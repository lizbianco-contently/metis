Mr. President, for more than a year now, Democrats in \nWashington have been focused--some would say fixated--on making \ndramatic changes to the American health care system as we know it.\n  It is an open debate as to whether spending so much time and energy \non this issue was in the best interest of the public at a time of \nrecord unemployment and a need to address jobs and the economy. But \nwhat is not open to debate is, the plan they came up with was \nfundamentally flawed--that it focused too much on expanding the size \nand cost of government and not enough on the core problem with our \nhealth care system, which is cost.\n  This is why Americans have been telling Democrats in Washington to \nscrap their plan and start over. This is why so many Americans are so \nfrustrated with government right now. The administration says we need \nto pass its health spending bill to show Americans government still \nworks. Americans are saying the opposite. They are saying the first \nthing Washington can do to show it is working is to listen to what the \npublic is saying, to scrap this bill and to start over.\n  Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in Congress are not interested. \nThey are still clinging to the same old bill and the same old process \nAmericans rejected last year. They are more determined than ever to jam \ntheir bill through Congress by any means necessary.\n  So over the next few weeks, we are going to see a replay of the same \nkind of arm-twisting and deal-making we saw in the runup to Christmas. \nI say we are going to see it, but in reality we will not see any of it. \nWe will have to read about it--the deals and the arm-\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\ntwisting--only after the final bill hits the floor because all the arm-\ntwisting and deal-making is going on behind closed doors, and it has \nalready started.\n  Somehow the administration seems to think all this arm-twisting and \ndeal-making will prove to the American people government works. I \nshould think Americans will draw the opposite conclusion. Americans do \nnot like the bill any more today than they did 3 months ago. They do \nnot like the frantic, backroom deal-making any more now than they did \nthen.\n  In the midst of all this, it is understandable that a lot of \nDemocrats are on the fence about whether to vote for this bill, about \nwhether to vote for this process as well. But the reasons they are \ngiving for being on the fence do not square with reality, and they are \nnot going to fly with the public.\n  Some say they like the current bill because they say it reduces \ncosts. It does not. The administration's own experts say the bill \nincreases health spending by $222 billion more than if we took no \naction at all. In other words, this bill would bend the cost curve up, \nnot down.\n  Others say they like the current bill because it reduces the deficit. \nBut even if you grant that highly speculative premise, the one bill the \nSenate will be voting on tomorrow would wipe away every dime of those \nprojected savings with one stroke of the President's pen. If you \nbelieve the health bill will save $100 billion, then you have to also \nacknowledge the bill the Senate will pass this week increases it by \n$100 billion.\n  So far from moving in a more fiscally responsible direction, the \nhealth spending bill the White House now wants Congress to pass before \nEaster would move us in a less fiscally responsible direction. This \nundercuts the entire point of reform.\n  The administration recognizes the weakness of its argument. That is \nwhy it is trying to create a sense of inevitability about this bill. \nOnce again, it is imposing an artificial deadline to put pressure on \nMembers. It is talking about how we are in the middle of the final \nchapter of this debate.\n  The administration wants Members to believe they are characters in a \nscreenplay and that the ending of the play is already written. This is \nan illusion. House Members are not buying these arguments anymore. In \nfact, many of them are already walking off the set. My guess is, a lot \nmore are about to.\n  They know we may be nearing the final act for this bill and the \nlegislative process but that it is just the beginning for those who \nsupport it. Americans do not want this bill. They are telling us to \nstart over. The only people who do not seem to be getting the message \nare Democratic leaders in Washington. But they can be sure of this--\nabsolutely sure of this: If they cut their deal, if they somehow \nconvince enough Members to come on board, then they will get the \nmessage. The public will let them know how they feel about this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the \nimportance of engineering education. As my colleagues know, this is an \nissue near and dear to my heart.\n  I believe we are at a crucial moment for STEM--for science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics--that often reminds me of \nsailing. Whether you have done much sailing or not, we all know that \nyou can construct the perfect sailboat, outfit it with the best sails, \nman it with the greatest crew, and if the wind is not blowing, you will \nnot move. The wind is blowing for STEM and I believe we must work \neffectively to capitalize on it now.\n  Today, America's engineers have a central role to play in developing \nthe innovative technologies that will help our economy recover and \npromote real job growth. In particular, as the global economy turns \nincreasingly competitive, many nations are investing heavily in \ntraining their future scientists and engineers.\n  We don't know where the next generation of innovation will come from. \nThat is the nature of innovation. But we want to do what we can to make \nsure it comes from the United States. This means we must have an \ninnovation policy, one that helps to generate greater interest in STEM \nand actually leads to the production of greater numbers of engineers.\n  A few weeks after I took office, I began meeting with groups of \nengineering deans and other leaders in the engineering community to \ndiscuss these issues. I have learned many important things from these \nconversations. For example, while all the surveys today say that young \npeople want to ``make a difference'' with their lives, they do not see \nengineering as the way to do that.\n  To someone of my generation, this is an astounding revelation. \nEngineers have always been the world's problem solvers. We need to make \nsure students are aware of that--so they will aspire to take on the \nchallenges we face today.\n  I also learned about a challenge occurring on many of our Nation's \ncollege campuses. In talking to engineering deans it is clear that the \npresent economic downturn has exacerbated a problem that has been with \nus for quite a while--that is the additional cost of educating an \nengineering student, which requires an investment in labs and other \ncostly facilities. Simply put, most universities make more money on \nliberal arts students than STEM students.\n  We must start educating college and university administrators about \nthe long-term benefits to the university and to the United States of \nspending the additional money required to graduate more engineering \nstudents.\n  Many administrators do get it. One is Pat Harker, president of the \nUniversity of Delaware and an engineering graduate from Penn. Working \nwith his engineering dean Mike Chajes they have increased last year's \nentering engineering class by 25 percent, but they do not have the lab \nspace to accommodate these students. They now have to hold lab classes \nfor engineering students on Saturday.\n  To figure out how to address these issues and grow the engineers and \nscientists we need, I again met with a small group of deans in the fall \nand worked with the American Society of Engineering Education to give \nthem a homework assignment.\n  Yes, I turned the tables on them. This time the professors had \nhomework. We sent out an informal survey to solicit ideas on how to \nincrease the number of graduates from our engineering schools. We \nreceived some very thoughtful feedback from nearly 25 deans across the \ncountry. These comments provide a very clear picture of what needs to \nbe done. Several common themes emerged from the surveys.\n  To begin, many of these deans said that we need a better way to \ncommunicate to parents, teachers, students, and school counselors about \nwhat it means to be an engineer. There was a great idea from Maryland \nabout creating a web site on the rock stars of engineering such as Bill \nGates, Steve Jobs, Alan Mullaly, and others.\n  They also agreed that green jobs are an excellent way to show young \npeople how engineers make a difference. I think this comment from New \nYork sums it up best: ``Service to the community and the belief in \ngreat causes\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\nresonates with the millennial generation. This makes green energy and \nclean tech the perfect vehicle to entice youth into considering careers \nin science and engineering.''\n  Overwhelmingly, they told me that students need better preparation in \nK-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. For \nthe past 5 years, the College of Engineering at Marquette University \nhas been engaged in a range of STEM activities to increase the number \nof K-12 students who are interested in studying engineering and \nprepared for college courses in the field.\n  Marquette hosts nearly 50 Discovery Learning Academies every year. At \nthese events, students spend several days engaging in hands-on learning \nactivities in robotics, water quality, biomedical engineering, energy, \nbridges, and more.\n  The university also supports Project Lead the Way courses that \nprovide an engaging, hands-on curriculum in STEM education. They \nsupport First Robotics teams that inspire young people to be science \nand technology leaders through team robotics competitions.\n  They created a scholarship fund to aid students in pursuing \nengineering who could not otherwise afford to attend school there. And \nto bring school administrators and teachers into the effort, Marquette \nholds a conference to motivate educators to begin STEM-related \nactivities in their schools.\n  Marquette's dean told us, ``We have been at this for five years now \nand over that time, our incoming freshman classes have increased by 46 \npercent.'' This is great news.\n  The surveys also told us that, even if our campuses had the physical \nspace to teach more engineering students, these deans would need \nadditional faculty members and research dollars. I have to tell my \ncolleagues, I am so encouraged by what they are doing in Utah.\n  In 2002, Utah's Governor challenged the higher education community \nthrough what they call the ``Engineering Initiative,'' to double--and \nthen triple--the number of engineers and computer scientists they \ngraduate. Each year since, the legislature has allocated funds to \nsupport engineering education. These funds have been matched first by \nthe university, then by corporate donations, and, finally, by the \nFederal Government.\n  Utah's Governor also prioritized building requests from the college \nof engineering, while the State legislature started the Utah Science, \nTechnology, and Research--or U-STAR--Initiative. U-STAR provides \nsalaries and startup packages to hire faculty who are doing research \nthat can find commercial applications.\n  Tenure-track faculty members grew by 46 percent since Utah's \nEngineering Initiative began. From 2002 to 2009, engineering research \nexpenditures went from $25 million to $56.9 million.\n  The number of engineering degrees granted by the University of Utah \nrose 76 percent in the past decade, and roughly 80 percent of these \nundergraduates accept engineering jobs right there in Utah.\n  What is more, the College of Engineering spun off 35 companies in the \npast 3 years. For the past 2 years, the University of Utah as a whole \nranked second only to MIT in the number of startups. These results are \njust remarkable.\n  I truly am impressed with the work some of our Nation's engineering \ncolleges are doing and I am inspired by their ideas. On our end, I \nthink there are 4 things the Federal Government can do to bolster these \nefforts:\n  First, we can help inspire more young people to pursue engineering in \nthe growing green economy. That is why I am so pleased that President \nObama launched the ``Educate to Innovate'' campaign. This campaign is a \nnationwide effort of private companies, universities, foundations, \nnonprofits, and science and engineering societies working with the \nFederal Government to improve student performance and engagement in \nSTEM subjects.\n  As part of the ``Educate to Innovate'' effort, President Obama \nannounced an annual science fair at the White House, so that \n``scientists and engineers stand side by side with athletes and \nentertainers as role models.'' I think that is a very powerful message \nto America's youth.\n  Second, we can build a new generation of engineers through policies \nthat promote STEM education. The fiscal year 2011 Department of \nEducation budget submitted by the administration includes $833 million \nfor STEM education. This includes funding to improve teaching and \nlearning of STEM subjects, to support STEM projects in the ``Investing \nin Innovation'' education program, to create a new STEM initiative to \nattract undergraduates to STEM fields, and to close the gender gaps in \nSTEM disciplines.\n  In addition, I was pleased to join Senator Gillibrand and a number of \nmy other colleagues in introducing legislation last week that will \nfurther these initiatives.\n  This bill is the Engineering Education for Innovation Act, or the E-\nsquared for Innovation Act. This legislation authorizes the Secretary \nof Education to award competitive planning and implementation grants to \nStates to integrate engineering education into K-12 instruction and \ncurriculum. It also funds the research and evaluation of these efforts.\n  Based largely on recommendations from the National Academy of \nEngineering and the National Research Council's ``Engineering in K-12 \nEducation'' report, 77 organizations have voiced their support for the \nE-squared Innovation Act.\n  The third important step the Federal Government can take is to \npromote policies that encourage women and underrepresented minorities \nto enter engineering. While women earn 58 percent of all bachelor's \ndegrees, they constitute only 18.5 percent of bachelor's degrees \nawarded in engineering. We cannot let that go on. That is ridiculous. \nAfrican Americans hold only 4.6 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded \nin engineering, and Hispanics hold only 7.2 percent. How can we move \ninto the 21st century? How can we be the great country we are going to \nbe if we are so underrepresented by women and minorities? We can and \nmust do better.\n  Last year, a bipartisan group of 13 Senators joined me in writing the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture to urge greater funding to \nincrease participation of women and underrepresented minorities in \nrural areas in STEM fields. That is the second thing I talked about for \nSTEM education where there is clear bipartisan support. STEM education \nis not a partisan issue; it gets bipartisan support. It is important \nfor all of us, and we all agree.\n  I am grateful that in response, the Agriculture appropriations bill \nwe enacted last October included $400,000 to fund research and \nextension grants at land grant universities for women and minorities in \nSTEM fields. This was a small but important step that we can continue \nto build on from year to year.\n  Last, we must continue to support research and development, a \nchallenge that requires significant Federal as well as private \ninvestment. In our current economy, it is often hard, especially in \nthis body, to imagine investing more in anything. But as Congress has \nrecognized over the years and what was reinforced in the survey \nresponses I received is funding is the lifeblood of research \ninstitutions. To yield more innovation, we need more R funding so \nuniversities can hire more graduate assistants and faculty, accept more \nengineering students, and ultimately create more jobs.\n  Utah is a great example of the importance of investing in research \nand development. The Bureau of Economic and Business Research estimates \nthat for every $1 million of research generated by Utah's research \nuniversities, $1.5 million is created in increased business activity.\n  Listen to that. We are all talking about how to generate business \nactivity. For every $1 million of research generated by Utah's research \nuniversities, we get back $1.5 million in increased business activity.\n  Moreover, a forthcoming report from the Science Coalition features \n100 companies that can be directly traced to influential research \nconducted at a university and sponsored by a Federal agency. Examples \ninclude Google, Cisco Systems, SAS.\n  I become more encouraged every day that we have growing support for \nengineering. Engineers and scientists will foster the research and \ninnovation that continues to lead America on a path to economic \nrecovery and prosperity. Likewise, these discoveries and innovations \nwill create millions of new jobs,\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\nand they will help us to invest in our future security and prosperity. \nThis is the target. This is the way to get to long-term economic \nhealth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak for about 10 \nminutes about the health care debate that continues to be in front of \nus. For much of our country, the health care debate has been a long and \nconfusing trail. As details have emerged over the last weeks and \nmonths, constituents ask me: What is going to happen to my health care? \nWill I be able to continue to see the doctor I have always seen? They \nheard both sides argue the merits and the detriments of various pieces \nof legislation. Citizens are understandably skeptical and perplexed by \nthe debate that has transpired.\n  One of the things I suggest that is very clear, one situation that is \nclear as a matter of policy and conscience is that Americans are \nagainst the Federal funding of abortion, whether they support or oppose \nthe bill. Unfortunately, the Senate-passed health care bill allows \ntaxpayer funds to fund abortion.\n  The current Senate language says people who receive a new government \nsubsidy could enroll in an insurance plan that covers abortion. Nothing \nwould stop them from doing that.\n  Some say: Yes, but States could opt out. What I point out is that in \nthose States that opt out, the taxpayers would still see their tax \ndollars funding elective abortions in other States.\n  Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management can provide access \nto two multistate plans in each State, and only one of them would \nexclude abortions. OPM's current health care program, the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, now prohibits any plans--any plans--\nthat cover elective abortion. For the first time, a federally funded \nand managed health care plan will cover elective abortions.\n  Those who have looked at this language have said very clearly that it \nis woefully inadequate. I say that. It does not apply a decades-old \npolicy--an agreement really--that was reached many years ago that was \nembodied in the Hyde amendment. The Hyde language bars Federal funding \nfor abortion except in the cases of rape and incest or where the life \nof the mother is at stake. The public has clearly rejected advancing \nthe abortion agenda under the guise of health care reform.\n  Yet as we have seen the language of the Senate bill proceed, it seems \nvery clear my colleagues are refusing to listen. They seem bent on \nforcing this very unpopular bill upon us via a rather arcane process \ncalled reconciliation.\n  The important point to be made today is this: Reconciliation will not \nallow us to fix the egregious abortion language.\n  This is not the first time I have come to the floor to speak about \nthis issue. Last November, I came here to urge pro-life Senators to \nvote no on cloture if they wanted any chance to address the Federal \nfunding of abortion in the Senate bill. I said then that if the \nlanguage was not fixed before the debate began, there would be no way \nto fix it. We would not have any leverage to fix it.\n  I wish I were here on the floor today to say that I was wrong about \nthat. Unfortunately, though, I was not wrong. Unfortunately, when an \namendment was offered to match the Stupak language in the House bill \nwith the Senate bill, only 45 Senators supported it.\n  The sad reality is that this Senate, as a matter of the majority, is \nnot a pro-life body. There are not 60 Senators who are willing to vote \nfor that.\n  Back in November, some of my colleagues disagreed with my assessment. \nThere was a big debate. They said: Whoa, wait a second. We can fix this \nprovision via an amendment, they said. But they were wrong. When the \ndust settled, we were left with a Senate bill that allows Federal \nfunding of abortion.\n  The House is now being asked to vote on the Senate bill. You see, \nthat is going to be the pathway: vote on the Senate bill so any fix on \nother provisions can come through a reconciliation sidecar.\n  According to the National Right to Life committee, the Senate bill \nis--and I am quoting their language--``the most pro-abortion single \npiece of legislation that has ever come to the House floor for a vote \nsince Roe v. Wade.''\n  They go on to warn:\n\n       Any House Member who votes for the Senate health bill is \n     casting a career-defining pro-abortion vote.\n\n  There is talk that Democratic leaders might try to appease pro-life \nHouse Members by promising to change the Senate bill through a separate \nbill or the reconciliation sidecar I mentioned.\n\n  I urge pro-life supporters and pro-life House Members to think \nthrough this very carefully. Don't be fooled. Don't be lulled into \nthinking there are 60 votes in the Senate that will somehow rescue this \nsituation. There are not. You do not have to take my word for it. It is \nin black and white in the Congressional Record. It is the same \nsituation we faced in November.\n  The Senate specifically rejected the amendment that would have \nblocked Federal funding for abortion. Nothing--nothing--has changed to \nsuggest the Senate would have anywhere near 60 votes to support it now.\n  It was recently reported that some in the pro-life community support \nadding pro-life language in the reconciliation sidecar or maybe in a \nseparate bill with the hope and the promise that somehow the Senate \nwill swoop in and waive the rules and keep that language there. Let me \nbe abundantly clear. As much as I might want that to happen, it will \nnot happen here, as demonstrated by November's vote.\n  If the Senate rejects it again, the language in the Senate bill would \nbecome law. Current law would be reversed, and taxpayer dollars would, \nin fact, fund abortions.\n  There was recently a column in the Washington Post. It issued a \nwarning to pro-life Democrats to be wary of this strategy. I am quoting \nagain:\n\n       The only way they can ensure that the abortion language and \n     other provisions they oppose are eliminated is to reject \n     reconciliation entirely--and demand that the House and Senate \n     start over with clean legislation.\n\n  I come to the Senate floor again to encourage my pro-life colleagues \nin the House to recognize the reality in the Senate. I tell them what \nthey know already, and that is that many innocent lives are depending \non their courage.\n  This issue should not be an issue of political gamesmanship, \nespecially when the game is so rigged against pro-lifers. This is an \nissue of conscience. On this one, you are pro-life or you are not.\n  Agreeing to a strategy that is guaranteed to fail, one that has \nfailed already in this health care debate in November, in my judgment, \nis not leadership at all. It is surrendering your values.\n  I leave the floor today, and I pray that my House colleagues will \nhave the wisdom to understand this in their decisionmaking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1246-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1246-S1247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STEEL INDUSTRY FUEL TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about \ntwo subjects--first, an amendment filed by Senator Rockefeller, \namendment No. 3371 to amendment No. 3336, cosponsored by Senator Hatch, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Casey, Senator Bayh, and myself.\n  This amendment would extend the steel industry fuel tax credit and \nmake minor technical corrections to ensure that the steel industry will \ncontinue to recycle the hazardous waste called coal waste sludge. The \nrecycling process which converts coal waste sludge into steel industry \nfuel eliminates a hazardous waste, ends the need to landfill or \nincinerate the waste, displaces fuel from the coking process, and \nincreases the efficiency of coke-making. This recycling process makes \nthe production\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nof coke more efficient and cost-effective. Additionally, this provision \nwill create jobs across the country and preserve thousands of fuel-\nmaking jobs in economically hard hit States.\n  The technical corrections made by this amendment cover minor issues \nsuch as who has title to the coal in the few minutes before it enters \nthe coke ovens and whether a minuscule percentage of the feedstock is \npure coal or a material called pet coke.\n  The extension of the tax credit and these minor technical corrections \nwill ensure this credit can actually be used by processors and the \nsteel industry. I am advised that all of the integrated steel companies \nand the representatives of their workers support this provision, which \nis a rarity in any industry.\n  We have been working for nearly a decade to ensure the widespread use \nof this technology in coke ovens across the country. Across \nPennsylvania, coke ovens continue to be used as the engine that drives \nthe American industrial machine. I have long been committed to ensuring \nwe use the cleanest and most efficient method for making steel and in \nthis case, the coke that is an ingredient in the steel-making process.\n  This is an extender right in line with the thrust of the legislation, \nan extender which would save many jobs and add many more jobs. So it is \nright in line with what we are seeking to accomplish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1247-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1247-S1252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GRIDLOCK AND RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now going to speak about the subject \nof gridlock which confronts this body and the use of the reconciliation \nprocess to enact comprehensive health care reform.\n  We have seen an extraordinary display of gridlock, evidenced at the \npresent time. We have some 30 judicial nominees which are pending, and \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \nnominees following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have some 64 executive branch nominees who are now \npending, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlist of these nominees following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have some 13 ambassadorial positions pending, only 1 \nof which I am advised is controversial, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a list of these 13 positions following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. On many occasions, the majority leader has been \ncompelled to file a cloture petition, which is well known on this \nSenate floor. I don't believe it even has to be explained to C-SPAN \nviewers, even though it is technical and arcane, because it has been \nused so often. But in case anyone new is watching C-SPAN2--or perhaps I \nshould say in case anybody is watching C-SPAN2--just a word of \nexplanation. If a Senator places a hold on a nomination, that is a \nsignal for a filibuster.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have filibusters. I have been in the Senate \nnow since being elected in 1980 and I have been part of only one real \nfilibuster. Had we utilized that procedure, perhaps there would be \nfewer holds and fewer moves toward filibuster. People really had to \nstand up here and argue, as Senator Thurman did historically once, for \nsome 26 hours. But when the majority leader is compelled to file a \ncloture petition, cloture is invoked, and then some 30 hours must be \nconsumed where the Senate can take care of no additional business, the \ntwo lights are on, there is a quorum call, and it is a colossal waste \nof time.\n  I am going to recite the facts in five of these cloture petitions to \ndemonstrate that there was never really a controversy. Christopher \nHill, Ambassador to the Republic of Iraq, had a cloture vote. Yet his \nvote in favor was 73 to 17--hardly controversial. Robert M. Groves, of \nMichigan, to be the Director of the Census, the cloture vote was 76 to \n15--not really a contest there at all. Nobody seriously contested his \nconfirmation. David Hamilton to be a judge of the Seventh Circuit, 70 \nyeas, 29 nays. A cloture petition was filed on Martha N. Johnson to be \nAdministrator of General Services. The vote was 82 to 16. The \nnomination of Barbara Keenan to be a circuit judge in the Fourth \nCircuit, 99 to 0.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe details of these cloture motions and confirmations following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. So the stage is now set where we have gridlock on the \nissue of comprehensive health care reform. In this situation, we have \nhad the bills passed by both the House and the Senate, and we are now \nlooking to use reconciliation, a procedure which has been employed some \n22 times in analogous circumstances. Illustrative of the analogous \ncircumstances are the use of cloture to pass Medicare Advantage and the \npassage of COBRA, the passage of SCHIP--health care for children--and \nthe passage of the welfare reform bill in 1996.\n  In a learned article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. \nHenry J. Aaron, an expert on budgetary matters, had this to say:\n\n     [reconciliation] can be used only to implement instructions \n     contained in the budget resolution relating to taxes or \n     expenditures. Congress created reconciliation procedures to \n     deal with precisely this sort of situation. . . .\n\n  And he is referring here to what we have with the Senate-passed bill \nand the House-passed bill.\n  Quoting him further:\n\n       The 2009 budget resolution instructed both Houses of \n     Congress to enact health care reform. The House and the \n     Senate have passed similar but not identical bills. Since \n     both Houses have acted but some work remains to be done to \n     align the two bills, using reconciliation to implement the \n     instructions in the budget resolution follows established \n     congressional procedure.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof this article following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. So what we have here, essentially, is gridlock created \nby the composition of the two Houses of Congress. We have a situation \nwhere not one Member on the other side of the aisle voted in favor of \nthe health care bill. In the House of Representatives, the vote was 176 \nto 1; that is, among the 177 Republicans voting, only 1 out of 177 in \nthe House voted in favor. It is hard to see a more precise definition \nof ``gridlock'' than what appears here.\n  It would be my hope that we would be able to resolve the issue \nwithout resorting to reconciliation. If there is any doubt about the \nprocedure, our institutional integrity would be enhanced without going \nin that direction. But if you have to fight fire with fire and since it \nis a legitimate means, then we can use it.\n  Five years ago, in 2005, the Senate faced a somewhat similar \nsituation when the roles were reversed, when it was the Democrats \nfilibustering judicial nominees of President Bush. And we find that so \noften it depends on whose ox is being gored as to who takes the \nposition. Some of the most vociferous objectors to the use of \nreconciliation on comprehensive health care reform have filled the \nCongressional Record with statements in favor of using reconciliation \nin analogous circumstances when it helped their cause. But in the year \n2000, it was the Democrats stymying Republican judicial nominees. \nDuring the Clinton administration, it was exactly reversed--it was \nRepublicans stymying Clinton's judicial nominees. Fortunately, in 2005 \nwe were able to work out the controversy. We were able to confirm some \nof the judges, some of the judges were withdrawn, and we did not move \nfor what was called the nuclear option, which would have confirmed \njudges by 51 votes.\n\n  The procedural integrity of the Senate is very important. Without \ngoing into great detail, it was the Senate that saved the independence \nof the Federal judiciary when the Senate acquitted Supreme Court \nJustice Chase\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nin 1805, and it was the Senate that preserved the power of the \nPresidency on the impeachment proceeding of Andrew Johnson in 1868. \nCongress sought to have limited the President's power to discharge a \nCabinet officer in the absence of approval by the Senate. Well, the \nSenate has to confirm, but the Senate doesn't have standing to stop the \nPresident from terminating the services of a Cabinet officer. And \nthere, the Senate saved it through the courageous vote of a single \nSenator--a Kansan, I like to mention, being one originally myself.\n  So it would be fine if we could find some way to solve the problem, \nbut absent that, this Senate reconciliation procedure is entirely \nappropriate. We have gotten much more deeply involved in the research \nand analysis as this issue has come to the floor on comprehensive \nhealth coverage.\n  The gridlock that faces the Senate and the country today has profound \nimplications beyond the legislation itself. It is hard to find \nsomething more important than insuring the millions of Americans now \nnot covered or to find something more important than stopping the \nescalating cost of health insurance, driving many people to be \nuninsured and raising the prices for small businesses where it cannot \nbe afforded. But the fact is, this gridlock is threatening the capacity \nin this country to govern--really threatening the capacity to govern.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was before the Subcommittee on \nForeign Operations of the Committee on Appropriations, and I asked her \nabout this issue. I asked her about the President not being able to:\n\n       . . . project the kind of stature and power that he did a \n     year ago because he is being hamstrung by Congress. And it \n     has an impact on foreign policy which we really ought to do \n     everything we can not to have partisanship influence.\n\n  Secretary of State Clinton replied as follows:\n\n       Senator, I think there is certainly a perception that I \n     encounter in representing our country around the world that \n     supports your characterization. People don't understand the \n     way our system operates, they just don't get it. Their view \n     does color whether the United States is in a position--not \n     just this President but our country--is in a position going \n     forward to demonstrate the kind of unity and strength and \n     effectiveness that I think we have to in this very complex \n     and dangerous world.\n  She continued a little later:\n\n       We have to be attuned to how the rest of the world sees the \n     functioning of our Government. Because it's an asset. It may \n     be an intangible asset, but it's an asset of great importance \n     and as we sell democracy, and we're the lead democracy in the \n     world, I want people to know that we have checks and \n     balances, but we also have the capacity to move too.\n\n  So what we find is a diminution of the authority and stature of the \nPresident, a diminution of the authority and stature of the Presidency, \nand ultimately a diminution and reduction in the stature of our country \nunable to deal with these problems. So it would be my hope we could yet \nresolve this issue with a little bipartisanship. It would not take a \nwhole lot, but at the moment there is none, with 40 Senators voting no, \nall those on the other side of the aisle, and 176 out of 177 \nRepublicans in the House voting no. That simply is no way to govern.\n\n                                          EXHIBIT 1--JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                      Days since\n                   Name                               Court                   Nomination date            nom\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlack, Timothy S.........................

AS: Y.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n               [From the New England Journal of Medicine]\n\n   Forging Ahead--Embracing the ``Reconciliation'' Option for Reform\n\n       The course of health care reform in 2009 resembled the \n     silent movie series ``The Perils of Pauline,'' in which each \n     episode began with a threat to the heroine's life but ended \n     with her salvation.\n       Despite repeated near-death experiences, reform legislation \n     passed both houses of Congress. After so many obstacles had \n     been surmounted, the remaining task of reconciling the House \n     and Senate bills seemed doable.\n       Then, a political earthquake hit. Republican Scott Brown \n     won the Massachusetts senatorial seat that had been held for \n     47 years by the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, thwarting the \n     capacity of the remaining 57 Democrats and two independents \n     to bring anything to a vote in the Senate over the united \n     opposition of the 41 Republicans. The election also caused \n     something approaching a panic attack among White House and \n     congressional Democrats, who called variously for dropping \n     health care reform, trying to pass one scaled-back bill or \n     several smaller bills, moving slowly on doing anything, \n     seeking compromise with Republicans on some (unspecified) new \n     approach, or having the House pass the Senate bill subject to \n     modifications, which both houses would pass separately, to \n     make the Senate bill acceptable to the House. Passing the \n     fixes in the last of these options hinged on using \n     ``reconciliation,'' a procedure that requires only a majority \n     vote but that can be used only to implement instructions \n     contained in the budget resolution relating to taxes or \n     expenditures. Passage of the modifications would follow House \n     approval of the Senate-passed bill.\n       The idea of using reconciliation has raised concern among \n     some supporters of health care reform. They fear that reform \n     opponents would consider the use of reconciliation high-\n     handed. But in fact Congress created reconciliation \n     procedures to deal with precisely this sort of situation--its \n     failure to implement provisions of the previous budget \n     resolution. The 2009 budget resolution instructed both houses \n     of Congress to enact healt care reform. The House and the \n     Senate have passed similar but not identical bills. (Since \n     both houses have acted but some work remains to be done to \n     align the two bills, using reconciliation to implement the \n     instructions in the budget resolution follows established \n     congressional procedure.)\n       Furthermore, coming from Republicans, objections to the use \n     of reconciliation on procedural grounds seem more than a \n     little insincere. A Republican president and a Republican \n     Congress used reconciliation procedures in 2001 to enact tax \n     cuts that were supported by fewer than 60 senators. The then-\n     majority Republicans could use reconciliation only because \n     they misrepresented the tax cuts as temporary although \n     everyone understood they were intended to be permanent--but \n     permanent cuts would have required the support of 60 \n     senators, which they did not have.\n       The more substantive objection to the use of reconciliation \n     for passing health care reform derives from the fact that, \n     according to polls, more Americans oppose than support what \n     they think is in the reform bills. It is hardly surprising \n     that people are nervous about health care reform. Most \n     Americans are insured and are reasonably satisfied with their \n     coverage. In principle, large-scale reform could upset \n     current arrangements.\n       If public perceptions of the intended and expected effects \n     of the current bills were accurate, democratically elected \n     representatives might be bound to heed the concerns. Because \n     the perceptions are inaccurate, reform supporters have a duty \n     to do a better job of explaining what health care reform will \n     do. When participants in focus groups are informed about the \n     bills' actual provisions, their views become much more \n     positive. The prevailing views have clearly been shaped by \n     opponents' misrepresentations of the reform plans, which \n     supporters have done little to rebut. Opponents have \n     described as a ``government takeover'' plans that would cause \n     tens of millions of people to buy insurance from private \n     companies. They have told people that a plan deemed by the \n     Congressional Budget Office to be a deficit reducer is \n     actually a budget buster. They have fostered the canard that \n     end-of-life counseling would mean the creation of ``death \n     panels'' (a claim that PolitiFact.com labeled ``the lie of \n     the year''). They have persuaded Americans that their \n     insurance arrangements would be jeopardized by plans that \n     would in fact leave most coverage untouched, add coverage for \n     millions of Americans, and protect millions of others from \n     cancellation of their coverage and from unaffordable rate \n     increases in the event of serious illness.\n       Meanwhile, supporters have spent most of their time on \n     seemingly endless debates with one another about specific \n     legislative provisions--whether to include a public option in \n     the reform legislation, whether to have a single national \n     insurance exchange or separate state exchanges, how to \n     enforce a mandate that everyone carry insurance and how much \n     to spend on subsidies to make that mandate acceptable, how to \n     enforce a mandate on all but small employers to sponsor and \n     pay for basic coverage for their workers, and scores of other \n     complex and bewildering technical provisions.\n       Health care reformers in the administration and Congress \n     have a powerful case to make and, on an issue of such \n     enormous importance, a duty to make it. In addition to \n     reminding Americans that reform will protect, not jeopardize, \n     coverage by preventing insurance companies from canceling \n     coverage or jacking up premiums for the sick, reform \n     advocates should remind them that the proposed legislation \n     will bring coverage to tens of millions of currently \n     uninsured Americans and protect it for scores of millions of \n     others. Reform advocates should explain the legislation's \n     legitimate promise of cost control and quality improvement.\n       President Barack Obama has announced a bipartisan meeting \n     on moving the reform process forward. It is an opportunity \n     for all sides to present ideas for improving the bills that \n     already have been passed by both houses of Congress. If \n     modifications are identified that will command the support of \n     simple majorities in both houses, they should be adopted \n     through reconciliation. Then the House should pass the Senate \n     bill.\n       Other strategies, in my view, have no prospect of success. \n     Abandoning the reform effort is the worst strategy of all--\n     not only for reform advocates, but for the nation. Reform \n     advocates are already on record as supporting reform. Voters \n     who oppose reform will not forget that fact come November, \n     and those who support it will find little reason to make \n     campaign contributions to or turn out to vote for lawmakers \n     who were afraid to use large congressional majorities to \n     implement legislation that would begin long-overdue efforts \n     to extend coverage, slow the growth of spending, and improve \n     the quality of care.\n       The start-from-scratch and piecemeal-legislation strategies \n     are invitations to time-consuming failure. The Senate would \n     need 60-vote majorities for every component of such reforms. \n     To be sure, lawmakers could craft a different bill that would \n     extend coverage to fewer people than the current bills do. \n     But they could not institute serious insurance market \n     reforms without assuring a balanced enrollee pool--or \n     assure such a pool without mandating coverage. Nor is it \n     politically possible or ethically fair to mandate coverage \n     without offering subsidies for low- and moderate-income \n     people. And it is not possible to prevent those subsidies \n     from increasing deficits without tax increases or spending \n     cuts, which reform opponents won't support and which would \n     require 60 Senate votes. The call to start anew is naive \n     at best. At worst, it is a disingenuous siren song, luring \n     health care reformers into a political swamp.\n       Reformers' best choice is to embrace the democratic process \n     and attempt to persuade voters that the current legislation \n     is in the national interest. They have 10 months to succeed \n     before the midterm elections.\n       If would-be reformers retreat in the face of current public \n     opinion polls, they will be sent packing in November. \n     Arguably, they will deserve to lose. If they stand up for \n     their genuinely constructive legislation, they can prevail--\n     and will deserve to win.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I opened the newspaper, the New York Times, \non\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nSunday morning and was surprised--shocked--at a full-page advertisement \nI saw. It had a big headline that said: ``What will it be, Mr. \nPresident? Change or more of the same?'' Then it had four photographs \nor artist's renderings. The first one was of President Barack Obama. It \ngradually morphed from Barack Obama into George W. Bush, so the last in \nthe frame of four was clearly a likeness of President George W. Bush.\n  This was an advertisement paid for by the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, the ACLU. I do not know what surprised me more, whether it was \nthe audacity and the blatant partisanship of the ad or its ignorance \nand misrepresentation of the law. Either way, it deserves some comment \ntoday.\n  The essence of the ad was to obviously try to put some pressure on \nPresident Obama not to change his initial decision to transfer the \ntrial of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to the Manhattan Federal district \ncourt, the so-called article III court, back to a military commission \nwhere it had originally been. The ad makes the point that ``Barack \nObama vowed to change Bush-Cheney policies''--I am quoting now--``and \nrestore America's values of justice and due process.''\n  Of course, those values didn't exist under the Bush administration, \naccording to the ACLU. They then say they are ``shocked and concerned'' \nthe President is considering changing the 9/11 defendants' trials from \ncriminal court back to military commissions. They say that: ``Our \ncriminal justice system will resolve the cases more quickly and more \ncredibly than the military commissions.'' That is a matter of dispute, \nwhich I will get back to in a moment, but then there is this sentence: \n``Obama can vigorously prosecute terrorists and keep us safe without \nviolating our Constitution.'' The implication, of course, being if you \ngo to a military commission, you are violating the Constitution.\n  If that is what they mean to convey, and it is clear they do, the \nwriters of this ad are obviously intentionally misrepresenting the law. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has upheld military commissions. You can go back \nto the 1950s case of Johnson v. Eisentrager, involving German war \nprisoners.\n  The current U.S. Supreme Court in the Hamdan decision made it clear \nthe President, with authority from Congress, could establish military \ncommissions to try the very people we are talking about, these Islamic \nterrorists. Indeed, the President came to Congress and, with changes \nfrom the administration recommended by the Justice Department, Congress \npassed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. That act is available to \ntry many of these same terrorists. Indeed, the Attorney General has \nmade it clear there are four categories of these terrorists held at \nGitmo. They want to try to release some of them back to their country \nof origin; they believe some of them should be tried in article III \ncourts--that is like the Federal district court in Manhattan; others of \nthem should be tried before the military commissions that the ACLU \nseems to think would violate due process; and, finally, that they \nintend to hold some of them for the duration of the conflict, which is \nalso authorized.\n  Here you have one of the, at least I thought, preeminent legal \nauthorities in the country--granted they always seem to take the side \nof the little guy without representation or the person who is not \nlooked upon with great favor who needs legal representation, frequently \nto represent cases that represent different points of view--certainly, \nperforming a service to our legal community over the years, most people \nI think would acknowledge. But now they have turned into a blatant \npartisan political entity that I think can have no more credibility in \ncourt for both reasons: First, because of the nature of this, morphing \nPresident Obama's face into President George W. Bush's face and talking \nabout changing the Bush-Cheney policies, which obviously they believe \ndo not represent America's values of justice and due process, \ncontending that you have to go to article III courts to try these \npeople or else you are violating our Constitution.\n  The final conclusion: ``The President must decide whether he will \nkeep his solemn promise to restore our Constitution and due process or \nignore his vow and continue the Bush-Cheney policies,'' which in their \nview, I gather, means not having constitutional rights and due process.\n  Again, this administration helped the Congress write the military \ncommissions law. That law is in effect today. The administration \nintends to try many of these same terrorists before those military \ncommissions. The constitutionality of military commissions has been \nupheld in the past. The constitutionality of the President and the \nCongress doing so in the future was acknowledged by the Supreme Court \nin the Hamdan case. No court has ruled that the military commissions \nthat were thus created in the 2006 act would, as the ACLU suggests, \nviolate our Constitution or due process. So what exactly is the ACLU \ntalking about?\n  Moreover, I said I would get back to it, the ad suggests that the \n``criminal justice system,'' meaning the article III courts, ``will \nresolve these cases more quickly and more credibly than the military \ncommissions.''\n  Absolutely false, demonstrably false. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the \nkind of poster child here, the mastermind of 9/11, was before the \nmilitary commission at Guantanamo, and he said he wanted to plead \nguilty in the military commission. That case could have been over with \nhad his guilty plea been accepted.\n  I cannot think of a quicker and more successful outcome than \naccepting the guilty plea of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  When the Attorney General came before the Judiciary Committee and \nhemmed and hawed about what his reason was for moving this trial to the \nManhattan Federal district court, he basically settled on the \nproposition that it would represent a more sure way to gain a \nconviction. I asked him: ``Mr. Attorney General, this defendant has \nagreed to plead guilty before the military commission. How much surer \nof a conviction do you get than that?''\n  Well, the Attorney General said he wasn't sure he still wanted to \nplead. But he also assured us, pursuant to a question one of my \ncolleagues asked--what would happen if, for some reason, the court \ndecided to let him go--the Attorney General said: ``Failure of \nconviction is not an option.''\n  In other words, he will be convicted, and both he and the President \nhave talked about execution. If the ACLU and the administration are so \nintent on showing off the great American judicial system which presumes \ninnocence over guilt--and it is literally unethical for prosecutors to \ngo out before the public and guarantee the conviction and execution of \na defendant--then it seems to me to be rather odd that this Attorney \nGeneral would say: Oh, failure is not an option. He will be convicted \nand, by inference, he will be executed by our wonderful article III \ncourts which, of course, presume innocence.\n  How the ACLU can say he would be more quickly and more credibly \ntreated than through military commissions is beyond me, after these \nparticular statements.\n  I go back to my original perplexity: As I say, I don't know whether \nto be more surprised by the audacity of this organization with a \nblatantly partisan political ad, obviously highly critical of the Bush-\nCheney administration, implying it did not believe in America's values \nof justice and due process or by the ignorance and misrepresentation of \nthe law by the ACLU. They have smart lawyers, so I assume it is not \nignorance, but they are clearly misleading anyone who reads this ad in \nsuggesting both that military commissions would not be pursuant to the \nConstitution or due process but would rather be a continuation of Bush-\nCheney policies. Bear in mind, the new Military Commissions Act of 2006 \nis not a Bush-Cheney military commission, this is a current U.S. \nCongress Obama administration military commission law, signed into law \nby President Bush.\n  When the ACLU says prosecuting them in the article III courts would \nkeep us safe without violating our Constitution, one has to assume they \nbelieve the Military Commissions Act would be violative of the U.S. \nConstitution, and that is incorrect.\n  It is unclear to me what is gained by politicizing this issue. My \ncolleague, Lindsey Graham, has talked about the idea of some kind of \nbipartisan arrangement, whereby the President will acknowledge the will \nof the American\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\npeople, which is very strongly against trying these terrorists in the \narticle III courts and in favor of trying them in military commissions. \nIt seems to me there is sufficient understanding. The administration \ncertainly agrees with the Military Commissions Act. It has said it \nwould use that act to try some of these terrorists. It doesn't believe \nthat act represents an unconstitutional approach to deal with these \npeople. According to public opinion surveys, the American public \nopinion is very strongly of the view that these cases should be tried \nbefore military commissions.\n  That being the case, it seems to me there is an opportunity for us \nnot to try to make this a partisan issue but to try to follow what the \nAmerican people believe should be the case; that these cases can and \nshould be tried before military commissions when appropriate; that \nthere is also a place for them to be tried before article III courts; \nthat some of them potentially can be returned to their country of \norigin, although that represents a significant danger, considering the \nfact that about 20 percent of them return to the battlefield to fight \nour forces or that there is a category that cannot be tried in either \narticle III courts or before military commissions.\n  It seems to me we can have a legitimate discussion of this; that the \nlaw that the previous President signed into law that represents the \npoint of view of both Democrats and Republicans, that allows for \nmilitary commissions, can be used; that the President would be well \nwithin his rights to use military commissions; that it would comport \nwith the law as acknowledged by the U.S. Attorney General and would \nreflect the views of the American people that it is important these \nterrorists be treated, first and foremost, as enemies of the United \nStates and only if appropriate in article III courts as common \ncriminals.\n  Finally, the last point I would make is, to some extent, the location \nof the trial is a lot less important than the primary objective when an \nenemy terrorist is captured; that is, to get intelligence.\n  I think this is what upset the American people: when, the first thing \nthat happened, after 50 minutes of questioning of the so-called \nChristmas Day bomber, that he was read his Miranda rights and he \nstopped providing intelligence to those who were interrogating him.\n  Subsequently, that intelligence interrogation has resumed. But we \nwill never know what kind of real-time intelligence was lost as a \nresult of the reading of Miranda rights. When we try people in article \nIII courts, we are going to have to quickly provide these Miranda \nrights. That ordinarily will mean we give up important--potentially \ngive up important intelligence that we could gain by interrogating the \nindividual.\n  Now, it is not the case that necessarily we would be foreclosed from \ntrying the individual in an article III court because we can rely on \nsomething other than the confession of the individual to gain his \nconviction. In the case of the would-be bomber on Christmas Day, there \nwas plenty of physical evidence: he was burned badly, there were \neyewitnesses, and we did not need a confession of the individual.\n  So the Mirandizing in that case was largely irrelevant; the point \nbeing that what we ought to be doing is getting the intelligence first \nand then deciding which is the appropriate court in which to try the \nindividual. In many cases, that will be military commissions. An \norganization which has studied the history of the ACLU should \nappreciate the fact that military commissions are constitutional. They \ndo not violate due process rights. A defendant such as Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed could be tried before a military commission in a perfectly \nappropriate and constitutional way, and it takes nothing away from our \narticle III court system or from President Obama's leadership as \nPresident of the United States to hold those trials of this kind of \nindividual in the military commissions.\n  To describe this advertisement, I ask unanimous consent that a Fox \nNews article dated March 7 be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nACLU Likens Obama to Bush in Ad Slamming Possible Reversal on KSM Trial\n\n       The possibility that President Obama could send the self-\n     professed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks to a military \n     tribunal has earned him the highest insult from the left--\n     that he's another George W. Bush.\n       A full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times left no doubt as \n     to how the American Civil Liberties Union feels about the \n     possibility of the president reversing the decision to send \n     Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators to \n     civilian court.\n       ``What will it be Mr. President?'' the ad asks in boldfaced \n     type. ``Change or more of the Same?''\n       In the middle of those words are four photos that show \n     Obama's face morphing into Bush's.\n       ``Many of us are shocked and concerned that right now, \n     President Obama is considering reversing his attorney \n     general's decision to try the 9/11 defendants in criminal \n     court,'' the advertisement continues. ``Our criminal justice \n     system has successfully handled over 300 terrorism cases \n     compared to only 3 in the military commissions.''\n       The ad follows a series of reports that reflect a softening \n     of the administration's position that the accused Sept. 11 \n     architects must be tried in federal court instead of military \n     tribunals.\n       The public softening is part of a test, a source told Fox \n     News, to gauge how infuriated the left would be by reversing \n     course. The White House knows Republicans like the idea of \n     the tribunals being used--and needs their support on other \n     key national security matters--but a shift on this issue \n     could poison the waters between the president and the liberal \n     base, as demonstrated by the ACLU ad.\n       ``As president, Barack Obama must decide whether he will \n     keep his solemn promise to restore our Constitution and due \n     process, or ignore his vow and continue the Bush-Cheney \n     policies,'' the ACLU ad said.\n       Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaking on CBS' \n     ``Face the Nation,'' said the ACLU ad was out of line.\n       ``The president is getting unholy grief from the left,'' \n     said Graham, who supports moving the defendants to tribunals. \n     ``The ACLU theory of how to manage this war I think is way \n     off base.''\n       Some are urging groups like the ACLU to look at the bigger \n     picture.\n       Attorney General Eric Holder announced in November that the \n     defendants would be heading to Manhattan civilian court, but \n     that move has generated a huge backlash from New Yorkers, \n     including the mayor and police chief, as well as Republicans \n     in Congress. The backlash has forced the administration to \n     reconsider not just the location of the trial but the forum.\n       ``Foreign terrorists ought not to be tried in U.S. courts. \n     Period,'' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox \n     News. ``They ought to be taken to Guantanamo, detained there, \n     interrogated there and adjudicated there in military \n     tribunals.''\n       A source told Fox News that if the administration decides \n     to send the case back to the commissions, it could be part of \n     a larger bargain to get support to close the detention center \n     at Guantanamo Bay and bring those detainees to the U.S. \n     Congress has barred the transfer of prisoners who don't have \n     a path to trial--those who appear to be detained \n     indefinitely--and refused to give the president the money for \n     a facility to house them on American soil.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

I rise today to commend the communities of Minnesota's \nRed River Valley for their extraordinary flood mitigation efforts this \nyear. Spring flooding in the Red River Valley is an enormous challenge \nto my constituents in Moorehead and in surrounding communities and the \ncommunities downstream.\n  Last year, these communities experienced record flooding with snow \nmelt draining into the Red River and resulting in over 40 feet of water \nfilling the valley. The families of the Red River Valley saw severe \noverland flooding resulting in the devastation of their homes, road \nclosures, and the cutting off of transportation in and out of the area.\n  This year, the Red River Valley is getting ready for what is \ngenerally forecast to be a major flood. Right now the National Weather \nService is forecasting a 90-percent chance of major flooding of over 35 \nfeet. I spent this past weekend in Moorehead, MN, and surrounding \ncommunities and communities downstream meeting with local leaders and \ntalking to folks on the ground getting ready for the flooding.\n  Their flood preparation efforts this year are truly impressive. The \ncity of Moorehead and Clay County have been acquiring houses in the \nfloodplain and moving them out of harm's way. As a result, Moorehead is \ngoing to need one-third fewer sandbags this year compared to last year.\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\n  Volunteers are already at work sandbagging, getting ready to fortify \nthe levees. I went to the Moorehead facility building this weekend to \nbag sandbags. We do that inside. They cannot freeze; the sandbags \ncannot freeze. It would be like stacking frozen turkeys. They have to \nbe unfrozen when we stack them.\n  The sense of community solidarity in tackling this challenge is \nincredible. I was struck by how much the community has unified once \nagain around preparing for these floods, and it was fun. So I would \nurge folks in the area to go down to the Moorehead facility building in \nthe next few days and weeks and sandbag.\n  What I took away from being there this weekend and from talking to \nlocal and community leaders is that they are doing all that they can to \nprepare for these floods with the resources they have. But they need \nour help. I am determined to make sure we are doing all we can on a \nFederal level to help these communities through the next few months.\n  Right now, Congress needs to appropriate supplemental funding for \nFEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. FEMA has said they are reserving their \nremaining disaster relief funds for immediate needs until we \nappropriate the supplemental funding. Yet the longer we wait, the \nlonger communities in the Red River Valley have to wait on important \nflood mitigation efforts such as removing the remaining homes in the \nfloodplain.\n  I have contacted the FEMA Administrator urging him to exhaust all \navailable options while Congress approves the President's request of \n$5.1 billion in supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund.\n  I stand ready to support Chairman Inouye in any of his efforts on \nthis or any other bill on the Senate floor to approve this $5.1 billion \nin supplemental funding.\n  Once again, I commend the communities in Minnesota's Red River Valley \nfor their flood mitigation preparation for this year.\n  As the ice melts and the water rises, I will continue to fight to get \nFederal funding out to these communities to make sure we are doing all \nwe can to support them in their flood preparations and in their \nrecovery over the coming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1253-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on our sixth day of \nconsideration of this important legislation to create jobs and extend \nvital safety net and tax provisions.\n  This legislation would prevent millions of Americans from falling \nthrough the safety net. It would put cash into the hands of Americans \nwho would spend it quickly, boosting the economy. And it would extend \ncritical programs and tax incentives that help create jobs.\n  Now, we had a productive week on the bill last week. By my count, the \nSenate has considered 29 amendments on this bill. We have conducted 10 \nrollcall votes.\n  As I count it, there are nine amendments pending. Those amendments \nare:\n  The underlying substitute amendment, the Murray-Kerry amendment on \nthe TANF emergency fund and summer employment for youth, the Coburn \namendment on transparency, the Webb amendment on executive bonuses, the \nFeingold-Coburn amendment rescinding unused transportation earmarks, \nthe amendment by Senator Reid of Nevada on geothermal receipts, the \nMcCain amendment on the use of reconciliation to change Medicare, the \nLincoln amendment on disaster assistance, and the Isakson amendment on \npension funding.\n  On Friday, we reached a unanimous consent agreement that, after the \nSenate resumes consideration of the bill tomorrow, we will conduct up \nto four rollcall votes in relation to the following amendments: the \nside-by-side amendment to the Coburn amendment on transparency, the \nCoburn amendment, the Murray amendment on youth jobs, and the side-by-\nside amendment to the Murray amendment.\n  And so Senators should be aware that we will have up to four rollcall \nvotes at about 10:15 tomorrow morning.\n  We further agreed that at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow, the Senate will vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment. And we hope \nthat we might conclude action on the bill thereafter.\n  Today, we will continue to process cleared amendments throughout the \nday.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Virginia Job Fair\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, and while I am speaking as \nin morning business, it is actually speaking in support of the \nlegislation the chairman of the Finance Committee talked about, just \ntaking it in a slightly different direction.\n  We spend a lot of time talking in this body about the necessity for \nus to focus on jobs and how Americans feel about that search for jobs. \nWe read about unemployment numbers at 9.7 percent. While we say, with \nsome relief, the numbers did not pop up during February, those numbers \nare still way too high.\n  I had a personal experience--I was not planning on speaking on the \nSenate floor, but I wanted to share with my colleagues and others an \nevent that happened--actually is still happening--about 45 minutes \nsouth of this Chamber.\n  My office had decided to sponsor a jobs fair, where we would bring \ntogether more than 30 Federal agencies. We located this jobs fair down \n45 minutes, as I mentioned, south of here at the University of Mary \nWashington at their Stafford campus.\n  For those who do not follow all of the ins and outs of Northern \nVirginia, we are blessed in Northern Virginia and Virginia overall with \nactually a rather low unemployment rate. Statewide our unemployment is \nabout 7 percent, and in Northern Virginia our numbers are even much \nlower.\n  As I mentioned, we put together this jobs fair, not unlike what the \nChair has done or other Senators have done. We were well represented \nwith over 30 Federal agencies--from TSA to the Peace Corps to the Fish \nand Wildlife Service. We put out the word, not knowing exactly what \nkind of response we would get. This is the first jobs fair I have \nhosted as a U.S. Senator.\n  At first we were a little worried. Last week, last Wednesday we only \nhad about 75 RSVPs for this jobs fair on a\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\ncollege campus south of Washington. But by that Friday night we had \nalmost 3,000 folks signed up. By yesterday afternoon, we realized, oh, \nmy gosh, our numbers were topping out about 5,000, and we were warning \npeople that perhaps all of the accommodations we put in place were not \nready to handle this many folks. We extended the hours of the jobs fair \nfrom noon to 12 to actually 4 o'clock today.\n  When my staff started showing up this morning about 6:30 or 7, there \nwere 500 people waiting in cars, many of whom had been sleeping there \nfor hours. By 9 o'clock, when the jobs fair was supposed to start, \n3,000 people were in line. I showed up there about 9:30, and, \nregrettably, before noon, we had topped out over 5,000, probably closer \nto 7,000 folks clogging the roads trying to come to this jobs fair in \nStafford County, VA.\n  Unfortunately, we had to cut it off at that point and put out the \nword that we would try to have another jobs fair with these Federal \nagencies and some private sector partners within the next few weeks. \nThe response was overwhelming.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I spent an hour simply going up and down the \nline of folks who were waiting. Many of these folks were people who had \ngraduate degrees; almost all of them had college degrees. They looked \nlike any of the kind of workforce we would see crossing any parts of \nour Nation's Capital today.\n  I heard story after story of folks who had never ever expected to \nshow up at a Federal jobs fair, folks who had never ever expected to \nsee their lives turned topsy-turvy by unemployment, or by folks who \nwere still unable to change jobs because of their constraints on health \ncare.\n  None of these folks were looking for a handout. They were just \nlooking for that opportunity to talk with some of the 35-plus \nrepresentatives from Federal agencies about the possibilities of \ngetting a job. All they wanted to do was try to do a better job for \nthemselves and their families.\n  So as we return to the debate on the so-called tax extenders bill, \nand when we work, as I know I have with the Presiding Officer, on \nefforts to kind of free up credit for small business owners or when we \ntalk about how we can provide other kinds of incentives with the \nprivate sector to jumpstart the economy, while it was great to provide \nthe possibility of these jobs in the public sector, the vast majority \nof jobs will and should be created in the private sector.\n  As we think about this piece of legislation right now, to make sure \nour Tax Code is supportive enough of those private sector efforts, I \nsaw the reason for those efforts this morning in the thousands in one \nof the most prosperous parts of our country, in Northern Virginia.\n  I came back more charged up than ever that what we do here is \nterribly important and that the folks there in that line didn't \nunderstand rules about filibusters or holds or all the other procedural \nback and forth that sometimes seems to dominate the floor. What they \ndid want us to do was to put that aside, put our partisanship aside and \nget the job done of trying to create more and more jobs all across the \ncountry. It is my hope in the coming weeks, when we have the next jobs \nfair, we will have the same kind of response. I look forward to the \nday, hopefully in the not too distant future, when we have a jobs fair, \nwhether it be in Virginia or in Minnesota, that we get a few folks but \nthat we don't get overwhelmed with the kind of literally unprecedented \nnumber of the 7,000 folks we saw today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The Space Program\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, that great philosopher, that \nobserver of the national scene, Yogi Berra, once said: ``You better be \nvery careful if you don't know where you're going, because you may not \nget there.'' A bit of that policy is now the perception of President \nObama's manned space program. There is a concern that the \nadministration doesn't know where they are going and they may not get \nthere.\n  I said ``perception'' because in reality the President has laid out a \nvisionary manned space program. However, the way the administration \nrolled out the space program--much to the chagrin of a number of us who \nwere trying to get through to the White House about the way they should \nroll it out--it was rolled out as a part of the budget and left for \npeople to draw their own conclusions.\n  Among the aerospace and space community, particularly in areas such \nas Houston at the Johnson Space Center, Huntsville at the Marshall \nSpace Flight Center, and Florida at the Kennedy Space Center, I can \ntell my colleagues that the perception is that the President has killed \nthe manned space program. In fact, that is the farthest thing from \nPresident Obama's mind. He is an enthusiastic fan of the space program. \nAs a matter of fact, we heard him speak many times about how as a \nlittle boy his grandfather took him to see the return of some of the \nApollo astronauts coming back from the Moon. When he tells that story, \nhis face lights up and you can see the enthusiasm he has. As he \ninteracts by radio with the astronauts on board the space station and \non board the space shuttle, you can see the enthusiasm he has.\n  Unfortunately, some of his advisers have not given him correct \ninformation about how to lay out his vision. So, happily, over the \ncourse of the weekend, the President has said he is going to come to \nFlorida on April 15 and he is going to lay out his vision for the space \nprogram. What is it? Well, we can anticipate that the President will \nsay what he already had his Administrator of NASA say in our committee \nhearing last week, which is that the goal is Mars. Mars is the next \nlogical goal. We were on the Moon 40 years ago. There could well be \ninterim steps on the way to Mars: possibly the Moon; possibly \nrendezvousing and landing on an asteroid; possibly--and very likely--to \ngo to one of the moons of Mars such as Fobos, before going actually to \nMars. Why? Because it would expend a lot less energy to land on a moon \nof Mars and return than it would to go on down to the red planet.\n  The President actually laid out in his robust budget proposal to the \nCongress a $6 billion increase for NASA over the course of the next 5 \nyears. Compared to other agencies of the government, NASA did very \nwell. The President is also to be commended for his budget proposal in \nwhich he said what everybody knew he had to say--which the Bush \nadministration had ignored--which was we have this $100 billion asset \nup there in orbit called the International Space Station. We are \ncompleting it now and we are equipping it now where we can get a crew \nof several astronauts--not just one, two, or three--on board to use it \nas a national laboratory, as it is technically designated. What he said \nwas that we are not going to stop it in 2015. We are going to at least \ncarry it out to 2020. Again, that was the logical thing that everybody \nknew. But if you can believe it, in the previous administration, it had \nnot been budgeted to continue beyond 2015 the International Space \nStation which we haven't even completed yet, and of which the last four \nflights will not only complete the construction, the equipping, but \nwill take up major scientific experiments such as the alpha magnetic \nspectrometer which, if it works, is going to open our understanding of \nthe universe and what the origins of the universe are.\n  So the President laid out a fairly good plan that had some good \nthings in it, but he left himself open to misinterpretation so that not \nonly is there the perception that the President has killed the manned \nspace program, but there is outright hostility toward President Obama \nand his proposals for the Nation's human space program.\n  Why did that occur? Well, No. 1, the President didn't make the \ndeclaration. Why is that important? Because only a President can lead \nthe Nation's human space program. Of course, the best example of that \nwas that after the Soviets had surprised us in the late 1950s\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nwith Sputnik and then they surprised us again in 1961 by putting the \nfirst human in orbit, Yuri Gagarin--and we didn't even have a rocket \nthat was strong enough to get us into orbit with our little Mercury \nspacecraft. We had the plan to go into suborbit with Alan Shepard, and \nafter Shepard came back, it took that bold stroke of President Kennedy \nto say, In 9 years, we are going to the Moon and will return safely. \nThat is leadership. That is a declaratory judgment. That is stepping \nout and being bold.\n  If we are going to Mars, it is going to take the President to say \nthat; not to tell his NASA Administrator in the Space Subcommittee \nhearing in the Senate last week that the Administrator can say that the \ngoal is Mars. It has to take the President to say that and he has to \nset out a specific timeframe. It can be approximate, but it has to be a \nreasonable timeframe. He then has to say to NASA: You figure out the \narchitecture; you set the benchmarks. So is it to go back to the Moon \nfor a temporary mission? Is it to go to an asteroid? Is it to go on and \ntry to go straight to Mars? Then we will unleash the creative spirit, \nthe human ingenuity of Americans as we have seen in this extraordinary \nprogram. The heartbeat of every American is a little faster when they \nsee some of the extraordinary, heroic accomplishments we have had in \nthe American space program, both manned and unmanned space \naccomplishments.\n  The President let himself be misinterpreted. He said in his budgetary \nmessage that he was cancelling the Constellation program. The \nConstellation program was a program that was announced 5 or 6 years ago \nby President George W. Bush, but the Bush administration never funded \nit. In fact, they starved NASA so that the building of the new rocket \nis not ready when the space shuttle is now being set for retirement. \nWhy is that? Well, that decision on the space shuttle came as a result \nof the destruction of Columbia over the skies of Texas on reentry back \nin 2003.\n  The investigation commission, headed by a Navy admiral named Gehman, \ncalled the Gehman Commission, otherwise known as CAIB, the Columbia \nAccident Investigation Board--they refer to it as the acronym CAIB--\nthey said, after a decade, at the end of the decade: If you are going \nto continue to fly the space shuttle, you are going to have to \nrecertify all these orbiters that have been going on since the early \neighties.\n  The decisions were made to shut down the space shuttle program at the \nend of the last decade. We find the shuttle program is, in fact, coming \nto an end without the new rocket being ready and, therefore, we have \nthe angst that is in this aerospace community, this close-knit family \ncalled the NASA family who are going to be seeing so many of the men \nand women who are so dedicated to this program being laid off because \nif you are not launching Americans on American rockets, then the jobs \nare not there.\n  Unfortunately, those decisions we tried to avert over and over. In \nthe last 5 or 6 years in the Senate, we put additional money into \nNASA's exploration program to try to speed the development of the \nrocket. Over and over, the previous administration cut us off at the \nknees, would not support it, and we could not get the votes in the \nHouse of Representatives to keep that additional money. As a result, we \nhave a rocket that is just in its testing stages, a capsule that has \nnot been built, and, as the President's advisers looked at it, they saw \nit was going to be well on into this decade before it would be ready, \nso they up and announced they are going to cancel this program called \nConstellation, which was the development of the Ares rocket and the \ndevelopment and construction of a capsule called Orion. But they also \nsaid: We want the R of a heavy-lift vehicle. There came the \ndisconnect because people who do not understand the space program were \nmaking decisions. I lay it at the feet of some of the folks in OMB, the \nOffice of Management and Budget. If you are going to build a heavy-lift \nvehicle, the likelihood is you cannot do that entirely with liquid \nrockets; you need solid rockets to propel that massive weight up into \nlow Earth orbit.\n  The solid rockets are what we are testing now. Thus, the President \nallowed his administration to be perceived that they were killing the \nmanned space program when, in fact, there was nothing further from what \nhe intended.\n  What are we going to do about it? Let's go back to the announcement \nmade over the weekend. I commend the President. I am very thankful to \nthe President that he has said he is coming to Florida for a major \ndiscussion and announcement on the human space program. This will occur \nApril 15. It will occur in Florida. I assume it will be at the Kennedy \nSpace Center or somewhere close by, which is the logical place, from \nwhence we have sent Americans into the cosmos.\n  I think that is a step in the right direction for the President. But \nhe needs to be prepared with specifics because of the perception that \nhe has killed the manned space program. Because of the hostility he has \ngenerated because of that perception, the President needs to be \nprepared with specifics of the goal, the timeframe, the benchmarks, the \nsuggested architecture, and how he would take his budget to flesh out \nmoving toward that goal.\n  May I give some suggestions to the President on how he might achieve \nthat. In the first place, there are four additional shuttles manifested \nto fly and, with that, the completion and the equipping of the \nInternational Space Station.\n  But there is a fifth shuttle that can fly because the external tank \nis there. It is referred to as the ``mission on demand'' because, in \neffect, it is a rescue shuttle to go up, if a space shuttle got \nmarooned, and rescue them.\n  What about a rescue for the last and the fifth shuttle? The risk is \nminimal because the mission would be to the space station. If the worst \nhappened on launch, just like Columbia, that a piece of the delicate \nsilicon tiles fell off and knocked a hole in the wing, of which they \nthen could not come back into Earth without burning up, then they could \ntake safe sanctuary in the International Space Station because now it \nis large enough to accommodate additional crew members until a rescue \nspacecraft could come to rescue them to take them back to Earth.\n  The risk to safety is minimal on a fifth shuttle flight. The \nPresident should announce he is asking NASA to do that fifth flight.\n  By the way, the money is already there. If the four flights, as \nscheduled, get off between now and the end of the fiscal year, \nSeptember 30, there is the money in the first quarter of fiscal year \n2011 for an additional flight. You don't have to get any additional \nmoney. It is budgeted. The President should announce that.\n  The next thing the President of the United States should do is say we \nare going on a full-scale, aggressive R program to develop that \nheavy-lift rocket that is going to get us up into low Earth orbit so we \ncan assemble things and go to whatever the next station is--the Moon, \nasteroid, the Moon of Mars. That aggressive R effort should be the \ncontinued testing of a solid rocket booster, not unlike the one that \nhas already been successfully tested.\n  Concurrent with that, there should be the development of a crew \nexploration vehicle, otherwise known as a capsule, that would carry \nastronauts up into low Earth orbit on this heavy-lift vehicle that \nwould allow us to do the assembly and all the other things we want to \ndo. This does not have to take away from the President's proposal that \ncommercial companies are encouraged to compete against each other to \nhave a cargo and human ferry service to and from the International \nSpace Station, for that can go on concurrently. Although I must say, in \na couple weeks, we are having a hearing in our Space Subcommittee. We \nare going to look at the commercial rocket competitors and whether they \nneed the $6 billion the President has recommended over the next 5 years \nin order for them to get humans to and from the International Space \nStation. The President should then clearly say we are going to do an \naggressive R effort to build a heavy-lift vehicle.\n  Because of the angst among space workers in the middle of a \nrecession, some of whom have already been laid off, others of whom are \ngetting pink slips and others of whom fear for their jobs, let us \nremember a recession is not a recession if you have been laid off from \nyour job. It is a depression. The angst of this economic recession with\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nlosing their job and not knowing where to turn elsewhere is among them. \nTherefore, my next recommendation to the President would be that he \naddress those fears.\n  He has already said he wants to spend $2 billion to help the center \nthat is going to be the most impacted. I have had estimates that with \nthe layoff of the shuttle program, it is about 5,000 jobs. The \nPresident should address that point. He should point out in his budget \nthe $2 billion he offered to modernize the Kennedy Space Center, how \nthat will affect jobs, and what part of that 5,000 could be \nameliorated.\n  Then the President should say--and it is my humble, respectful \nsuggestion--there are plenty other jobs in the aerospace community, and \nhe is going to try to bring them into places such as the Kennedy Space \nCenter, that is going to feel the effects of these layoffs, to help \npeople on a temporary basis until we can get back into the business of \nlaunching humans.\n  I humbly, respectfully request that the President say: The commercial \nboys who are bidding in a competition to be the service to and from the \nInternational Space Station have to hire, if they are the successful \nbidders, those people who are so skilled and who have not missed a beat \nin all these, lo, many years of which the American space program has \nbeen so tremendously successful. That is the next thing I would \nrespectfully ask the President to do.\n  Then, I think the President has to directly confront his critics, \nthose who, in political parlance, are taking cheap shots at the \nPresident--and he has left himself open to those cheap shots--that he \nwould directly confront them head on and say: The American space \nprogram is not a partisan program, it is not an ideological program; it \nis an American program, and it has always been run that way. That is \nthe way he should say he is going to continue to run that program and \nthat he should get those people to quiet down, get in the harness, and \nlet's all pull together what we all want to do, which is go out there \nand explore the heavens.\n  By the way, on that fifth shuttle flight, some people have asked me: \nWhat can it do? What is its function, other than just flying an \nadditional shuttle? There is a lot of equipment, a lot of experiments \nthat can be put in it, and it can take up an additional component, \nattach it to the space station and add volume to an already expansive \nspace station that will allow us to do experimentation in the zero \ngravity of orbit for years and years to come.\n  For all these reasons, I am so grateful to the President that he has \nstepped forth and said he is going to come and address this issue. I \nrespectfully request that he consider some of the suggestions I have \nmade.\n  At the end of the day, it is what he wants, it is what the Nation \nwants because every American heart beats a little bit quicker when they \nhappen to witness the extraordinary feats of Americans in space and the \npeeling back of the frontiers and the new knowledge and scientific \nresults that we have of the spinoffs as we develop these incredible \nflying machines.\n  Mr. President, it is an urgent plea that I make to the White House. \nListen to some advice. Stop listening just to the budget boys and OMB. \nListen to the cries of an American people who once again want to be \nchallenged and inspired, as President John F. Kennedy inspired the \nNation and the Nation came together and did what was considered to be \nalmost the impossible. It wasn't impossible. It was extraordinary, and \nit was an American achievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Iraqi Parliamentary Elections\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these are days when we Senators take to \nthe floor to express our anger and criticism of actions or events we \ndisagree with. But then there are days we rise happily to pay tribute \nto great and noble achievements. Today is such a day.\n  The people of Iraq went to the polls yesterday and struck a blow for \nfreedom and democracy that has resounded across the world. As opposed \nto Iraq's last national elections in 2005 which saw the country rigidly \ndivided along sectarian lines, with most Sunnis refusing to participate \naltogether, the election yesterday was broadly inclusive, with a host \nof cross-sectarian lists competing for the vote.\n  Early reports indicate turnout was high among Iraq's nearly 19 \nmillion registered voters. Over 50,000 polling stations were up and \nrunning across the country with more than 200,000 Iraqis observing the \nelection.\n  Loud speakers in mosques that once implored Iraqis to take up arms \nand kill Americans appealed to them yesterday with a different purpose: \nto express their desire for a better Iraq--not with bullets but with \nballots, not with bombs but with ink-stained fingers.\n  Tragically, as most of us feared, yesterday's events did not proceed \nwithout incident. Al-Qaida and other terrorists lashed out with acts of \nbarbaric violence against innocent Iraqis--women and men, fellow Muslim \nand fellow Arabs, even young children. Although these criminals did \ntake the lives of at least 37 people, Iraqis were not deterred. They \nvoted by the millions anyway, and in so doing they defied the enemies \nof their great nation. The Iraqi people deserve the lion's share of the \ncredit for making yesterday's election such a resounding triumph for \ndemocracy.\n  Iraq's Government, its High Electoral Commission, and its security \nforces all conducted themselves with distinction. I congratulate them \nall. It has been Iraqi courage, Iraqi sacrifice, and Iraqi endurance \nover many years of hardship that are now bringing about the country's \nemergence as an increasingly free society.\n  Yet Iraqis have been fortunate to have committed allies in their \nstruggle for justice. I thank America's civilians and diplomats, as \nwell as those of our coalition partners and the United Nations for \nsupporting our Iraqi friends in this election and throughout the \ncountless challenges that preceded it.\n  Most of all, I want to express my deepest gratitude to America's men \nand women in uniform who have given more to our mission in Iraq than \ncould ever be asked of them. As our troops return home in the months \nahead, as they must, it will be with the knowledge that their mission \nhas been worth fighting for, with the thanks of a grateful nation, and \nwith an honor won for themselves that time will not diminish.\n  Our fellow citizens who have served in Iraq these past several years \nhave done what many once believed to be impossible. It was once assumed \nthat Iraq was unfit for democracy, that Iraq's people could not \npractice it, and Iraq's culture would not allow it.\n  It was once assumed that America was trying to ``impose'' democracy \non Iraq, or perhaps ``export'' it to Iraq. It was once assumed that no \nmanner of additional U.S. troops could succeed in helping Iraqis to \nsecure their country. These were all popular assumptions, especially in \nthis town--popular but wrong. Thankfully, the United States followed a \ndifferent course. Because we did, Iraqis are showing that freedom and \ndemocracy are Iraqi dreams and, increasingly, Iraqi realities. Iraqis \nare choosing to resolve their differences through cooperation and \ndialogue not violence and repression. They are demonstrating that \nIraqis share the same basic aspirations as you and me: safe \nneighborhoods, opportunity for themselves and their children, equal \naccess to justice, a chance to elect those who would govern them, and \nto live under laws of their own making.\n  Yesterday the citizens of Iraq once again reaffirmed that a nation's \npast need not determine its future when citizens of courage are devoted \nto a just cause that is greater than themselves.\n  I will be the first to admit that Iraq still faces many difficulties: \na limited but lethal terrorist threat, the unhelpful meddling of some \nof its neighbors, weak political institutions, a still developing \neconomy, and a culture of distrust that will take a long time to heal.\n  There is much hard work still to be done in Iraq, and the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nmust remain fully seized with it. In the weeks ahead, we must support \nour Iraqi friends in the arduous task of forming their new government. \nIn the months ahead, as U.S. troops return home, we must deepen and \nexpand America's diplomatic and economic engagement with Iraq. In the \nyears ahead, the United States, especially our Congress, has a \nresponsibility to continue providing the critical support, including \nthe necessary resources to strengthen Iraq's young democracy.\n  We have given much to this effort already, but now is not the time to \nscale back. Although our military mission is ending, our commitment to \nIraq will endure, and must endure, for a long time to come. The fruits \nof this commitment are already becoming evident for the United States. \nWe have not seen eye to eye with the current Iraqi Government at all \ntimes. I am fairly certain that we will have our share of disagreements \nwith future Iraqi Governments. But this does not change the fact that \nIraq has transformed in just 8 years from a principal enemy of the \nUnited States to a rising partner in the fight against violence, \nextremism; from a generator of insecurity to an emerging source of \nstability in the midst of a volatile region; and from one of history's \nmost reprehensible tyrannies to a growing inspiration for people across \nthe Middle East who still yearn for freedom and justice in their own \ncountries.\n  When Iranians look at a democratic Iraq today amid violent and bloody \nmilitary crackdowns in their own country, they must be thinking: Why \nnot us? When Syrians look at a democratic Iraq today among the stifling \nclimate of oppression in their own country, they must be thinking: Why \nnot us? And when our friends in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other nations \nin the region, where liberty is not assured, watch a peaceful \ntransition of power in Iraq from one freely elected government to \nanother, they must also be thinking: Why not us?\n  The citizens of Iraq are now writing a new and hopeful chapter for \ntheir country, but also for the region as a whole, whose people are \nincreasingly looking to emulate Iraq, its freedoms, its rule of law, \nits security of human dignity, its equal rights, and equal justice. \nThis is the start of something new and wondrous in the Middle East, a \nrenaissance of sorts, and Iraq is at the very forefront.\n  The war in Iraq is ending, but America's partnership with the new \nIraq is only just beginning. No matter where any of us stood in the old \ndebates of the past, Americans should all be able to agree now that the \nemergence of a free and democratic Iraq is one of the greatest \nstrategic opportunities in all of U.S. foreign policy.\n  America and our allies have created this opportunity. Iraqis have \nexpanded it and seized it. Now let's all come together to usher in a \nnew era of liberty not just for Iraq but for the entire Middle East.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about a \nsimple amendment that would go a long way to save a lot of jobs in our \ntimber industry and our forested communities.\n  To give a little bit of background, the collapse of the housing \nmarket has devastated the timber industry and the many rural \ncommunities that depend on it, resulting in major job losses. Because \nof a fate tied to the housing industry, the timber industry is one of \nthe hardest hit by the current recession, with timber prices at a \nrecord low. That precipitous drop in timber prices has created a unique \nand very threatening problem for companies that harvest timber on \nfederally owned lands. Specifically, a lot of companies bid for \ncontracts to harvest timber and they did so right before the housing \nmarket and then the timber market collapsed. So those companies bid. \nSome won contracts, and those that won those contracts won them at a \nvery high price for the timber. They could make a profit selling that \ntimber when they harvested it, but by the time the process was \ncompleted, the timber prices had fallen through the floor. At the \ncurrent record-low timber prices, harvesting under contract would cost \nmore than the timber is worth. So the companies would lose money by \ngoing forward, resulting in major losses and leading to layoffs and \nlost jobs.\n  This takes us to an interesting point where there are two \npossibilities: one is a contract with the Forest Service, and one is a \ncontract with the BLM, Bureau of Land Management. If a company is \nfortunate enough to have a contract with the Forest Service, they can \napply for and receive an extension, giving them more time to act on the \ncontract and harvest the timber. Given the unique circumstances we find \nourselves in, that is of great value. It makes sense. It is a simple \nway to save jobs. But, unfortunately, if your contract is with the \nBureau of Land Management--and that Bureau manages 69 million acres of \nforested land across our Western States, much of it prime timberland--\nthe same rules are not set up for companies that happen to do business \nwith the BLM rather than the Forest Service. Their only alternative is \nharvesting timber at a loss and to lose the contract and lose the \nbusiness altogether. This makes no sense as a policy. In Western States \nsuch as Oregon where Forest Service and BLM lands are side by side, you \ncan find yourselves on the Forest Service land one moment and BLM land \nthe next. It is practically arbitrary whether a company is working with \nan agency that can give them a commonsense extension, as the Forest \nService can, or an agency that cannot give them that commonsense \nextension, which is the BLM.\n  My amendment is simple. It allows companies to apply for a contract \nextension and authorizes the BLM to review and grant those applications \nso we can save those jobs. It applies the same rules to the BLM that \nthe Forest Service already has in place. Indeed, the language of the \namendment is identical to a companion bill that has already passed the \nHouse. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office has determined \nthere is no significant financial impact for this bill.\n  I have spoken to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nand I haven't found anyone who has an objection to this amendment. This \nis one of those commonsense opportunities to cut a little bit of \nredtape; a commonsense opportunity to assist companies that were caught \nin an unexpected trap; a commonsense opportunity to strengthen our \nrural resource-based companies and the jobs that go with them.\n  So I put forward this amendment, and, as I noted, everyone I have \nspoken to on both sides of the aisle says it makes a lot of sense, but \nsome objection has been placed anonymously. So I simply wish to ask \nthat any colleague who has an objection to this effort to help the \ntimber companies, to help our rural resource-based communities, to \nplease come and talk with me because I am sure that whatever concern \nyou have, I should be able to get a good answer for your concern.\n  We have in this Chamber the opportunity to help some of the hardest \nhit communities with a simple amendment such as this. I hope we can \nseize that opportunity. That is the type of bipartisan problem-solving \nAmericans are hoping to see in the Senate.\n  Thank you. Thank you to my colleagues who have been so helpful in \nreviewing this amendment on both sides of the aisle. Thank you to my \ncolleagues who will be helpful as we try to put this commonsense \namendment in place.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            PBGC Governance\n\n  Mr. KOHL, Mr. President, I rise to talk about the importance of \nretirement security and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the \nFederal agency responsible for insuring the pension plans of nearly 44 \nmillion Americans. Unfortunately, this vital agency in November of 2009 \nreported a total deficit of nearly $22 billion. Furthermore, the PBGC \nsaid its potential exposure from financially weak companies that may \nnot be able to honor their pension payments is currently about $168 \nbillion, an increase of $121 billion from the prior year.\n  The American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act includes \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nto offer limited pension funding relief to companies that provide \ndefined benefit plans. While this relief is much needed, I am concerned \nabout any such action that could increase the liability of the PBGC in \nits current state. As we found at an Aging Committee hearing last year, \nthe agency sorely lacks the oversight and policy direction it requires.\n  There is little doubt that an improved PBGC governance structure is \nnecessary. The PBGC's boards consist of only three members: the \nSecretary of Labor, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Secretary of \nCommerce. These three members obviously have their own agencies to run, \nand are doing so during an economic crisis.\n  The Government Accountability Office has indicated for years that the \nPBGC board members do not have enough time or resources to provide the \npolicy direction and oversight required by the agency. In 28 years, the \nfull board has met only 20 times. These findings have been echoed in \nreports by the McKinsey & Company consulting group and by the Brookings \nInstitution.\n  The role of PBGC is too crucial to allow its governance to slip \nthrough the cracks. And we have seen devastating results when it has. \nThe former PBGC Director was able to adopt a risky investment strategy \njust months before the market downturn and inappropriately involve \nhimself in the bidding process, with little more than a rubberstamped \napproval from the board.\n  We must ensure that these problems do not impact the ability of the \nagency to function going forward. I have crafted an amendment based on \nthe PBGC Governance Improvement Act, a bill I introduced with Senators \nBennet, McCaskill and Feingold, which would significantly improve the \nPBGC board's governance oversight structure. First and foremost, the \namendment would expand the Board's membership, requiring it to meet at \nleast four times a year, and ensuring that the board retains continuity \nduring a change in administration. The amendment would also ensure the \nPBGC Advisory Council, inspector general, and general counsel have full \nand direct independent access to the entire board. Finally, the \namendment would require the PBGC director to recuse him or herself from \npotential conflicts of interest, to include any involvement with the \nagency's technical evaluation panels. These small commonsense changes \nare a bare minimum needed to make sure the PBGC is secure and \ntaxpayer's are protected.\n  The role of the PBGC is a vital one, now more than ever. For 44 \nmillion Americans with defined benefit pension plans, PBGC is the only \nthing that stands between the secure retirement they have worked so \nhard for, and the prospect of living without the retirement income they \nhave earned. We must get the PBGC back on track, or face the \npossibility of absorbing its obligations as taxpayers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the concerns raised by \nSenator Kohl, and agree that these are serious issues that need to be \naddressed. While I believe that short-term, targeted pension funding \nrelief is critically important and should move as quickly as possible, \nI would welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to pursue \nlonger term solutions addressing the many challenges facing our defined \nbenefit pension system, including PBGC governance.\n  I plan to hold hearings in the HELP Committee this year addressing \nthe state of the defined benefit system and the PBGC. I look forward to \ndiscussing with Senator Kohl the ideals and goals reflected in the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Governance Improvement Act of \n2009, and I thank him for bringing this important legislation to my \nattention. I hope that we can work collaboratively on legislation to \nimprove the security of defined benefit pensions and the agency that \ninsures these plans, as well as on broader initiatives to build greater \nretirement security for all working families.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I applaud the chairman of the Select Committee on Aging \nfor raising this important issue. I look forward to working with him \nand the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \non addressing the shortcomings he has highlighted.\n  Mr. KOHL. With those assurances, I will not offer my amendment and \nlook forward to working with Chairman Harkin and Chairman Baucus on \nimproving the PBGC.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, \nMarch 9, after any leader time, the time until 11 a.m. be for a period \nfor the transaction of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders, with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first portion; that at 11 a.m., the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 4213 and proceed as under the order of March 5, \nwith all provisions of that order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1258-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UGANDA RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by \nSenators Feingold and Brownback, the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament \nand Northern Uganda Recovery Act. I am one of the 62 cosponsors of this \nlegislation, and I believe this broad bipartisan support speaks to both \nthe urgency of this issue and the importance of this legislation.\n  On a continent plagued by man-made tragedy, the Lord's Resistance \nArmy stands out as a manufacturer of that tragedy. The U.S. State \nDepartment describes the LRA as ``vicious and cult-like.'' Formed in \nthe 1980s to overthrow the Ugandan government, the LRA engaged in such \nwidespread violence that at one time, about 2 million Ugandans were \ndisplaced from their homes. The LRA massacred, mutilated and abducted \ncivilians, and forced many into sexual servitude. An estimated 66,000 \nUgandan youths were forced to fight for the group.\n  The good news is that the Ugandan government has now largely pushed \nthe LRA out of Uganda. The bad news is that the scars it has left \nbehind are raw and real for Ugandans; and that meanwhile, the LRA has \nmoved into parts of Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the \nCentral African Republic, continuing to spread violence and terror. \nBetween September of 2008 and July of 2009, the United Nations \nestimates that LRA violence claimed 1,300 civilian lives, that the LRA \nabducted another 1,400 civilians, and that more than 300,000 were \nforced from their homes.\n  This legislation, which 63 Senators support, would take a number of \nsteps to address both the aftermath of the LRA's rampage in Northern \nUganda and its continuing violence in Uganda's neighbor nations. The \nAct would require that within six months, the United States develop a \ncomprehensive strategy for dealing with the LRA, including an outline \nof steps to protect the civilian population against LRA violence. The \nact would authorize funding under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide humanitarian assistance in areas affected by LRA. And it would \nprovide assistance for reconstruction and for promotion of justice and \nreconciliation in areas of Uganda recovering from the LRA's \ndepredations.\n  It is unfortunate that despite the broad and bipartisan support for \nthis legislation, apparently only one Member of the Senate objects to \nit and is able to block its consideration. As with so many measures \nbefore the Senate, there is little doubt that this bill would win \noverwhelming passage were it allowed to come to the floor.\n  But the innocent victims of LRA violence, past and present, need our \nhelp. The objection of one Senator should not be allowed to thwart us \nresponding to that need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1258-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1258-S1259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             REMEMBERING JOEL WAHLENMAIER AND JAVIER BEJAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of two respected and dedicated public servants, \nFresno County Sheriff's Deputy Joel Wahlenmaier and\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nReedley Police Officer Javier Bejar. Deputy Wahlenmaier and Officer \nBejar were tragically killed in the line of duty while helping officers \nwith the California Fire Marshal's office serve a warrant on a \nsuspected arsonist in Minkler, CA.\n  Deputy Wahlenmaier was born in Bakersfield, CA, and raised in Fresno. \nAfter spending his early career in construction, Deputy Wahlenmaier \njoined the Fresno County Sheriff's Department in 1998. During his \ntenure with the department, he worked as a detective in the homicide \nand property crime bureaus and he was a longtime member of the \ndepartment's search and rescue team.\n  Deputy Wahlenmaier is survived by his wife Beverly and children Amy \nand Austin. He had a profound love of the outdoors. He was a skilled \nfisherman and hunter who enjoyed skiing and water sports. Those who \nknew Deputy Wahlenmaier will always remember him as a trusted, caring, \nand kind colleague and friend, and above all else, a devoted family \nman.\n  Officer Bejar was born in Mexico and moved to the United States with \nhis family at the age of 3. He grew up in Orange Cove in Fresno County. \nWhile a student at Reedley High School, he became an Explorer Scout in \nthe Reedley Police Department Police Explorer Program, which teaches \nyoung people interested in pursuing a law enforcement career the \nfundamentals of police service. After graduating from high school, he \njoined the U.S. Marine Corps, during which time he served a 14-month \ntour in Iraq and Kuwait and earned the rank of sergeant before he was \nhonorably discharged. Officer Bejar joined the Reedley Police \nDepartment in 2005. He was named the Reedley Police Department Officer \nof the Year in 2007 and he received a life-saving medal in 2009.\n  Office Bejar is survived by his wife Miriam, his parents, and seven \nsiblings. He will always be remembered as a gentleman with an engaging \npersonality who was committed to his job and family.\n  Deputy Wahlenmaier and Officer Bejar dutifully served the residents \nof Fresno County with great selflessness, integrity, and valor. Their \ndevotion to help others and passion to make a positive impact on the \ncommunity epitomize the best ideals of law enforcement. Their lasting \ncontributions to public safety and law enforcement are greatly \nappreciated. They will be sorely missed.\n  We shall always be grateful for Deputy Wahlenmaier and Office Bejar's \nheroic service and the sacrifices that they made while serving the \ncommunity and the people they loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1259-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL EMERSON GARDNER, JR.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to thank LTG Emerson \nGardner, Jr. for his outstanding service to our great Nation and to \ncongratulate him on the occasion of his retirement.\n  Lieutenant Genera Gardner hails from the great State of Maryland and \nnext week he will retire from the U.S. Marine Corps after 37 years of \nfaithful and superb service. Duty, honor, country--the Marine Corps \nmotto--are not just words to him. I am so proud of General Gardner's \naccomplishments and service and would like to share a bit more about \nthis great marine.\n  Lieutenant General Gardner is a 1973 cum laude graduate of Duke \nUniversity. He was named an Olmsted Scholar in 1978 and studied history \nand political science for 2 years at Goettingen, Germany. He is a \ngraduate of The Basic School, Defense Language Institute, Marine Corps \nCommand and Staff College, Armed Forces Staff College, the Norwegian \nDefense College and the National Security Leadership Course at the \nMaxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse \nUniversity.\n  As a distinguished naval aviator, Lieutenant General Gardner served \nas a helicopter pilot in all three Marine air wings. He was hand-picked \nto serve as a White House liaison officer and Presidential helicopter \ncommand pilot for President Ronald Reagan. As commanding officer of \nHMM-261, Lieutenant General Gardner led the Raging Bulls in Operation \nSharp Edge, the evacuation of Liberia, and into major combat operations \nduring Operations Desert Shield and Storm. It is also important to note \nthat during his career, he has accumulated more than 4,300 flight hours \nin most of the aircraft currently in the Marine Corps inventory.\n  Lieutenant General Gardner also served as one of seven Marine \nExpeditionary Unit commanders in the world. As the commanding officer \nof the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Special Operations Capable, he \nled Operation Silver Wake, the noncombatant evacuation, NEO, of \nAlbania, Operation Guardian Retrieval, contingency support for a NEO of \nKinshasa, Zaire and Dynamic Response, the first employment of SACEUR's \nStrategic Reserve into Bosnia.\n  Lieutenant General Gardner has served as G-3 current ops officer with \nthe 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade in Okinawa, deputy G-3 for II Marine \nExpeditionary Force and as the J-3, operations officer, for the \nStanding Joint Task Force, MARFORLANT. He was also the assistant chief \nof staff for operations and logistics at Allied Forces Northern Europe \nat Kolsas, Norway and at Allied Forces Northwestern Europe, in High \nWycombe, England. Soon after this assignment, he served as assistant \ndeputy commandant for aviation at Headquarters Marine Corps, \nWashington, DC. His tour as the deputy commander of U.S. Marine Corps \nForces, Atlantic included extended temporary additional duty as the \ndeputy J-3 for current operations at U.S. Central Command in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom. General Gardner served as the director for \noperations, J3 at U.S. Pacific Command, the deputy commandant for \nprograms and resources at Headquarters, Marine Corps and currently as \nthe director for cost assessment and program evaluation for the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  With such an honorable and distinguished career, it is only fitting \nthat I share with you his long list of military awards and decorations \nwhich include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, multiple awards \nof the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, Navy \nCommendation Medal and the Presidential Service Badge.\n  Under Lieutenant General Gardner's guidance, the Marine Corps \nexpanded its personnel and strengthened its readiness. He led the \nMarine Corps' efforts to acquire MRAPs and other vital equipment so \nneeded by our marines, soldiers and airmen in Iraq and Afghanistan. As \na result of his work, the force has never been stronger and it is his \nhonesty and integrity which both his subordinates and superiors admire. \nAnyone who knows General Gardner knows of his commitment to lead and \nmentor young marines, his dynamic and persuasive personality, his \ncareful, thoughtful and precise preparation of all things--mission or \nbrief--and of course, his steadfast and unwavering dedication to the \nmen and women serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  The history of our great Nation is comprised of men, just like \nGeneral Gardner, who have so bravely fought for the ideals of freedom \nand democracy. It is humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers \nthey have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. Today our \ncountry owes General Gardner, as well as his wife Vivian, and children \nPhil, the oldest Nick, a corporal in the Marine Corps who served in \nIraq, Christian, a lance corporal who will deploy to Afghanistan in \nJune as a Marine Corps sniper, and Marc who wants to be an engineer, \nour warmest of thanks and deepest appreciation for all that they have \ndone. I offer my sincerest gratitude for his decades of service and I \nsalute LTG Emerson Gardner as he retires from the U.S. Marine Corps. \nSemper Fi!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1259-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1259-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1259-S1260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1260-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1260-S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4944.

A bill to support high-achieving, educationally \ndisadvantaged elementary school students in high-need local educational \nagencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague Senator \nGrassley, to introduce legislation on behalf of the millions of \ntalented, high-achieving American students who every day, despite our \nbest efforts, are being left behind.\n  When we talk about reducing the achievement gap, we usually think of \nhelping economically disadvantaged kids who are having a tough time in \nschool keep up with their peers.\n  Unfortunately, there is also a growing gap between high-achieving \nkids from high-earning families and students with just as much \npotential and talent who come from difficult economic circumstances.\n  Potential is being squandered every day. Tragically, some estimates \nindicate that one in five of our highest-achieving students drops out \nof school. That is 20 percent of our best and brightest students, the \nhope of our nation and the key to our economic competitiveness in the \n21st century, left behind.\n  Every child should have the opportunity to reach their full \npotential. So, today I introduce the Equity in Excellence Act of 2010, \ndesigned to eliminate this gap among high-achieving students by helping \ntalented but economically disadvantaged kids find the challenging and \nenriching materials and programs they need to stay in school and on \ntrack.\n  Here is how it works.\n  First, our bill will help to evaluate how school districts are \nchallenging their most talented students--and to diagnose the problem \nwhen they are not.\n  Second, it will put in place evidence-based programs--ranging from \nenrichment programs to academic acceleration strategies to high quality \nsupport material--designed to maximize learning among high-potential \nstudents.\n  Third, it provides funding to hire and train personnel--principals, \ncounselors, psychologists--skilled in meeting the needs of high-\nachieving students.\n  Fourth, it provides funding to educate and inform parents of these \nstudents, so that they can partner with schools in supporting their \nkids.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National Association for \nGifted\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\nChildren, an organization of more than 8,000 parents, teachers, \neducation professionals, and community leaders united in support of \nhigh-achieving kids and their unique needs.\n  Of course we all want to ensure that every child--no matter what \ntheir strengths and weaknesses, no matter what their grades or test \nscores, no matter what their economic background--can get a good \neducation that prepares them for the 21st century economy.\n  Every child who falls through the cracks represents a tragedy. When \nthose who have displayed such tremendous potential are left behind, we \nall suffer. This legislation offers a step towards keeping those kids \nchallenged, engaged--and in school.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for joining me in this effort, and \nencourage our colleagues to join as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCAIN):\n  S. 3088. A bill to reduce the number of executive branch political \nappointments; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good \nfriend the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in introducing \nlegislation to reduce the number of presidential political appointees. \nSpecifically, the bill caps the number of political appointees at \n2,000. When I previously introduced this legislation, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates it would save $382 million over the next 5 \nyears and over $872 over the next 10 years.\n  The bill is based on recommendations of a number of distinguished \npanels, including the 1996 Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the \nPresidential Appointment Process. The Task Force findings, which are \nstill very relevant today, are part of a long line of recommendations \nthat we reduce the number of political appointees in the Executive \nBranch. For many years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual \npublication Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options, and it \nwas one of the central recommendations of the National Commission on \nthe Public Service, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman \nand current economic advisor to President Obama, Paul Volcker.\n  This proposal is also consistent with the recommendations of former \nVice President Al Gore's National Performance Review, which called for \nreductions in the number of federal managers and supervisors, arguing \nthat ``over-control and micro management'' not only ``stifle the \ncreativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year \nin salary, benefits, and administrative costs.''\n  Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 and 2003 Volcker \nCommission reports, which argued the growing number of presidential \nappointees may ``actually undermine effective presidential control of \nthe executive branch.'' The first Volcker Commission recommended \nlimiting the number of political appointees to 2,000, as this \nlegislation does.\n  It is essential that any administration be able to implement the \npolicies that brought it into office in the first place. Government \nmust be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the \nVolcker Commissions noted, the great increase in the number of \npolitical appointees in recent years has not made government more \neffective or more responsive to political leadership.\n  Between 1980 and 2008 the ranks of political appointees rose by more \nthan 27 percent whereas between that same period, excluding the defense \nsector, the civilian workforce remained consistent at about 1.1 to 1.2 \nmillion.\n  In recommending a cap on political appointees, the 1989 and 2003 \nVolcker Commission reports noted that the large number of presidential \nappointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any President or \nWhite House. The 1989 Commission argued that this lack of control and \npolitical focus ``may actually dilute the President's ability to \ndevelop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to hold cabinet \nsecretaries accountable.''\n  Adding organizational layers of political appointees can also \nrestrict access to important resources, while doing nothing to reduce \nbureaucratic impediments.\n  In commenting on this problem, author Paul Light noted, ``As this \nsediment has thickened over the decades, presidents have grown \nincreasingly distant from the lines of government, and the front lines \nfrom them.'' Light added that ``Presidential leadership, therefore, may \nreside in stripping government of the barriers to doing its job \neffectively. . .''\n  The Volcker Commission also asserted that this thickening barrier of \ntemporary appointees between the President and career officials can \nundermine development of a proficient civil service by discouraging \ntalented individuals from remaining in government service or even \npursuing a career in government in the first place.\n  Former Attorney General Elliot Richardson put it well when he noted:\n\n       But a White House personnel assistant sees the position of \n     deputy assistant secretary as a fourth-echelon slot. In his \n     eyes that makes it an ideal reward for a fourth-echelon \n     political type--a campaign advance man, or a regional \n     political organizer. For a senior civil servant, it's irksome \n     to see a position one has spent 20-30 years preparing for \n     pre-empted by an outsider who doesn't know the difference \n     between an audit exception and an authorizing bill.\n\n  The 2003 Volcker Commission report identified another problem \naggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees, namely \nthe increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of \npositions. As the Commission reported, both President Bush and \nPresident Clinton were into their presidencies for many months before \ntheir leadership teams were fully in place. The Commission noted that \non average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more than \neight months after the inauguration, one-sixth of an entire \npresidential term. By contrast, the report noted that in the \npresidential transition of 1960, Kennedy appointees were confirmed, on \naverage, 2\\1/2\\ months after the inauguration.\n  In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in \ngovernment, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental \neffect on potential appointees. The 2003 Volcker Commission reported \nthat, ``Potential appointees sometimes decline to enter government \nservice when confronted by this process. Others drop out along the way. \nBut the principal impact of the modern appointments process is the \ndelay it imposes on the staffing of new administrations.''\n  The Clinton administration made modest reductions in the number of \npolitical appointees but the numbers have steadily increased in the \npast decade.\n  As we scour the Federal budget for wasteful or unnecessary spending, \nwe can't overlook spending that many in Washington may well wish to \nretain. The test of commitment to deficit reduction is not simply to \nsupport measures that impact someone else. By reducing the number of \npolitical appointees, we can ensure a sufficient number remain to \nimplement the policies of any administration without burdening the \nFederal budget with unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political \njobs.\n  Reducing the Federal deficit and balancing the budget is something \nthat has been central to my Senate career, from the 82 point plan I \nbrought to the Senate in 1993 to my most recent Control Spending Now \nAct, which would cut the deficit by around $500 billion.\n  The legislation I am introducing today reflects one of the points \nincluded on the original 82 point plan calling for streamlining various \nFederal agencies and reducing agency overhead costs, and it will be \nadded to my Control Spending Now Act. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin reducing the deficit and reforming government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1263-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1263-S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 446--COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY \n              ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. CASEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.

Res. 447\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Postal Service should, in accordance with \n     section 416 of title 39, United States Code--\n       (1) issue a semipostal stamp to support medical research \n     relating to Alzheimer's disease; and\n       (2) transfer to the National Institutes of Health for that \n     purpose any amounts becoming available from the sale of such \n     stamp.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nurging the U.S. Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp to help \nraise money for Alzheimer's research. A semipostal stamp will fund new \nresearch while also raising public awareness about this devastating \ndisease.\n  Finding new ways to treat Alzheimer's should be a national priority. \nThe disease not only harms patients and their families, it strains our \nhealth care system as well. Every 70 seconds, someone in America \ndevelops Alzheimer's. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have \nAlzheimer's disease, including one in eight people over 65. The direct \nand indirect costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias to Medicare, \nMedicaid and businesses amount to more than $148 billion each year. By \n2050, this disease is likely to affect more than 11 million people 65 \nand older--unless we can find a medical breakthrough.\n  In addition to this resolution, I am also the sponsor of the \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act. The act would increase overall funding \nfor Alzheimer's research at NIH, establish a national summit to \nidentify priorities and maximize resources in our fight for better \ntreatments and a cure, and expand the Alzheimer's State Matching Grant \nProgram. I am hopeful the Senate will pass the Breakthrough Act this \nyear in addition to the resolution I am introducing today.\n  A semipostal stamp is one more way each of us can help in the fight \nagainst Alzheimer's. Proceeds from the stamp's sales would fund \nAlzheimer's research at the National Institutes of Health. By paying \nmore than the normal postage rate for this stamp, the public could \ncontribute directly to the search for a new treatment or even a cure. I \nask my colleagues today to join me in the fight against Alzheimer's and \nsupport this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/08/senate-section/article/S1264-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1264-S1265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3431.
