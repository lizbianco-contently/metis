Mr. President, I wish to address, again, the issue of the \nbudget as proposed by the President of the United States, which is \nabout to be\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\ntaken up by the Budget Committees of the Senate and the House, and its \nimplications for us as a nation because the implications of it are \nrather dramatic.\n  Now, I understand--and all of us on our side of the aisle \nunderstand--the last election was won by the President and his party, \nthat the Democratic Party now controls both the House and the Senate \nand the administration and, therefore, they have absolute \nresponsibility and the right to send us a budget which reflects their \npriorities. But I think we ought to have openness as to what the \nimplications of that budget are relative to the future of our Nation, \nand they are dramatic.\n  As you look at the budget that has been proposed by this \nadministration, it represents the largest expansion of Government in \nour history. It is a proposal which is essentially moving the \nGovernment into arenas with an aggressiveness that has never been seen \nbefore. It has in it the largest tax increase in history, as well as \nthe fastest increase in the debt of our Nation in history.\n  The taxes go up by $1.4 trillion under this budget. Discretionary \nspending, which is spending that is not entitlement spending, goes up \nby $725 billion. Entitlement spending--which are things such as health \ncare--goes up by $1.2 trillion. Yet there is no effort to save money in \nthis budget to reduce the cost of spending and the cost of the \nGovernment. Instead, there is an expansion of the Government in this \nrather aggressive way.\n  The practical effect of this is that within 5 years the debt of the \nUnited States held by the public will double. That means in the first 5 \nyears of this administration--presuming it is reelected--they will have \nincreased the debt more than the debt was increased since the founding \nof the Republic all the way through the Presidency of George W. Bush; \nthey will have doubled the debt of the country.\n  In 10 years, because of this massive expansion in the size of the \nGovernment, they will triple the debt of the country.\n  What does ``debt'' mean? What does tripling the debt from $5.8 \ntrillion to $15 trillion in 10 years mean? Well, basically, it means \nAmericans coming into the workforce, Americans of the next generation, \nand the generation that follows that generation, will bear a burden \nfrom our generation--that the costs of today are being offloaded onto \nour children. The result of that is very simple. Our children and our \ngrandchildren will have a country which will not give them as much \nopportunity as our country has given us because the burden from our \ngeneration will be weighing them down. The costs we have run up as a \ngeneration and passed on to them will set them behind the starting \nline. They will end up having less opportunity to buy a house, send \ntheir kids to college, live a quality of life we have lived because \nthey will start out with a debt and a burden of a government which \nexceeds, in many instances, their ability to pay.\n  We are, under this proposal, heading the Nation into an untenable \nsituation. In the area of deficits, which translates into debt--a \ndeficit is what happens at the end of the year when your bills come in. \nIf you have more bills than you have income, you end up with a deficit. \nThat, then, becomes debt.\n  In the area of deficits, this budget takes us up dramatically in the \nnext 2 years to an all-time high--a number that is hardly even \ncontemplatable--a $1.7 trillion deficit this coming year. That is 28 \npercent of gross national product being spent by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, I am willing to accept this number and not debate it because we \nare in a recession. It is necessary for the Government to step in and \nbe aggressive, and the Government is the last source of liquidity. So \none can argue that this number, although horribly large, is something \nwe will simply have to live with. What one can't accept is what happens \nin the outyears--rather than bringing this deficit down to a reasonable \nnumber, a number which would be sustainable for our children to bear--\nbecause the President is proposing to expand the Government \ndramatically, its size and its cost. He is proposing deficits as far as \nthe eye can see of 3 to 4 percent of gross domestic product.\n  What does that mean, 3 to 4 percent of gross domestic product? Well, \nhistorically, the deficit of the United States over the last 20 years \nhas been 1.9 percent of gross domestic product. It means every year we \nare adding so much more debt than we can afford to our Nation that our \nchildren, again, will have less opportunity to succeed.\n  To put it in numbers terms, historically, the debt of the Federal \nGovernment has been about 40 percent of gross domestic product. In \nthese outyears--ignoring this situation which is driven by the very \nsevere recession--in these outyears, the public debt compared to the \ngross domestic product will stay at about 67 percent of gross domestic \nproduct, not 40 percent, which is sustainable but 67 percent. Those are \nnumbers which, if we were in another part of the world, would be \ndescribed as a Banana Republic because they are not sustainable and \nthey drive us up to a cost which is not affordable. Those are the \nnumbers which are driving the tripling of the national debt in 10 \nyears.\n  One may say, well, where does that all come from, all this expansion \nof debt that is going to be put on our children's backs? It comes, \nquite simply, from spending. This administration has proposed the \nlargest increase in the size of the Federal Government in our history, \na massive shift to the left of the Government.\n  This is a chart which shows the historical spending of the Federal \nGovernment as a percent of GDP. Historically, this line right here \nreflects the mean, which has been somewhere around 20 percent of gross \nnational product. That is a big chunk of the gross national product to \nbe spending on the Federal Government, but that is what we have been \ndoing. With the recession, obviously, it spikes up to 28 percent, but \nthe point is that this administration doesn't plan to bring it down to \nhistorical levels; rather, they intend to keep spending at around 22 to \n23 percent of gross national product. That is not affordable. It is not \nsustainable.\n  Why is it not sustainable? Because they don't increase taxes to that \nlevel. If they did, they would basically be creating a confiscatory \nsituation for young people who are going into the workforce; rather, \nthey simply run up debt to try to cover that difference at a \ncatastrophically fast rate. We have to bring this spending line down if \nwe are going to have a responsible budget.\n  Now, why does this go up so much? Why does this spending level go up \nso much? Well, it goes up so much because essentially they are planning \nto nationalize large segments of the economy; to have the Government \ntake over the responsibility for large segments of the economy. The \nmost specific area they do this in is in educational loans, where today \nwe have what is known as the public-private balance, where some people \nget their loans directly from the Federal Government and some people \nget their loans from the private sector. They are going to end that \npolicy, and they are going to have the Federal Government take over all \nlending. That is the most specific. However, if you look at their \nhealth care policy, they are moving in that direction there too. They \nhave suggested in this budget that we should increase health care \nspending as a downpayment for $634 billion. That is a downpayment. The \nactual number of the increase is closer to $1.2 trillion in new health \ncare spending.\n  What does that really mean? Well, essentially we as a government and \nwe as a nation spend 17 percent of our gross national product on health \ncare. That is much more than any other industrialized nation in the \nworld spends. The next closest nation spends about 12 or 11 percent. So \nit isn't that we are not spending enough on health care in this \ncountry; it is that we don't use it very well--the money. We don't \nallocate it very well, and we don't use it efficiently.\n  What the administration suggests is that we should expand that \nspending in the area of health care by another $1.2 trillion, as they \nmove the Federal Government into the role of basically deciding how \nhealth care should be managed in this country, in a much more direct \nway. That is one of the reasons this spending line stays up so high.\n  At the same time, they are suggesting massive new tax increases--\nmassive new tax increases--the largest tax increases in history. Now, \nthis has been covered with the argument that, oh, this is just going to \ntax the\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nwealthy; the rich among us are going to be the ones who pay these \ntaxes. Well, that is a canard. That is a straw dog. When you start \nincreasing taxes at the rate they are proposed to be increased in this \nbudget--$1.4 trillion of new taxes--you are going to hit everybody. You \nare going to hit everybody pretty hard.\n  There is in this budget proposal something that is euphemistically \ncalled a carbon tax. That is a term of art to cover up what it really \nis. It is a national sales tax on your electrical bill. It is estimated \nby MIT, a fairly objective institution, that this national sales tax on \nyour electrical bill will raise around $300 billion a year. That is \n$300 billion a year that will be added to your electrical bill. The \nadministration says it is $64 billion, but the same program they are \ntalking about when looked at by an objective group at MIT, they \nconcluded the real cost would be $300 billion. Whether it is $64 \nbillion or $300 billion, it is a huge tax that is going to affect every \nAmerican when they get their electrical bill.\n  In addition, they have this tax which they call the wealthy tax. \nPeople making over $250,000, they are essentially going to nationalize \ntheir income and say: If you make more than $250,000 we are going to \nraise your tax rate up to an effective rate of 42 percent. Well, I \nguess if you don't make that type of money, it probably doesn't bother \nyou, but think about the people who are making $250,000. For the most \npart, they are small business people. They run a restaurant. They run a \nsmall software company. They run a small manufacturing firm. They are \nthe people who create jobs in this country. Most small businesses are \nsole proprietorships or subchapter S corporations. The money they make \nis taxed to the individual who runs the small company. Whether it is a \nrestaurant or a software company or a small manufacturer, it is taxed \nto them personally.\n  What do they do with that money? They take it and they invest it in \ntheir small business. Where are jobs created in this Nation? They are \ncreated by small business. This is a tax on small business. Then, of \ncourse, they raise the capital gains rates. They raise the dividend \nrates. Aren't we in a recession? Why would you raise taxes on the \nproductive side of the economy when you are in a recession? Is that \nconstructive to getting out of the recession? No. In fact, the stock \nmarkets are saying exactly that. They are looking at this budget and \nsaying: Wow, this is the largest increase in the Government ever \nproposed, and it is going to be borne by the people who are the \nentrepreneurs and the small business people.\n  So do we really want to invest in America? Do we really want to put \nour money into the effort to try to make this country grow? Second \nthoughts. That is what is happening in the stock market. It is not \nconstructive to economic growth.\n  Tax policy has to be constructed in a way that creates an incentive \nfor people to go out and take risks. It creates an incentive for people \nto be willing to take their money and invest in something that is going \nto create jobs. When it is said to someone we are going to take 40 \ncents of the next dollar they make and throw State and local taxes on \ntop of that--for example, in New York, it would amount to almost 60 \npercent of the next dollar they make--people start to think: Well, why \nshould I invest in something that is a taxable event? Let me invest in \nsomething that is not a taxable event.\n\n  So instead of getting an efficient use of capital, people are running \naround investing their money to try to avoid taxes. As a result, we \ndon't create more jobs; we just create more tax attorneys. Well, maybe \nthat is jobs. I used to be a tax attorney, so I shouldn't pick on tax \nattorneys, but as a practical matter, it is not an efficient way to use \ncapital.\n  We saw over the last 7 years prior to this recession--and granted, \nthis recession has created an aberration for everything that is \neconomic--we had a tax policy which saw the largest increase in \nrevenues for 4 straight years that this country has ever experienced. \nWe saw a tax policy which basically stood on its head the idea that if \nwe maintain a low tax burden in capital gains, we would collect less \ntaxes. In fact, it did just the opposite. We collected much more taxes \nfrom capital gains. In fact, over the last 7 years, because of the tax \npolicy that was in place, the Tax Code became more progressive. The top \n20 percent of income producers in this country ended up paying 85.7 \npercent of the income taxes in the country. That was compared with the \nClinton years when the top 20 percent of income producers in this \ncountry paid 82 percent of the taxes.\n  At the same time, the bottom 40 percent of people receiving income in \nthis country ended up getting twice as much back because they don't pay \nincome taxes and they get a rebate in many instances through the EITC. \nThey ended up getting twice as much back than during the Clinton years. \nSo you actually had in the last 7 years a tax policy that encouraged \ngrowth, encouraged entrepreneurship, encouraged job creation, which was \ngenerating more revenues to the Federal Treasury, and yet being more \nprogressive than during the period of the Clinton years.\n  What the administration has suggested is, we should not only go back \nto the Clinton years, we should do even more by taking an effective \nrate that will even go above the rate of the Clinton years to 42 \npercent, 41 percent. It makes no sense, especially in a time of \nrecession, to basically have that sort of attack on small business and \njob producers in our Nation.\n  So this budget is a statement of policy which is pretty definitive, \nand I don't believe it is very constructive. It is a statement of \npolicy which says we are going to radically expand the spending in this \ncountry. We are going to radically expand the size of Government in \nthis country. We are going to end up after 5 years with Government we \ncan't afford, that is spending more than at any time in our history, \nand that is running up deficits which are going to compound the \nproblems for our children. It is not constructive, in my opinion. I \nthink we can do a lot better, and we can do it this year rather than \nwait.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2993-S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire. As a Member of the Senate, \nthere are many people I look to for wisdom and knowledge, and Judd \nGregg is one of them. In my hometown of Atlanta, GA, there is another \nperson I look to for wisdom and knowledge, and that is my barber, \nTommy.\n  I got a haircut, as you can probably tell, on Saturday. I was at \nTommy's Barbershop on West Paces Ferry Road and Northside Drive in \nAtlanta. While in that barbershop, I talked to a real estate broker, a \nstock broker, a pension fund manager, and a good old, average, everyday \nAmerican retiree trying to figure out how he is going to make it on \nwhat the markets have done to him in the last year or so.\n  It is ironic--and I had no plan to make this speech behind Judd \nGregg--but they talked to me about only two things. The first one was \ndebt because last Saturday was just a week after the announcement of a \n$3.6 trillion budget, a 20-percent increase; an increase in taxes and \nconcern because at a time of economic peril America is bearing more and \nmore and more.\n  The other thing is what I rise to talk about today. We have looked \ninto the mirror to look for the enemy, but we have avoided looking at \nourselves. For a second I wish to talk through regulatory policy. I am \ntalking about both administrations: the end of the Bush administration \nand the beginning of the Obama administration. I think we have been \nmissing the mark. I wish to share some real-life stories about real-\nlife Georgians that indicate where mark-to-market accounting is going \nin the United States of America, the businesses of the United States of \nAmerica, and the people of the United States of America.\n  Some of my colleagues have watched television and watched the AFLAC \nduck commercials. I think they are the best commercials on television. \nI also think AFLAC is one of the finest companies in the United States \nof America. When we consider AFLAC and Dan Amos, the CEO of AFLAC, he \nput in stockholder consent and stockholder advice on his compensation \nand repealed his own golden parachute. All of\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nthose things we all complain about CEOs doing, he did it right. But \nstock has plummeted in AFLAC. Do you know why? Because of the FASB \nrules on mark to market, his core asset base, which is long-term \nassets, held to maturity, to protect against insurance commitments \nAFLAC has made, are now being marked to market, meaning assets worth \nsomething are being marked worth nothing.\n  So the stock has gone down because the evaluators say the footings on \nthe asset side of the ledger sheet aren't looking as good because of \nthe mark to market. Let me explain the best I can what that really \nmeans.\n  Mortgage-backed securities are one investment a lot of life companies \nand other industries bought to put on their asset sheet to offset \nobligations they have off into the future because those securities have \nmaturities corresponding with the maturities of the loans embedded \nwithin them of anywhere from 7 to 30 years. When the subprime market \nstarted failing last year, Merrill Lynch, in a crisis mode last July, \nsold its subprime securities to get rid of them; it financed the sale \nand sold them for 22 cents on the dollar. Under the FASB rules, assets \nworth 70 or 80 or 90 percent were marked down to 22 percent. That \nlowered the asset side of the ledger and made the stability of the \ncompany look--and I underline that word ``look''--worse, when, in fact, \nthose assets, held to maturity, would not be anywhere near the value.\n  Here is a good example of that: Let's just say I bought a mortgage-\nbacked security, a subprime mortgage-backed security, backed 100 \npercent by 30-year mortgage loans made in the State of Nevada--every \none a subprime loan. Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate of any \nState on subprime paper. Seventy percent of those loans in Nevada today \nare paying right on time; 30 percent are in default. Yet, because of \nmark to market, that security is not marked at 70 percent, which it is \nperforming at, but at zero because at a given point in time today you \ncan't sell it. It is being held by the institution as an offsetting \nasset to a liability over a term of maturity.\n  At Tommy's Barber Shop, I ran into a pension fund man and an \ninsurance guy, and they said: Why in the world don't we look for \naccounting on mark to market like we looked at the pension crisis in \n2004?\n  We have short memories in the Senate. In 2004, because of the \ndeclining stock market in 2001 and 2002, there were a number of defined \nbenefit plans in America that underfunded. Because of the accounting \nrules that were being enforced at the time, those institutions were \nasked to write checks to fully fund the pension funds when, in fact, \nnot everybody is going to retire the same day but over a number of \nyears.\n  What did we do in the Congress? With Senators Kennedy, Enzi, myself, \nand others, we passed the Pension Protection and Reform Act. We said: \nIf your pension fund's corpus becomes underfunded, if you cannot meet \nyour obligation, we will let you smooth that investment, or amortize \nit, over 4 to 6 years. In the case of Delta, which was in trouble at \nthe time, they had a $900 million shortfall in their pension fund. But \nbecause of smoothing, instead of having to put $900 million in in 1 \nyear, they did $150 million over 6 years. Delta is the most profitable \nairline in the United States today. They would not exist today had it \nnot been for the smoothing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in conclusion, I hope everyone will visit \ntheir ``Tommy's Barber Shop'' and look at what we are doing that may \nhave the unintended consequences of exacerbating the economic problem \nfor the average American today and for Tommy the barber.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S2994-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have seen the numbers. Unemployment \nis at a 25-year high. Millions are worried about holding on to their \njobs and their homes. With every passing day, Americans are waiting for \nthe administration to offer its plan to fix the banking crisis that \ncontinues to paralyze our economy. Every day, it seems, the \nadministration officials are unveiling one new plan after another on \neverything from education to health care. Meanwhile, the details of a \nbanking plan to address our main problem have yet to emerge.\n  We need reforms in health care and education and in many other areas. \nBut Americans want the administration to fix the economy first. \nUnfortunately, the budget avoids the issue entirely. It simply assumes \nthis enormously complex problem will be fixed, and then it proposes \nmassive taxes, spending, and borrowing to finance a massive expansion \nof Government. It assumes the best of times, and, as millions of \nAmericans will attest, these are not the best of times.\n  Over the next few weeks, the Senate will debate the details of this \nbudget. One thing is already certain: It spends too much, it taxes too \nmuch, and it borrows too much. This budget would be a stretch in boom \ntimes. In a time of hardship and uncertainty, it is exactly the wrong \napproach. The budget's $3.6 trillion price tag comes on top of a \nhousing plan that went into effect last week that could cost a quarter \nof a trillion dollars, a financial bailout that could cost another $1 \ntrillion to $2 trillion, and a stimulus bill that will cost, with \ninterest, more than a trillion dollars. Some are now talking about yet \nanother stimulus. The national debt is more than $10 trillion, and \nyesterday we passed a $410 billion Government spending bill that \nrepresented an increase in Government spending over last year of twice \nthe rate of inflation. In just 50 days, Congress has voted to spend \nabout $1.2 trillion between the stimulus and the omnibus. To put that \ninto perspective, that is about $24 billion a day or about $1 billion \nan hour--most of it, of course, borrowed. There is simply no question \nthat Government spending has spun out of control.\n  Given all this spending and debt, the cost of the budget might not \nseem like much to some people. But this is precisely the problem. To \nmost people, it seems that lawmakers in Washington have lost the \nperspective of the taxpayer. It is long past time we started to think \nabout the long-term sustainability of our economy, about creating jobs \nand opportunity for future generations. That will require hard choices. \nThe omnibus bill avoided every one, and, unfortunately, so does the \nbudget.\n  Stuart Taylor of the National Journal recently praised the President \nin two consecutive columns. Yet he was shocked by the President's \nbudget. Here is what Taylor said about the budget:\n\n       ``. . . Not to deny that the liberal wish list in Obama's \n     staggering $3.6 trillion budget would be wonderful if we had \n     limitless resources,'' Mr. Taylor wrote. ``But in the real \n     world, it could put vast areas of the economy under permanent \n     government mismanagement, kill millions of jobs, drive \n     investors and employers overseas, and bankrupt the nation.''\n\n  There is no question, in the midst of an economic crisis, this budget \nsimply spends far too much. In order to pay for all this spending, the \nbudget anticipates a number of rosy scenarios. It doesn't explain how \nthe economic recovery will come about, it simply assumes that it will. \nIt projects sustained growth beginning this year and continuing to grow \n3.2 percent in 2010.\n  Let me say that again. It projects sustained growth beginning this \nyear and continuing to grow 3.2 percent in 2010, 4 percent in 2011, and \n4.6 percent in 2012. While we all hope to soon return to this growth, \nwe cannot promise the growth we hope to have, especially when this \ngrowth is far from likely, particularly given a host of new policy \nproposals in the budget itself that are certain to tamp down growth \neven more. There is simply no question that this budget spends too \nmuch.\n  But even if this growth does occur, it would not be enough to support \nthe\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nspending proposals. That is why the budget calls for a massive tax \nhike. In fact, this budget calls for the largest tax increase in \nhistory, including a new energy tax that will be charged to every \nsingle American who turns on a light switch, drives a car, or buys \ngroceries. Unless you are living in a cave, this new energy tax will \nhit you like a hammer.\n  During the campaign, the President said his plan for an energy tax \nwill ``cause utility rates to skyrocket.'' He was right. The new energy \ntax will cost every American household. I can't imagine how increasing \nthe average American's annual tax bill will lift us out of the worst \nrecession in decades.\n\n  There is more. A new tax related to charitable giving would punish \nthe very organizations Americans depend on more and more during times \nof distress. One study suggests that the President's new tax on \ncharitable giving could cost U.S. charities and educational \ninstitutions up to $9 billion a year--money that will presumably be \nredirected to the 250,000 new Government workers the budget is expected \nto create. There is no question that this budget taxes too much.\n  Remarkably, the largest tax increase in history and a new energy tax \nstill aren't enough to pay for all the programs this budget creates. To \npay for everything else, we will have to borrow--borrow a lot. This \nbudget calls for the highest level of borrowing ever.\n  Now, if there is one thing Americans have learned the hard way over \nthe past several months, it is that spending more than you can afford \nhas serious, sometimes tragic, consequences. Yet Government doesn't \nseem ready to face that reality--not when it is spending other people's \nmoney and not when it is borrowing from others to fund its policy \ndreams.\n  It is not fair to load future generations with trillions and \ntrillions of dollars in debt at a moment when the economy is \ncontracting, millions are losing jobs, and millions more are worried \nabout losing homes. It is time the Government realized that it is a \nsteward of the people's money, not the other way around, and that it \nhas a responsibility not only to use tax dollars wisely but to make \nsure the institutions of Government are sustainable for generations to \ncome.\n  I don't know anybody who would borrow money from people thousands of \nmiles away for things they don't even need. Yet this is precisely what \nour Government is doing every single day by asking countries such as \nSaudi Arabia, Japan, and China to finance a colossal budget in the \nmidst of an economic crisis.\n  The administration has said it intends to be bold, and I have no \ndoubt this budget reflects their honest attempt to implement what they \nbelieve to be the best prescription for success. We appreciate that \neffort. We simply see it differently. A $3.6 trillion budget that \nspends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much in a time of \neconomic hardship may be bold, but the question is, Is it wise? Most of \nthe people who have taken the time to study this budget have concluded \nit is not wise. Republicans will spend the next few weeks explaining \nwhy to the American people.\n  Americans want serious reforms. But in the midst of a deepening \nrecession, they are looking at all this spending, taxing, and \nborrowing, and they are wondering whether, for the first time in our \nNation's history, we are actually giving up on the notion that if we \nwork hard, our children will live better lives and have greater \nopportunities than ourselves.\n  Americans are looking at this spending, taxing, and borrowing, and \nthey are wondering whether we are reversing the order--whether we are \nbeginning to say with our actions that we want everything now--and \nputting off the hard choices, once again, for future generations to \nmake. That would be a most important question in this upcoming budget \ndebate.\n  It is important, once again, to sum up the core problem with the \nbudget we will be voting on in a few weeks: It spends too much, taxes \ntoo much, and it borrows too much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S2995-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POLITICAL EXPRESSION WITHOUT FEAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to address the so-called card \ncheck legislation which was introduced in both the House and Senate \nyesterday.\n  As Americans, we expect to be able to vote on everything from high \nschool class president to President of the United States in private. \nWorkers expect the same right in union elections. This legislation goes \nagainst that fundamental right of political expression without fear of \ncoercion.\n  We have had the secret ballot in this country for 100 years--130 \nyears, at least--and it was common even before then. We have said to \nother countries around the world: If you want to have a democracy, you \nhave to have a secret ballot. And yet this measure, to put it simply, \nwould be better called the ``Employee No Choice Act.'' It is totally \nundemocratic. To approve it would be to subvert the right to bargain \nfreely over working terms and conditions. It would strip members of a \nnewly organized union of their right to accept or reject a contract.\n  In addition, this bill ushers in a new scheme of penalties which are \nantiworker and which apply only to employers and not to unions. Even \nthough Americans have regarded secret ballot elections as a fundamental \nright--as I indicated earlier, for more than a century--some Democrats \nseem determined to strip that right away from American workers.\n  If this were not bad enough, a study released last week by economist \nDr. Anne Layne-Farrar showed that if enacted, card check legislation \ncould cost 600,000 American jobs--600,000 American jobs potentially \nlost. At a time when all of us are looking to stimulate the economy and \nput Americans back to work, we are threatening to undermine those \nefforts with this job-killing bill.\n  Republicans will oppose any legislation which attempts to undermine \njob creation, and we will oppose the effort to take away a worker's \nright to a secret ballot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S2995-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2995-S3019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NOMINATION OF DAVID W. OGDEN TO BE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David W. \nOgden, of Virginia, to be Deputy Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 4:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am opening this debate in my capacity not \nonly as a Senator from Vermont but as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  We are here today to consider President Obama's nomination of David \nOgden to be Deputy Attorney General, the number two position at the \nDepartment of Justice. This is a picture, incidentally, of David Ogden. \nI had hoped we could vote on this nomination soon--although apparently, \nbecause of objections on the other side, we will not be able to vote \nuntil tomorrow. This is unfortunate. Every day we delay the appointment \nof the Deputy Attorney General is a day we are not enhancing the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  In this case, we have a nominee who I had hoped to have confirmed \nweeks ago. Mr. Ogden is a highly qualified nominee who has chosen to \nleave a very successful career in private practice--one I might say \nparenthetically pays considerably more than the Department of Justice \ndoes--to return to the Department, where he served with great \ndistinction. His path in many ways reflects that of the Attorney \nGeneral, Eric Holder, who, of course, also was a highly successful and \nrespected partner in one of the major law firms in Washington. And he \nleft to become Attorney General of the United States at the request of \nPresident Obama to serve his Nation. Mr. Ogden is doing the same thing.\n  Interestingly enough, once Mr. Ogden's nomination was announced, the \nletters of support started to come\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nin from leading law enforcement organizations across the country. Let \nme put a few of these up on this chart. As you can see, Mr. Ogden's \nnomination received support from leading law enforcement organizations; \nchildren's advocates; civil rights organizations; and former Government \nofficials from both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  Indeed, Larry Thompson, the former Deputy Attorney General under \nPresident George W. Bush, a highly respected former public official, \nhas endorsed David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs of America, an organization I have spent a \nlot of time with and one I highly respect. This organization provides \nalternative programs and a great mentoring system for children in many \ncities to keep them out of trouble. And this fine organization has \nendorsed David Ogden.\n  A dozen retired military officers who serve as Judge Advocates \nGeneral have endorsed Mr. Ogden's nomination.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police and the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, two major law enforcement organizations, have \nendorsed him.\n  The Major Cities Chiefs Association have endorsed him.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, another \norganization I have worked a great deal with, and one that has done \nsuch wonderful things to help in the case of missing and exploited \nchildren, has also endorsed him.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations has endorsed David \nOgden.\n  The National District Attorneys Association has endorsed him, which I \nwas particularly pleased to see. I once served as vice president of the \nNational District Attorneys Association. As an aside, I should note \nthat I gave up the honor and glory of becoming president of the \nNational District Attorneys Association for the anonymity of the \nSenate.\n  The National Narcotics Officers' Associations' Coalition has endorsed \nDavid Ogden.\n  The National Sheriffs' Association has endorsed David Ogden.\n  The Police Executive Research Forum has endorsed David Ogden.\n  The National Center for Victims of Crime has endorsed David Ogden.\n  Why have they endorsed him? Because he is an immensely qualified \nnominee, and he has the obvious priorities that we want in a Deputy \nAttorney General. His priorities will be the safety and security of the \nAmerican people and to reinvigorate the traditional work of the Justice \nDepartment in protecting the rights of all Americans. That is why he \nwill be a critical asset to the Attorney General. He will help us \nremember it is the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, and it \nis the Department of Justice for all Americans.\n  With all of these endorsements, including all of the major law \nenforcement groups endorsing him, and all the endorsements from both \nRepublicans and Democrats, what is astonishing for all these law \nenforcement organizations wanting him there is that Republicans \nthreatened to filibuster this nomination. They refused to agree to this \ndebate and a vote on the nomination, and they required the majority \nleader to file a cloture motion, which he did on Monday. For more than \na week we were told that Republicans would not agree to a debate and \nvote and would insist on filibustering this nomination.\n  It is amazing. I don't know if Republicans are aware of what is going \non in this country--the rising crime rates which began rising in the \nlast year or so and the critical nature working families are facing. \nAnd yet they want to filibuster a nominee, one of the best I have seen \nfor this position in my 35 years in the Senate.\n  I noted that development and the threat of a filibuster at a \nJudiciary Committee business meeting last Thursday, after a week of \nfruitless efforts to try to move this nomination forward by agreement \nand obviate the need for a filibuster. I noted my disappointment that, \ndespite the bipartisan majority vote in favor of the nomination by \nRepublicans and Democrats on the committee, despite the support from \nlaw enforcement groups, despite the support from children's advocates, \nand despite the support from former Government officials for Republican \nand Democratic administrations, we have been stalled in our ability to \nmove forward to consider this nomination. And, of course, the Justice \nDepartment, which is there to represent all Americans--Republicans and \nDemocrats, Independents, and everybody--is left without a deputy for \nanother week.\n\n  Quite frankly, I found the news of an imminent Republican filibuster \nincomprehensible. I could not think of any precedent for this during my \n35 years in the Senate. A bipartisan majority--14 to 5--voted to report \nthis nomination from the Judiciary Committee to the Senate. The ranking \nRepublican member of the committee, Senator Specter, voted to support \nthis nomination. The assistant Senate Republican leader, Senator Kyl, \nand the senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, voted in favor \nof Mr. Ogden. And yet, in spite of this bipartisan support, someone or \na group of Senators on the Republican side of the aisle were intent on \nfilibustering this nominee to stop us from having a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral who might actually be there to help fight crime in America.\n  Why there was this attempt of filibustering President Obama's \nnomination for Deputy Attorney General of the United States, and \ndepriving law enforcement in this country of his support, I cannot not \nunderstand.\n  Two weeks ago, we debated and voted on the nomination in the \nJudiciary Committee. Those who opposed the nomination had the \nopportunity to explain their negative vote. I urge all Senators to \nreject these false and scurrilous attacks that have been made against \nMr. Ogden. I also held out hope that they would reject applying an \nobvious double standard when it comes to President Obama's nominees. \nRemember, these are the same people who voted unanimously for one of \nthe worst attorneys general in this Nation's history, former Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales.\n  I am glad some semblance of common sense has finally prevailed on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. I guess somebody looked at the facts and \nsaid: ``This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and there is no way \nof justifying this to Americans, other than to the most partisan of \nAmericans,'' and they reversed their position. They now say they will \nnot filibuster this nomination.\n  It was disturbing to see the President's nomination of Mr. Ogden to \nthis critical national security post being held up this long by Senate \nRepublicans apparently on some kind of a partisan whim.\n  I voted for all four of the nominees that the Senate confirmed and \nPresident Bush nominated to serve as the Deputy Attorney General during \nthe course of his Presidency. In fact, each of the four was confirmed \nby voice vote. Not a single Democratic Senator voted against them and \nsome may not have been the people we would have chosen had it been a \nDemocratic President. But we respected the fact the American people \nelected a Republican President and he deserved a certain amount of \nleeway in picking his nominees.\n  Of course, we heard the same preaching from the Republican side. \nSuddenly their position has now changed since the American people, by a \nlandslide, elected a Democratic President. What Republicans are \nessentially saying is President Obama does not get the same kind of \ncredit that President Bush did. That amounts to a double standard, \nespecially after every Republican Senator supported each of President \nBush's nominees, as they did the nomination of Alberto Gonzales.\n  Today, however, there will be no more secret and anonymous Republican \nholds. Any effort to oppose the President's nominees--executive or \njudicial--will have to withstand public scrutiny. There can be no more \nanonymous holds. We can turn at last to consideration of President \nObama's nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General, the \nNo. 2 position at the Department.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about David Ogden. As a former high-\nranking official at both the Defense Department and the Justice \nDepartment, he is the kind of serious lawyer and experienced Government \nservant who understands the special role the Department of Justice must \nfulfill in our democracy. It is no surprise that his\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nnomination has received strong support from leading law enforcement \norganizations, children's advocates, civil rights organizations, and \nformer Government officials from Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  The confirmation of Mr. Ogden to this critical national security post \nshould not be further delayed. The Deputy Attorney General is too \nimportant a position to be made into a partisan talking point for \nspecial interest politics.\n\n  Now, I understand some people want to do fundraising as they talk \nabout their ability to block nominations of President Obama. I wonder \nif they know how critical the situation is in this country. This is not \nthe time for partisan political games. This is a time where all of us \nhave a stake in the country getting back on track and we ought to be \nworking to do that. Stop the partisan games. The Deputy Attorney \nGeneral is needed to manage the Justice Department with its many \ndivisions, sections, and offices and tens of thousands of employees. As \nDeputy Attorney General, Mr. Ogden would be responsible for the day-to-\nday management of the Justice Department, including the Department's \ncritical role of keeping our Nation safe from the threat of terrorism.\n  I want to thank Mark Filip, the most recent Deputy Attorney General \nand a Republican. Judge Filip came from Chicago last year motivated by \npublic service. He had a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge where \nhe served with distinction as a conservative Republican. He gave up his \nlifetime appointment after the scandals of the Gonzalez Justice \nDepartment, where not only did the Attorney General resign but \nvirtually everybody at the top echelon of the Department of Justice \nresigned because of the outrageous scandals at that time. I urged his \nfast and complete confirmation and he was confirmed just over one year \nago, unanimously, by voice vote.\n  Now, are Judge Filip and I different politically? Yes, of course we \nare. We differ in many areas. Yet, I saw a man dedicated to public \nservice. He gave up his dream of a lifetime position on the Federal \nbench. He saw the scandals of the former Attorney General and all the \npeople who had to be replaced by President Bush because of the \nscandalous conduct, and he came in for the good of the country to help \nright it. I admire him for that. I was chairman of the committee that \nunanimously endorsed his nomination. As chairman of the committee, I \ncame to the floor of the Senate and urged his support.\n  On February 4, after 11 months of dedicated and commendable service \nto us all he left the Justice Department. It is time, over a month \nlater, that his replacement be confirmed by the Senate.\n  The Senate's quick consideration of Mr. Filip's nomination was \nreflective of how Senate Democrats approached the confirmations of \nnominees for this critical position. President Bush's first nominee to \nserve as Deputy Attorney General, Larry Thompson, received similar \ntreatment. At the beginning of a new President's term, it is common \npractice to expedite consideration of Cabinet and high level nominees. \nI remember that nomination very well. I was the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee at that time. His hearing was just 2 weeks after his \nnomination. He was reported by the Judiciary Committee unanimously. \nEvery Democratic Senator voted in favor of reporting his nomination. \nAnd he was confirmed that same day by voice vote by the Senate. No \nshenanigans. No partisanship. No posturing for special interests.\n  His replacement was James Comey. He, like Mr. Ogden, was a veteran of \nthe Department of Justice. The Democratic Senators in the Senate \nminority did not filibuster, obstruct or delay that nomination. We knew \nhow important it was. We cooperated in a hearing less than 2 weeks \nafter he was nominated. He was reported from the committee unanimously \nin a 19-0 vote, and he was confirmed by the Senate in voice vote.\n  Even when President Bush nominated a more contentious choice, a \nnominee with a partisan political background, Senate Democrats did not \nfilibuster. Paul McNulty was confirmed to serve as the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral in 2006 in a voice vote by the Senate. While there were \nconcerns, there was no filibuster. As it turned out, Mr. McNulty \nresigned in the wake of the U.S. attorney firing scandal, along with \nAttorney General Gonzales and so many others in leadership positions at \nthe Department of Justice.\n  I voted for all four of the nominees that the Senate confirmed and \nPresident Bush appointed to serve as the Deputy Attorney General during \nthe course of his presidency. In fact, each of the four was confirmed \nby voice vote. Not a single Democratic Senator voted against them. And, \nof course, every Republican Senator supported each of those nominees as \nthey did the nomination of Alberto Gonzales and the other nominations \nof President Bush to high ranking positions at the Justice Department.\n  I bring up this history to say let us stop playing partisan games. \nMr. Ogden's nomination to be Deputy Attorney General, a major law \nenforcement position, is supported by Republicans and Democrats, at a \ntime when we need the best in our law enforcement in this country.\n  The Justice Department is without a confirmed deputy at a time when \nwe face great threats and challenges. Indeed, one of the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission was that after \nPresidential transitions, nominees for national security appointments, \nsuch as Mr. Ogden, be accelerated. In particular, the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended:\n\n       A president-elect should submit the nominations of the \n     entire new national security team, through the level of \n     undersecretary of cabinet departments, not later than January \n     20.\n\n  The commission also recommended that the Senate:\n\n     should adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to \n     confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days \n     of their submission.\n\n  President Obama did his part when he designated Mr. Ogden to be the \nDeputy Attorney General on January 5, more than 2 months ago. We now \nare at March 11. It is time for the Senate to act. Stop the partisan \ngames, stop the holding up, stop the holds and the threats of \nfilibusters and all the rest. The problems and threats confronting the \ncountry are too serious to continue to delay and to play partisan \ngames, no matter which fundraising letter somebody wants to send out. \nForget the fundraising letters for a moment; let us deal with the needs \nof our Nation.\n  Scurrilous attacks against Mr. Ogden have been launched by some on \nthe extreme right. David Ogden is a good lawyer and a good man. He is a \nhusband and a father. The chants that David Ogden is somehow a \npedophile and a pornographer are not only false, they are so wrong. \nSenators know better than that. Forget the fundraising letters, let us \ntalk about a decent family man, an exceptional lawyer. Let us talk \nabout somebody who answered every question at his confirmation hearing, \nnot only about those he represented legally but about his personal \nviews.\n  I questioned Mr. Ogden at his hearing and he gave his commitment to \nvigorously enforce Federal law, regardless of the positions he may have \ntaken on behalf of his clients in private practice. I asked him if he \nhad the right experience to be Deputy Attorney General and he pointed \nout his extensive experience managing criminal matters at the \nDepartment and in private practice. I asked him to thoroughly review \nthe practice of prosecutors investigating and filing law suits on the \neve of elections, and he said he would. I asked him to work with me on \na mortgage and financial fraud law, and he was agreeable. I asked about \nhis experience in the type of national security matters that have \nbecome more than ever before central to the mission of the Justice \nDepartment, and he highlighted his extensive national security \nexperience and lessons he learned as General Counsel for the Department \nof Defense. On all these matters he was candid and reassuring.\n  That is why Mr. Ogden's nomination has received dozens of letters of \nsupport, including strong endorsements from Republican and Democratic \nformer public officials and high-ranking veterans of the Justice \nDepartment, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and from nearly every \nmajor law enforcement organization.\n\n  As one who began his public career in law enforcement, I would not \nstand\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nhere and endorse somebody for such a major law enforcement position if \nI did not feel it was a person who should do this. Larry Thompson, a \nformer Deputy Attorney General himself, and somebody I worked with on \nlaw enforcement matters when he was here as a Republican nominee, \ndescribed Mr. Ogden as\n\n       A brilliant and thoughtful lawyer who has the complete \n     confidence and respect of career attorneys at Main Justice. \n     David will be a superb Deputy Attorney General.\n\n  Chuck Canterbury, who is the national president of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, wrote that Mr. Ogden\n\n       . . . possesses the leadership and experience the Justice \n     Department will need to meet the challenges which lay before \n     us.\n\n  A dozen retired military officers who served as judge advocates \ngeneral have endorsed Mr. Odgen's nomination, calling him\n\n       . . . a person of wisdom, fairness, and integrity, a public \n     servant vigilant to protect the national security of the \n     United States, and a civilian official who values the \n     perspective of uniformed lawyers in matters within their \n     particular expertise.\n\n  I know something about law enforcement, not only from my past career \nbut the 35 years I have served in this body, most of that time on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee dealing with law enforcement matters. I know \nthat David Ogden is an immensely qualified nominee whose priorities \nwould be the safety and security of the American people, but also to \nreinvigorate the traditional work of the Justice Department in \nprotecting the rights of Americans--all Americans. We do not want to go \nback to the scandalous time of a former Attorney General, where the \nrights of only certain Americans were protected, and political and \npartisan decisions were made about whose rights would be protected. \nThis is the Department of Justice. It is the Deputy Attorney General of \nthe United States. It is not the Deputy Attorney General of the \nRepublican Party or the Democratic Party, but the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral for all of us. That is why he is going to be a critical asset \nto the Attorney General.\n  I urge all Senators to support him. Give the same kind of support to \nMr. Ogden as Democrats did to Judge Filip when he came in to try to \nclean up the mess created by a former Attorney General.\n  One of the joys of being chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nare the people I get to serve with. Over the years, I have served with \nnumerous Senators, including the father of one of our current Senators. \nFor a lawyer, it is an intellectually exhilarating committee to serve \non, but again because of some of the great people who serve here.\n  The Senator from Delaware is the newest member of the committee \nbecause the former Senator from Delaware--whom I served with for well \nover 30 years on that committee. Part of the time he was chairman and \npart of the time he was ranking member; part of the time I was chairman \nand part of the time he was ranking member--has left the Senate to be \ninvolved in the Senate now only as the presiding officer, because he \nwent on to become Vice President of the United States. His replacement, \nSenator Kaufman of Delaware, moved into that seat on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee as though he had served there for all those \ndecades. In a way, he did, as a key person working for former Senator \nBiden.\n  I have often joked that Senators are merely constitutional \nimpediments or constitutional necessities to the staff, who do all the \nwork. Now we have somebody who has both the expertise of having been \none of the finest staff people I have ever served with and now one of \nthe best Senators I have served with, and a great addition to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  So as not to embarrass him further, I will yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, people have asked me what it is like to \nbe a Senator as opposed to being chief of staff, and one of the great \nthings is getting to work with a chairman such as Chairman Leahy on the \nJudiciary Committee; someone who knows what he is about, knows the \nSenate, and is a former prosecutor. We are truly fortunate to have him \nas chair and also to have a truly great staff on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, led by Bruce Cohen. So it is a great and a genuine pleasure. \nPleasure is used a lot of times on the floor. Sometimes it is not too \npleasurable. But this is truly pleasurable, to work with the chairman \nand the staff of the Judiciary Committee, but especially the chairman. \nSo I thank the chairman for his kind remarks.\n  I do agree with so much of what he has to say about David Ogden for \nDeputy Attorney General. I, along with him, am deeply disappointed that \nthe nomination of David Ogden for Deputy Attorney General has been so \nneedlessly delayed. This has real consequences for the administration \nof law in our country during a challenging time. Depriving the \nDepartment of Justice of senior leadership at this critical juncture is \nmuch more than unfortunate.\n  As we saw from his confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee \nmore than a month ago, David Ogden has excellent academic credentials \nand broad experience in law and government. He fully understands the \nspecial role of the Department of Justice and is deeply committed to \nthe rule of law. He has broad support from lawyers of all political and \njudicial philosophies.\n  President Obama designated Mr. Ogden be Deputy Attorney General on \nJanuary 5, which seems like an eternity ago--over 2 months ago. We held \nhis confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee over a month ago \nand, on February 26, after thorough consideration, a bipartisan \nmajority of the committee, 14 to 5, voted to report his nomination. The \nranking member, the Senate minority whip and the well-respected senior \nSenator from South Carolina, voted in favor of his nomination.\n\n  Despite that bipartisan vote and broad support from law enforcement \ngroups, children's advocates, civil rights organizations, former \nDemocratic and Republican officials, his nomination has faced \nunwarranted delay. This delay is unfortunate in itself, particularly \nwhen the nominee has impeccable credentials and broad support. However, \nas important, this delay has come at a critical time for the Department \nof Justice. Without a Deputy Attorney General, the Department is forced \nto deal with some of the most important issues facing this Nation with \none hand tied behind its back.\n  The Deputy Attorney General holds the No. 2 position at the \nDepartment of Justice and, as we all know, is responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the Department, including critical national \nsecurity responsibilities. The Deputy Attorney General, for example, \nsigns FISA applications. These are essential to ensuring that our \nintelligence services get the information they need to protect us from \nterrorism and other national security threats. The Deputy Attorney \nGeneral will also play an important role in overseeing the Guantanamo \nBay detainee review, to make sure we assess each of the remaining \ndetainees and make sure they are safely and appropriately transferred--\nI know an issue that everyone in this body shares a concern about.\n  One of the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission was that \nafter Presidential transitions, nominations for national security \nappointments, such as Mr. Ogden's, be accelerated. The delay we are \nseeing now, to put it mildly, is not helping those who are sworn to \nprotect our country. The Deputy Attorney General manages the criminal \ndivision of the FBI, which helps keep Americans safe, not only from \nviolent crime but also from financial fraud. In the aftermath of the \nfinancial fraud meltdown that has thrown the American economy into a \nserious recession, we must ensure that lawbreakers will be identified \nand prosecuted for financial fraud. Punishing complex financial crimes \nand deterring future fraud are vital in restoring confidence in our \ndecimated financial markets. How can people be expected to go back in \nthe market again when they do not know or cannot have confidence that \nthe people who perpetrated these crimes are not still there but are in \njail? This is important. As we know in dealing with crime, the sooner \nyou deal with it after the crime happens the better your chance of \ncatching the people involved. Getting the Deputy Attorney General \ninvolved as soon as possible is essential for our financial well-being.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n  The Deputy Attorney General also oversees efforts to fight waste and \ncorruption in Federal programs by means of the False Claims Act. As we \nexpend vast sums in two wars and work to stimulate the economic \nrecovery, we must do everything we can to make sure the taxpayer \ndollars are well spent. Along the same line, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral oversees the distribution of billions of dollars in economic \nrecovery funds in support of critical State and local law enforcement \ninitiatives. Everyone agrees that to fulfill the promise of the \neconomic recovery package, we need to get the funds out the door \nquickly. Again, depriving the Department of Justice of senior \nleadership at this critical time is bad policy.\n  The American people need a Deputy Attorney General in place now, to \nmeet all these critical efforts. The problems and threats confronting \nthe country are too serious to delay.\n  We know David Ogden is extraordinarily well qualified. We know the \nJudiciary Committee fully vetted his background, experience and \njudgment and reported out his nomination with a bipartisan majority. We \nknow the Attorney General needs his second in command as well as other \nmembers of his leadership team in place and working as soon as \npossible. We know further delay in this crucial nomination is \ninexcusable.\n  I hope on this nomination, and going forward, we do better.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask the time \nbe charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset in addressing the Chair, \nmay I note that it is my distinguished colleague, Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania. Nice to see you acting as Vice President, Senator Casey.\n  May I just say that in the 2 years plus that you have been here, I \nhave admired your work and found it very gratifying to be your \ncolleague in promoting the interests of our State and our Nation.\n  I have sought recognition to comment on the nomination of David W. \nOgden to be Deputy Attorney General. In reviewing the pending \nnomination, I have noted Mr. Ogden's academic and professional \nqualifications. I have also noted certain objections that have been \nraised by a number of organizations. As a matter of fact, some 11,000 \ncontacts in opposition to the nomination have been received by our \nJudiciary Committee offices.\n  As to Mr. Ogden's background, his resume, his education, and his \nprofessional qualifications--he received his undergraduate degree from \nthe University of Pennsylvania in 1976, Phi Beta Kappa, and his law \ndegree from Harvard, magna cum laude, where he was an editor of the Law \nReview.\n  I know it is difficult to get a Phi Beta Kappa key at the University \nof Pennsylvania. I know that being on the Law Review at a school like \nHarvard is an accomplishment. He then clerked for Judge Sofaer on the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York. I \ncame to know Judge Sofaer when he was counsel to the New York \nDepartment of State. I have a very high regard for him.\n  Mr. Ogden then clerked for Harry Blackmun on the Supreme Court. That \nis a distinguished achievement. Then he worked for Ennis Friedman \nBersoff & Ewing and became a partner there. Then he was a partner at \nJenner & Block and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University \nLaw Center from 1992 to 1995. He then had a string of prestigious \npositions in the Department of Justice: Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, Counselor to the Attorney General, Chief of Staff to the \nAttorney General, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nDivision, and Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division--all \nduring the administration of President Clinton.\n\n  We have seen quite a series of nominees come forward when the current \nadministration selects people from a prior administration. There have \nbeen quite a few people who served in President Reagan's administration \nwho later served in President George H.W. Bush's administration. Then \nsome of those individuals served in the administration of President \nGeorge W. Bush. Similarly, individuals from President Carter's \nadministration came back with President Clinton, and the people from \nPresident Clinton are now serving in President Obama's administration. \nSo it is a usual occurrence.\n  Contrasted to the resume Mr. Ogden has, I have noted the objections \nraised by the Family Research Council headed by Mr. Tony Perkins, who \nwrote the committee expressing his concerns about Mr. Ogden's \nnomination because, as Mr. Perkins puts it:\n\n       Mr. Ogden has built a career on representing views and \n     companies that most Americans find repulsive . . . Mr. Ogden \n     has also profited from representing pornographers and in \n     attacking legislation designed to ban child pornography.\n\n  It was also noted by those opposing his nomination that a brief filed \nby Mr. Ogden in Planned Parenthood v. Casey argued that ``women who \nhave had abortions suffer no detrimental consequences and instead \nshould feel `relief and happiness' after aborting a child.'' Fidelis, a \nCatholic-based organization, Concerned Women of America, Eagle Forum, \nand the Alliance Defense Fund have also written the committee in \nopposition to Mr. Ogden's nomination based on similar concerns; \nspecifically, his representation of several entities in the pornography \nindustry and organizations that oppose restrictions on abortions.\n  As I noted earlier, the committee has received an unprecedented \nnumber of opposition phone calls and letters for a Department of \nJustice nominee. In total, the committee has received over 11,000 \ncontacts in opposition to the nomination.\n  The objections raised call into focus the issue as to whether an \nattorney ought to be judged on the basis of arguments he has made in \nthe representation of a client. I believe it is accurate to say that \nthe prevailing view is not to bind someone to those arguments. I note \nan article published by David Rivkin and Lee Casey, who served in the \nJustice Department under President Reagan and President George H.W. \nBush, that advances the thesis that a lawyer is not necessarily \nexpressing his own views when he represents a client. They point out \nhow Chief Justice Roberts' nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was vociferously opposed \nby pro-choice groups based upon briefs he had filed when he served as \nDeputy Solicitor General under President George H.W. Bush and the \narguments for restrictions of abortion rights contained in those \nbriefs. I recollect that NARAL had a commercial opposing then-Judge \nRoberts. I spoke out at that time on the concern I had about their \ninference that those were necessarily his own views. As I recollect, \nNARAL withdrew the commercial.\n  The article by Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Casey notes the objections of the \nFamily Research Council, Focus on the Family, and Concerned Women for \nAmerica, and comes to the conclusion that a persons's representation of \na client does not necessarily state what a person's views are on an \nissue.\n  I further note that Mr. Ogden has been endorsed by very prominent \npeople from Republican administrations: Deputy Attorney General Larry \nThompson, former Assistant Attorney General Peter Keisler, former \nAssistant Attorney General Rachel Brand, and former Acting Assistant \nAttorney General Daniel Levin.\n  Professor of law Orin Kerr at George Washington University Law School \nnoted that he disagreed with arguments that Mr. Ogden had made, but \ndespite his disagreement with Mr. Ogden's arguments, he believed those \narguments should not be held against him.\n  In the consideration of nominees who are now pending before the \nJudiciary Committee, we are taking a very close look at all of them. I \nthink it appropriate to note at this point that the nomination of \nHarvard Law School dean Elena Kagan is being analyzed very carefully. \nWithout going into great detail at this time because her nomination, \nwhich has been voted out of committee, will be on the floor at a later \ndate, I and others voted to pass\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\non Ms. Kagan because we are not satisfied with answers to questions \nthat she has given.\n  I ask unanimous consent to put in the Record a letter that I wrote to \nDean Kagan, February 25, 2009, and her reply to me on March 2, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2009.\n     Dean Elena Kagan,\n     Harvard Law School,\n     Cambridge, MA.\n       Dear Dean Kagan: I write to express my dissatisfaction with \n     many of the answers you provided to the Committee in response \n     to my written questions following your confirmation hearing. \n     I believe these answers are inadequate for confirmation \n     purposes.\n       In a 1995 review of a book entitled The Confirmation Mess, \n     you made a compelling case for senatorial inquiry into a \n     nominee's judicial philosophy and her views on specific \n     issues. You stated, ``when the Senate ceases to engage \n     nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the \n     confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, \n     and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly \n     evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public.'' \n     You further asserted that the Senate's inquiry into the views \n     of executive nominees, as compared to Supreme Court nominees, \n     should be even more thorough, stating, ``the Senate ought to \n     inquire into the views and policies of nominees to the \n     executive branch, for whom `independence' is no virtue.'' I \n     agree with the foregoing assessment, and, therefore, am \n     puzzled by your responses, which do not provide clear answers \n     concerning important constitutional and legal issues.\n       For example, in response to several questions related to \n     the constitutionality of the imposition of the death penalty, \n     you offer only the following: ``I do not think it comports \n     with the responsibilities and role of the Solicitor General \n     for me to say whether I view particular decisions as wrongly \n     decided or whether I agree with criticisms of those \n     decisions. The Solicitor General must show respect for the \n     Court's precedents and for the general principle of stare \n     decisis. If I am confirmed as Solicitor General, I could not \n     frequently or lightly ask the Court to reverse one of its \n     precedents, and I certainly would not do so because I thought \n     the case wrongly decided.'' You repeatedly provide this \n     answer verbatim, or a similarly unresponsive answer, to \n     numerous questions regarding the First and Second Amendments, \n     property rights, executive power, habeas corpus rights of \n     detainees, the use of foreign law in constitutional and \n     statutory analysis, and the Independent Counsel statute, \n     among others. I think you would agree that, given the gravity \n     of these issues and the significance of the post for which \n     you are nominated, this Committee is entitled to a full and \n     detailed explanation of your views on these matters.\n       Please provide the Committee with adequate answers to these \n     questions so that I may properly evaluate your nomination and \n     determine whether any supplemental questions are necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Harvard Law School,\n\n\n                                           Office of the Dean,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, March 2, 2009.\n     Senator Arlen Specter\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing in response to your \n     letter of February 25. I am sorry that you believe some of my \n     answers to written questions to be inadequate. I wish to \n     respond to your request for additional information as fully \n     as possible while still meeting the obligations attendant to \n     a nominee for the Solicitor General's office.\n       Let me first say how much I respect the Senate and its \n     institutional role in the nominations process. As the members \n     of a co-equal branch of government charged with the ``advice \n     and consent'' function, you and your colleagues have a right \n     and, indeed, a duty to seek necessary information about how a \n     nominee will perform in her office. By the same token, each \n     nominee has a responsibility to address senatorial inquiries \n     as fully and candidly as possible. But some questions--and \n     these questions will be different for different positions--\n     cannot be answered consistently with the responsible \n     performance of the job the nominee hopes to undertake. For \n     that reason, some balance is appropriate, as I remarked to \n     Senator Hatch at my nomination hearing and as you quoted \n     approvingly in the introduction to your written questions.\n       I endeavored to strike that proper balance in responding to \n     your and other senators' written questions. I answered in \n     full every question relating to the Solicitor General's role \n     and responsibilities, including how I would approach specific \n     statutes and areas of law. I also answered in detail every \n     question relating to my own professional career, including my \n     relatively extensive writings and speeches. Finally, I \n     answered many questions relating to general legal issues. In \n     short, I did my best to provide you and the rest of the \n     Committee with a good sense of who I am and of how I would \n     approach the role of Solicitor General. The only matters I \n     did not address substantively were my personal views (if any) \n     regarding specific Supreme Court cases and constitutional \n     doctrines. These personal views would play no role in my \n     performance of the job, which is to represent the interests \n     of the United States; and expressing them (whether as a \n     nominee or, if I am confirmed, as Solicitor General) might \n     undermine my and the Office's effectiveness in a variety of \n     ways.\n       In answering these questions as I did, I was cognizant of \n     the way other nominees to the position of Solicitor General \n     have replied to inquiries from senators. For example, in \n     answering a question about his views of the use of foreign \n     law in legal analysis, Paul Clement wrote: ``As Solicitor \n     General, my role would be to advance the interests of the \n     United States, and previous statements of my personal views \n     might be used against the United States' interests, either to \n     seek my recusal, to skew my consideration of what position \n     the United States should take, or to impeach the arguments \n     eventually advanced by the United States.'' Similarly, Seth \n     Waxman stressed in responding to questions about his \n     understanding of a statute that ``[i]t is the established \n     practice of the Solicitor General not to express views or \n     take positions in advance of presentation of a concrete \n     case'' and prior to engaging in extensive consultation within \n     and outside the office. The advice I received from former \n     Solicitors General of both parties prior to my nomination \n     hearing was consistent with what the transcripts of their \n     hearings reveal: all stressed the need to be honest and \n     forthcoming, but also the responsibility to protect the \n     interests of the office and of the United States. In my \n     hearing and in my responses to written questions, I believe I \n     have provided at least as much information to the Committee \n     as any recent nominee.\n       As you noted to me when we met, I have lived my \n     professional life largely in the public eye. I have written \n     and spoken widely, so the Committee had the opportunity to \n     review many pages of my law review articles and many hours of \n     my remarks. I tried to answer every question put to me at my \n     hearing completely and forthrightly. I met with every member \n     of the Committee who wished to do so in order to give all of \n     you a more personal sense of the kind of person and lawyer I \n     am. I submitted letters from numerous lawyers, who themselves \n     hold views traversing the political and legal spectrum, \n     indicating how I approach legal issues. And as noted above, I \n     answered many written questions from you and other members of \n     the Committee.\n       In all, I did my best to provide you and the other members \n     of the Committee with a complete picture of who I am and how \n     I would approach the role of Solicitor General, consistently \n     with the responsibilities of that office and the interests of \n     the client it serves. But I am certainly willing to do \n     anything else I can to satisfy your concerns, including \n     meeting with you again.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elena Kagan.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The comments that are in Ms. Kagan's letter require \nfurther analysis. She has, as a generalization, stated that she does \nnot think it appropriate to answer certain questions about her views \nbecause she has the ability as an advocate to disregard her own \npersonal views and to advocate with total responsibility to the law, \neven though she may have some different point of view. I think as a \ngeneralization, that is valid. However, as I discussed at her hearing, \nsome of her points of view raise a question as to whether, given the \nvery strongly held views she has expressed, she can totally put those \nviews aside. When her nomination was before the committee for a vote, I \npassed. I agreed it ought to go to the floor, and we ought not to \ndelay; but I wanted to have another talk with her. I have scheduled a \nmeeting for tomorrow to go over Dean Kagan's record because I think it \nis important to take a very close look at it.\n  I also think it is relevant to comment about the pending nomination \nof Dawn Johnsen for Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office \nof Legal Counsel. That is the Assistant Attorney General who passes on \nlegal questions, a very important position. They all are important, \nwhether it is Deputy Attorney General or Solicitor General or Assistant \nAttorney General for the various divisions. But the Office of Legal \nCounsel, OLC as it is called, is especially important. We now have \nchallenges in dealing with opinions on the torture issue by people who \nheld leadership positions in the Office of Legal Counsel under \nPresident George W. Bush--whether they were given in good faith and \nwhether they went far beyond the law as to what interrogation tactics \nwere appropriate.\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\n  With respect to Ms. Johnsen's nomination, she has equated limiting a \nwoman's right to choose with slavery in violation of the 13th \namendment. While I personally believe, as did Senator Goldwater, that \nwe ought to keep the Government out of our pocketbooks, off our backs, \nand out of our bedrooms, I am not going to raise the contention that \nabortion restrictions are a violation of the 13th amendment and that it \nconstitutes slavery. Her nomination is being subjected to very careful \nanalysis, especially the part of her testimony where she disclaimed \nmaking that the connection between abortion restrictions and the 13th \namendment because the records and a footnote suggest the contrary.\n  I talk about the nominations of Dean Kagan and Ms. Johnsen briefly, \nwhen considering the nomination of Mr. Ogden, to point out that there \nis very careful scrutiny given to these very important positions. I am \nlooking forward to meeting Dean Kagan tomorrow to examine further her \ncapabilities to be the Solicitor General and advance arguments with the \nappropriate adversarial zeal. We have an adversarial system. We put \nlawyers on opposite sides of the issue and we postulate that, from the \nadversarial system, the truth is more likely to emerge. An advocate has \nto pursue the cause within the range of advocacy. With Ms. Johnsen, we \nare going to be considering further her qualifications in light of her \nstatements to which I have referred.\n  But coming back to Mr. Ogden, my net conclusion is that he ought to \nbe confirmed. I say that based upon a resume that is very strong, both \nacademically and professionally. I think it is important to note that \nwhen questioned about some of his positions, Mr. Ogden has, one might \nsay, backed off some of his earlier views. When asked about some of the \nthings he had written, he criticized a 1983 memo he wrote when he was a \nlaw clerk to Justice Blackmun that referred to the defenders of a \nchallenged law in a way that disparagingly suggested their insincerity. \nHe told the committee that after maturing, he had some different views.\n  In a 1990 tribute to Justice Blackmun, he expressed agreement with \nthe Justice's endorsement of affirmative action programs that entailed \nset-asides or quotas. At his hearing, he said he now believes that such \nan approach was inappropriate and instead believes that consideration \nof race, as he put it, ``in limited circumstances'' should be one of \nmany factors in affirmative action programs.\n  Mr. Ogden also stated he no longer agrees with the position he took \nin a 1980 case comment that ``state expansion of speech rights at the \nexpense of property rights does not constitute a taking.'' That case \ncomment involved the issue of whether there was an unlimited right of \nspeech on private property. So he has maintained a little different \nposition. It is fair to raise a question about whether statements made \nin the confirmation amount to a confirmation conversion. That has been \nan expression used from time to time that you have to take statements \nat a confirmation with a grain of salt because of the motivation to be \nconfirmed. That has to be taken into account. But I listened to what \nMr. Ogden had to say, and I think he is entitled to modify his views \nover a substantial period of time from what he did in 1983 and 1990, \nwith a maturation process.\n  Then there is the consideration that the President is entitled to \nselect his appointees within broad limits. The Deputy Attorney General, \nwhile important, is not a lifetime appointment as a judge. I had a call \nfrom the Attorney General who raised the issue that he does not have \nany deputies and the Department of Justice has now been functioning for \nmore than a month and a half. It is a big, important department, and we \nought to give appropriate latitude to President Obama and appropriate \nlatitude to Attorney General Holder and move ahead with Mr. Ogden's \nconfirmation.\n  For all of those factors, I intend to vote in favor of Mr. Ogden. I \nthink those who have raised objections have done so, obviously, in good \nfaith. They are entitled to have their objections considered and to \nknow that the Judiciary Committee is giving very careful analysis to \ntheir facts and will do so, as I have outlined, on the consideration of \nother nominees.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of an \narticle I referred to from Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Casey be printed in the \nCongressional Record, along with the resume of Mr. Ogden.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Don't Blame the Lawyer\n\n               (By David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey)\n\n       President Barack Obama's selection of David Ogden as deputy \n     attorney general has drawn fire from conservative family \n     values groups, including the influential Family Research \n     Council, Focus on the Family, and Concerned Women for \n     America. Conservative talk show hosts including Fox News' \n     Bill O'Reilly, have highlighted the story, and there appears \n     to be a real effort under way to derail the nomination.\n       This effort undoubtedly has not escaped notice on Capitol \n     Hill, and several Republican senators on the Judiciary \n     Committee--including Orrin Hatch (Utah), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), and \n     Jeff Sessions (Ala.)--have pressed Ogden on some of the \n     issues raised by these groups.\n       Unfortunately, much of this opposition from the family \n     values groups is based upon Ogden's representation of \n     controversial clients and the positions he has argued on \n     their behalf. This tactic has been used against conservatives \n     in the past, including Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. \n     Punishing lawyers for who they represent and what they argue \n     before the courts is not in the interest of justice and makes \n     for bad public policy.\n\n\n                           ``FROM PLAYBOY''?\n\n       Among the principal objections to Ogden's nomination is \n     that he has represented adult magazine, book, and film \n     producers, including Playboy and Penthouse, on whose behalf \n     he has argued for a broad interpretation of First Amendment \n     protections.\n       Ogden also represented a number of library directors who \n     filed an amicus brief supporting the American Library \n     Association's challenge to the Children's Internet Protection \n     Act of 2000, which among other things required the use of \n     Internet filtering software by public libraries.\n       In addition, as noted by the Family Research Council, \n     ``Ogden worked for the ACLU and filed a brief in the landmark \n     abortion case Planned Parenthood v. Casey that denied the \n     existence of adverse mental health effects of abortion on \n     women:''\n       His participation and arguments in cases involving parental \n     notification, the Pentagon's ``don't ask, don't tell'' \n     policy, and gay rights has also raised conservative hackles. \n     According to the president of an important Catholic values \n     organization, ``David Ogden is a hired gun from Playboy and \n     the ACLU. He can't run from his long record of opposing \n     common-sense laws protecting families, women, and children.''\n\n\n                         ZEALOUS REPRESENTATION\n\n       The premise of this opposition is a familiar one--that \n     lawyers must be presumed to agree with, or be sympathetic to, \n     the clients they represent or, at a minimum, that they should \n     be held accountable for the arguments they advance on a \n     client's behalf. In fact, of course, lawyers represent \n     clients for many and varied reasons--for money or fame, out \n     of a sense of duty, an interest in a particular subject \n     matter, or for professional growth and development. Sometimes \n     lawyers are motivated by all of the above, and more.\n       It is simply inaccuracy to attribute to a lawyer his or her \n     client's beliefs. That is just not the way our legal system \n     works--at least not all the time.\n       Sometimes, of course, lawyers do personally agree with the \n     client's substantive views and the legal positions they \n     advance. There is no doubt that lawyers are often drawn to a \n     pardcular area of practice, or undertake to represent \n     particular clients--especially on a pro bono basis--because \n     they do believe in the client's cause. It is possible, \n     however, to believe in a client's cause--a broad application \n     of free speech rights, for example--and not to approve of the \n     client's personal behavior or business model.\n       And, just as a lawyer's character cannot be judged based on \n     a client list, neither can a lawyer's policy preferences \n     easily be divined by reading his or her briefs. Lawyers must \n     represent their clients zealously, and this means they often \n     must deploy legal arguments with which they personally \n     disagree.\n\n\n                         SUBVERTING THE SYSTEM\n\n       Moreover, even in cases where a lawyer does share the \n     client's opinions, or where he or she personally believes \n     that the law means, or should mean, what the briefs say, \n     there are very good reasons why this should not disqualify \n     such individuals from high government office.\n       Lawyers are human beings, and punishing them in this way \n     would result in many avoiding controversial clients and \n     causes. Indeed, this is often the purpose and intent of such \n     opposition, but it also is subversive of our legal system. \n     That system is adversarial and works only if both sides of an \n     issue are adequately represented. If there are clients or \n     causes, be they the adult entertainment industry, tobacco \n     companies, or Guantanamo detainees, that are classified as \n     being so disreputable or radioactive that their lawyers are \n     later personally held to account for representing them, the \n     quality of justice will suffer.\n       Conservatives and Republicans who are tempted in that \n     direction now that a liberal\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n     Democrat is in office should recall that similar arguments \n     about supposedly disreputable clients and unacceptable \n     arguments have been raised against their own nominees in the \n     past. For example, now-Chief Justice Roberts' nomination to \n     serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was \n     vociferously opposed by pro-choice groups based upon briefs \n     he had filed--and the arguments for restriction of abortion \n     rights they contained--when he served as deputy solicitor \n     general under President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\n                           CLEARLY QUALIFIED\n\n       Although there are many issues on which conservatives can \n     and should disagree with Ogden as ideological matters, those \n     disagreements are not good reasons why he should not be \n     confirmed as deputy attorney general. His views of the law \n     and legal policy are certainly legitimate topics of inquiry \n     and debate, both for the Senate and the public in general, \n     but only in the context of what they may mean about Obama's \n     own beliefs and plans.\n       Like his presidential predecessors, Obama is entitled to \n     select the men and women who will run the federal government, \n     including the Justice Department, exercising the executive \n     authority vested in him as president by the Constitution.\n       It is entirely appropriate that Obama's appointees share \n     his policy preferences and ideological inclinations. If their \n     legal views are considered by some to be out of the \n     ``mainstream,'' that is the president's problem. If they push \n     for extreme policies, it will be up to Obama to curtail them. \n     If not, there will be another election in 2012, at which time \n     the country can call him to account.\n       In the meantime, so long as the individuals Obama chooses \n     to serve in the executive branch have sufficient integrity, \n     credentials, and experience to perform the tasks they will be \n     assigned, they should be confirmed.\n       This is the case with Ogden. He is clearly qualified for \n     the job. His training and experience are outstanding, \n     including a Harvard law degree and a Supreme Court clerkship. \n     Ogden has practiced at one of the country's premier law \n     firms. He served as Attorney General Janet Reno's chief of \n     staff and as assistant attorney general in charge of the \n     Justice Department's Civil Division--its largest litigating \n     unit--in the Clinton administration. This service is \n     important. The deputy attorney general is, in large part, a \n     manager, and Ogden clearly understands the Justice \n     Department, its role in government, its career lawyers, and \n     its foibles.\n       Significantly, his nomination has been endorsed by a number \n     of lawyers who served in the Reagan and two Bush \n     administrations, including one who preceded, and one who \n     succeeded, Ogden as head of the Civil Division. They are \n     right; he should be confirmed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             David W.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor to my \ndistinguished colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business and that the time be charged \nagainst the time under the control of the majority on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on February 24, President Obama said:\n\n       [N]early a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for \n     reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our \n     economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let \n     there be no doubt: Health care reform cannot wait, it must \n     not wait, and it will not wait another year.\n\n  I could not agree more with our President. Our next big objective is \nhealth care reform. Comprehensive health care reform is no longer \nsimply an option, it is an imperative. If we delay, the problems we \nface today will grow even worse. If we delay, millions more Americans \nwill lose their coverage. If we delay, premiums will rise even further \nout of reach. And if we delay, Federal health care spending will soak \nup an even greater share of our Nation's income.\n  In the Finance Committee, we have now held 11 hearings preparing for \nhealth care reform. We held our latest hearing yesterday. The Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget, Dr. Peter Orszag, testified to \nthe Finance Committee about the President's health care budget.\n  Yesterday, Director Orszag told the committee the cost of not \nenacting health care reform is enormous. He said:\n\n       The cost of doing nothing is a fiscal trajectory that will \n     lead to a fiscal crisis over time.\n\n  Director Orszag said if we do not act, then we will further \nperpetuate a system in which workers' take-home pay is unnecessarily \nreduced by health care costs. Director Orszag said if we do not act, \nthen 46 million uninsured Americans will continue to be denied adequate \nhealth care. According to the Center for American Progress, the ranks \nof the uninsured grow by 14,000 people every day--14,000 more people \nuninsured every day. And Director Orszag said if we do not act, then a \ngrowing burden will be placed on State governments, with unanticipated \nconsequences. For example, health care costs will continue to crowd out \nState support of higher education. That would have dire consequences \nfor the education of our Nation's young people.\n  We must move forward. Senator Grassley and I have laid out a schedule \nto do just that. Our schedule calls for the Finance Committee to mark \nup a comprehensive health care reform bill in June. We should put a \nhealth care bill on the President's desk this year.\n  The President's budget makes a historic downpayment on health care \nreform. Over the next 10 years, the President's budget invests $634 \nbillion to reform our health care system.\n  Reforming health care means making coverage affordable over the long \nrun. It means improving the quality of the care. And I might say, our \nquality is not as good as many Americans think it is, certainly \ncompared to international norms. It means expanding health insurance to \ncover all Americans. We need fundamental reform in cost, quality, and \ncoverage. We need to address all three objectives at the same time. \nThey are interconnected. If you do not address them together, you will \nnever really address any one of them alone.\n  Costs grow too rapidly because the system pays for volume, not \nquality. Quality indicators such as lifespan and infant mortality \nremain low. Why? Because too many are left out of the system. Families \ndo not get coverage because health costs grow faster than wages. And \nwithout coverage, health insurance costs increase because providers \nshift the cost of uncompensated care to their paying customers. It is a \nvicious cycle. Each problem feeds on the others.\n  We need a comprehensive response. Let us at long last deliver on the \ndream of reform Teddy Roosevelt called for nearly a century ago. Let us \nat long last lift the burden of health care costs on our economy and on \nthe conscience of our Nation. And let us at long last enact health care \nreform this year.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time consumed during the quorum call be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to say a few words in \nopposition to the nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  There is no doubt that Mr. Ogden is an experienced lawyer. However, I \nhave serious concerns about Mr. Ogden's views and some of the cases he \nhas argued. Mr. Ogden is an attorney who has specialized in first \namendment cases, in particular pornography and obscenity cases, and has \nrepresented several entities in the pornography industry. He has argued \nagainst legislation designed to ban child pornography, including the \nChildren's Internet Protection Act of 2000 and the Child Protection and \nObscenity Enforcement Act of 1998. These laws were enacted to protect \nchildren from obscene materials in public libraries and to require \nproducers of pornography to personally verify that their models are not \nminors. I supported both these important pieces of legislation.\n  In addition, Mr. Ogden authored a brief in the 1993 case Knox v. \nUnited States, where he advocated for the same arguments to shield \nchild pornography under the first amendment that the Senate unanimously \nrejected by a vote of 100 to 0 and the House rejected by a vote of 425 \nto 3. In the Knox case, the Bush I Justice Department successfully had \nprosecuted Knox for violating Federal antipornography laws; but on \nappeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Clinton Justice Department \nreversed course and refused to defend the conviction. After significant \npublic outrage, President Clinton publicly chastised the Solicitor \nGeneral, and Attorney General Reno overturned the position. At the \ntime, I was involved in the congressional effort opposing this switch \nin the Justice Department's position on child pornography.\n  Mr. Ogden also has filed briefs opposing parental notification before \na minor's abortion, opposing spousal notification before an abortion, \nand opposing the military's policy against public homosexuals serving \nin uniform.\n  Significant concerns have been raised in regard to Mr. Ogden's \nnomination. I have heard from a very large number of Iowa constituents, \nincluding the Iowa Christian Alliance, who are extremely concerned with \nMr. Ogden's ties to the pornography industry and the positions he has \ntaken against protecting women and children from this terrible scourge. \nThe Family Research Council, Concerned Women of America, Eagle Forum, \nFidelis, the Alliance Defense Fund, and the Heritage Foundation, among \nothers, have all expressed serious concerns about Mr. Ogden's advocacy \nagainst restrictions on pornography and obscenity.\n  The majority of Americans support protecting children from \npornography exploitation, protecting children from Internet pornography \nin libraries, and allowing for parental notification before a minor's \nabortion. So do I. I feel very strongly about protecting women and \nchildren from the evils of pornography. I have always been a strong \nsupporter of efforts to restrict the dissemination of pornography in \nall environments. As a parent and grandparent, I am particularly \nconcerned that children will be exposed to pornographic images while \npursing educational endeavors or simply using the Internet for \nrecreational purposes. Throughout my tenure in Congress I have \nsupported bills to protect children from inappropriate exposure to \npornography and other obscenities in the media, and I support the \nrights of parents to raise children and to be active participants in \ndecisions affecting their medical care. Mr. Ogden has consistently \ntaken positions against these child protection laws and this troubles \nme.\n  Because of my concerns, I must oppose the nomination of David Ogden.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I didn't make a complete request, as I \nshould have, for a quorum, so I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nevenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Transportation Troubles\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Last evening, I was driving from the Capitol and \nlistening to Jim Lehrer News Hour. They had a report about transit \nsystems in this country that are facing significant financial problems. \nThe report was fairly interesting. It turns out to be a subject with \nwhich I am fairly familiar. The report was that there are more than a \ncouple dozen transit agencies in some of America's largest cities that \nare in deep financial trouble. Why? Because they had sold their subway \nsystem or bus system to a bank in order to raise needed revenue. Under \nwhat is called a SILO, a sale in/lease out transaction, a city can sell \nits property to a bank, so the bank takes title to the property. The \nbank then leases it back to the city, and the bank gets a big tax \nwriteoff because it can depreciate the property. So the city still gets \nto use its subway system because they are leasing it back.\n  All of a sudden, a couple dozen cities discovered that this \ntransaction they entered into, which I think is kind of a scam, landed \nthem in huge trouble because the transaction was insured with a \nderivative that went through AIG. AIG's credit rating collapsed, and \nnow the banks are calling in substantial penalties on the part of the \ntransit system that they cannot meet. So they are in trouble.\n  Surprised? I am not particularly surprised. I have been on the floor \nof the Senate talking about what is happening with respect to these so-\ncalled sale in/lease out, SILO practices. I have talked about banks and \nabout Wachovia Bank, by the way, which was buying German sewer systems. \nI will describe a couple of these transactions. These are cross-border \nleasing provisions, sale and lease back.\n  Wachovia Bank buys a sewer system in Bochum, Germany. Why? Is it \nbecause it is a sewer specialist? Do they have executives who really \nknow about sewers in Germany? I don't think so. This is a scam. It has \nalways been a scam. An American bank buys a sewer system in a German \ncity so it can depreciate the assets of that sewage system and then \nlease it back to the German city. The Germans were scratching their \nheads, saying: This seems kind of dumb, but as long as we are on the \nreceiving end of a lot of money, we are certainly willing to do it.\n  I am showing this example of a bank called Wachovia, which used to be \nFirst Union, that originally started some of these transactions. I \nbelieve Wachovia itself, which was in deep financial trouble, has now \nbeen acquired by Wells Fargo. First Union was involved in a cross-\nborder lease of Dortmund, Germany, streetcars. What is an American bank \ndoing leasing streetcars in a German city? To avoid paying U.S. taxes, \nthat is why.\n  We have seen all kinds of these transactions going on. I have \ndescribed them on the floor of the Senate previously.\n  This one is the transit system railcars in Belgium. Since many of \nthese transactions are confidential, I don't know which American \ncompany bought Belgium National Railway cars. One of our corporations \nbought the Liefkenshoek Tunnel under the river in Antwerp, Belgium. \nWhy? To save money on taxes. Some companies don't want to pay their \ntaxes to this country.\n  PBS Frontline's Hedrick Smith did a piece on it. The cross-border \nleasing contracts appear particularly hard to justify because all the \nproperty rights remain as they were even after the deal was signed. The \nCologne purification plant keeps cleaning Cologne's sewage water. In \nthe words of Cologne's city accountant:\n\n       After all, the Americans should know themselves what they \n     do with their money.\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\n     If they subsidize this transaction, we gratefully accept.\n\n  I mention this because the tax shelters that big American banks and \nsome cities have discovered are unusual and, I think, raise very \nserious questions about whether they are fair to do.\n  Here is a Wall Street Journal article about how the city of Chicago \nactually sold Chicago's 9-1-1 emergency call system to FleetBoston \nFinancial and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking. Why would a city sell its 9-1-1 \nemergency call system? Why would somebody buy it? It is in order to \navoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  The reason I mention all of this is, last evening, I heard about the \ntransit systems being in trouble in this country. Why? They are engaged \nin this. They were engaged in exactly the same thing. A transit system \nthat is established by a city to provide transportation for folks in \nthat city decides it wants to get involved in a transaction to sell its \ntransit system to a bank someplace and then lease it back, allowing the \nbank to avoid paying U.S. taxes and, all of a sudden, they are in \ntrouble. Do you know what? I do not have so much sympathy for people \nwho are involved in those kinds of transactions. It reminded me, last \nevening, listening to this issue of cross-border leasing, SILOs and \nLILOs, and all these scams going on for a long time, many established \nby U.S. companies who apparently, in their boardrooms, are not only \ntrying to figure out how to sell products but how to avoid taxes \nthrough very sophisticated tax engineering.\n  I think it raises lots of questions about the issue of economic \npatriotism and what each of us owes to our country. It reminded me \nagain of another portion of this financial collapse and financial \ncrisis that we now face in this country. It reminded me of the work \nthat the attorney general of New York, Andrew Cuomo, is doing and \nsomething he disclosed. We should have disclosed it, but we didn't know \nit. We know it because Andrew Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, \ndug it out. Let me tell you the story.\n  Last year, Merrill Lynch investment bank was going belly up. So the \nTreasury Secretary arranged a purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of \nAmerica in September to be consummated in January. And it happened. \nWhat we now understand and learn is that Merrill Lynch, which lost $27 \nbillion last year, in December, just prior to it being taken over by \nBank of America, paid 694 people bonuses of more than $1 million each. \nI will say that again. They paid 694 people bonuses of more than $1 \nmillion each, with the top four executives sharing $121 million.\n  Moments later--that is, in a couple of weeks--the American taxpayers, \nthrough the TARP program, put tens of billions of dollars more into the \nacquiring company, Bank of America. At least a portion of that would \nhave been attributable to the takeoff of Merrill Lynch, which just lost \n$15 billion the previous quarter. It appears to me that this was an \narrangement, and Bank of America understood it was buying Merrill \nLynch. Merrill Lynch lost a ton of money--$27 billion--last year but \nwanted to pay bonuses to its executives. So 694 of their folks got more \nthan $1 million each--just prior to the American taxpayer coming in and \nproviding the backstop to the acquiring company, Bank of America, at \nleast in part because of the purchase.\n  Is there any wonder the American people get furious when they read \nthese kinds of things? The top four executives received $121 million. \nThe top 14 received $250 million. I describe this because we didn't \nknow this. We are the ones who are pushing TARP money. This Congress \nappropriated TARP money--now $700 billion. This Congress has \nappropriated that money, but we don't know what is going on. That is \nwhy I introduced, with Senator McCain, a proposal for a select \ncommittee to investigate the narrative of what happened with respect to \nthis financial crisis. These tax scams are just a part of it. It is the \nway everything was happening around here, with some of the biggest \ninstitutions in the country.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around. The Federal Government was \nrunning deficits that were far too large. Corporate debt was increasing \ndramatically. Personal debt, household debt, doubled in a relatively \nshort time. It is not as if everybody doesn't have some culpability. \nOur trade deficit, $700 billion a year, is unsustainable. You cannot do \nthat year after year. There were a lot of reasons.\n  Then the subprime loan scandal--this unbelievable scandal. At the \nsame time the subprime loan scandal ratchets up, we have a circumstance \nwhere regulators, who were appointed by the previous administration, \nessentially advertised they were willing to be willfully blind and not \nlook. ``Self regulation'' is what Alan Greenspan called it.\n  So then there grew a substantial pot of dark money that was traded \noutside of any exchanges. Nobody knew what they were. The development \nof newly engineered products, credit default swaps, CDOs--you name it, \nwas very complicated--so complicated that many could not understand \nthem. I was asked by a television interviewer 2 days ago: If you did a \nselect committee to investigate all of this, with due respect, do you \nthink Members of the Senate could understand these very complicated \nproducts?\n  I said: I think if your question is could we understand them as well \nas the heads of financial institutions who steered their companies into \nthe ditch with these products, can we understand them as well as they \ndid, yes, I think so. I think we are capable of figuring out what \ncaused all this, but we would not do it without looking. We would not \ndo it, in my judgment, without the establishment of a select committee \nwith subpoena power to develop the narrative of what happened, who is \naccountable, what do we do to make sure this never happens again.\n  I believe we ought to go back a ways, go back to 1999, when the \nCongress passed something called the Financial Services Modernization \nAct that took apart the Glass-Steagall Act that was put in place after \nthe Great Depression, and it separated banking from risk. It said you \ncannot be involved in deposit-insured banking and then involved in real \nestate and securities as well.\n  In 1999, Congress passed legislation that said that is old-fashioned. \nLet's get rid of Glass-Steagall. Let's abolish Glass-Steagall. Let's \ncreate big financial holding companies for one-stop financial \ncapabilities for everybody. I was one of eight to vote no. I said on \nthe floor of the Senate 10 years ago that I think this will result in a \nbig taxpayer bailout. I said that during the debate, not because I knew \nit but because I felt it. You cannot take apart the protections that \nexisted after the Great Depression and somehow believe you are doing \nthe country a favor. We were not.\n  We have to reconnect some of those protections and separate banking \nfrom the substantial risks that are involved in things such as the \nderivatives and some of the complex products with great risk that now \nexist as something called toxic assets deep in the bowels of some of \nthe largest financial institutions of our country.\n  We have a lot to do and a lot to do in a hurry to try to fix what is \nwrong in this country. I said before that I do not think you can fix \nwhat is wrong unless you clean up the banking system. I understand a \nbanking system is a circulatory system for an economy. You have to have \na working system of finance.\n  I was asked the other day: Do you believe in nationalizing the banks?\n  I said: That is a word that is thrown around. I don't know what words \nto use. But I think perhaps for the biggest banks in the country that \nhave failed that are loaded with massive, risky toxic assets and are \nnow saying to the American taxpayers: Bail me out, but keep me alive \nbecause I have a right to exist because I am too big to fail, I said I \nthink instead we ought to run it through a banking carwash. Start at \nthe front end--I know ``banking carwash'' is a goofy idea--start at the \nfront end and when they come out new, you have gotten rid of the bad \nassets, keep the good assets, change the name, perhaps change their \nownership, put them back up. We need banks, I understand that. But \nthere is no inherent right with all the banks with the current names to \nexist if they ran into the ditch, taking on very big risks and then \ndecide the taxpayers have to retain them because it is their inherent \nright to exist. I don't believe that is the case.\n  I do believe all of us have to find a way to put together this \nbanking and financial system in a manner that\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nworks because business cannot exist without credit. We have plenty of \nbusinesses out there right now that have the capability to make money, \nhave the capability to survive and get through this but cannot find \ncredit. We have to find a way to put that together so our financial \nsystem works.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  I wish to make a couple points about a subject I did not talk about \nin recent days because there was a lot of controversy on the floor of \nthe Senate over some provisions that I included in the omnibus bill \ndealing with Cuba. I wish to make a couple comments because much of the \ndiscussion has been inaccurate.\n  Fifty year ago, Fidel Castro walked up the steps of the capitol in \nHavana, having come from the mountains as a revolutionary. Fidel Castro \nturned Cuba into a Communist country. I have no time for Fidel Castro \nor the Communist philosophy of Cuba. But it has always been my interest \nto try to understand why we treat Cuba differently than we do other \nCommunist countries.\n  China is Communist, Communist China. What is our policy with China? \nEngagement will be constructive; allow people to travel to China; trade \nwith China; constructive engagement will move China in the right \ndirection. That has always been our policy with respect to Communist \nChina. I have been to China.\n  Vietnam is a Communist government. What is our policy? Engagement is \nconstructive; travel to Vietnam; trade with Vietnam; constructive \nengagement will move Vietnam toward better human rights and greater \nfreedoms. I have been to Vietnam.\n  That is our constructive approach with respect to Communist \ncountries. Cuba? Different, an embargo with respect to Cuba, a complete \nembargo, which at one time even included food and medicine which, in my \njudgment, is immoral. In addition to an embargo, we said: We don't like \nFidel Castro; so we are going to slap around the American people as \nwell because we are going to prevent them from traveling to Cuba. So we \nhave people in the Treasury Department in a little organization called \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control, called OFAC, that at least until \nnot long ago was spending 20 to 25 percent of its time tracking \nAmerican citizens who were suspected of vacationing in Cuba.\n  Can you imagine that? The organization was designed to track \nterrorist money. But nearly a quarter of its time was spent trying to \ntrack whether Americans went to Cuba to take a vacation illegally. Let \nme show you some of what they have done.\n  This woman is named Joan Slote. I have met Joan. Joan is a senior \nOlympian bike rider. Joan went to Cuba to ride bicycle with a Canadian \nbicycling group. Canadians can go to Cuba, and she assumed it was legal \nfor Americans also. She answered an ad in a bicycling magazine and \nsaid: Yes, I would like to bicycle in Cuba. So she went.\n  For going to bicycle in Cuba, she was fined $7,630 by the U.S. \nGovernment under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Think of that, the \nTrading with the Enemy Act. This senior citizen bicyclist was fined by \nher Government. Then, because her son had a brain tumor and she was \nattending to her son in another State, she did not get this notice. So \nthe Government took steps to threaten to attach her Social Security \ncheck. Unbelievable. This is unbelievable, in my judgment.\n  This is Joni Scott, a young woman who came to see me one day. She \nwent to Cuba with a religious group to pass out free Bibles. You can \nguess what happened to her. Her Government was tracking her down to try \nto fine her for going to Cuba to pass out free Bibles. Why? Because we \ndecided to punish Fidel Castro by not allowing the American people to \ntravel to Cuba.\n  Here is Leandro. He is a Cuban American but he could not attend his \nfather's funeral in Cuba. President Bush, by the way, changed the \ncircumstances that Cuban Americans living in this country could travel \nto Cuba so they can go only once in 3 years rather than once in 1 year. \nYour mother is dying? Tough luck. Your father is dying? Tough luck. You \ncan't go there. That policy is unbelievable to me.\n  This is a man I met, SGT Carlos Lazo. SGT Carlos Lazo fled from Cuba \non raft and went to Iraq to fight for this country. He won a Bronze \nStar there. He is a great soldier. His sons were living in Cuba with \ntheir mother. One of his sons was quite ill. He came back from fighting \nin Iraq, and was denied the opportunity see his sick son in Cuba 90 \nmiles away from Florida. That is unbelievable to me. In fact, we even \nhad a vote on the floor of the Senate--we did it because I forced it--\nwhether we were going to let this soldier go to Cuba to see his sons. \nWe fell only a few votes short of the two thirds we needed to change \nthe law.\n  My point is, our policies make no sense at all. We are going to slap \naround the American people because we are upset with Castro and Cuba. I \nam upset with Castro. I am upset with Cuba's policies. But with \nCommunist China and Communist Vietnam, we say travel there, trade with \nthem, constructive engagement moves them in the right direction.\n  John Ashcroft and I, when John Ashcroft was in the Senate, passed the \nfirst piece of legislation that opened a crack for American farmers to \nbe able to sell food and for us to sell medicine in Cuba. We opened \njust a crack. There was a time a few years ago when the first train \ncarloads of dried peas from North Dakota went to a loading dock to be \nshipped to Cuba.\n\n  President Bush decided: I am going to tighten up all that. I am going \nto tighten up family visits; I am going to tighten up and try to thwart \nthe ability of farmers to sell food into Cuba. It made no sense to me. \nSo in this omnibus legislation, I made the changes we have been talking \nabout and debating for years; that is, restoring the right of family \nvisits once a year rather than once in 3 years and a couple other \nchanges to make it easier to export food and medicine to Cuba.\n  But I wish to make the point that some people on the floor of the \nSenate have claimed this legislation that was in the omnibus would \nextend U.S. credit to Cuba. It is flat out not true. There is nothing \nin these provisions that would extend credit to Cuba. In fact, the \nAshcroft-Dorgan or Dorgan-Ashcroft legislation that allowed us to sell \nfood into Cuba explicitly prohibits U.S. financing for food sales to \nCuba. They cannot purchase food from us unless it is in cash, and the \npayments cannot even be conducted directly through an American bank. \nThey have to run through a European bank for a cash transaction to buy \nAmerican farm products. But at least the law allows us to compete with \nthe Canadians, the Europeans, and others who sell farm products into \nCuba.\n  These policies, in my judgment, have been a failure, dating back to \n1960. There is no evidence at all that this embargo has been helpful.\n  I have been to Cuba. I have been to Havana. I talked with the \ndissidents who take strong exception and fought the Castro regime every \nstep of the way, and a good number of those dissidents said to me this \nembargo we have with respect to Cuba is Castro's best excuse. Castro \nsays: Sure our economy is in shambles. Wouldn't it be? Wouldn't you \nexpect it to be if the 500-pound gorilla north of here has its fist \naround your neck? That is what the Castro regime says to excuse its \ndismal record--the economy, human rights, and all of it.\n  I, personally, think it is long past the time to take another look. I \nknow Senator Lugar also published some recommendations on Cuba policy \nrecently. Sometime soon, Senator Enzi and I and others are going to \ntalk about legislation we have introduced on this subject. It is long \npast the time to take another look at this issue and begin to treat \nCuba as we treat Communist China and Communist Vietnam.\n  I think constructive engagement is far preferable because now the \nonly voice the Cuban people hear effectively is the Castro voice, \nwhether it is Raul or Fidel--I guess it is now Raul. That is the only \nthing they hear, and they need to hear more. Hearing more from a flock \nof tourists who go to a country such as Cuba would, in my judgment, \nopen a substantial amount of new dialog. So I think travel and trade \nwill be constructive, not just with China and Vietnam. I think there is \nevidence in both cases--I have been to both countries--that \nconstructive engagement has moved forward in both countries in a \nmeasurable way.\n  Has engagement resulted in a quantum leap with china and Vietnam? No, \nbut it is measurable. I think the same would be true with respect to \nCuba.\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\n  What persuaded me to come to the floor to talk about this today was a \ndiscussion this past week on the floor regarding the provisions I \nsponsored on the bill we passed last night. I didn't engage in that \ndiscussion because we needed to move the omnibus bill.\n  I did want the Senate Record to understand and show exactly what the \nhistory has been and what we have done. What we have done, I think, is \na very small step in the right direction. Much more needs to be done, \nwhether it is saying to American farmers: You have a right to compete, \nyou have a right to sell farm products without constraints. By the way, \none of the provisions in the bill authorizes a general license that \nwould make it easier for farm groups like the Farmers Union and Farm \nBureau to go to an agriculture expo in Cuba to be able to sell their \nproducts. That is not radical. That is not undermining anything. That \nis common sense.\n  The drip, drip, drip of common sense in this Chamber could be helpful \nover a long period of time. This is just a couple small drops of common \nsense that I think will help us as we address the issue of Cuba.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask the Chair to let me know when I \nhave 2 minutes remaining. I believe we have 30 minutes allocated to us \nat this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this is an important next 3 or 4 weeks for the \nUnited States. The President of the United States has outlined his 10-\nyear blueprint for our country's future in the form of a budget. The \nbudget is now before the Congress, and it is our job to consider it. We \nare doing that every day in hearings, and we are looking forward to the \ndetails the President will send later this month. But for the next 4 \nweeks, including this week, the major subject for debate in this Senate \nChamber is this: Can we afford the Democrats' proposals for spending, \ntaxes, and borrowing? And our view--the Republican view--is the answer \nis no.\n  As an example, in the 1990s, President Clinton and the Congress \nraised taxes, but they raised taxes to balance the budget. This \nproposal--and we will be discussing it more as we go along--will raise \ntaxes to grow the government.\n  Not long ago, the President visited our Republican caucus, and we \ntalked some about entitlement reform--the automatic spending that the \ngovernment says we don't appropriate; mostly all of it is for Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--and he talked about the importance to \nhim of dealing with entitlement spending. Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, made a speech at the National Press Club to begin \nthis Congress in which he said that he was going to say to this \nPresident: Let's work together to bring the growth in entitlement \nspending, automatic spending, under control. We had a summit at the \nWhite House, which we were glad to attend, about that.\n  But I say to Senator Gregg, the Senator from New Hampshire, who is \nthe ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I was disappointed to \ncome back from the excellent meeting we had at the White House on \nfiscal responsibility and find, for example, that in this budget we \nhave $117 billion more for entitlement spending on Pell grants. So my \nquestion to the Senator from New Hampshire is: Does this budget \nactually reform entitlement spending, or does it not?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I know the Senator \nfrom Tennessee will not be surprised to learn that there is no \nentitlement reform in this budget; that this budget, regrettably, \ndramatically increases entitlement spending.\n  The chart I have here reflects that increase. If you would use the \npresent baseline on entitlement spending, that would be the blue. Now \nthat is going up pretty fast. During this period, it would go from $1.2 \ntrillion up to almost $2.4 trillion. That is the baseline, if you did \nnothing. Now one would have presumed with that type of increase in \nentitlement spending, and the fact that this budget, as it is proposed, \nis going to run up a public debt which will double in 5 years and \ntriple in 10 years, that it will create a deficit this coming year of \n$1.7 trillion and a deficit in the last year of the budget of $700 \nbillion--deficits which are larger in the last years of this budget \nthan have historically been those that we have borne as a nation over \nthe last 20 years, and a debt which will go from $5.8 trillion to $15 \ntrillion plus. One would have presumed that in that area where the \nbudget is growing the fastest, and which represents the largest amount \nof cost, that this administration would have stepped forward and said: \nWell, we can't afford that; we have to try to slow the rate of growth \nof spending in that area, or at least not have increased it. But what \nthe President's budget has done is they have proposed to dramatically \nincrease the amount of spending in the entitlement accounts.\n  Most of this increase will come in health care. Now, people say, and \nlegitimately so, that we have to reform our health care delivery system \nin this country; that we have to get better with health care in this \ncountry. But does that mean we have to spend a lot more money on it? \nNo. We spend 17 percent of our national product, of what we produce as \na nation, on health care. The closest country to us in the \nindustrialized world only spends 11\\1/2\\ percent of their product on \nhealth care. So we have a massive amount of money we are spending on \nhealth care as an industrialized nation that is available to correct \nour health care system. We don't have to increase it even further.\n  What the President is proposing is to increase health care spending. \nAs a downpayment, they are saying $600 billion, but actually what they \nare proposing is $1.2 trillion of new entitlement spending in health \ncare. No control there. In addition, as the Senator from Tennessee \nnoted, they are taking programs which have traditionally been \ndiscretionary, which have therefore been subject to some sort of fiscal \ndiscipline around here, because they are subject to what is known as \nspending caps on discretionary programs, and taking these programs and \nmoving them over to the entitlement accounts. Why? Because then there \nis no discipline. You spend the money, and you keep spending the money, \nand there is no accountability. So they are taking the entire Pell \nprogram out of discretionary accounts and moving it over to entitlement \naccounts. As the Senator from Tennessee noted, this is over $100 \nbillion of new entitlement spending.\n  If we keep this up, what is it going to do? Essentially, what it is \ngoing to do is bankrupt our country, but it will certainly bankrupt our \nkids. We are going to pass on to them a country which has this massive \nincrease in debt--something our children can't afford, as I mentioned \nearlier--a debt which will double in 5 years because of the spending, \nand triple in 10 years. Almost all of this growth in debt is a function \nof the growth of the entitlement spending in this program. Although \nthere is a considerable amount of growth in discretionary, the vast \nmajority of this increase is in spending for entitlement programs.\n  To put it another way, and to show how much this is out of the \nordinary and how much this is a movement of our government to the \nleft--an expansion of government as a function of our society--this \nchart shows what historically the spending of the Federal Government \nhas been. It has historically been about 20 percent of gross national \nproduct. That has been an affordable number. Granted, we have run \ndeficits during a lot of this period, but at least it has been \nreasonably affordable. But this administration is proposing in their \nbudget that we spike the spending radically next year, which is \nunderstandable because we are in the middle of a very severe recession \nand the government is the source of liquidity to try to get the economy \ngoing. So that is understandable. Maybe not that much, but maybe \nunderstandable. It is more than I would have suggested, but I will \naccept that. The problem is out here, when you get out to the year \n2011,\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n2012, and 2013, when the recession is over. When the recession is over, \nthey do not plan to control spending. They plan to continue spending on \nan upward path so it is about 23 percent of gross national products.\n  What does that mean? That means we are going to run big deficits, big \ndebt, and all of that will be a burden and fall on the shoulders of our \nchildren. Our children are the ones who have to pay this cost.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. At this point, let me ask the Senator from New \nHampshire a question. I have heard you say, and I believe I said a \nmoment ago, that in the 1990s, President Clinton raised taxes, as \nPresident Obama is planning to raise taxes, but that President Clinton \nused it to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. When President Clinton raised taxes in the mid 1990s, \nand a Republican Congress came into play, we controlled spending. He \ngot his tax increase, the deficit went down, because the tax increase \nwas put to reducing the deficit. What President Obama is proposing is \nthat he increase taxes by $1.4 trillion--the largest tax increase in \nthe history of our country. Is it going to be used to reduce the \ndeficit? No, just the opposite. It is going to be used to grow the \ngovernment and allow the government to now take 23 percent of gross \nnational product instead of the traditional 20 percent.\n  So you can't close this gap. Basically, all the new taxes in this \nbill--and there are a lot of them. There is a national sales tax on \neverybody's electric bill, a tax which is basically going to hit most \nevery small business in this country and make it harder for them to \nhire people; and a tax which limits the deductibility of charitable \ngiving and of home mortgages. All these new taxes are not being used to \nget fiscal discipline in place, to try to bring down the debt, or limit \nthe rate of growth of the debt, or to limit the size of the deficit. \nThey are being used to explode--literally explode--the size of the \nFederal Government, with ideas such as nationalizing the educational \nloan system, ideas such as quasinationalization of the health care \nsystem, which is in here, and massive expansion of a lot of other \ninitiatives that may be worthwhile but aren't affordable in the context \nof this agenda.\n  So this budget is a tremendous expansion in spending, a tremendous \nexpansion in borrowing, and a tremendous expansion in taxes. And it is \nnot affordable for our children.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I may ask the Senator from New Hampshire \nabout this. Some people may say, with some justification: You \nRepublicans are complaining about spending, yet in the last 8 years you \nparticipated in a lot of it yourself. How would you compare the \nproposed spending and proposed debt over the next 10 years in this \nblueprint by the Obama administration with the last 8 years?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a good point, and that has certainly been made by \nthe other side of the aisle: Well, under the Bush administration all \nthis spending was done and this debt was run up.\n  In the first 5 years of the Obama administration, under their \nbudget--not our numbers, their numbers--they will spend more and they \nwill run up the debt on the country more and on our children more than \nall the Presidents since the beginning of our Republic--George \nWashington to George Bush. Take all those Presidents and put all the \ndebt they put on the ledger of America, and in this budget President \nObama is planning to run up more debt than occurred under all those \nPresidents. It is a massive expansion in debt.\n  It is also an interesting exercise in tax policy. Now, I know we are \nnot talking so much about taxes today, but I think it is important to \npoint out that when you put a $1.4 trillion tax increase on the \nAmerican people, you reduce productivity in this country rather \ndramatically. One of the unique things about President Bush's term was \nthat he set a tax policy which actually caused us to have 4 years--\nprior to this massive recession, which is obviously a significant \nproblem and a very difficult situation--but for the runup during the \nmiddle part of his term right up until this recession started, the \nFederal Government was generating more revenues than it had ever \ngenerated in its history. Why was that? Because we had a tax policy \nwhich basically taxed people in a way that caused them to go out and be \nproductive, to create jobs, and to do things which were taxable events.\n  Unfortunately, what is being proposed here, under this \nadministration's tax policy, is going to cause people to do tax \navoidance. Instead of investing to create jobs, they will go out to \ninvest to try to avoid taxes, and that is not an efficient way to use \ndollars. The practical effect is it will reduce revenues and increase \nthe deficit. So on your point, the simple fact is, as this proposal \ncomes forward from the administration, it increases the debt of the \nUnited States more in 5 years than all the Presidents of the United \nStates have increased the debt since the beginning of the Republic.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Arizona, who is a longtime \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee and pays a lot of attention to \nFederal spending and is the assistant Republican leader. I wonder, \nSenator Kyl, as you have watched the Congress over the years, to what \ndo you attribute this remarkable increase in spending? We heard a lot \nof talk last year about change, but this may be the kind of change that \nproduces a sticker shock. It may be a little bit more change in terms \nof spending than a lot of Americans were expecting.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the question of my colleague \nfrom Tennessee. I also compliment the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, the Senator from New Hampshire, who has tried to deal with \nbudgets all the time he has been in the Senate.\n  If I could begin by just asking him one question: How would you \ncharacterize this budget proposed by the President as compared with \nothers, in terms of the taxes and the spending and the debt created? Is \nthere some way to compare it with all of the other budgets that you \nhave worked with, including all of the Bush budgets?\n  Mr. GREGG. It has the largest increase in taxes, the largest increase \nin spending, and the largest increase in debt in the history of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first would answer my colleague from \nTennessee. We ought to be spending less and taxing less and borrowing \nless. Our minority leader asked his staff to do some calculations. Just \nfrom the time that the new President raised his hand and was \ninaugurated as President, how much money have we spent? They calculated \nthat we have spent $1 billion every hour. That is just in the stimulus \nlegislation, this omnibus bill that was just passed last night, which \nis 8 percent over the stimulus bill, and we have not even added in the \nspending that is going to occur as a result of this budget which, as \nthe Senator from New Hampshire said, in just the first year is a third \nmore spending than even the previous year--$3.55 trillion.\n  In addition to that, it makes much of the so-called temporary \nspending in the stimulus bill permanent. Some of us predicted that \nwould happen, that when they have a new program in the stimulus bill \nthey surely wouldn't cut it off after 2 or 3 years. We said they will \nprobably make it permanent. Sure enough, and the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee can speak to that better than I, but a great many of \nthese programs are made permanent. On health care, for example, the \nSenator from New Hampshire talked about that, but there is no effort to \ncontrol entitlements. In fact, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security \nall rise between 10 and 12 percent, Medicare itself by $330 billion. \nThis is increased spending, and it is permanent programs.\n  We also wondered what would happen with respect to the Federal \nGovernment's growth as a result. According to a March 3 Washington Post \narticle, ``President Obama's budget is so ambitious, with vast new \nspending on health care, energy independence, education, services for \nveterans, that experts say he probably will need to hire tens of \nthousands of new Federal Government workers to realize his goals.'' \nAccording to the article, estimates are as high as 250,000 new \nGovernment employees will have to be hired to implement all of this \nspending.\n  I know we want to create jobs in this economy, but I wonder if the \nAmerican people intended that we create a whole bunch of new Government \nbureaucrats to spend all of this money.\n  This is not responsive to my colleague's question, but the one area\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nwhere we do not have high unemployment is Government jobs. The \nunemployment in the country is about 8 percent now. In Government jobs \nit is between 2 percent and 3 percent, so that is not an area we needed \nto grow more jobs.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Arizona, one \nmight look at the chart Senator Gregg has up and say that is not too \nbig an increase in Federal spending, but of course the United States \nproduces about 25 percent of the world's wealth. When we go up on an \nannual basis by a few percentage points, it begins to change the \ncharacter of the kind of country we have.\n  How do you see this kind of dramatic increase in spending and taxing \nand debt affecting the character of the country as compared with, say, \ncountries in Europe or other countries around the world?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say that is getting to the heart of \nthe matter. We can talk about these numbers all day. They are mind-\nboggling, they are very difficult to take in. But what does it all mean \nat the end of the day? I will respond in two ways.\n  First of all, it makes us look a whole lot more like the countries in \nEurope that have been stagnating for years because they spend such a \nhigh percent of their gross national product on government. As the \nSenator from New Hampshire pointed out, we are headed in that direction \nunder this budget. It is a recipe for a lower standard of living in the \nUnited States and makes us look a lot more like Europe.\n  The second way goes back to the policy I think is embedded in this \nbudget. The President has been very candid about this. He talks about \nit as his blueprint. He says this budget is not about numbers, it is \nabout policies; it is about a blueprint for change. The Wall Street \nJournal on February 27 said:\n\n       With yesterday's fiscal 2010 budget proposal, President \n     Obama is attempting not merely to expand the role of the \n     federal government but to put it in such a dominant position \n     that its power can never be rolled back.\n\n  That is the problem. It is the growth of Government controlling all \nof these segments of our lives. That is what this spending is \nultimately all about, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, taking \nover the energy policy, taking over the health care, taking over the \neducation policy, as well as running our financial institutions. It is \nnot just about spending more money and creating more debt and taxing in \norder to try to help pay for some of that. It is also about a huge \nincrease in the growth of Government and therefore the control over our \nlives.\n  In a way, the Wall Street Journal says, ``In a way that can never be \nrolled back.''\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if either the Senator from Arizona or New \nHampshire would have a comment on the way that spending was \naccomplished in the stimulus bill. For example, in the Department of \nEducation, where I used to work, the annual budget was $68 billion. But \nthe stimulus added $40 billion per year to the department's budget for \nthe next 2 years. There were no hearings. There was no discussion about \nthis. No one said: Are we spending all the money we are spending now in \nthe right way, and if we were to spend more would we give parents more \nchoices? Would we create more charter schools? Would we, as the \nPresident said yesterday, of which I approve, spend some money to \nreward outstanding teachers?\n  What about the way this is being spent on energy, education, and \nMedicaid, for example?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator is absolutely right. The stimulus \npackage was a massive unfocused effort by people to fund things they \nliked. I don't think it was directed at stimulus. It was more directed \nat areas where people believed there needed to be more money, people \nwho served on the Appropriations Committee, and therefore they \nmassively funded those areas. Between the stimulus bill and the omnibus \nbill, there were 21 programs which received on average an 88-percent \nincrease in funds for 2009 compared to 2008; $155 billion more was \nspent on those programs for this year than last year. That is just a \nmassive explosion in the size of the Government. It is inconsistent \nwith what the purposes of a stimulus package should have been.\n  The stimulus package should have put money into the economy quickly \nfor purposes of getting the economy going. What this bill did was \nbasically, as you mentioned earlier, build programs that are going to \nbe very hard to rein in. The obligations are there. They are going to \nhave to be continued to be paid for, and, as the Senator from Arizona \npointed out, that was probably the goal: to fundamentally expand the \nsize of Government in a way that cannot be contracted.\n  Take simply, for example, a very worthwhile exercise which is NIH. \nThey received an extra $10 billion, I believe, on the stimulus package, \nfor 2 years of research. Research doesn't take 2 years. Research takes \nyears and years and years, so you know if you put in that type of money \nup front you are going to have to come in behind it and fill in those \ndollars in the outyears.\n  They basically said you are going to radically expand the size of \nthis initiative. The same thing happening in education. The same thing \nhappening in health care. That is where this number goes up so much, 23 \npercent of gross national product, and it goes up from there. The only \nway you pay for it is basically taxing our children to the point they \ncannot have as high a quality of life as we have.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I heard the Senator from Arizona say it was not just a \n$1 trillion stimulus package, that by the time you add in all these \nprojected costs in the future, it might be much more.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the number was $3.27 trillion. I believe that was \nthe correct number over the time of the 10 years.\n  The Senator from Tennessee certainly knows a bit about education. It \nall was not spent. There were some policies that actually attempted to \nreduce some costs--of a program that works very well, that thousands of \npeople in the District of Columbia depend upon to send their kids to \ngood schools. That is the program we put into effect to give a voucher \nof $7,500 a year to kids to attend private schools, kids who would \nnever have that opportunity otherwise.\n  If I could ask a question of my colleague from Tennessee, since as \nformer Secretary of Education he knows something about how to make sure \nour kids have the best opportunities for education in this country, \nwhy, with the District of Columbia costing about $15,000 a year to \neducate children and not doing a very good job of it according to all \nof the test scores, and thousands of parents wishing their kids had an \nalternative choice, somewhere else to go--when we create a program that \nprovides a few of them, less than 2,000 a year, I believe, with a \nvoucher that returns only half of that much money to the private \nschool--$7,500, so it doesn't cost the public anything--why, when it \ngives these kids such a great opportunity, would our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, and the President, whose two daughters, by the \nway, attend one of the schools that kids would have to be taken out of \nbecause they can't afford to go there without the voucher--why would \nthey remove that school choice and the voucher program?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is very hard to imagine, Senator Kyl. Just to make \nthe point we are not being personal about that, my son attended the \nsame school that the President's daughters attend when we were here and \nI was Education Secretary.\n  School vouchers may not be the solution in every rural county in \nAmerica, but in the District of Columbia, 1,700 children who are low-\nincome children have a chance to choose among private schools, their \nparents are delighted with the choice, and a study is coming out this \nspring to assess what they are learning. I do not know the motive \nbehind this, but I do know the National Education Association has made \nits reputation opposing giving low-income parents the same choices that \nwealthy people have. That is a poor policy and one we ought not to have \nstuck on an appropriations bill like that.\n  The President has shown good instincts on education. His Education \nSecretary is a good one. But had we had a chance to debate this in \ncommittee and to hear from them, perhaps we could have had a bipartisan \nagreement that we need to pay good teachers more, we need more charter\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nschools, and we need to give parents some more choices like these \nDistrict of Columbia parents.\n  I know our time is running short. I wonder if the Senator from New \nHampshire has any further thoughts about spending.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for taking this time. I \nthink it all comes down to these numbers. Really, what does spending \ndo? Sure it does a lot of good things, but in the end, if you don't pay \nfor it, it makes it more difficult for our country to succeed and for \nour children who inherit the debts to succeed. When you double the debt \nin 5 years because of the spending, and you triple it in 10 years, you \nare absolutely guaranteeing that you are passing on to our children a \ncountry where they will have less opportunities to succeed than our \ngeneration. That is not fair. It is simply not fair for one generation \nto do this to another generation. Yet that is what this budget proposes \nto do: to run up bills for our generation and take them and turn them \nover to our children and grandchildren at a rate greater than ever \nbefore, a rate of spending greater than has ever been seen before, and \na rate of increasing the debt that has never been conceived of before, \nthat you would triple the national debt in 10 years.\n  It is not fair, it is not right, it is not appropriate, and it \ncertainly is a major mistake, in my opinion.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Kyl, to conclude our discussion, this is the \nbeginning of a process in the Senate in which everyone in this country \ncan participate. We are asking that they consider: Can you afford this \namount of spending, this amount of borrowing, this amount of taxes? \nThere is a different path we could take toward the future.\n  Mr. KYL. Indeed. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. \nAs this debate unfolds, I think our colleagues will see that \nRepublicans have some better ideas. We want to spend less and tax less \nand borrow less. We believe we can accomplish great results in the \nfield of energy, for example, in the field of education, in the field \nof health care--much more positively, much better results in the long \nrun with a lot less burden on our children and our grandchildren in the \nfuture.\n  As this debate unfolds, we are very anxious to present our \nalternative views on how to accomplish these results.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) The Senator is notified that 28 \nminutes has elapsed.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \nand the Senator from New Hampshire for his views.\n  This is the beginning of a discussion about a 10-year blueprint \noffered by our new President about the direction in which our country \nshould go. We on the Republican side believe American families cannot \nafford this much new spending, this many new taxes, and this much new \ndebt. We will be suggesting why over the next 3 or 4 weeks, and in \naddition to that we will be offering our vision for the future. For \nexample, on energy, some things we agree with, such as conservation and \nefficiency; some things we would encourage more of, such as nuclear \npower for carbon-free electricity.\n  This is the beginning of a very important debate, and the direction \nin which it goes will dramatically influence the future of this country \nand make a difference to every single family, not just today's parents \nbut children and their children as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe equally charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today with great concern regarding \nthe nomination of Mr. David Ogden to serve as the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. There is no doubt that Mr. Ogden has a \nlong record of legal experience. He also, however, brings a long \nhistory of representation of the pornography industry and the \nopposition to laws designed to protect children from sexual \nexploitation.\n  He opposed the Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000 that would \nrestrict children's exposure to explicit online content. Mr. Ogden \nfiled an amicus brief supporting the American Library Association in a \ncase that challenged mandatory anti-obscenity Internet filters in \npublic libraries. He treated pornography like informative data, writing \nthat the ``imposition of mandatory filtering on public libraries \nimpairs the ability of librarians to fulfill the purposes of public \nlibraries--namely, assisting library patrons in their quest for \ninformation. . . .''\n  Mr. Ogden also argued against laws requiring pornography producers to \nverify that models were over 18 at the time their materials were made. \nThink of that. He challenged the Child Protection and Obscenity \nEnforcement Act of 1988 and a companion law adopted in 1990, the Child \nProtection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act. Mr. Ogden argued \nthat requiring pornography producers to personally verify that their \nmodels were over age 18 would ``burden too heavily and infringe too \ndeeply on the right to produce First Amendment-protected material.''\n  Among the many cases in which Mr. Ogden has advocated interests of \nthe pornography industry, none is more egregious than the position he \ntook in Knox v. the United States.\n  The facts in the next case are straightforward. Steven Knox was \nconvicted of receiving and possessing child pornography under the Child \nProtection Act after the U.S. Customs Service found in Mr. Knox's \napartment several videotapes of partially clothed girls, some as young \nas age 10, posing suggestively. Serving as counsel on an ACLU effort, \nMr. Ogden argued to strike down the 1992 conviction of Mr. Knox. On \nbehalf of the ACLU and other clients, Mr. Ogden submitted a Supreme \nCourt brief advocating the same statutory and constitutional positions \nas the Clinton Justice Department. Mr. Ogden's arguments stated that \nwhile nudity was a requirement for prosecution, nudity alone was \ninsufficient for prosecutions under child pornography statutes. Put \nsimply, Mr. Ogden argued that the defendant had been improperly \nconvicted because the materials in his possession would only qualify as \nchild pornography if children's body parts were indecently exposed.\n  In response, on November 3, 1993, the Senate, right here, passed a \nresolution by a vote of 100 to 0 condemning this interpretation of the \nlaw by Mr. Ogden. President Clinton then publicly rebuked the Solicitor \nGeneral, and Attorney General Reno overturned his position. Now the \nSenate is being asked to confirm as Deputy Attorney General someone who \nadvocated the same extreme position on a Federal child pornography \nstatute that the Senate unanimously repudiated 16 years ago.\n  The Supreme Court has ``recognized that there is a compelling \ninterest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of \nminors. This interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of \nliterature that is not obscene by adult standards.'' Pornography should \nnot be regarded as immune from regulation simply because it is deemed \n``free speech.''\n  Furthermore, child pornography in any form should not be tolerated. \nHow can Mr. Ogden's clear position on the right to unfettered access to \npornography not interfere with the Justice Department's responsibility \nto protect children from obscene material and exploitation?\n  When asked about this very issue at the Senate hearing on his \nnomination, Mr. Ogden said he hoped he would not be judged by arguments \nmade for clients. If we cannot judge him on his past positions, what \ncan we judge him on? Past performance is a great indicator of future \naction.\n  David Ogden is more than just a lawyer who has had a few unsavory \nclients. He has devoted a substantial part of his career, case after \ncase for 20 years, in defense of pornography. Ogden has profited from \nrepresenting pornographers and in attacking legislation designed to ban \nchild pornography. Should a man with a long list of pornographers as \npast clients, with a\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nrecord of objection to attempts to regulate this industry in order to \nprotect our children, be confirmed for our Nation's second highest law \nenforcement position? Is he the best choice to actively identify and \nprosecute those who seek to harm our children?\n  Highlights of the Department of Justice's budget request for the year \n2010 indicate an increased focus on educating and rehabilitating \ncriminals, while neglecting funding for vital child-safety programs \nsuch as the Adam Walsh Act. I believe Mr. Ogden's past positions, \ncoupled with the Department's growing trend to prioritize criminal \nrehabilitation over child safety, cause me great concern this \nafternoon.\n  There is not a quick and easy solution to the problems of child \nexploitation, but I can state unequivocally that we need a proactive \nand aggressive Department of Justice to take the steps necessary to \nattack this problem and demonstrate that protecting our children is a \ntop priority. I am not certain David Ogden will bring that leadership \nto the Department; therefore, I must oppose this nomination.\n  This vote is made with the belief that a person's past legal \npositions do mean a great deal. I think if most Americans knew what \nthis man has worked for and whom he has willingly represented, support \nfor his nomination would disappear. I do not believe his legal \nphilosophy, illustrated in the clients he freely chose to represent, \nreflects the majority's views on the issue of child exploitation. I \nknow certainly they do not reflect mine.\n\n\n                           Tragedy in Alabama\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to get into something else you have \nbeen reading about what happened in my State of Alabama yesterday. I \noffer my condolences to the families and friends of the victims killed \nin Samson, AL.\n  Yesterday, my State of Alabama suffered the worst mass shooting in \nour State's history. As this tragedy unfolded, our law enforcement \nresponded bravely. I commend them for their actions and efforts. I also \noffer my sincere sympathies to the victims, their families, and the \ncommunity. This is a tragedy that did not have to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Levin and Mr. Grassley pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 569 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak about the nomination \nof David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General of the Department of \nJustice. To summarize what I see in the Record, what I have read, I am \nvery disappointed in the Obama administration for nominating this \nindividual who is obviously talented but has also obviously chosen to \nrepresent, sometimes on a pro bono basis, groups that push pornography. \nHe even represented interests against child pornography laws that we \nhave passed by unanimous votes in the Senate.\n  Here is a gentleman who has taken up these causes as a lawyer. I \nappreciate his skill and ability as a lawyer. I appreciate his \nwillingness to represent a client. But he has chosen to consistently \nrepresent pornography companies and groups. Even against the unanimous \nopinion of this body on child pornography cases, he has taken the other \nside. The message that sends across the country to people--when we are \nstruggling with a huge wave of pornography, and then, at the worst end \nof it, child pornography--the message it sends around the rest of the \ncountry is this is a Justice Department that is not going to enforce \nthese child pornography laws or is not concerned about this, when we \nhave an epidemic wave of pornography, and particularly of child \npornography, that is striking across the United States, and that this \nis harming our children. It is harming our society overall. Now, at the \nsecond to the top place of enforcement, you are putting your Deputy \nAttorney General who has taken on these cases, and sometimes in a pro \nbono manner.\n\n  I have no doubt of his legal skills. But the message this sends \nacross the country to parents, who are struggling to raise kids, is not \na good one. Our office has been receiving all sorts of calls opposed to \nMr. Ogden's nomination because of that very feature--and deeply \nconcerned calls because they are struggling within their own families \nto try to raise kids, to try to raise kids responsibly, and to try to \nraise them in a culture that oftentimes is very difficult with the \namount of violent material, sexual material that is out there, and \nhoping their Government can kind of back them a little bit and say: \nThese things are wrong. Child pornography is wrong. It should not take \nplace. It should not be on the Internet. And you should not participate \nin it.\n  Instead, to then nominate somebody who has represented groups \nsupporting that dispirits a number of parents and says: Is not even my \nGovernment and its enforcement arms going to take this on? Are they not \ngoing to be concerned about this, as I am concerned about it as a \nparent? I see it pop up on the Internet, on the screen, at our home way \ntoo often, and I do not want to see this continue to take place. Then \nalong comes this nominee, who knocks the legs out from under a number \nof parents.\n  I want to give one quick fact on this that startled me when I was \nlooking at it. It is about the infiltration of pornography into the \npopular culture, and particularly directly into our homes, and now it \nis an issue that all families grapple with, our family has grappled \nwith. My wife and I have five children. Three of them are out of the \nhousehold now. We still have two of them at home. We grapple and \nwrestle with this. Once relatively difficult to procure, pornography is \nnow so pervasive that it is freely discussed on popular, prime-time \ntelevision shows. The statistics on the number of children who have \nbeen exposed to pornography are alarming.\n  A recent study found that 34 percent of adolescents reported being \nexposed to unwanted--this is even unsolicited; unwanted--sexual content \nonline, a figure that, sadly, had risen 9 percent over the last 5 \nyears. Madam President, 9 out of 10 children between the ages of 8 and \n16 who have Internet access have viewed porn Web sites--9 out of 10 \nchildren between the ages of 8 and 16 who have Internet access have \nviewed porn Web sites--usually in the course of looking up information \nfor homework.\n  It is a very addictive situation we have today. I held a hearing \nseveral years back about the addictiveness of pornography, and we had \nexperts in testifying that this is now the most addictive substance out \nin the U.S. society today because once it gets into your head, you \ncannot like dry off or dry out of it.\n  The situation is alarming on its impact on marriages. There is strong \nevidence that marriages are also adversely affected by addiction to \nsexually addictive materials. At a past meeting of the American Academy \nof Matrimonial Lawyers, two-thirds of the divorce lawyers who attended \nsaid that excessive interest in online pornography played a significant \nrole in divorces in the previous year. That is two-thirds of the \ndivorce lawyers saying this is getting to be a situation that is \nimpacting so many of our clients and is so pervasive.\n  While David Ogden possesses impressive academic credentials, and he \ncertainly is a talented lawyer, he has also represented several \nclients, significant clients, with views far outside the mainstream, \nand he has not, to my satisfaction, disavowed the views of these \nclients. He was given every chance to in hearings. He was trying to be \npinned down by people on the committee about: What are your views? I \nunderstand your clients' views. What are your views? And he would not \nrespond to those.\n  He said: Well, these are views of my clients. I understand the views \nof your clients. If they are pushing pornography, child pornography, \nwant to have access to this, I understand that. What are your views? \nAnd he demurred each time and would not respond clearly.\n  Based on that record, I am led to believe it is highly likely David \nOgden\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nmay share the views of some of his clients--of those who have supported \npornography--and I cannot trust him to enforce some of our Nation's \nmost important antichild pornography laws--laws that he has a history \nof arguing are unconstitutional. That is a position he took as a \nlawyer: that these are unconstitutional, antichild pornography laws.\n  In an amicus brief David Ogden filed in United States v. American \nLibrary Association, he argued that the Children's Internet Protection \nAct, which requires libraries receiving Federal funds to protect \nchildren from online pornography on library computers, censored \nconstitutionally protected material and that Congress was violating the \nfirst amendment rights of library patrons. Now, that was the position \nDavid Ogden took.\n  In a response to written questions submitted by Senator Grassley \nafter his confirmation hearing, David Ogden indicated he served as pro \nbono counsel--for people who are not lawyers, that means he did it for \nfree--in this case, further calling into question his personal views. \nIf you are willing to represent a client for free, it seems to me there \nis some discussion or possibility you may really share your client's \nviews on this issue regarding access to online pornography at \nlibraries.\n  The Children's Internet Protection Act passed this body, the Senate, \nby a vote of 95 to 3 back in 2000. Ninety-five Members of this body \nbelieved the Children's Internet Protection Act was an appropriate \nmeasure to protect children from Internet filth and was constitutional \nbecause our duty, as well, is to stand for the Constitution and to \nabide by the Constitution and uphold it.\n  How can we trust David Ogden to enforce this law when he argued \nagainst it as a pro bono counsel?\n  In another very disturbing case, Knox v. the United States, in which \nStephen Knox was charged and convicted for violating antichild \npornography laws--these are child pornography laws but child \npornography laws which I think are in another thoroughly disgusting \ncategory--David Ogden filed a brief on behalf of the ACLU and others \nchallenging the Federal child pornography statutes. At issue in this \ncase was how child pornography is defined under the Federal statutes.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues will remember the controversy that \nsurrounded this case. As you may recall, Stephen Knox was prosecuted by \nthe Bush Justice Department--during the first Bush Presidency--and \nultimately convicted, after U.S. Customs intercepted foreign videotapes \nhe had ordered. By the time his conviction was appealed, however, \nPresident Clinton was in office, and the Justice Department changed its \nposition on Knox's conviction. Drew Days, Clinton's Solicitor General \nat the time, chose not to defend the conviction of Knox.\n  The Clinton Justice Department said: Yes, he is convicted, but we are \nnot going to prosecute this. But the Senate, by a vote of 100 to 0--\nwhich is really rare to get around this place--and the House, by a vote \nof 425 to 3, rejected the Clinton Justice Department's interpretation \nof the child porn laws. The Senate unanimously said: Prosecute this. \nProsecute this child pornography case.\n  David Ogden was on the wrong side of this case. I urge my colleagues \nto consider whether a man who has taken such extreme positions on \npornography, and especially child pornography, can be trusted to \nenforce Federal laws prohibiting this cultural toxic waste. I am not \nconvinced that David Ogden does not share the views he advocated in the \nKnox case, and I am concerned that at the very least he may be \nsympathetic to the views of his former clients.\n  I hope David Ogden proves me wrong and he demonstrates a strong \nwillingness to enforce Federal child pornography and obscenity laws. \nThese laws are on the books. I hope he enforces them. But I cannot in \ngood conscience vote in favor of his nomination given his past record \nand the positions he has taken. His past positions have been far too \nextreme and outside of the mainstream for me, or I think for most \nAmericans, and certainly for most parents, to be able to support him to \nbe No. 2 in command of the Justice Department that enforces these laws.\n  I realize many of my colleagues, and likely the majority, are going \nto cast their votes in favor of David Ogden. Before they do, I ask them \nto please consider the negative impact pornography has had--and \nparticularly child pornography has had--on this society and the \nimportant role the Justice Department plays in protecting children from \nobscene and pornographic material, particularly child pornography.\n  The infiltration of pornography into our popular culture and our \nhomes is an issue that every family now grapples with. Once relatively \ndifficult to procure, it is now so pervasive that it is freely \ndiscussed all over. Pornography has become both pervasive and intrusive \nin print and especially on the Internet. Lamentably, pornography is now \nalso a multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. While sexually explicit \nmaterial is often talked about in terms of ``free speech,'' too little \nhas been said about its devastating effects on users and their \nfamilies.\n  According to many legal scholars, one reason for the industry's \ngrowth is a legal regime that has undermined the whole notion that \nillegal obscenity can be prosecuted. The Federal judiciary continues to \nchallenge our ability to protect our families and our children from \ngratuitous pornographic images, and we must have a Justice Department \nthat is committed to combating this most extreme form of pornography.\n  Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the pornographic epidemic is child \npornography. This is where Mr. Ogden's record is most disturbing \nbecause he is outside of even the minimal consensus on pornographic \nprosecutions that exist. Children as young as 5 years old are being \nused for profit in this, regrettably, fast-growing industry. While \nthere has been very little consensus on the prosecution of even the \nmost hard-core adult pornography, there has been widespread agreement \non the necessity of going after the purveyors of child porn. Despite \nthis agreement, this exploitive industry continues to thrive. Every \nday, there are approximately 116,000 online searches for child \npornography--116,000. I think we can all agree that we have a duty to \nprotect the weakest members of our society from exploitation and from \nabuse.\n  I fear David Ogden will be a step backward--and certainly sends that \nsignal across our society and to our parents and our families in this \neffort to combat this most dangerous form of pornography. For those \nreasons, I will be casting a ``no'' vote on his confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Obama Budget\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, a couple weeks ago the Obama \nadministration released an outline of its budget plan for fiscal year \n2010. The budget is a plan that reflects the President's agenda and \npriorities for the fiscal year.\n  The document with which most of our colleagues are quite familiar \nwith by now is entitled, ``A New Era of Responsibility--Renewing \nAmerica's Promise.'' While this is a nice title for which I commend the \nPresident, it does not sound like the appropriate name for a work of \nfiction. Because of the impact of the policies outlined in this budget, \na more fitting title might be, ``How To End America's Global Leadership \nand Prosperity Without Really Trying.'' Even better, it sounds more \nlike a 1973 Disney animation entitled ``Robinhood.''\n  In this Oscar-nominated movie about a legendary outlaw, I think a \ncolloquy between Little John and Robinhood sums it up best. Little John \nsaid:\n\n       You know somethin', Robin? I was just wonderin', are we \n     good guys or bad guys? You know, I mean our robbing the rich \n     to give to the poor.\n\n  Robinhood responded:\n\n       Rob? Tsk, tsk, tsk. That's a naughty word. We never rob. We \n     just sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.\n\n  Simply stated, this budget declares war on American jobs and on the \nability of American businesses to save or\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\ncreate them. It is bitingly ironic, since on the first page of the \nbudget message the President said that the time has come, ``not only to \nsave and create new jobs, but also to lay a new foundation for \ngrowth.''\n  The only thing this budget lays the foundation of growth for is more \nGovernment spending and more taxes.\n  Indeed, this budget is so bad, it is hard to know where to begin to \ndescribe what is wrong with it. But let's start with the tax provisions \nbeginning on page 122 of the budget. Right there in black and white are \nthe administration's plans to increase taxes on American businesses--\nthe only entities that can create and save jobs on a permanent basis--\nby a minimum of $1.636 trillion over 10 years. I say ``minimum'' \nbecause the total amount may be much higher, as I will explain a little \nlater in my remarks.\n  This budget is a masterpiece of contradiction. For example, it \npromises the largest tax increases known to humankind while promising \ntax cuts to 95 percent of working families. In reality, the President \nwants to play Robinhood by redistributing trillions of dollars from \nthose who already pay the lion's share of this Nation's income taxes \nand give a significant portion of it, through refundable tax credits, \nto those who now pay no income taxes at all.\n  The budget promises millions of jobs to be saved or created but takes \naway the very means for the private sector to perform this job creation \nthrough increases in capital gains taxes, carried interest, and the top \nindividual rates where most business income is taxed.\n  The budget is also contradictory to stimulating the economy. On one \nhand, it claims to provide $72 billion in tax cuts for businesses, but \non the other hand, the budget raises $353 billion in new taxes on \nbusinesses, not counting the hundreds of billions--perhaps trillions--\nmore in so-called ``climate revenues.''\n  The budget decries the role of housing in bringing about our economic \ncrisis. It reduces the value of millions of homes by reducing the value \nof the home mortgage interest deduction. The budget talks about \nstruggling families but reduces the incentive for taxpayers with the \nmeans to donate to charity to do so.\n  The President claims this budget is free from the trickery and budget \ngimmicks that have characterized those of previous administrations, but \nhe then assumes the extension of all the 2001 and 2003 tax relief and \nthe AMT patch into the baseline and then eliminates some of the same \ntax relief and counts it as new revenue. I could go on and on about \nother contradictions and ironies in this budget outline, and this is \nlikely just a preview. Wait until we get all the details.\n  The budget outline indicates tax increases of $990 billion over the \nnext 10 years in so-called ``loophole closers'' and ``upper income tax \nprovisions dedicated to deficit reduction.'' This is in addition to at \nleast $646 billion more in so-called ``climate revenues.''\n  In short, President Obama is proposing to raise taxes at a time when \nwe are in a recession. The last time we raised taxes during a \nrecession, we went into a depression.\n  The President claims these tax hikes will not take effect until 2011, \nwhen he believes the economy will recover. This is in itself a huge \ncontradiction. Why is it not a good idea to raise taxes this year, but \nit is OK to do so 2 years hence, when most economists believe we will \njust begin to recover from the most serious downturn since the 1930s? \nHuge new taxes in 2011 may be as dangerous to our long-term recovery as \nputting them in place right now. I find it very interesting that the \nnew administration and many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle recognize tax increases have a negative effect on economic \ngrowth. So please explain again why they would be a good idea 2 years \nfrom now. If the President believes the economy will have recovered by \n2011, then why does he keep using the fear of a looming, deep recession \nto push forward his spending projects? Is it because he knows the \neconomy will rebound with or without the ``Making Work Pay'' tax credit \nfor funding for infrastructure? This budget would make the Making Work \nPay tax credit permanent. If this credit, which costs the taxpayers \n$116 billion for just 2 years in the stimulus bill and would cost more \nthan half a trillion dollars over 10 years in this budget, is a \nstimulus measure, as we were told, why is it included in the \nPresident's budget beyond 2011, when he predicts the economy to \nrecover?\n  Let us take a look at the single largest tax increase proposal in the \nhistory of the world--a huge tax on middle-income people--the so-called \n``climate revenues'' that are listed at $646 billion over 10 years. The \nproponents of this job-killing idea call it a ``cap-and-trade'' \nauction, but it is, in reality, nothing more than a gargantuan new tax \non American businesses. Moreover, a close look at the footnotes of the \ntables reveals that this $646 billion is not even the extent of this \nnew tax on American industry. The footnotes indicate this is just the \nportion of the new tax hike that will be used to pay for the Making \nWork Pay credit permanent and for clean energy initiatives. Additional \nrevenues will be used to ``further compensate the public.'' It sounds \nlike more income distribution to me.\n  In a briefing of staff last week, top administration officials \nadmitted these revenues could be two to three times higher than the \n$646 billion listed in the budget. That means this tax could reach as \nhigh as $1.9 trillion--a $1.9 trillion tax increase. That is insane. So \nwhat we have in this first part is a brandnew tax increase on the \nindustrial output of the United States of America, a tax that has never \nbeen levied before and which could raise as much as $1.9 trillion over \n10 years, and this budget says it is all right because the proceeds of \nthe new tax will go to ``compensate the public.''\n  Now, this $1 trillion-plus tax increase will mean businesses will \nhave less money to hire new employees or pay salaries of existing \nemployees. How are we going to compensate the hundreds of thousands or \nperhaps millions of workers who are employed by these industries when \nthey lose their jobs because their companies can no longer compete \nbecause of this new tax? Will that be part of ``compensating the \npublic''?\n  The next highest category of tax increases is almost as bad. The \nbudget outline indicates it would raise $637 billion over 10 years by \nallowing some of the job-creating tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 to expire \nat the end of 2010. Now, these massive tax increases are touted as \nhitting only the so-called wealthy in our society; those who, in \nanother part of the budget--page 14--are referred to as the few ``well \noff and well connected'' on whom the Government ``recklessly'' showered \ntax cuts and handouts over the past 8 years.\n  What this gross mischaracterization does not say is, many of these \nsame individuals are the ones who have the ability to save or create \nthe very jobs we need to turn our economy around.\n\n  What the Obama administration and many Democrats in Congress refuse \nto recognize is the fact that a majority of the income earned by small- \nand medium-sized businesses in America is taxed through the individual \ntax system. In other words, many of these small businesses pay their \ntaxes as individuals, and they will thus be subject to these huge tax \nincreases.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, over \nhalf the Nation's private sector workers are employed by small \nbusinesses. Moreover, 50 percent of the owners of these businesses fall \ninto the top two tax brackets which are the ones being targeted for big \ntax increases by the Obama budget. Let me repeat that. Fifty percent of \nthe owners of these small businesses fall into the top two tax \nbrackets, which are the ones being targeted for the big tax increases \nby the Obama budget.\n  The Small Business Administration tells us that 70 percent of all new \njobs each year are created by small businesses. Why in the world would \nwe want to harm the ability of America's job creation engines--small \nbusinesses--to help us create or save the jobs we so badly need right \nnow? Why would we want to harm their ability? This is sheer folly.\n  President Obama claims he is providing tax relief to 95 percent of \nAmericans. If you look closely, you will see that the budget raises the \ncost of living for lower wage earners. How? The budget raises $31 \nbillion in taxes from domestic oil and gas companies. At a time when we \nare trying to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, we are\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nforcing oil companies to raise the price of gas at the pump. This \nincrease in gas prices at the pump will have a greater impact on lower \nincome wage earners than on anyone else.\n  I think this cartoon illustrated by David Fitzsimmons of the Arizona \nDaily Star, with a few of my edits, says it best: We will create 4 \nmillion jobs out of one side, and we will raise taxes on those who \ncreate those jobs on the other. That is a little harsh, but it kind of \nmakes its point. I don't like to see our President depicted this way, \nbut I have to admit it is a pretty good cartoon.\n  The budget outline also opens the door to universal health care by \ncreating a 10-year, $634 billion ``reserve fund'' to partially pay for \nthe vast expansion of the U.S. health care system, an overhaul that \ncould cost as much as $1 trillion over 10 years. This expansion is \nfinanced, in part, by reducing payments to insurers, hospitals, and \nphysicians. Already I am being deluged by hospitals and physicians. How \nare they going to survive if they get hammered this way? Now, most \npeople don't have much sympathy for hospitals and physicians, but it \ndoes take money to run those outfits, and to take as much as $1 \ntrillion over 10 years by reducing payments in part to insurers and \nhospitals is pretty serious. Highlights of these reductions include \ncompetitive bidding for Medicare Advantage, realigning home health \npayment rates, and by lowering hospital reimbursement rates for certain \nadmissions.\n  Almost one-third of the health reserve fund would be financed by \nforcing private health plans participating in the Medicare Advantage \nProgram to go through a competitive bidding process to determine annual \npayment rates. I wish to remind my colleagues that in the past, \nMedicare managed care plans left rural States due to low payments. Utah \nwas one of the States that was severely impacted. I know my State was \nhurt by it.\n  Many other States were hurt as well, especially rural States. To \ncorrect this situation, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \nworked with both the Clinton and Bush administrations to address this \nissue in a bipartisan manner by creating statutory language to create \npayment floors for Medicare Advantage Plans. As a result, Medicare \nbeneficiaries across the country have access to Medicare Advantage \nPlans, and 90 percent of them seem to be happy with those plans.\n  By implementing a competitive bidding process for Medicare Advantage, \nchoice for beneficiaries in the Medicare Advantage program will be \nlimited.\n  It is unclear whether Medicare Advantage programs will continue in \nrural parts of our country--areas such as Utah, where Medicare payments \nare notoriously low. You can go on and on with the many small States \nthat are represented by Senators on the Finance Committee--including \nme.\n  I served as a key negotiator on the House-Senate conference that \ncreated the Medicare Advantage program. I cannot support any initiative \nthat I believe will limit beneficiaries' choices in coverage under this \nprogram.\n  Another outrage and irresponsible attack on U.S. jobs is contained in \nthe proposal the budget calls ``implement international enforcement, \nreform deferral, and other tax reform policies.'' This line item is \nestimated to raise $210 billion over 10 years. This vague description \ncan really mean only one thing: The Obama administration plans to tax \nthe foreign subsidiaries of all U.S.-owned businesses on their earnings \nwhether they send the money back to the United States or keep it \ninvested in a foreign country. This is similar to requiring individual \ntaxpayers to pay taxes each year if the value of their home or \ninvestments goes up even if they do not sell them.\n  The real danger of this proposal, however, is its impact on U.S. \ncompanies and their ability to compete in the global marketplace. \nAlmost all of our major trading partners tax their home-based \nbusinesses only on what they earn at home. The rest of the world taxes \nit that way. They don't tax their businesses for moneys earned overseas \nthat don't come back. Those moneys are taxed there. The U.S. system is \npractically the only worldwide system in the industrialized world.\n  What this means is that an American company that is competing for \nbusiness in some other nation--let's say India--may have competitors \nfrom France, the UK, and Germany. Because these other nations don't tax \ntheir companies on profits earned in countries other than the home \ncountry, they would enjoy a significant competitive advantage over any \nU.S. company, which, under the Obama proposal, would have to pay U.S. \ntaxes on any profits earned. The result would simply be that \nmultinational businesses would shun the United States and relocate \nelsewhere, as many have already done. A lot of Fortune 500 companies \nhave left our country, in part because of tax ideas such as this. They \ndon't want to go. U.S. firms will become ripe for international \ntakeovers, and we would lose our global leadership, prestige, market \nshare, jobs, and the bright future our country has enjoyed for decades.\n  In 1960, 18 of the world's largest companies were headquartered in \nthe United States. Today, just eight are based in the United States. We \nhave the largest corporate tax rates of any major country in the world. \nCan you imagine, if we reduced those rates, as I and other Republicans \nhave suggested, from 35 to 25 percent, the jobs that would be \nautomatically created? I cannot begin to tell you.\n  In 1960, we had 18 of the world's largest companies right here in the \nUnited States. Today, we only have eight based in the United States, \npartly because of these stupid, idiotic tax changes. If we pass this \nproposal, within a short time, there will be none. I predict that. The \nUnited States will be the last place on Earth businesses will want to \nlocate.\n  I will show you this poster: Effect of Taxing U.S.-owned \nSubsidiaries. The United States has the second highest corporate tax \nrate. Again, in 1960, 18 of the world's largest companies were \nheadquartered here. Today, only eight of the world's largest companies \nare headquartered in the United States. This is part of the reason.\n  The President believes our Tax Code includes incentives for U.S. \nbusinesses to ship jobs overseas, and this proposal is an attempt to \nend this practice. However, the evidence shows that our tax laws do not \nlead to U.S. job loss but to increases in U.S. employment when \ncompanies invest overseas.\n  We have all heard the accusations, time after time, right here on the \nSenate floor. It goes something like this: U.S. companies close their \nplants here, laying off all of their workers, just to move their \nproduction to a lower wage paying country, where those same goods are \nmade with cheap labor and then shipped right back into the United \nStates. Well, these accusations are largely unfounded. In 2006, just 9 \npercent of sales of U.S.-controlled corporations were made back to the \nUnited States. Our companies are not sending production jobs for U.S. \nproducts overseas. Instead, they are making products overseas for the \noverseas market, and they are doing it for solid business reasons, such \nas transportation savings, not for tax reasons.\n  Moreover, the evidence shows that the U.S. plants of companies \nwithout foreign operations pay lower wages than domestic plants of \nU.S.-owned multinational companies. This means companies that have \noverseas operations pay more to their U.S. workers than those that do \nnot invest in other nations.\n  Studies by respected economists show that increasing foreign \ninvestment is associated with greater U.S. investment and higher U.S. \nwages. Overseas investment by U.S. companies is generally a good thing \nfor the U.S. economy and for U.S. jobs. Attacking the deferral rule, as \nthe Obama budget proposes, would do horrendous damage to our ability to \ncompete in an increasingly global economy and will lead to our loss of \nworld industrial leadership.\n  Just this week, I talked to one of the leading pharmaceutical CEOs in \nAmerica. This leader and his family all came to America. They love this \ncountry. They don't want to leave. He made it very clear that if this \ntype of tax law goes through, he is going to move to a more fair \ncountry. He will have to in order to compete. He probably will move his \noperations to Switzerland, where they are not treated like this. He \ndoesn't want to do that--leave this beloved country--but to compete he \nwould have to. All those jobs would go from here to there. I don't know \nwho is thinking about this in the Obama administration, but they better \nstart thinking about it.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n  I could go on about why this is the worst budget proposal I have seen \nin all of my nearly 33 years in this body. However, I will simply focus \non one more reason.\n  President Obama has said this budget would allow us to reduce the \nFederal deficit by half over the next 4 years. While this is a noble \ngoal, unfortunately, it is not one he can claim. Using the only common \nbaseline there is, which assumes no change to current law, the deficit \nwould decline--if we had no changes in current law--from $1.428 \ntrillion in 2009 to $156 billion in 2013. That is including the \nexpiring tax cuts. To put it in other words, if we do nothing, \naccording to CBO, the deficit would decline by 90 percent over the next \n4 years. Let me say that again. If we do nothing, the Federal deficit \nwould decline by 90 percent, according to the estimates. President \nObama proposes to reduce that decline to 50 percent by adding more \nGovernment spending.\n  I wish President Obama would follow his own lofty rhetoric. He says \nhe wants to save and create jobs. We all do. But the way to do it is \nnot through the job-killing policies found in this budget. He said it \nis time for honest and forthright budgeting. But this document is just \na means for him to put forth his ultraliberal philosophy while claiming \nto be fiscally responsible. As you can see from this cartoon, the \nPresident talks the talk, but this budget doesn't walk the walk. Again, \nI know he probably laughs at these things, as I do when they do it to \nme. I don't want to treat the President like that, but it does make the \npoint. He talks bipartisanship, he talks fiscal responsibility, but \neverything they are doing can be called irresponsible by good people \nwho understand economics.\n\n  Look, I happen to like this President. I happen to want him to \nsucceed. I care for the man. He is bright, articulate, and charismatic. \nI think that is apparent by the way the general public treats him. They \nwant him to succeed. I do too. He doesn't write this budget himself. I \ndon't blame him for this, except it is under his auspices that it is \nbeing touted. He has bright people around him. It is tough to find \npeople brighter than Larry Summers; I think a lot of him. Joe Biden is \nvery bright, and he knows a little bit about this. Joe admits that he \nis a self-confessed liberal. They are allowing this to go forward at a \ntime when they are going to hurt this country rather than help it. I \nthink we have to point some of these things out, and hopefully the \nPresident will see some of these things and say: Holy cow, I didn't \nrealize this was in the budget. It is pretty hard because most people \ndon't know what is in the budget. I doubt he has had a chance to read \nit. I want him to succeed, but he is not going to succeed with this \nkind of a budget.\n  This country is resilient, and maybe the country will pull out of \nthis no matter what he does. I think we are in very trying times. This \nis the greatest country in the world. I don't want to see it diminished \nin any way. I am prepared to do things--people know that around here--\nto bring people together on both sides and help this President be \nsuccessful. He has made overtures to me, and I very much respect him \nand I appreciate that. I want to help him.\n  I have to tell you that one of the reasons I am giving these remarks \ntoday is because I am very concerned about this type of a budget. We \nhave put up with this kind of stuff in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. It is time to quit doing it and start facing realities \nin this country. I see as much as a $5 trillion deficit in the near \nfuture. It is hard to even conceive of that. Yet that is where we are \nheaded.\n  I want Mr. Geithner to succeed. Everybody knows I stood firmly for \nhim in spite of all of the problems. He is a very bright guy, and I \nhope he succeeds. I will do what I can to help him, as a member on the \nFinance Committee and other committees as well.\n  They are not going to succeed with this type of budget. If they do, \nit will only be temporary. Our kids are going to pay these costs. They \nare going to pay for this mess. Elaine and I have 23 grandchildren I am \nconcerned about, and 3 great-grandchildren. I don't want to stick them \nlike this. I hope the President will get into it a little bit more, and \nI hope Larry Summers will get into it a little bit more. I think they \nhave been taking advantage of a crisis to pass a huge welfare agenda \nthat is going to hurt this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been watching the nominations \nfrom President Obama with quite a bit of concern. When I go back to my \nState of Oklahoma, people say: What would happen to us if we didn't pay \nour taxes? And I thought it couldn't get much worse than that.\n  I am here today to make sure everyone focuses attention on a couple \nof nominations that I think are outrageous.\n  First is my opposition to the nomination of David Ogden to be the \nU.S. Deputy Attorney General. Last year, Congress passed a significant \npiece of legislation, the Protect Our Children Act, to address a \ngrowing problem of child pornography and exploitation. Both sides of \nthe aisle hailed it as a great success. Democrats and Republicans \nthought that was great; we are going to protect our kids against child \npornography and exploitation. While I proudly supported that \nlegislation, I am shocked President Obama has nominated a candidate to \nserve in the No. 2 position in the Department of Justice who has \nrepeatedly represented the pornography industry and its interests.\n  As we are witnessing a significant increase in the exploitation of \nchildren on the Internet, we do not need a Deputy Attorney General who \nwill be dedicated to protecting children with that kind of a \nbackground. David Ogden has represented the pornography industry for a \nlong period of time.\n  In United States v. American Library Association, Ogden challenged \nthe Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000. I remember that well. \nWe passed it here. He filed a brief with the Supreme Court opposing \nInternet filters that block pornography at public libraries. He \nchallenged provisions of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement \nAct of 1988 which seeks to prevent the exploitation of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable population; that is, our children. He instead fought \nfor the interests of the pornography industry.\n  As a grandfather of 12 grandchildren, I am confident that I stand \nwith virtually all of the parents and grandparents around this country \nin opposing gross misinterpretations of our Constitution some use to \njustify the exploitation of women and children in the name of free \nspeech. That is what was happening. That is David Ogden.\n  Some claim Ogden is simply serving his clients. Yet his extensive \nrecord in representing the pornography industry is pretty shocking, \nespecially considering he has been nominated to serve in the Government \nagency that is responsible for prosecuting violations of Federal adult \nand children pornography laws.\n  Let's keep in mind, he is in the position of prosecuting the \noffenders of these laws, and yet he has spent his career representing \nthe pornography industry.\n  Additionally, his failure to affirm the right to life gives me a \ngreat concern. I don't think that is uncharacteristic of most of the \nnominees of this President. No one is pro-life that I know of, that I \nhave seen.\n  In the Hartigan case, Ogden coauthored a brief arguing that parental \nnotification was an unconstitutional burden for a 14-year-old girl \nseeking to have an abortion. In the case of abortion, parents have the \nright to know.\n  Furthermore, as a private attorney, Ogden filed a brief in the case \nof Planned Parenthood v. Casey in opposition to informing women of the \nemotional and psychological risks of abortion. In the brief, he denied \nthe potential mental health problems of abortion on women. This is what \nhe wrote. The occupier of the chair is a woman. I think it is \ninteresting when men are making their interpretation as to what \nfeelings women have.\n  He wrote this. Again, this is the same person we are talking about, \nDavid Ogden. He said:\n\n       Abortion rarely causes or exacerbates psychological or \n     emotional problems . . . she is\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n     more likely to experience feelings of relief and happiness, \n     and when child-birth and child-rearing or adoption may pose \n     concomitant . . . risks or adverse psychological effects . . \n     .\n\n  What he is saying is it is a relief. This is something he finds not \noffensive at all. He is actually promoting abortions.\n  We have to be honest. We need to talk about the mounting evidence of \nharmful physical and emotional effects that abortion has on women.\n  For these reasons, I oppose his nomination.\n  I also want to address my opposition to the nomination of Elena Kagan \nto serve as Solicitor General. Because of its great importance, quite \noften they talk about the Solicitor General as the tenth Supreme Court \nJustice and, therefore, it requires a most exemplary candidate. She \nserved as the dean of Harvard Law School, which is no doubt an \nimpressive credential. However, in that role, she demonstrated poor \njudgment on a very important issue to me.\n  While serving as the dean of Harvard Law School, Kagan banned the \nmilitary from recruiting on campus. We have to stop and remember what \nhappened in this case. In order to protect the rights of people to \nrecruit--we are talking about the military now--on campuses to present \ntheir case--nothing mandatory, just having an option for the young \nstudents--Jerry Solomon--at that time I was serving in the House of \nRepresentatives with him--had an amendment that ensured that schools \ncould not deny military recruiters access to college campuses. Claiming \nthe Solomon amendment was immoral, she filed an amicus brief with the \nSupreme Court in Rumsfeld v. FAIR opposing the amendment. The Court \nunanimously ruled against her position and affirmed that the Solomon \namendment was constitutional.\n  It is interesting, for a split division it might be different. This \nis unanimous on a diverse Court.\n  I also express my opposition to two other Department of Justice \nnominees--Dawn Johnsen and Thomas Pirelli. Dawn Johnson, who has been \nnominated to serve as Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal \nCounsel, has an extensive record of promoting a radical pro-abortion \nagenda. She has gone to great lengths to challenge pro-life provisions, \nincluding parental consent and notification laws. She has even inserted \non behalf of the ACLU that ``Our position is that there is no `father' \nand no `child'--just a fetus.''\n  As a pro-life Senator who believes each child is the creation of a \nloving God, I believe life is sacred. I cannot in good conscience \nconfirm anyone who has served as the legal director for the National \nAbortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The right to life is \nundeniable, indisputable, and unequivocal. It is a foundational right, \na moral fiber fundamental to the strength and vitality of this great \nNation.\n\n  For a similar reason I can't support the nomination of Thomas \nPerrelli to serve as Associate Attorney General. Keep in mind now, we \nare talking about the four top positions in the Justice Department. And \nlike other nominees I have discussed today, Mr. Perrelli has failed to \naffirm and protect the dignity of all human life, as an advocate for \neuthanasia, and I think we know the background of that.\n  I would only repeat that these are not people with just an opinion, \nthey are extremists. We are talking about someone in the No. 2 position \nof the Department of Justice who actually has been involved in \nrepresenting the pornography industry, and this is something that is \ntotally unacceptable.\n  I think as we look at these nominations, I suggest that those \nindividuals who are supporting these look very carefully, because \npeople are going to ask you the question: How do you justify putting \nsomeone who supports pornography, who has worked for it and been paid \nby that industry, in the No. 2 position in the Justice Department?\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here to speak in favor of David \nOgden to be the next Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\n  I have listened to my colleague and friend from Oklahoma, and I am \nnot going to be able to respond to everything he said about every \nnominee, but I did want to talk today about Mr. Ogden. He is someone \nwho I believe should be our next Deputy Attorney General, at a \nDepartment of Justice that is much in need of a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and he is someone who will hit the ground running. He will \nbeef up civil rights and antitrust enforcement. He will address white-\ncollar crime and drug-related violence, as well as help to keep our \ncountry safe from terrorist attacks.\n  We know the to-do list and the demands on the next Deputy Attorney \nGeneral will be great. Part of why it will be so great is something \nthat I saw in my own State. We had a gem of a U.S. Attorney General \nOffice in Minnesota, and we still do, but there was a period of time \nwhere I saw its destruction and rot by putting one political appointee \nin charge of that office. It was a huge mistake. The office was in an \nuproar. They got away from their regular mission. Luckily, Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey put in a career prosecutor, Frank McGill, who has put \nthe office back on track, and I thank him for that. We have suggested--\nrecommended--a new name to the Attorney General and the President for \nthe next U.S. Attorney in Minnesota. But I tell you that story for a \nreason, and that is justice is important and order is important and \nmanagement is important in our criminal justice system. We went so far \naway from that when Alberto Gonzalez was the Attorney General. That is \nwhy it is so important to have David Ogden in there to work with Eric \nHolder.\n  David Ogden has demonstrated intelligence and judgment, leadership \nand strength of character and, most importantly, a commitment to the \nDepartment of Justice. He has the experience and the integrity, I say \nto my colleagues, to serve as the next Deputy Attorney General. One of \nthe most important roles of a Deputy Attorney General is to make sure \nthat the day-to-day operations of the Department run smoothly and to \nprovide effective and competent management guided by justice. I know \nDavid Ogden can do that. His experience both as Chief of Staff and \ncounselor to former Attorney General Reno, as well as his experience as \nAssistant Attorney General for the Department's civil division under \nPresident Clinton proves that David Ogden has experience and the \nintegrity to do the job.\n  I have heard all these allegations made, including by my colleague. I \nwant to tell you some of the people who are supporting David Ogden. His \nnomination is supported by a number of law enforcement and community \ngroups, including among others, the Fraternal Order of Police--not \nexactly a radical organization. He is supported by the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, the Partnership for a Drug Free \nAmerica, and the National Sheriffs' Association.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is a strong \nsupporter. In fact, they sent a letter saying they gave David Ogden \ntheir enthusiastic support. In particular, they wrote:\n\n     . . . during Mr. Ogden's tenure as Chief of Staff and Counsel \n     to the Attorney General, we worked closely with the Attorney \n     General in attacking the growing phenomenon of child sexual \n     exploitation and child pornography. As counselor to the \n     Attorney General, Mr. Ogden was intricately involved in \n     helping to shape the way our group responded to child \n     victimization challenges and delivered its services.\n\n  It is seconded by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which also \nsupports David Ogden's nomination. In addition to these law enforcement \nand child protective groups, David Ogden has received broad bipartisan \nsupport from a number of former Department officials, including Larry \nThompson, a former Deputy Attorney General under President George W. \nBush, and George Terwilliger, who served in the same role under \nPresident George H. W. Bush.\n  There are so many things on the Justice Department's plate, and we \nneed someone to be up and running. But I want to respond specifically \nto some of the things we have heard today. There was a statement by one \nof Senators that Mr. Ogden opposed a child pornography statute that we \npassed in 1998.\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nThat is simply not correct, and I hope my colleagues know that. In \nfact, as head of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, he \nled the vigorous defense of the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 and \nthe Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996.\n  There were also mischaracterizations, for political reasons, of Mr. \nOgden's record. We have already talked about how he is supported by the \nmajor police organizations in this country. Well, in addition to that, \nhe has a general business practice, and before that he served in \ngovernment. His work at the WilmerHale law firm over the past 8 years, \nfor example, hasn't centered on first amendment litigation. He has \nrepresented corporate clients, from Amtrak to the Fireman's Fund.\n  They also said that somehow Mr. Ogden took some position taken by Mr. \nOgden's clients, who were America's librarians and booksellers. Rather, \nthe Senate rejected the Clinton administration's interpretation, and \nMr. Ogden made clear to the Judiciary Committee that he disagreed with \nthat interpretation. In his testimony, he made clear that he is \ncomfortable with the ruling of the Court and agreed with the Senate \nresolution.\n  You can go on and on about some of these misstatements about Mr. \nOgden's record, but let us look at what is going on here. As I \nmentioned before, the child protection community supports Mr. Ogden \nbased on his strong record of protecting children. Now, I tend to \nbelieve the people who deal every day with helping families with \nmissing children more than I believe some statement that is made in a \npolitical context. I will be honest with you, I tend to believe the \nFraternal Order of Police when they give an endorsement more than I \nbelieve some statement made in a political context.\n  Let me tell you this. Why is this so important? Why can we not go \nback and forth and back and forth and have all these political partisan \nattacks? Well, we need a Deputy Attorney General now. We need a Deputy \nAttorney General right now. The Department of Justice has more than \n100,000 employees and a budget exceeding $25 billion. Every single \nFederal law enforcement officer reports to the Deputy Attorney General, \nincluding the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the Bureau of Prisons, and all 93 \nU.S. Attorney's Offices. The Attorney General needs the other members \nof his Justice Department leadership team in place.\n  Look what we are dealing with: the Madoff case and billions of \ndollars stolen. We are dealing with childcare cases. We are dealing \nwith administering this $800 billion in money and making sure people \naren't ripped off. We are dealing with murders and street crimes across \nthis country. Yet people are trying to stop the Justice Department from \noperating? That can't happen.\n  I want to end by saying I was a prosecutor for 8 years, and always my \nguiding principle was that you put the law above politics. That is what \nI am asking my colleagues to do here. We need to get David Ogden in as \na Deputy Attorney General. Now is the time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pending before the Senate is the \nnomination of David Ogden to be the Deputy Attorney General. I rise to \nspeak in support of that nomination.\n  The Justice Department and our Nation are fortunate that President \nObama has put forward this nomination. Mr. Ogden has the experience, \nthe talent, and the judgment needed for this critical position.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the No. 2 person at the Justice \nDepartment. He is the day-to-day manager of the entire agency. This \nincludes supervising key national security and law enforcement offices \nsuch as the FBI and our counterterrorism operations. Mr. Ogden is a \ngraduate of Harvard Law School, former law clerk to a Supreme Court \nJustice, which is one of the most prestigious jobs in the legal \nprofession. He had three senior positions in the Janet Reno Justice \nDepartment and served as her Chief of Staff, Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and also served as Assistant Attorney General in the Civil \nDivision, a position for which he received unanimous confirmation by \nthis Senate. Mr. Ogden also served as the Deputy General Counsel at the \nDefense Department.\n  Given this excellent background, it is not surprising that David \nOgden gained the support of many prominent conservatives. At least 15 \nformer officials of the Reagan and both Bush administrations have \nannounced their support for his nomination. They include Larry \nThompson, the first Deputy Attorney General of the most recent Bush \nadministration; Peter Keisler, former high-level Justice Department \nofficial; and Rachel Brand, another high-level Justice Department \nofficial in the Bush administration. Their words are similar. I will \nnot read into the Record each of their statements, but they give the \nhighest possible endorsement to David Ogden.\n  Due to a scheduling conflict, I could not attend his hearing, but I \nasked him to come by my office so we could have time together and I \ncould ask my questions face to face. We talked about a lot of subjects, \nincluding criminal justice reform, human rights, and the professional \nresponsibilities of the Department of Justice lawyers. I was impressed \nby Mr. Ogden's intellect, his management experience, and his commitment \nto restoring the Justice Department's independence and integrity.\n  We talked about the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nCrime and Drugs, a subcommittee I will chair in the 111th Congress, and \nthe issues we are going to face--including the Mexican drug cartels, \nwhich will be the subject of a hearing in just a few days, racial \ndisparities in the criminal justice system in America, and the urgent \nneed for prison reform. That is an issue, I might add, that is near and \ndear to the heart of our colleague, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. I am \ngoing to try to help him move forward in an ambitious effort to create \na Presidential commission to look into this.\n  The Justice Department will play an important role in reclaiming \nAmerica's mantle as the world's leading champion for human rights. Mr. \nOgden and I discussed the Justice Department's role in implementing \nPresident Obama's Executive orders in relation to the closure of the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facilities and review of detention and \ninterrogation policies. We discussed the investigation by the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Professional Responsibility, as to the attorneys \nin that Department who authorized the use of abusive interrogation \ntechniques such as waterboarding. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland and I requested this investigation. Mr. Ogden committed to us \nthat he would provide Congress with the results of the investigation as \nsoon as possible. This is the kind of transparency and responsiveness \nto congressional oversight we expect from the Justice Department and \nsomething that we have been waiting for.\n\n  We also discussed the Justice Department's role in ensuring that war \ncriminals do not find safe haven in the United States. I worked with \nSenator Coburn who is a Republican from Oklahoma, on the other side of \nthe aisle. We passed legislation allowing the Justice Department to \nprosecute the perpetrators of genocide and other war crimes in the U.S. \ncourts. I believe Mr. Ogden appreciates the importance of enforcing \nthese human rights laws.\n  At the end of our meeting, I felt confident David Ogden will be an \nexcellent Deputy Attorney General.\n  I want to make one final point. There is some controversy associated \nwith his appointment that I would like to address directly. I am aware \nthere has been some criticism that David Ogden represented clients whom \nsome consider controversial. He has been criticized in his \nrepresentation of libraries and bookstores who sought first amendment \nfree speech protections, and for his representation of a client in an \nabortion rights case.\n  I would like to call to the attention of those critics a statement \nthat was made by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, when he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee several \nyears ago at his confirmation hearing.\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\n  He was asked about the positions he had advocated on behalf of his \nclients as an attorney. Here is what the Chief Justice told us:\n\n       It's a tradition of the American Bar Association that goes \n     back before the founding of the country that lawyers are not \n     identified with the positions of their clients. The most \n     famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the \n     British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that \n     for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution \n     in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule \n     of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.\n\n  And he went on to say:\n\n       That principle, that you don't identify the lawyer with the \n     particular views of the client, or the views that the lawyer \n     advances on behalf of a client, is critical to the fair \n     administration of justice.\n\n  You practiced law, Madam President. I have too. Many times you find \nyourself in a position representing a client where you do not \nnecessarily agree with their position before the court of law. But you \nare dutybound to bring that position before the court so the rule of \nlaw can be applied and a fair outcome would result. If we only allowed \npopular causes and popular people representation in this country, I am \nafraid justice would not be served.\n  Chief Justice Roberts made that point when he was being asked about \nhis representation of legal clients. I would say to many on the other \nside of the aisle who are questioning David Ogden's reputation, they \nowe the same fairness to him that was given to Chief Justice Roberts in \nthat hearing.\n  I would remind the conservative critics of Mr. Ogden, look carefully \nat that testimony. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  After 8 years of a Justice Department that often put politics over \nprinciple, we now have a chance to confirm a nominee with strong \nbipartisan support who can help restore the Justice Department to its \nrightful role as guardian of our laws and the protector of our \nliberties.\n  David Ogden has the independence, integrity, and experience for the \njob. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for his nomination to be \nDeputy Attorney General.\n\n\n                      Clean Coal Research Project\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was about 7 years ago when the Bush \nadministration announced what they said was the most significant coal \nresearch project in the history of the United States. The name of the \nproject was FutureGen. The object was to do research at a facility to \ndetermine whether you could burn coal, generate electricity, and not \npollute the environment. It is an ambitious undertaking.\n  The way they wanted to achieve it was to be able to capture the \nCO2 and other emissions, virtually all of them coming out of \na powerplant burning coal, and to sequester them; that is, to stick \nthem underground, find places underground where they can be absorbed by \ncertain geological foundations, safely held there. Of course, it was an \nambitious undertaking. It had never been done on a grand scale anywhere \nin the country.\n  Well, the competition got underway and many States stepped forward to \ncompete for this key research project on the future of coal. There were \nsome five to seven different States involved in the competition. My \nState of Illinois was one of them. The competition went on for 5 years.\n  Each step of the way, the panel of judges, the scientists and \nengineers would judge the site. Is this the right place to build it? Is \nit going to use the right coal? Can they actually pump it underground \nand trap it so that it will not ever be a hazard or danger at any time \nin the future? Important and serious questions.\n  My State of Illinois spent millions of dollars to prove we had a good \nsite. When it finally came down to a decision, there were two States \nleft: Texas and Illinois. Well, I took a look around at our President \nand where he was from, and I thought, we do not have a chance. Yet the \nexperts made the decision and came down in favor of Illinois. They \npicked the town of Mattoon, IL, which is in the central eastern part of \nour State, in Coles County, and said that is the best place to put this \nnew coal research facility.\n  We were elated. After 5 years of work, we won. After all of the \ncompetition, all of the different States, all of the experts, all the \nvisits, everything that we put into it, we won the competition.\n  Within 2 weeks, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, Mr. \nBodman, came to my office on the third floor of the Capitol and said: I \nhave news for you.\n  I said: What is that?\n  He said: We are canceling the project.\n  I said: You are cancelling it? We have been working on this for 5 \nyears.\n  He said: Sorry, it cost too much money. The original estimate was \nthat this was going to cost $1 billion. When the President first \nannounced it, we knew inflation would add to the construction costs \nover some period of time. But here was Mr. Bodman saying it cost almost \ntwice as much as we thought it would cost; therefore, we are killing \nthe project.\n  Well, I was not happy about it. In fact, I thought it was totally \nunfair, having strung us along for 5 years, made my State and many \nothers spend millions of dollars in this competition, go through the \nfinal competition and win, and then be told, within 2 weeks: It is \nover; we are not going to go forward with it.\n  So I said to Mr. Bodman: Well, you are going to be here about a year \nmore, and I am going to try to be here longer. At the end of that year, \nwhen you are gone, I am going to the next President, whoever that may \nbe, and ask them to make this FutureGen research facility a reality.\n  I told the people back home: Do not give up. Hold on to the land we \nhave set aside. Continue to do the research work you can do. Bring \ntogether the members of the alliance--which are private businesses, \nutility companies, coal companies--not only from around the United \nStates but around the world interested in this research and tell them: \nDon't give up.\n  So we hung on for a year, literally for a year, and a new President \nwas elected. It happened to be a President I know a little bit about, \nwho was my colleague in the Senate, Senator Obama. When we served \ntogether, he knew all about this project and had supported it.\n  So now comes the new administration and a new chance. The Obama \nadministration has said to me and all of us interested in this project: \nThere is one man who will make the decision: it is the Secretary of \nEnergy, Dr. Chu. He is a noted scientist who will decide this on the \nmerits. He is going to decide whether this is worth the money to be \nspent. So we made our appeal to him, we presented our case to him, and \nleft it in his hands. We are still worried about this whole issue of \ncost.\n\n  Bart Gordon, a Congressman from the State of Tennessee and serves on \nthe House Science Committee, he sent the Government Accountability \nOffice to take a look at FutureGen to find out what happened to the \ncost, why did it go up so dramatically.\n  Well, the report came out last night. Here is what the report found. \nThe report found the Department of Energy had miscalculated the cost of \nthe plant, overstating its cost by $500 million because they made a \nmathematical error--$500 million.\n  Taking that off the ultimate cost brings it down into the ordinary \nconstruction inflation cost. And so many of us who argued their \nestimate of cost was exaggerated now understand why. They made a basic \nand fundamental error calculating the cost of this project.\n  Here is what we face. Now, 53 percent of all the electricity in \nAmerica is generated by coal. Burning coal can create pollution. \nPollution can add to global warming and climate change, and we have to \nbe serious about dealing with it.\n  This plant is going to give us a chance to do that. When the GAO took \na look at the Department of Energy documentation, they also discovered \na memo which said: If we kill the FutureGen coal research plant, we \nwill set coal research back 10 years with all of the time they put into \nit. All of the effort they put into it would have been wasted and could \nnot be replicated.\n  So that is what is at stake. The ultimate decision will be made by \nDr. Chu at the Department of Energy. I trust that he will find a way to \nhelp us move forward, but I want him to do it for the right scientific \nreasons.\n  If we are successful, we will not only be able to demonstrate this \ntechnology for America but for the world. The reason why foreign \ncountries are joining\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nus in this research effort is what we discover will help them. China is \nbuilding a new coal-fired plant almost every week and is going to be \nadding more pollution to the environment than we can ever hope to take \ncare of in the United States alone.\n  But if we can find a way, a technology, a scientific way, using the \nbest engineering and capture that pollution before it goes into the \nair, it is a positive result not just for the United States but for the \nworld.\n  From a parochial point of view, we happen to be sitting on a \nfantastic energy reserve right here in America. There are coal reserves \nall across the Midwestern United States, and almost 75 percent of my \nState of Illinois has coal underneath the soil. It is there to be had \nand used. But we want to use it responsibly.\n  We want to make sure at the end of the day that we can use coal and \nsay to our kids and grandkids: We provided the electricity you needed \nbut not at the expense of the environment you need to survive.\n  So this finding by the GAO has given us a new chance. We are looking \nforward to working with the Department of Energy. For those back in \nIllinois who did not give up hope, we are still very much alive, and \nthis latest disclosure gives us a chance to bring the cost within \naffordable ranges. I hope the Department of Energy will decide to move \nforward on this critical research project.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb pertaining to the introduction of S. 572 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                                Earmarks\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I rise to address the recent debate we \nhave had on the Omnibus appropriations bill with respect to earmarks. \nThe premise seems to be, for those who have criticized the earmarks \nprocess, that this is pork. Sometimes it is; sometimes it is not. But I \nwould start first with the Constitution.\n  There is nothing in the Constitution that says the executive branch \nof Government should appropriate funds or decide which funds should be \nspent. That is a procedure that has evolved over the centuries because \nof the complexities of Government, where the executive branch looks at \nits needs and comes to the Congress and asks for appropriations. \nEarmarks take place when individual Members of Congress, exercising \ntheir authority to appropriate under the Constitution, decide and \nrecommend that worthwhile programs in an ideal case should be included \nin a budget process, programs that have not been considered or included \nby the executive branch or through other processes.\n  For instance, I was able, last year, along with Senator John Warner, \nnow retired, to bring $5 million into a rural area of Tidewater, VA, so \nthey could put broadband in. Broadband is something we know all \nAmericans who want to compete for their future and contribute equally \nneed to have. It didn't make it into anybody's bill. Who is thinking \nabout sparsely populated areas such as rural Virginia? Yet we were able \nto bring a lot of benefit to those who otherwise would not have \nreceived it.\n  What I would ask my colleagues, particularly those who have become so \nadamant in their concern over the earmarks process, to consider is, \nlet's take a look at the budget that comes to the Congress. Is there \npork in the budgets that come over, pork that comes through, in some \ncases, unnecessary influence or individual discretion? You bet there \nis.\n  I say that as someone who spent 5 years in the Pentagon, 4 years of \nwhich I was on the Defense Resources Board where on any given day we \nwere implementing a budget, arguing a budget in the Congress, and \ndeveloping the next year's budget. I offer an example of a situation \nthat my staff has been following for the last 10 months and use it as \nan invitation to colleagues to join me in looking at where there can be \nabuses of discretion and where there can be a lot of money that can be \nsaved.\n  Ten months ago, on May 21, there was an article in the Wall Street \nJournal that talked about Blackwater Worldwide attempting to obtain \nlocal approval for a new training center in San Diego, CA. We all \nremember Blackwater. They are an independent contractor that has done \nmore than a billion dollars of business since the Bush administration, \nthe most recent Bush administration took office. I became curious about \nthis project, first, because I had seen reports of what a very high \npercentage of the Blackwater contracts had been awarded were either \nnoncompete or minimal compete and the high volume number, more than a \nbillion of them. And also the fact that having at one time been \nSecretary of the Navy, they were apparently wanting to build a training \ncenter so they could train Active-Duty sailors how to defend themselves \nonboard a ship.\n  Having spent time in the Marine Corps, I immediately started thinking \nabout what it would have been like to have a nonmilitary contractor \nteaching me how to do patrolling when I was going through basic school \nin Quantico all those years ago. It didn't fit.\n  I started asking around. The first thing I found out was, this was a \ncontract from the Navy that was worth about $64 million. I wrote a \nletter to Secretary Gates. I said: Is this Blackwater program in any \nway authorized or funded by U.S. tax dollars? The answer came back, \nyes, obviously. I asked: Is there specific legislative authorization \nfor it? Because I couldn't find any, as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. The answer was no. According to Secretary Gates, this \nactivity falls under the broad authorization provided to the Secretary \nof Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments to procure \ngoods and services using appropriated funds and prescribed procedures \nfor those procurements.\n  Then I asked him in this letter: Is there a specific appropriation, \neither in an appropriations bill or through an earmark? The answer is: \nNo, there was no specific appropriation or earmark directing this \neffort.\n  As we started to peel this back, here is what we found. An \nindividual, an SCS, midlevel individual in the Department of the Navy \nhad the authority to approve this type of a program up to the value of \n$78 million, without even having a review by the Secretary of the Navy. \nThis was not an authorized program. It was not an appropriated program. \nIt was money that came out of a block of appropriated funds for \noperation and maintenance that then somebody in the Navy said was \nessential to the needs of the service, the needs of the fleet, which is \na generic term.\n  I ask my colleagues who are so concerned about some of the pork \nprojects or earmarks process here, which has gained a great deal of \nvisibility since I have been here over the past 2 years and \ntransparency, to join me in taking a look at these sorts of contracts. \nWhen a midlevel person in the Pentagon has the authority to approve a \nprogram that hasn't been authorized and hasn't been appropriated up to \nthe value of $78 million and not even have the oversight of the \nSecretary of that service, that is where you see the potential for true \nabuse of the process. That is where we need to start focusing our \nenergies as a Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today we debate the nomination of David \nOgden to be the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. Ogden is highly qualified for this important job. He is a \ngraduate of Harvard Law School and clerked on the Supreme Court for \nJustice Harry Blackmun. During the Clinton Administration, he served as \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division and as chief of \nstaff to the Attorney General.\n  He also previously served as Deputy General Counsel at the Department \nof Defense, so he has a keen appreciation for the national security \nissues that he will face at DOJ. He has an excellent reputation among \nhis fellow lawyers and is supported by a number of former Republican \nJustice Department officials.\n  It is surprising to me that we need to spend more than a full day \ndebating\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nthis obviously qualified nominee. Mr. Ogden was favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee by a vote of 14-5, so it seems clear he will be \nconfirmed. But apparently some far-right advocates have made this \nnomination more controversial than it should be.\n  As I understand it, those who oppose this nominee disagree with \npositions he took on behalf of some of his clients, including media \norganizations. In my view, that is a very unfair basis for opposing a \nnominee. As a former practicing lawyer, I feel strongly that a lawyer \nshould not be held personally responsible for the views of his clients.\n  President Obama deserves to have his advisors, especially members of \nhis national security team, in place as quickly as possible. I urge \nconfirmation of this outstanding nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, even after abandoning their the ill-\nconceived filibuster of President Obama's nomination of David Ogden to \nbe Deputy Attorney General, we still hear Republican Senators making \nscurrilous attacks against Mr. Ogden, launched by some on the extreme \nright.\n  As I said on the Senate Floor earlier, David Ogden is a good lawyer \nand a good man. He is a husband and a father. Yet, regrettably and \nunbelievably, we still hear chants that he is a pedophile and a \npornographer. Those charges are false and they are wrong. Senators know \nbetter than that.\n  Special interests on the far right have distorted Mr. Ogden's record \nby focusing only on a narrow sliver of his diverse practice as a \nlitigator spanning over three decades. Dating back to the 1980s, Mr. \nOgden's practice has included, for example, major antitrust litigation, \ncounseling, representation and authorship of a book on the law of trade \nand professional associations, international litigation and dispute \nresolution, False Claims Act and Export Controls Act investigations, \nand a significant practice in administrative law. In other words, he \nhas been a lawyer, representing clients. For the last 8 years, since \nleaving Government service, Mr. Ogden has represented corporate clients \nin a range of industries, including transportation clients like Amtrak \nand Lufthansa, insurance and financial institutions like Citibank and \nFireman's Fund, petrochemical companies like Shell and BP and \npharmaceutical concerns like PhRMA and Merck.\n  Here are the facts that underlie the overheated rhetoric: As a young \nlawyer in a small firm with a constitutional practice, along with other \nlawyers in that respected DC law firm, Mr. Ogden represented a range of \nmedia clients. He represented the American Library Association, the \nAmerican Booksellers Association, and Playboy Enterprises.\n  In the early 1990s, while at the respected firm of Jenner & Block, \nMr. Ogden represented a Los Angeles County firefighter. The firefighter \nwas being prohibited from possessing or reading Playboy magazine at the \nfirehouse, even when on down time between responding to fires. The \nFederal Court reviewing the matter held that the first amendment \nprotected the firefighter's right to possess and read the magazine. \nThat representation does not make Mr. Ogden a pornographer, a pedophile \nor justify any of the other epithets that have been thrown his way.\n  He also challenged a prosecution strategy that threatened \nsimultaneous indictments in multiple jurisdictions with the goal of \nnegotiating plea agreements that put companies out of business without \never having to prove that the materials they were distributing were \nobscene. That sounds like the kind of overreaching prosecution strategy \nthat Senator Specter and other Republican Senators would condemn, just \nas they have the excesses of the ``Thompson memo'' pressuring \ninvestigative targets to waive their attorney-client privilege.\n  Those who have argued that Mr. Ogden has consistently taken positions \nagainst laws to protect children ignore Mr. Ogden's record and his \ntestimony. What these critics leave out of their caricature is the fact \nthat Mr. Ogden also aggressively defended the constitutionality of the \nChild Online Protection Act and the Child Pornography Prevention Act of \n1996 while previously serving at the Justice Department. This work has \nled to support and praise from the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children. He has the support of the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica. In private practice he wrote a brief for the American \nPsychological Association in Maryland v. Craig in which he argued for \nprotection of child victims of sexual abuse. In his personal life, he \nhas volunteered time serving the Chesapeake Institute, a clinic for \nsexually abused children.\n  Nominees from both Republican and Democratic administrations and \nSenators from both sides of the aisle have cautioned against opposing \nnominees based on their legal representations on behalf of clients. \nWhen asked about this point in connection with his own nomination, \nChief Justice Roberts testified, ``it has not been my general view that \nI sit in judgment on clients when they come'' and, ``it was my view \nthat lawyers don't stand in the shoes of their clients, and that good \nlawyers can give advice and argue any side of a case.'' Part of the \ndouble standard being applied is that the rule Republican Senators urge \nfor Republican nominees--that their clients not be held against them--\nis turned on its head under a Democratic President.\n  As recently as just over 1 year ago, every Senate Republican voted to \nconfirm Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States. \nThat showed no concern that one of his clients, and one of his most \nsignificant cases in private practice as identified in the bipartisan \ncommittee questionnaire he filed, was his representation of Carlin \nCommunications, a company that specialized in what are sometimes called \n``dial-a-porn'' services. It is more evidence of a double standard.\n  Senators should reject the partisan tactics and double standards from \nthe extreme right and support David Ogden's nomination. The last Deputy \nAttorney nominee to be delayed by such a double standard was Eric \nHolder, whose nomination to be Deputy Attorney General in 1997 was \ndelayed for three weeks by an anonymous Republican hold after being \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee before being confirmed \nunanimously. Like now Attorney General Holder, Mr. Ogden is an \nimmensely qualified nominee whose priorities will be the safety and \nsecurity of the American people and reinvigorating the traditional work \nof the Justice Department in protecting the rights of Americans.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nMarch 12, the Senate resume consideration of the Ogden nomination at 12 \nnoon and that it be considered under the parameters of the order of \nMarch 10; that the vote on the confirmation of the nomination occur at \n2 p.m.; further, that upon confirmation of the Ogden nomination, the \nSenate remain in executive session and consider Calendar No. 23, the \nnomination of Thomas John Perrelli to be Associate Attorney General; \nthat debate on the nomination be limited to 90 minutes equally divided \nand controlled between the leaders or their designees; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, no further motions be in order; that \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, during consideration of the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, members of the minority party attempted to attach \namendments in an effort to delay passage of this important bill. \nBecause further delay in passing this bill could have resulted in the \nshutdown of the Federal Government, I voted against all amendments to \nthe bill.\n  I believe that this omnibus bill is important for job growth and will \nhelp revitalize our economy. That must be our concern at this critical \ntime.\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\n  I would like to clarify my position of some of these amendments:\n  Amendment 630 would have required the Secretary of State to report on \nwhether additional military aid to Egypt could be used to counter the \nillegal smuggling of weapons into Gaza. The omnibus bill already \nexplicitly authorizes the use of military aid provided to Egypt for \nborder security programs so the amendment was completely unnecessary.\n  Amendment 631 would have prohibited funds for reconstruction efforts \nin Gaza unless the administration certifies that the funds will not be \ndiverted to Hamas or entities controlled by Hamas. The Omnibus bill and \npermanent law already prohibit any funds from being provided to Hamas \nor entities controlled by Hamas so this amendment was also completely \nunnecessary.\n  Amendment 634 would have prevented funds in this bill from going to \ncompanies that assist Iran's energy sector. While I have long supported \ntough action against Iran for its illicit nuclear program, sending this \nprovision back to the House of Representatives could have endangered \nfinal passage of the bill.\n  Amendment 613 would have cut off all U.S. funding for the United \nNations if it imposes any tax on any United States person. The U.N. has \nnever imposed a tax, is not a taxing organization, and if the U.N. ever \ndecided it wanted to impose a tax the U.S. would veto it. This \namendment is unnecessary.\n  Amendment 604 would have extended the E-Verify worker identification \nprogram for an additional five years. The omnibus bill already contains \na 6-month extension of this program.\n  Amendment 662 would prohibit the use of funds by the Federal \nCommunications Commission to promulgate the fairness doctrine. On \nFebruary 26, 2009, I voted in favor of an amendment offered by the \njunior Senator from South Carolina to prevent the FCC from promulgating \nthe fairness doctrine. This amendment passed the Senate as part of S. \n160, the Washington, DC voting rights bill. Also, there are no \nprovisions in the omnibus bill related to the fairness doctrine, making \nthis amendment unnecessary.\n  Amendment 604 repeals the provision of the Legislative Reorganization \nAct which grants Members an automatic pay adjustment each year. The \namendment would take effect beginning December 11, 2010, and would \nrequire the enactment of new legislation to grant Members a pay raise. \nI believe the junior Senator from Louisiana was doing nothing more than \nplaying politics with his amendment, as he objected to passing a stand-\nalone bill offered by the Senate majority leader that would have \naccomplished the same goal as the Vitter amendment. I would have \nsupported passing the majority leader's bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate voted down \namendment No. 668 offered by my colleague Senator Enzi by a vote of 42 \nto 53. I strongly opposed this amendment and am pleased that my \ncolleagues defeated this harmful amendment.\n  The amendment, if passed, would have cut more than $983,000 in Ryan \nWhite Part A funding to the city of Hartford, CT, and more than \n$770,000 in funding to the city of New Haven, CT, in fiscal year 2009. \nThe Enzi amendment would have forced these cities to absorb a combined \ncut of more than 35 percent to their Ryan White Part A grant in 1 year.\n  During floor debate on the Enzi amendment, the amendment was \nrepresented as a proposal that would simply cut funding from San \nFrancisco. That is not the case and if the Enzi amendment had become \nlaw, thousands of individuals living with HIV/AIDS in the State of \nConnecticut would have been denied direct medical services for the \ntreatment of their disease.\n  Cuts in funding as envisioned under the Enzi amendment would have \ndeprived individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Connecticut access to \nmedications, clinics would have to turn away patients, and programs \nwould have to make drastic cuts to counseling, transportation, and \nnutrition assistance.\n  In fact, 13 cities in Florida, California, New York, New Jersey, \nPuerto Rico, and Connecticut would have seen huge funding cuts under \nthe Enzi amendment.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the State of Connecticut was \nseverely disadvantaged because of the way the last reauthorization was \nhandled. Despite receiving assurances and seeing numbers that told a \ndifferent picture, the 2006 reauthorization bill has led to more than \n$3 million in annual losses to Connecticut. The funding provided in the \nomnibus is essential to restoring these cuts.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can address the problems underlying the \ncuts to Connecticut when we reauthorize this program which expires this \nyear. I find it regretful that the senate had to take up this funding \nfight yesterday because reauthorizations of the Ryan White CARE Act \nprogram have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\n  I want to thank Senators Harkin and Inouye for including the largest \nincrease in Part A of Ryan White in 8 years in the fiscal year 2009 \nomnibus bill. With the defeat of the Enzi amendment, cities under Part \nA will receive a total increase of more than $25 million.\n  I thank my colleagues for defeating this harmful amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3020-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3020-S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thanks for asking our input. As Republican delegates to the \n     convention in Sandpoint, my wife and I were pleased to help \n     pass resolutions encouraging energy development.\n       I am really not sure what blend of ineptitude/conspiracy \n     (not you, sir) to blame for not drilling in Alaska and off \n     our coasts for the last 15 years, but I am glad to see that \n     clearing up.\n       I do encourage domestic and offshore drilling; China is \n     already drilling past the 16 mile limit off the coasts of \n     California and Florida. (I gave a letter from delegate Jack \n     Streeter to Bill Sali regarding this at the convention; he \n     may recall it).\n       Also, I would like to plug Idaho developing not only \n     nuclear power (I could go either way on that) but I really \n     think, as our forefathers had the wisdom to use government \n     resources to develop hydroelectric power, which we still \n     benefit from, so we should develop wind power, in a state so \n     blessed with wind, water and mountains!\n       Rather than our children inheriting simply an enormous U.S. \n     debt burden, I would like to see us drill on a national level \n     (Idaho might benefit from deep drilling, like the Russians \n     are doing, 30-40,000 foot deep wells, unlike anything we \n     have--that is how you get oil in high altitude regions like \n     Idaho) and produce cheap, renewable energy from wind in Idaho \n     to bless our selves, and children and generations beyond.\n       Please let me hear your thoughts; wind power for Idaho by \n     state funding or even a U.S. bill would be an earmark few in \n     the state would hold against you.\n     Bob, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       I heard on the radio that you want input from Idahoans on \n     the subject of gas prices and ideas for solutions. That is \n     why I am writing. In my opinion, this is a manipulated \n     situation, designed to pull more money from the pockets of \n     working Americans and put it in the coffers of corporate \n     America and a few of the mega wealthy citizens. We have seen \n     this happen before with the Enron debacle and the spike of \n     electricity prices a few years ago. We have seen it with the \n     .com stock market crash. We have seen it with the housing \n     market crisis. This is but another symptom of the larger \n     problem--corporate irresponsibility and subsequent government \n     bailout.\n       The larger problem is the corruption in Washington. \n     Corporate business cannot run government and have the \n     citizens of the country be the winner in anything. The only \n     solution to the problem of gas prices (and drug prices, and \n     food prices) is to kick corporate lobbies out of Washington, \n     step up to\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n     the plate and legislate for the people, not corporate. If \n     this does not happen, next year's problem will be extreme \n     food shortages in the U.S., as is happening in much of the \n     rest of the world. Corporate farming giants are not producing \n     as the old-fashioned family farmer did.\n       The other part of this problem is the [partisan blaming of] \n     each other for the problems. Continuing along this line \n     simply compounds the problems, and bipartisan solutions are \n     not found. Again, the citizens of our nation suffer. I am one \n     of a growing majority of Americans who are sick to death of \n     hearing the yammering and in-fighting coming from Washington. \n     At the rate our leaders in Washington are going, the \n     terrorists will not have anything left to terrorize. \n     Government and corporate corruption will have torn the \n     country apart for them. You all need to put your party \n     difference aside and come up with solutions with the other \n     party for the good of the country, or there is not going to \n     be a country anymore.\n       It is not just a fuel price crisis; it is a country in \n     crisis, from sea to shining sea.\n     Anna, Weiser.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing in response to your recent request for input \n     about gas prices and how it has affected our lives in Idaho. \n     As you mentioned: ``The driving distances between places in \n     our state as well as limited public transportation options \n     mean that many of us do not have any choice but to keep \n     driving and paying those ever-increasing prices for fuel.'' I \n     could not agree more. The opportunity for good solid \n     employment in Idaho is not something that can be found too \n     often in the little towns spread across the state. This of \n     course means that if you want a good job you will have to \n     commute. Being a single mother, I have had no choice but to \n     find good steady employment. I have been commuting from west \n     of Blackfoot to Idaho Falls to work every day. Due to the \n     price of gas, I have recently been forced to sell my home and \n     try to relocate in Idaho Falls. I have had to uproot my 3-\n     year-old little boy from his daily routine and child care. I \n     have had to move away from family and friends who helped with \n     him therefore causing yet more costs to me in the form of \n     more expensive daycare. It is so sad that my son will now \n     have to be with strangers each day while I work to support \n     the two of us all because I could not afford to commute a \n     mere 45 miles to work. It is sad that I am forced to be \n     secluded from lifelong friends and family because now that I \n     am moving to Idaho Falls I cannot afford to drive to \n     Blackfoot to see them. Sick--it is just sickening.\n     Sheri, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sir, you asked for input on energy issues. Here is mine:\n       First, I fully support nuclear energy. When viewed in terms \n     of energy independence, being environmentally friendly (e.g., \n     green house gas emission, waste), sustainability, cost and \n     efficiency, it stands out above every other option. Wind, \n     solar, ocean tides and the like may be reasonable \n     supplemental energy sources in certain cases but they are not \n     primary energy sources. The public needs to be educated on \n     this.\n       Second, the gas tax holiday concept is foolish. It is \n     robbing Peter-to-pay-Paul. We need that tax money for highway \n     maintenance and construction. Also, a gas tax holiday would \n     do nothing to increase supply but would increase demand (in \n     the short term due to a drop in pump prices), therefore \n     worsening the supply/demand situation.\n       Third, we need to aggressively pursue gasoline's ultimate \n     replacement (e.g., ethanol) like Brazil has. E85 fuel is a \n     prudent start. Also, we are at the door step to the hydrogen \n     economy; we need to be seriously working toward it.\n       Regarding a response to this inquiry, just an \n     acknowledgement that you received it is adequate. Thanks.\n     Chris, Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The people of Idaho are affected by the energy crisis. This \n     is why we in Idaho and across our country need to learn to \n     conserve and to develop clean and safe energy alternatives \n     which do not pose a risk for our children's future. I oppose \n     the use of nuclear energy as it does pose a health risk \n     however small. Remember Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. In \n     addition, I oppose more domestic drilling. Harming our earth \n     more just to feed our excessive oil habit is a short term \n     knee-jerk reaction. I strongly hope that Idaho can be a role \n     model for other states, by really looking at the problem and \n     creating long term solutions such as conservation, more \n     public transportation, and investment in extensive wind and \n     solar power energy.\n     Sheila, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       You ask for people to tell you their story about what the \n     high cost of gas and energy is doing to them. Well, here it \n     is. We live in rural Idaho. For those that do not know what \n     that means, it is ninety miles to a doctor or a reasonably \n     priced grocery store. Some people are going to say, ``take \n     mass transit''; we do have a subsidized transit system (it \n     costs over $90 for the round trip). They also charge extra \n     for more than one stop. It is cheaper to pay $4 per gallon \n     for gas. Some will say ``buy a hybrid'' that would be nice if \n     I could afford one, $40,000, and it will not do me any good. \n     They get great mileage in town but at highway speeds, they do \n     not get any better mileage than what I have. My family, \n     daily, makes the choice ``do we put gas in the car or do we \n     buy food''. I do not think anyone in government has ever had \n     to make that choice.\n       I am so disgusted with our government and Congress in \n     general that, I think, for the first time in fifty years, I \n     will sit the next election out. In long-term results, I do \n     not see an ounce of difference in the two candidates running \n     for President. You need look no farther than congressional \n     approval ratings. The government (all of you) have lied to \n     the American people for so long that I believe you have \n     started believing your own lies. You take my Social Security \n     money and spend it to buy votes. You take the items out that \n     we all have to buy to calculate inflation. Everything you do \n     is calculated on a political power basis. You borrow money \n     from my grandchildren to send me a check and tell me it is \n     good for the economy. You have us so deep in debt that what \n     money we have is not worth anything. I do not expect my \n     Social Security check to feed me the rest of my life.\n       I guess I have ranted enough. You ask for it; there it is. \n     I do not expect it to do any good. You will not do what the \n     people want, you are going to do whatever generates you the \n     most power wither it is good for the country or not. Drill \n     here--drill now!\n     Jess, Aberdeen.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like everyone, I have been very concerned about the rising \n     cost in fuel, and everything else. I am trying to raise a \n     family with my husband, and we definitely feel the pinch. \n     Even as the price of filling our cars has increased \n     dramatically, so has the cost of feeding our family. It is \n     costing my husband almost $10 per day, in a fuel-efficient \n     sedan, just to go to work. We also have my husband's \n     brother's family living here to get back on their feet, so, \n     of course, the cost of running our household and everything \n     in it is a concern.\n       I wanted to tell you that I strongly support domestic \n     drilling. It is something we should have done years ago, and \n     should be implemented as soon as possible. We need to \n     decrease our reliance on foreign oil! I also think that if we \n     are to continue fighting for the freedoms of the people in \n     the Middle East, we should expect that they compensate us, \n     maybe with oil. I know the answers are more complicated than \n     that, but there has to be something done. I would also, of \n     course, support alternative energy sources. I have heard \n     interesting things about algae, some of which you can see in \n     a video here: http://www.valcent.net/i/misc/Vertigro/\nindex.html.\n       I am not eloquent or succinct, but I wanted my voice heard. \n     Please encourage Washington to lift bans on off-shore \n     drilling, and also to explore domestic drilling. Also please \n     express support for programs to research alternative energy; \n     and anything else that will decrease our dependence on other \n     countries for our energy.\n       Thank you for your time, and your continued service to our \n     great state. Your representation is much appreciated.\n     Jennifer, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       You are trying to find out the public mind on what should \n     be done about the energy crisis and I really appreciate that. \n     Thank you.\n       I am in college, married and working to pay for school. The \n     gas prices have not helped me at all.\n       It is great that we are trying to get more fuel-efficient \n     cars but, I would like to see cars that do not need fuel at \n     all. (hydrogen fuel cell) The batteries for electric cars \n     have harmful chemicals in them and are going to be expensive \n     to replace and hard to dispose of. If we can push hydrogen we \n     will eliminate a lot of our dependency on oil altogether, \n     demand will go down; then the people who still need fossil \n     fuels can afford it.\n       As far as powering the nation goes, I am a great fan of \n     nuclear power. I started working at the INL outside of Idaho \n     Falls; here I was educated on nuclear energy and radiation. \n     Education was the key to convince me of the benefits of \n     nuclear power. People are just scared of it because they do \n     not understand it or radiation. If the public can be \n     educated, I believe nuclear power can become much more \n     feasible. Even new coal-fired power plants have a near zero \n     emission operation and I would be OK with using our coal \n     resource to ease the burden until a new energy strategy can \n     be implemented. In recent years, windmills were placed east \n     of Idaho Falls, and I like the idea of making the best use of \n     the resources in our area. Some things may work well here, \n     and other things may work well in other places. Researching \n     what works best in our area and implementing that is a wise \n     strategy.\n       Lastly, I favor drilling for our own oil. Self-sufficiency \n     is a principle that applies not only to individuals but to a \n     country as well.

Mr. President, it is with great admiration and \nrespect that I take this time to memorialize one of Kentucky's most \ncherished citizens, Mrs. Emma Jean Guyn Miller. Unfortunately, Mrs. \nMiller passed away at the age of 107. However, her life story should \nserve as an inspiration for people in central Kentucky and around the \nentire United States.\n  Mrs. Miller was born in Woodford County on September 29, 1901, and \nmoved with her family to Nicholasville in 1902. Since she was young \nMrs. Miller knew that she wanted to gain an education and better her \ncommunity. However, since Kentucky schools were still segregated during \nthis time period, Mrs. Miller could only attend the Nicholasville \nColored School, that only served students through the eighth grade. \nThis situation did not stop Mrs. Miller. Her mother, making only $4.50 \na week, and her local church saved enough money to send Mrs. Miller to \nRussell High School in Lexington where she graduated in 1920.\n  After graduating from high school she attended Turner Normal School \nin Shelbyville, TN, and earned her teaching certificate. She then \nreturned to Nicholasville and began a teaching career that lasted over \n40 years. Mrs. Miller began her career teaching in a one room \nschoolhouse and did not retire until segregated schools were ended in \nNicholasville. Her students remembered Mrs. Miller as a kind but strict \nteacher who always had their best interest at heart.\n  In 1940 she married William Miller, and although they did not have \nany children, the Millers opened their home to numerous young people in \nthe community who needed a place to stay. She also continued to be \nactive in Bethel AME Church, now Bethel Methodist Church, and was a \nmember for over 80 years. This church was the same congregation that \nhelped pay for her education at Russell High School.\n  Mrs. Miller's life story should serve an inspiration to every \nAmerican. Her uniquely American story should give us hope that we can \nmake a difference in our local communities and change the world one \nperson at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3022-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3022-S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING DANCEBLUE\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating the University of Kentucky's DanceBlue \nstudent organization and 24-hour dance marathon. This organization \noperates through the support and leadership of UK students, faculty, \nand staff as well as the Lexington community. The organization improves \nthe lives of children and families suffering from childhood cancer \nthrough the Golden Matrix Fund, and helps serve the Bluegrass by \nassisting those treated at the University of Kentucky Pediatric \nOncology Clinic. In just 4 years of operation, the DanceBlue \norganization has raised over $1 million towards research in childhood \ncancer. I would like to take this time to recognize the student \nleadership behind DanceBlue: Erin Priddy, Caitlin Mullen, Betsy Cooper, \nJoshua Rupp, Carson Massler, Townsend Miller, Colin Wheeler, and Tyler \nBolin.\n  Erin Priddy is a senior from Louisville, KY, and is the DanceBlue \noverall chair for this year. She is the fourth individual to preside \nover DanceBlue operations. Erin has spent many of her days and nights \nplanning this year-long fundraising process which builds up the actual \ndance marathon, as well as being a full time student. The success of \nthis organization would not be possible without the dedication and hard \nwork of Erin.\n  Caitlin Mullen is the vice chair for the DanceBlue organization and \nis also in her senior year at the University of Kentucky. Caitlin's \nhard work this entire year on the budget for the organization, as well \nas maintaining the organization's committees and keeping them together \nare a value to the entire university.\n  Betsy Cooper is a senior from Paducah, KY, and is the dance marathon \nprogramming chair. Betsy's role with DanceBlue involves planning, \norganizing, and orchestrating the entire 24-hour period of which the \nDance Marathon consists including overseeing 650 student dancers that \nwill dance for 24-hours.\n  Joshua Rupp is a senior from Louisville, KY, and is involved with \nmany organizations on campus. His role with DanceBlue is the rules, \nregulations and operations chair. He is in charge of the logistics for \nthe dance marathon which took place this past weekend. Josh's influence \nand presence on the University of Kentucky is a benefit to the school \nand the community.\n  Carson Massler is a senior from Louisville, KY, and graduate of \nSacred Heart Academy. Her role with DanceBlue is the family relations \nchair. Her position is vital to the organization since she serves as a \nliaison between the UK Pediatric Oncology Clinic and Golden Matrix Fund \nfamilies and DanceBlue. The partnerships she has created serve as a \nsign of hope that this organization will continue to flourish for many \nmore years.\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n  Townsend Miller is a senior from Lexington, KY, and is the corporate \nrelations chair. Townsend's role with DanceBlue this year involves \nmaintaining relationships with corporate sponsors of DanceBlue, and he \nis the representative of DanceBlue to local and national businesses.\n  Colin Wheeler is from Bowling Green, KY, and serves as the marketing \nchair for DanceBlue. Colin's work on public relations, press releases, \npress kits and promotional materials is one of the main reasons why the \norganization and 24-hour dance marathon is such a big success.\n  Tyler Bolin is a senior from Owensboro, KY, and serves as the special \nevents chair. Tyler has worked hard throughout the entire year planning \nevents that help build up to the dance marathon. His hard work and \nmotivation are truly an inspiration to all who meet him.\n  I am grateful that these students serve the people of the \nCommonwealth. I am confident that the children, families, and students \nwhose lives they touch are all thankful for the opportunity to know \nthem. The money that is raised through DanceBlue helps patients receive \nbetter care while improving the lives of children and their families \nsuffering from childhood cancer. The funds are also going directly to \npediatric cancer research initiatives that are helping to find a cure.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank these individuals for their \ncontributions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the University of \nKentucky, and the Lexington community. I wish them well in all their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3023-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING NEW ENGLAND CASTINGS, LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the manufacturing sector of our \nNation's economy is facing incredible hardships that are only amplified \nby the global economic downturn. In fact, Maine's manufacturing \nindustry has shed an alarming 23,600 jobs in the past 10 years, which \nrepresents nearly 30 percent of the State's manufacturing employment. \nDespite these challenges, some manufacturers, like New England \nCastings, the company I rise today to recognize, have been able to \nadapt, expand, and succeed.\n  Founded in 1985, New England Castings is an investment casting \nfoundry located in the western Maine town of Hiram. Considered the most \nancient form of metal casting, investment casting allows the firm to \nspecialize in producing specific castings that many conventional shops \noften find too difficult or intricate to fill. New England Castings \nprides itself on the timely creation of prototypes for customers to \nreview, allowing it to produce customers' orders in a shorter \ntimeframe. The firm was certified as a historically underutilized \nbusiness zone, or HUBZone, business in 2002, allowing it access to a \nwide variety of Federal contracting opportunities. The HUBZone program, \nmanaged by the Small Business Administration, assists small firms in \nrural and disadvantaged areas in attracting contracts to benefit their \nbusinesses and grow their companies.\n  Castings, which are the solidified materials made after pouring a \nliquid into a mold, have a number of practical uses, and New England \nCastings' work is easily suited to supply a number of diverse \nindustries. From medical and dental instruments to gas turbine \ncomponents, New England Castings' products run the gamut from small to \nlarge, slim to heavy. For instance, New England Castings can provide \nsturdy turbine powered tank combustor cover assemblies for Abrams M1 \ntanks, or more delicate window latches or sconces for architects \nseeking to beautify their buildings. The company's more innovative \npieces can be seen at Carnegie Hall in New York City and the \nSmithsonian's Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n  Although times are difficult for most small businesses, manufacturers \nhave been hit particularly hard by a confluence of challenges, \nincluding foreign competition, finding skilled workers, and rising \nenergy costs. But to remain competitive, New England Castings had to \ntransform the way it operated, and followed through by improving its \npractices and becoming a leaner company with increased productivity.\n  Seeking to secure a major contract to supply components to a railroad \nhardware manufacturer, New England Castings' president and owner, \nWalter Butler, decided that his company needed to become more efficient \nto earn the contract. After working with the Maine manufacturing \nextension partnership, MEP, a public-private partnership that assists \nsmall and medium manufacturers, New England Castings was able to double \nits sales, maximize the productivity of its workspace, and add 13 new \nemployees.\n  As cochair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, it is \nheartening to see small manufacturers like New England Castings utilize \nthe tremendous resources that the MEP has to offer, and I am certain \nthat the company will continue to benefit for years to come from the \ntraining and advice it has received. I congratulate Walter Butler and \neveryone at New England Castings for their dedication to creating \nquality products, and extend my best wishes for a productive and \nsuccessful year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3023-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3023-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3023-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n             ON MARCH 15, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--PM 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky urging the 111th United States \n     Congress to enact a federal Menu Education and Labeling \n     (Meal) Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, research continues to reveal the strong link \n     between diet and health, and that diet-related diseases start \n     early in life; and\n       Whereas, increased caloric intake is a key factor \n     contributing to the alarming increase in obesity in the \n     United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, two-thirds of American adults are overweight \n     or obese, and the rates of obesity have tripled in children \n     and teens since 1980. Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, \n     heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Each year \n     obesity costs families, businesses, and governments $117 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, over the past two decades, there has been a \n     significant increase in the numbers of meals prepared and \n     consumed outside of the home, with an estimated one-third of \n     calories and almost 46 percent of total food dollars being \n     spent on food purchased from and consumed at restaurants and \n     other food-service establishments; and\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\n       Whereas, studies like eating out with obesity and higher \n     caloric intakes. Foods that people eat from restaurants and \n     other food-service establishments are generally higher in \n     calories and saturated fat and lower in nutrients, such as \n     calcium and fiber, than home-prepared foods; and\n       Whereas, while nutrition labeling is currently required on \n     most packaged foods, this information is required only for \n     restaurant foods for which nutrient content or health claims \n     are made; and\n       Whereas, three-quarters of American adults report using \n     food labels on packaged foods, which are required by the \n     Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and went into effect in \n     1994. Using food labels is associated with eating healthier \n     diets, and approximately 48 percent of people report that the \n     nutrition information on food labels has caused them to \n     change their minds about buying a food product. Research \n     shows that people make healthier choices when restaurants \n     provide point-of-purchase nutrition information; and\n       Whereas, it is difficult for consumers to limit their \n     intake of calories at restaurants, given the limited \n     availability of nutrition information, as well as the popular \n     practice by many restaurants of providing foods in larger-\n     than-standard servings and `super-sized' portions; and\n       Whereas, the enacting of a federal Meal Act would provide \n     all Americans valuable additional nutritional information \n     that will best equip individuals and allow them to make \n     healthy choices when they are consuming prepared foods \n     outside of the home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The Senate of the Commonwealth of Kentucky \n     hereby urges the 111th United States Congress to enact a \n     federal Menu Education and Labeling (Meal) Act.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate shall forward a copy of \n     this Resolution to the Clerk of the United States Senate and \n     the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3025-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 303.

A bill to ensure that persons who form corporations in the \nUnited States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations, in \norder to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations \nfor criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in detecting, preventing, \nand punishing terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct \ninvolving United States corporations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, with my colleagues \nSenator Grassley and Senator McCaskill, the Incorporation Transparency \nand Law Enforcement Assistance Act. This bill tackles a longstanding \nhomeland security problem involving inadequate State incorporation \npractices that leave this country unnecessarily vulnerable to \nwrongdoers, hinders law enforcement, and damages the international \nstature of the United States.\n  The problem is straightforward. Each year, our States allow persons \nto form nearly 2 million corporations and limited liability companies \nin this country without knowing, or even asking, who the beneficial \nowners are behind those corporations. Right now, a person forming a \nU.S. corporation or limited liability company, LLC, provides less \ninformation to the State than is required to open a bank account or \nobtain a driver's license. Instead, States routinely permit persons to \nform corporations and LLCs under State laws without disclosing the \nnames of any of the people who will control or benefit from them.\n  It is a fact that criminals are exploiting this weakness in our State \nincorporation practices. They are forming new U.S. corporations and \nLLCs, and using these entities to commit crimes ranging from drug \ntrafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud, and \ncorruption.\n  Law enforcement authorities investigating these crimes have \ncomplained loudly for years about the lack of beneficial ownership \ninformation. Last year, for example, the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury sent a letter to the States stating: ``the lack of \ntransparency with respect to the individuals who control privately held \nfor-profit legal entities created in the United States continues to \nrepresent a substantial vulnerability in the U.S. anti-money \nlaundering/counter terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime. . . . [T]he \nuse of U.S. companies to mask the identity of criminals presents an \nongoing and substantial problem . . . for U.S. and global law \nenforcement authorities.''\n  Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, wrote the following:\n\n       In countless investigations, where the criminal targets \n     utilize shell corporations, the lack of law enforcement's \n     ability to gain access to true beneficial ownership \n     information slows, confuses or impedes the efforts by \n     investigators to follow criminal proceeds. This is the case \n     in financial fraud, terrorist financing and money laundering \n     investigations. . . . It is imperative that States maintain \n     beneficial ownership information while the company is active \n     and to have a set time frame for preserving those records. . \n     . . Shell companies can be sold and resold to several \n     beneficial owners in the course of a year or less. . . . By \n     maintaining records not only of the initial beneficial \n     ownership but of the subsequent beneficial owners, States \n     will provide law enforcement the tools necessary to clearly \n     identify the individuals who utilized the company at any \n     given period of time.\n\n  These types of complaints by U.S. law enforcement, their pleas for \nassistance, and their warnings about the dangers of anonymous U.S. \ncorporations operating here and abroad are catalogued in a stack of \nreports and hearing testimony from the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue \nService, and others.\n  To add insult to injury, our law enforcement officials have too often \nhad to stand silent when asked by their counterparts in other countries \nfor information about who owns a U.S. corporation committing crimes in \ntheir jurisdictions. The reality is that the United States can't answer \nthose requests, because we don't have the information.\n  Our bill would cure the problem by requiring State incorporation \nforms to include a request for the names of a corporation's beneficial \nowners. States would not be required to verify the information, but \ncivil or criminal penalties would apply to persons who submitted false \ninformation. If law enforcement issued a subpoena or summons to obtain \nthe ownership information, States would then supply the data contained \non its forms.\n  This bill has received the support of numerous law enforcement \nassociations, including the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of \nAssistant United States Attorneys, the National Narcotic Officers' \nAssociations Coalition, the United States Marshals Service Association, \nand the Association of Former ATF Agents.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, FLEOA, for example, \nwhich represents more than 26,000 Federal law enforcement officers, \nstates that ``the unfortunate lax attitude demonstrated by certain \nstates has enabled large criminal enterprises to exploit those state's \nflawed filing systems.'' FLEOA goes on:\n\n       We regard corporate ownership in the same manner as we do \n     vehicle ownership. Requiring the driver of a vehicle to have \n     a registration and insurance card is not a violation of their \n     privacy. This information does not need to be published in a \n     Yellow Pages, but it should be available to law enforcement \n     officers who make legally authorized requests pursuant to \n     official investigations.\n\n  The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, \nNAAUSA, which represents more than 1,500 Federal prosecutors, urges \nCongress to take legislative action to remedy inadequate State \nincorporation practices. NAAUSA states:\n\n       [M]indful of the ease with which criminals establish `front \n     organizations' to assist in money laundering, terrorist \n     financing, tax\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\n     evasion and other misconduct, it is shocking and unacceptable \n     that many State laws permit the creation of corporations \n     without asking for the identity of the corporation's \n     beneficial owners. Your legislation will guard against that \n     from happening, and no longer permit criminals to exploit the \n     lack of transparency in the registration of corporations.\n\n  Our bill was also endorsed by President Obama during the last \nCongress when he was a member of the U.S. Senate and served as an \noriginal cosponsor of the predecessor bill, S. 2956.\n  In 2006, the leading international anti-money laundering body in the \nworld, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering--known as \nFATF--issued a report criticizing the United States for its failure to \ncomply with a FATF standard requiring countries to obtain beneficial \nownership information for the corporations formed under their laws. \nThis standard is one of 40 FATF standards that this country has \npublicly committed itself to implementing as part of its efforts to \npromote strong anti-money laundering laws around the world.\n  FATF gave the United States 2 years, until July 2008, to make \nprogress toward coming into compliance with the FATF standard on \nbeneficial ownership information. That deadline passed long ago, and we \nhave yet to make any real progress. Enacting the bill we are \nintroducing today would bring the United States into compliance with \nthe FATF standard by requiring the States to obtain beneficial \nownership information for the corporations formed under their laws. It \nwould ensure that the United States met its international commitment to \ncomply with FATF anti-money laundering standards.\n  The bill being introduced today is also the product of years of work \nby the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair. As long ago as 2000, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nat my request, conducted an investigation and released a report \nentitled, ``Suspicious Banking Activities: Possible Money Laundering by \nU.S. Corporations Formed for Russian Entities.'' This report revealed \nthat one person was able to set up more than 2,000 Delaware shell \ncorporations and, without disclosing the identity of the beneficial \nowners, open U.S. bank accounts for those corporations, which then \ncollectively moved about $1.4 billion through the accounts. It is one \nof the earliest government reports to give some sense of the law \nenforcement problems caused by U.S. corporations with unknown owners. \nIt sounded the alarm years ago but to little avail.\n  In April 2006, in response to a Subcommittee request, GAO released a \nsecond report entitled, ``Company Formations: Minimal Ownership \nInformation Is Collected and Available,'' which reviewed the corporate \nformation laws in all 50 States. GAO disclosed that the vast majority \nof the States do not collect any information at all on the beneficial \nowners of the corporations and LLCs formed under their laws. The report \nalso found that many States have established automated procedures that \nallow a person to form a new corporation or LLC within the State within \n24 hours of filing an online application without any prior review of \nthat application by a State official. In exchange for a substantial \nfee, at least two States will form a corporation or LLC within one hour \nof a request. After examining these State incorporation practices, the \nGAO report described the problems that the lack of beneficial ownership \ninformation has caused for a range of law enforcement investigations.\n  In November 2006, our subcommittee held a hearing further exploring \nthis issue. At that hearing, representatives of the U.S. Department of \nJustice, DOJ, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, and the Department of \nTreasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, testified that \nthe failure of States to collect adequate information on the beneficial \nowners of the legal entities they form has impeded Federal efforts to \ninvestigate and prosecute criminal acts such as terrorism, money \nlaundering, securities fraud, and tax evasion. At the hearing, DOJ \ntestified:\n\n       We had allegations of corrupt foreign officials using these \n     [U.S.] shell accounts to launder money, but were unable--due \n     to lack of identifying information in the corporate records--\n     to fully investigate this area.\n\n  The IRS testified:\n\n       Within our own borders, the laws of some states regarding \n     the formation of legal entities have significant transparency \n     gaps which may even rival the secrecy afforded in the most \n     attractive tax havens.\n\n  FinCEN identified 768 incidents of suspicious international wire \ntransfer activity involving U.S. shell companies.\n  In addition, in a list of the ``Dirty Dozen'' tax scams in 2007, the \nIRS highlighted shell companies with unknown owners as number four on \nthe list, as follows:\n\n       4. Disguised Corporate Ownership: Domestic shell \n     corporations and other entities are being formed and operated \n     in certain states for the purpose of disguising the ownership \n     of the business or financial activity. Once formed, these \n     anonymous entities can be, and are being, used to facilitate \n     underreporting of income, non-filing of tax returns, listed \n     transactions, money laundering, financial crimes and possibly \n     terrorist financing. The IRS is working with state \n     authorities to identify these entities and to bring their \n     owners into compliance.\n\n  That is not all. Dozens of Internet websites advertising corporate \nformation services highlight the fact that some of our States allow \ncorporations to be formed under their laws without asking for the \nidentity of the beneficial owners. These Web sites explicitly point to \nanonymous ownership as a reason to incorporate within the United \nStates, and often list certain States alongside notorious offshore \njurisdictions as preferred locations for the formation of new \ncorporations, essentially providing an open invitation for wrongdoers \nto form entities within the United States.\n  One Web site, for example, set up by an international incorporation \nfirm, advocates setting up companies in Delaware by saying: \n``DELAWARE--An Offshore Tax Haven for Non U.S. Residents.'' It cites as \none of Delaware's advantages that: ``Owners' names are not disclosed to \nthe state.'' Another Web site, from a U.K. firm called \n``formacompanyoffshore.com,'' lists the advantages to incorporating in \nNevada. Those advantages include: ``No I.R.S. Information Sharing \nAgreement'' and ``Stockholders are not on Public Record allowing \ncomplete anonymity.''\n\n  Despite this type of advertising, years of law enforcement \ncomplaints, and mounting evidence of abuse, many of our States are \nreluctant to admit there is a problem with establishing U.S. \ncorporations and LLCs with unknown owners. Too many of our States are \neager to explain how quick and easy it is to set up corporations within \ntheir borders, without acknowledging that those same quick and easy \nprocedures enable wrongdoers to utilize U.S. corporations in a variety \nof crimes and tax dodges both here and abroad.\n  Since 2006, the subcommittee has worked with the States to encourage \nthem to recognize the homeland security problem they have created and \nto come up with their own solution. After the subcommittee's hearing on \nthis issue, for example, the National Association of Secretaries of \nState, NASS, convened a 2007 task force to examine state incorporation \npractices. At the request of NASS and several States, I delayed \nintroducing legislation while they worked on a proposal to require the \ncollection of beneficial ownership information. My subcommittee staff \nparticipated in multiple conferences, telephone calls, and meetings; \nsuggested key principles; and provided comments to the task force.\n  In July 2007, the NASS task force issued a proposal. Rather than cure \nthe problem, however, the proposal was full of deficiencies, leading \nthe Treasury Department to state in a letter that the NASS proposal \n``falls short'' and ``does not fully address the problem of legal \nentities masking the identity of criminals.''\n  Among other shortcomings, the NASS proposal does not require States \nto obtain the names of the natural individuals who would be the \nbeneficial owners of a U.S. corporation or LLC. Instead, it would allow \nStates to obtain a list of a company's ``owners of record'' who can be, \nand often are, offshore corporations or trusts. The NASS proposal also \ndoesn't require the States themselves to maintain the beneficial \nownership information, or to supply it to law enforcement upon receipt \nof a subpoena or summons. The proposal also fails to require the \nbeneficial ownership information to be updated over time. These and \nother flaws in the proposal have been identified by the\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\nTreasury Department, the Department of Justice, me, and others, but \nNASS has given no indication that the flaws will be corrected.\n  It is deeply disappointing that the States, despite the passage of \nmore than 1 year, were unable to devise an effective proposal. Part of \nthe difficulty is that the States have a wide range of practices, \ndiffer on the extent to which they rely on incorporation fees as a \nmajor source of revenue, and differ on the extent to which they attract \nnon-U.S. persons as incorporators. In addition, the States are \ncompeting against each other to attract persons who want to set up U.S. \ncorporations, and that competition creates pressure for each individual \nState to favor procedures that allow quick and easy incorporations. It \nis a classic case of competition causing a race to the bottom, making \nit difficult for any one State to do the right thing and request the \nnames of beneficial owners.\n  That is why we are introducing Federal legislation today. Federal \nlegislation is needed to level the playing field among the States, set \nminimum standards for obtaining beneficial ownership information, put \nan end to the practice of States forming millions of legal entities \neach year without knowing who is behind them, and bring the United \nStates into compliance with its international commitments.\n  The bill's provisions would require the States to obtain a list of \nthe beneficial owners of each corporation or LLC formed under their \nlaws, to maintain this information for 5 years after the corporation is \nterminated, and to provide the information to law enforcement upon \nreceipt of a subpoena or summons. If enacted, this bill would ensure, \nfor the first time, that law enforcement seeking beneficial ownership \ninformation from a State about one of its corporations or LLCs would \nnot be turned away empty-handed.\n  The bill would also require corporations and LLCs to update their \nbeneficial ownership information in an annual filing with the State of \nincorporation. If a State did not require an annual filing, the \ninformation would have to be updated each time the beneficial ownership \nchanged.\n  In the special case of U.S. corporations formed by non-U.S. persons, \nthe bill would go farther. Following the lead of the Patriot Act which \nimposed additional due diligence requirements on certain financial \naccounts opened by non-U.S. persons, our bill would require additional \ndue diligence for corporations beneficially owned by non-U.S. persons. \nThis added due diligence would have to be performed--not by the \nStates--but by the persons seeking to establish the corporations. These \nincorporators would have to file with the State a written certification \nfrom a corporate formation agent residing within the State attesting to \nthe fact that the agent had verified the identity of the non-U.S. \nbeneficial owners of the corporation by obtaining their names, \naddresses, and passport photographs. The formation agent would be \nrequired to retain this information for a specified period of time and \nproduce it upon request.\n  The bill would not require the States to verify the ownership \ninformation provided to them by a formation agent, corporation, LLC, or \nother person filing an incorporation application. Instead, the bill \nwould establish Federal civil and criminal penalties for anyone who \nknowingly provided a State with false beneficial ownership information \nor intentionally failed to provide the State with the information \nrequested.\n  The bill would also exempt certain corporations from the disclosure \nobligation. For example, it would exempt all publicly traded \ncorporations and the entities they form, since these corporations are \nalready overseen by the Security and Exchange Commission. It would also \nallow the States, with the written concurrence of the Homeland Security \nSecretary and the U.S. Attorney General, to identify certain \ncorporations, either individually or as a class, which would not have \nto list their beneficial owners, if requiring such ownership \ninformation would not serve the public interest or assist law \nenforcement in their investigations. These exemptions are expected to \nbe narrowly drawn and used sparingly, but are intended to provide the \nStates and Federal law enforcement added flexibility to fine-tune the \ndisclosure obligation and focus it where it is most needed to stop \ncrime, tax evasion, and other wrongdoing.\n\n  Another area of flexibility in the bill involves privacy issues. The \nbill deliberately does not take a position on the issue of whether the \nStates should make the beneficial ownership information they receive \navailable to the public. Instead, the bill leaves it entirely up to the \nStates to decide whether and under what circumstances to make \nbeneficial ownership information available to the public. The bill \nexplicitly permits the States to place restrictions on providing \nbeneficial ownership information to persons other than government \nofficials. The bill focuses instead on ensuring that law enforcement \nand Congress, provided they are equipped with a subpoena or summons, \nare given ready access to the beneficial ownership information \ncollected by the States.\n  To ensure that the States have the funds needed to meet the new \nbeneficial ownership information requirements, the bill makes it clear \nthat States can use their DHS state grant funds for this purpose. Every \nState is guaranteed a minimum amount of DHS grant funds every year and \nmay receive funds substantially above that minimum. Every State will be \nable to use all or a portion of these funds to modify their \nincorporation practices to meet the requirements in the act. The bill \nalso authorizes DHS to use appropriated funds to carry out its \nresponsibilities under the act. These provisions will ensure that the \nStates have the funds needed for the modest compliance costs involved \nwith amending their incorporation forms to request the names of \nbeneficial owners.\n  It is common for bills establishing Federal standards to seek to \nensure State action by making some Federal funding dependent upon a \nState's meeting the specified standards. This bill, however, states \nexplicitly that nothing in the bill authorizes DHS to withhold funds \nfrom a State for failing to modify its incorporation practices to meet \nthe beneficial ownership information requirements in the act. Instead, \nthe bill simply calls for a GAO report in 2013 to identify which \nStates, if any, have failed to strengthen their incorporation practices \nas required by the act. After getting this status report, a future \nCongress can decide what steps to take, including whether to reduce any \nDHS funding going to the noncompliant States.\n  Finally, the bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury \nto issue a rule requiring formation agents to establish anti-money \nlaundering programs to ensure they are not forming U.S. corporations or \nLLCs for criminals or other wrongdoers. GAO would also be asked to \nconduct a study of existing State formation procedures for partnerships \nand trusts.\n  We have worked hard to craft a bill that would address, in a fair and \nreasonable way, the homeland security problem created by States \nallowing the formation of millions of U.S. corporations and LLCs with \nunknown owners. What the bill comes down to is a simple requirement \nthat States change their incorporation applications to add a question \nrequesting the names and addresses of the prospective beneficial \nowners. That is not too much to ask to protect this country and the \ninternational community from wrongdoers seeking to misuse U.S. \ncorporations and to help law enforcement stop those wrongdoers.\n  For those who say that, if the United States tightens its \nincorporation rules, new companies will be formed elsewhere, it is \nappropriate to ask exactly where they will go. Every country in the \nEuropean Union is already required to get beneficial information for \nthe corporations formed under their laws. Most offshore jurisdictions \nalready request this information as well, including the Bahamas, Cayman \nIslands, Jersey, and the Island of Man. Our States should be asking for \nthe same ownership information, but they don't, and there is no \nindication that they will any time in the near future, unless required \nto do so.\n  I wish Federal legislation weren't necessary. I wish the States could \nsolve this homeland security problem on their own, but ongoing \ncompetitive pressures make it unlikely that the States will reach \nagreement. It has been more than 2 years since our 2006 hearing with no \nreal progress to show for it, despite repeated pleas from law \nenforcement.\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\n  Federal legislation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the \nUnited States to wrongdoing by U.S. corporations with unknown owners, \nto protect interstate and international commerce from criminals \nmisusing U.S. corporations, to strengthen the ability of law \nenforcement to investigate suspect U.S. corporations, to level the \nplaying field among the States, and to bring the United States into \ncompliance with its international anti-money laundering obligations.\n  There is also an issue of consistency. For years, I have been \nfighting offshore corporate secrecy laws and practices that enable \nwrongdoers to secretly control offshore corporations involved in money \nlaundering, tax evasion, and other misconduct. I have pointed out on \nmore than one occasion that corporations were not created to hide \nownership, but to shield owners from personal liability for corporate \nacts. Unfortunately, today, the corporate form has too often been \ncorrupted into serving those wishing to conceal their identities and \ncommit crimes or dodge taxes without alerting authorities. It is past \ntime to stop this misuse of the corporate form. But if we want to stop \ninappropriate corporate secrecy offshore, we need to stop it here at \nhome as well.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand put an end to incorporation practices that promote corporate \nsecrecy and render the United States and other countries vulnerable to \nabuse by U.S. corporations with unknown owners.\n  As I mentioned earlier, in the 110th Congress, then-Senator Obama was \nan original cosponsor of this legislation. I look forward to working \nwith President Obama to ensure this homeland security bill is enacted \ninto law.\n  I thank my cosponsor, Senator Grassley, who has been such a leader in \nthis effort for so long, as he has in so many other good government \ninitiatives. I also thank Senator McCaskill for her cosponsorship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Incorporation Transparency \n     and Law Enforcement Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability \n     companies are being formed under the laws of the States each \n     year.\n       (2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the \n     beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability \n     companies formed under their laws.\n       (3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability \n     company within the United States typically provides less \n     information to the State of incorporation than is needed to \n     obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does \n     not name a single beneficial owner.\n       (4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State \n     formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming \n     corporations or limited liability companies in the United \n     States, and have then used the newly created entities to \n     commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce \n     such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax \n     evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of \n     foreign corruption.\n       (5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and \n     limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes \n     have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial \n     ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony \n     by officials from the Department of Justice, the Department \n     of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal \n     Revenue Service, and the Government Accountability Office, \n     and others.\n       (6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money \n     laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on \n     Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the \n     ``FATF''), of which the United States is a member, issued a \n     report that criticizes the United States for failing to \n     comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial \n     ownership information and urged the United States to correct \n     this deficiency by July 2008.\n       (7) In response to the FATF report, the United States has \n     repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation \n     practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for \n     the corporations and limited liability companies formed under \n     the laws of such States.\n       (8) Many States have established automated procedures that \n     allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability \n     company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online \n     application, without any prior review of the application by a \n     State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States \n     will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.\n       (9) Dozens of Internet websites highlight the anonymity of \n     beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices \n     of some States, point to those practices as a reason to \n     incorporate in those States, and list those States together \n     with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the \n     formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open \n     invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities \n     within the United States.\n       (10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all \n     countries in the European Union are required to identify the \n     beneficial owners of the corporations they form.\n       (11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to \n     wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited \n     liability companies with unknown owners, to protect \n     interstate and international commerce from criminals misusing \n     United States corporations and limited liability companies, \n     to strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect \n     corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum \n     standards for and level the playing field among State \n     incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into \n     compliance with its international anti-money laundering \n     obligations, Federal legislation is needed to require the \n     States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the \n     corporations and limited liability companies formed under the \n     laws of such States.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRANSPARENT INCORPORATION PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Transparent Incorporation Practices.--\n       (1) In general.--Subtitle A of title XX of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2009.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the same bill the \nSenator from Michigan spoke on, but I ought to compliment him. He is \nmost known for being a leader in the area of military affairs because \nof being chairman of that committee. But for sure, for years he has \nbeen also a chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nand so much of the work that comes out of this legislation comes out of \nhis work on that committee. I think he ought to be commended for the \nwork he does through investigations there as well.\n  I am happy to join Senator Levin and Senator McCaskill in \ncosponsoring the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act. This bill requires States to obtain corporate ownership \ninformation at the time of formation and help law enforcement \ninvestigate shell companies which are set up for the sole purpose of \nconducting illegal activities.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Levin joined me when I introduced a bill \nthat we entitled the Hedge Fund Transparency Act. I said then that the \nmajor cause of the current financial crisis is a lack of transparency \namong hedge funds. That same thing can be said about corporate \nownership. In too many States, very little ownership information is \nneeded to register a corporation, and the actual owners of that \ncorporation are often hidden behind the agents and lawyers who register \nthe corporation on behalf of owners.\n  One example of how these criminals take advantage of this lack of \ntransparency is the practice of setting up and using shell corporations \nto hide corporate ownership information. These individuals set up shell \ncorporations that have the benefits of corporate registration and \nfunction legitimately. But these same corporations are being used to \nhide illegal activities. These activities include a variety of \nelaborate schemes to disguise money laundering, tax evasion, and \nsecurities fraud. Law enforcement officials from the Department of \nJustice and the Internal Revenue Service have testified before Congress \nabout how the lack of corporate information has been a very significant \nimpediment to their ability to conduct criminal investigations.\n  For example, when a corporation is involved in illegal activities, \nthe legitimate corporate owners are often hidden, making it difficult \nfor law enforcement agencies to determine who is actually responsible. \nThat, in turn, makes it difficult to bring the real culprits to \njustice. States differ as to what corporate information is required to \nregister a corporation and how long it takes to process that paperwork. \nMost States require only the name of the company, the name and address \nof the agent, a signature, and, of course, a fee.\n  In fact, the Government Accountability Office found that most States \nwill take the time to verify that the fee has been paid but do not take \nthe time to verify the identities of the incorporators, officers, and \ndirectors. Perhaps even more important, no State checks the names of \nincorporators, officers, or directors against criminal records and the \nwatch lists that sometimes Federal agencies have. As a result, we have \nno way of knowing if the beneficial owners are criminals, or they could \neven be terrorists, for that matter. Many States now have introduced \nelectronic registration procedures that enable a new corporation to be \nregistered on line within 24 hours. States offer this expedited service \nin exchange for yet an additional fee. In fact, there are two States \nwhere an individual can form a corporation within 1 hour of making the \nrequest. The promise of quick registration and little oversight has \nproven to be a very popular revenue generator for some States. But this \nprocess is not necessarily in the best interest of protecting our \nfinancial system or our national security.\n  Some States have raised concerns that if their incorporation laws are \ntightened, corporations will simply register in other States where \nthere are less stringent registration requirements. This bill is to \ntake care of that problem. It is designed to bring some sanity to this \nwhole process. It makes the registration requirement uniform over all \n50 States, as well as the District of Columbia. This way corporations \nwill simply not be able to ``shop around'' for the State with the most \nrelaxed standards and simply play one State against the other. Further, \nmuch of the information set forth in this bill is already required by \nthe European Union and many offshore jurisdictions. This bill simply \nupdates our laws to match those of other nations combating the same \nproblems with money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorist financing.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Levin and \nMcCaskill requires that States obtain a list of the beneficial owners \nof each corporation or limited liability company formed under their \nlaws before the corporation is registered in that particular State. The \nbill also requires that States ensure required information is updated \nannually and that States provide the information to civil or criminal \nlaw enforcement agencies upon receipt of a subpoena or summons. This \nalso establishes a civil penalty of up to $10,000 and a criminal \npenalty of up to 3 years in prison for providing false information.\n  Additionally, the bill would exempt publicly traded companies that \nare already regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nFurther, the bill requires non-U.S. beneficial owners to provide \ncertification from an in-State agent that verifies the identity of the \nbeneficial owner.\n  Finally, this bill requires the Government Accountability Office to \ncomplete a study of State beneficial ownership information requirements \nfor in-State partnerships and trusts and gives the States until October \n2011 to require beneficial ownership information for the corporations \nand limited liability companies formed under their laws.\n  I urge colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation as we try \nto bring greater transparency to our financial system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 572. A bill to provide for the issuance of a ``forever stamp'' to \nhonor the sacrifices of the brave men and women of the armed forces who \nhave been awarded the Purple Heart; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I have introduced a bill that will create \na perpetual Purple Heart stamp. I cannot think of any other stamp or \nany other area for a perpetual stamp that is more deserving than this \naward which recognizes sacrifice on the battlefield.\n  The original cosponsors of this legislation are Senators Brown, \nVitter, Wicker, Boxer, Lincoln, and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. The Purple \nHeart is the oldest continually authorized U.S. military decoration. It \nwas created as a badge of military merit by George Washington in 1782.\n  The original Purple Hearts were awarded to three soldiers in the \nContinental Army who had shown outstanding courage during the \nRevolutionary War. In 1931, Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur \ncommissioned work on a new design for the Purple Heart to coincide with \nthe then upcoming 200th anniversary of President Washington's birth.\n  President Hoover's War Department authorized the award for wounds \nreceived by Army personnel in action or for meritorious service dating \nback to World War I. On February 22, 1932, General MacArthur became its \nfirst recipient. In December of 1942, the Purple Heart was extended to \nall branches of service, but the criteria were then strictly limited to \nthose we know\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\ntoday; that is, to be awarded to those who are wounded or killed during \ndirect combat with the enemies of the United States. More than 1.7 \nmillion Americans of every race, color, creed and from all 50 States \nhave received the Purple Heart in honor of their sacrifice on our \nNation's battlefields.\n  This is the only U.S. military decoration for which there is no \nrecommendation. It is simply earned through bloodshed for our country.\n  In 2003, the Postal Service honored recipients of this award by \ncommissioning a first-class Purple Heart stamp in a ceremony at the \nhome of George Washington in Mount Vernon, VA. The image used for this \nstamp is a photograph of one of the two Purple Hearts received by \nMarine LTC James Loftus Fowler of Alexandria, VA, which he received in \n1968 as a battalion commander near the Ben Hai River in South Vietnam. \nSince that first issuance in 2003, approximately 1.2 billion first-\nclass Purple Heart stamps have been sold, an average of 200 million a \nyear. At the new first-class rate of 44 cents, which is taking place in \nMay, that is approximately $88 million a year in revenue for the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  This yearly sales rate is equal to or greater than the sales of even \nthe most popular commemorative stamps issued during that period, stamps \nbearing such American icons as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, \nsinger Frank Sinatra, and the classic Disney characters.\n  In 2007, the Postal Service created the first ``forever'' stamp, a \nstamp which, no matter when it was purchased, would be good for first-\nclass postage on the day it was used. The image they chose was an image \nas old and venerable and quintessentially American as the Purple \nHeart--the Liberty Bell. According to a Postal Service press release, \nsince its first issuance in April of 2007, more than 6 billion forever \nLiberty Bell stamps have been sold. This is an order of magnitude \ngreater than any other single stamp sold in the United States, \ngenerating revenue of $2 billion.\n  Clearly, the volume of sales of forever stamps is a win for the \nPostal Service, which is facing a shortfall in future revenues, and a \nwin in terms of the value delivered to the people who want to use them.\n  In creating the first Purple Heart, General Washington said:\n\n       Let it be known that he who wears the military order of the \n     Purple Heart has given of his blood in defense of his \n     homeland and shall forever be revered by his fellow \n     countrymen.\n\n  George Washington intended that the Nation he helped found would \nforever revere those who wear the Purple Heart as a symbol of the \nsacrifice they have given in our Nation's defense.\n  As a recipient of the Purple Heart in Vietnam as a Marine, I believe \nthat making the Purple Heart stamp a forever stamp is the most \nappropriate way to honor the past and future recipients of our Nation's \noldest military decoration.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Carper, Mr. Levin, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 574. A bill to enhance citizen access to Government information \nand services by establishing that Government documents issued to the \npublic must be written clearly, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Plain Writing \nAct of 2009. I am pleased that Senators George Voinovich, Tom Carper \nCarl Levin, Claire McCaskill, and Jon Tester have joined as original \nco-sponsors of this legislation.\n  Our bill is very similar to H.R. 946, introduced by Representative \nBruce Braley last month.\n  The Plain Writing Act has a simple purpose: it would require the \nFederal Government to write more clearly. Agencies would be required to \nwrite documents that are released to the public in a way that is clear, \nconcise, well-organized, readily understandable.\n  This bill would extend an initiative that President Bill Clinton and \nVice President Al Gore started a decade ago as part of the Reinventing \nGovernment initiative. In 1998, President Clinton directed agencies to \nwrite in plain language. Although many agencies have made progress in \nwriting more clearly, the requirement never was fully implemented. In \nrecent years, the focus on plain writing has dropped. This legislation \nwill renew that focus.\n  There are many benefits to plain writing. First, it promotes \ntransparency and accountability. It is very difficult to hold the \nFederal Government accountable for its actions if only lawyers can \nunderstand Government writing. As we face an economic crisis and \nunprecedented budget deficits, the American people need clear \nexplanations of Government actions.\n  Plain writing also improves customer service. Individuals and \nbusinesses waste time and money, and make unnecessary errors, because \nGovernment instructions, forms, and other documents are too \ncomplicated. Anyone who has filled out their own tax forms, \napplications for Federal financial aid or veterans' benefits, Medicare \nforms, or any number of other overly complicated Federal forms \nunderstands the need for plain writing.\n  Government officials, in turn, spend time and money answering \nquestions and addressing complaints from people frustrated with \nGovernment documents they cannot understand. Correcting the errors \npeople make because they do not understand Government documents demands \nGovernment officials' time as well. Because of this, plain writing \nmakes Government more efficient and effective.\n  Numerous organizations have called on Congress to require the Federal \nGovernment to write more clearly, including the AARP, Disabled American \nVeterans, National Small Business Association, Small Business \nLegislative Council, Women Impacting Public Policy, American Nurses \nAssociation, American Library Association, American Association of Law \nLibraries, and several associations dedicated to promoting better \ncommunication. These groups support plain writing because their members \ncomplain about their frustration with trying to understand Government \ndocuments--or hiring attorneys to decipher them--and the time and money \nthey waste because the Government does not write plainly.\n  As a former teacher and principal, I understand that even very smart \npeople must be trained to write plainly, so this bill recognizes that \nFederal Employees will need plain writing training. Each agency will \nreport their plans to train employees in plain writing. Writing in \nplain, clear, concise, and easily understandable language is a skill \nthat Congress and Federal agencies must foster. As Thomas Jefferson \nonce said, ``The most valuable of all talents is that of never using \ntwo words when one will do.''\n  Additionally, congressional oversight will ensure that agencies \nimplement the plain language requirements. Agencies will be required to \ndesignate a senior official responsible for implementing plain language \nrequirements and to report to Congress how it will ensure compliance \nwith the plain language requirement and on its progress.\n  To avoid imposing too great a burden on agencies, agencies will not \nbe required to rewrite existing documents. Only new or substantially \nrevised documents will be covered. Similarly, this bill does not cover \nregulations, so that agencies can focus first on improving their every \nday communications with the American people. We recognize that it will \nbe more challenging to write plainly when crafting regulations, which \noften must be technical and complex.\n  Requiring plain writing is an important step in improving the way the \nFederal Government communicates with the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an important \nmoment for the people of Lithuania. Last month, Lithuania celebrated \nits 1000 year anniversary.\n  Along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Voinovich from Ohio \nand Senator Feinstein from California, I have submitted a commemorative \nresolution for this occasion.\n  As the birthplace of my mother, who came to the United States from \nLithuania with her parents when she was just 2 years old, Lithuania \nholds a special place in my heart.\n  One thousand years sounds like a long time, especially in our \nrelatively young United States. But historians have noted that the name \nof the area now known as Lithuania first appeared in European records, \nin the German Annals of Quedlinburg.\n  Traditions of Lithuanian statehood date back to the early Middle \nAges, when Duke Mindaugas united an assortment of Baltic Tribes to \ndefend themselves from attacks by the Teutonic Knights. From these \nearly roots, Lithuania grew to encompass territory stretching from the \nBaltic Sea to the Black Sea by the end of the 14th century.\n  This nation, which once was the largest in Europe, has seen \nextraordinary struggles during the last century. It suffered 50 years \nof occupation, by both Nazi and Soviet forces.\n  Throughout that time, the U.S. Congress stood in support of Lithuania \nand its Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, and refused to recognize \nthe Soviet occupation. In 2007, the United States and Lithuania \ncelebrated 85 years of continuous diplomatic relations.\n  Today, Lithuania is a thriving free-market democracy and a strong \nally of the United States. As a member of the European Union and NATO, \nLithuania contributes to peace and security in Europe. Lithuania also \ncontributes to global stability and peace building through its \ncontributions to missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and \nGeorgia.\n  When I traveled to Lithuania a few years ago and visited the village \nof my mother and grandparents, I was welcomed warmly by President \nAdamkus, who I have known for many years, and the people of Lithuania. \nI was so proud, not only to see my family's roots, but to see how far \nLithuania has come, despite the many difficulties it endured in the \nlast century.\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\n  I congratulate President Adamkus, Foreign Minister Usackas, and the \npeople of Lithuania on this historic occasion.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 70) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 70\n\n       Whereas the name ``Lithuania'' first appeared in European \n     records in the year 1009, when it was mentioned in the German \n     manuscript ``Annals of Quedlinburg'';\n       Whereas Duke Mindaugas united various Baltic tribes and \n     established the state of Lithuania during the period between \n     1236 and 1263;\n       Whereas, by the end of the 14th century, Lithuania was the \n     largest country in Europe, encompassing territory from the \n     Baltic Sea to the Black Sea;\n       Whereas Vilnius University was founded in 1579 and remained \n     the easternmost university in Europe for 200 years;\n       Whereas the February 16, 1918 Act of Independence of \n     Lithuania led to the establishment of Lithuania as a \n     sovereign and democratic state;\n       Whereas, under the cover of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, on \n     June 17, 1940, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania were forcibly \n     incorporated into the Soviet Union in violation of pre-\n     existing peace treaties;\n       Whereas, during 50 years of Soviet occupation of the Baltic \n     states, Congress strongly, consistently, and on a bipartisan \n     basis refused to legally recognize the incorporation of \n     Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania by the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, on March 11, 1990, the Republic of Lithuania was \n     restored and Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to \n     declare independence;\n       Whereas on September 2, 1991, the United States Government \n     formally recognized Lithuania as an independent and sovereign \n     nation;\n       Whereas Lithuania has successfully developed into a free \n     and democratic country, with a free market economy and \n     respect for the rule of law;\n       Whereas Lithuania is a full and responsible member of the \n     United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization;\n       Whereas in 2007, the United States Government and the \n     Government of Lithuania celebrated 85 years of continuous \n     diplomatic relations;\n       Whereas the United States Government welcomes and \n     appreciates efforts by the Government of Lithuania to \n     maintain international peace and stability in Europe and \n     around the world by contributing to international civilian \n     and military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, \n     and Georgia; and\n       Whereas Lithuania is a strong and loyal ally of the United \n     States, and the people of Lithuania share common values with \n     the people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of the Republic of Lithuania \n     on the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of Lithuania;\n       (2) commends the Government of Lithuania for its success in \n     implementing political and economic reforms, for establishing \n     political, religious, and economic freedom, and for its \n     commitment to human rights; and\n       (3) recognizes the close and enduring relationship between \n     the United States Government and the Government of Lithuania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/11/senate-section/article/S3034-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 570\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.
