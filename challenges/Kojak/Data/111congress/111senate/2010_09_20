Mr. President, I would like to speak a bit about the two \ncompeting philosophies of economic growth. The first version I will \ndiscuss is the so-called Keynesian economics, which has been the basis \nof the Obama administration's economic policy since January 2009 and, I \nwould add, with little to no success in reviving our economy and \nreducing unemployment.\n  Keynesian economics relies on the theory that in recessionary times, \nincreased government spending can take the place of private sector \nactivity, hence the administration's nearly $1 trillion stimulus \npackage, the Cash for Clunkers Program and a litany of other government \nprograms, transfer payments, and temporary tax credits. This \nadministration's insistence on enacting these temporary Keynesian \npolicies to stimulate consumption is misguided and has ultimately \nfailed.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorialized in a piece called ``The \nObama Economy:''\n\n       Never before has government spent so much and intervened so \n     directly in credit allocation to spur growth, yet the results \n     have been mediocre at best. In return for adding nearly $3 \n     trillion in Federal debt in 2 years, we still have 14.9 \n     million people unemployed. What happened?\n\n  Well, I will mention three problems with Keynesian economics that I \nthink help to answer that question. First of all, someone without a job \nis not going to be fooled into spending more money because of a one-\ntime payment that he or she received from the Federal Government. \nPeople only change their spending habits when they know they will have \na greater consistent income\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nover time, such as when they receive a raise at work. In fact, the \nevidence has shown that people either save one-time rebates or shift \nfuture consumption forward but do not permanently increase their work \neffort or incentive to invest, which is what is needed to jump-start \neconomic growth.\n  Second, Keynesian economics assumes the government has the foresight \nto determine in advance which spending programs would best create \neconomic growth. Well, the obvious problem with this assumption is, \nCongress does not spend taxpayers' money wisely. We see time and time \nagain how straightforward pieces of legislation get loaded up with \nspecial projects which are costly and of questionable value to the \npublic. This has been one of the problems with the stimulus package.\n  Third, if the problem is lack of consumption and Americans are too \nbroke to spend, how can the government spend for us? We are the \ngovernment. It is our tax money that is being spent. We have to pay it \nback if it is borrowed.\n  The authors of a textbook entitled ``Economics: Public and Private \nChoice,'' write:\n\n       There are no free lunches. Regardless how they are \n     financed, activities undertaken by the government will be \n     costly. When governments purchase resources and other goods \n     and services to provide rockets, education, highways, health \n     care, and other goods, the resources used by the government \n     will be unavailable to produce goods and services in the \n     private sector. As a result, private-sector output will be \n     lower.\n\n  In short, there is a major misconception that consumption fueled by \ngovernment spending actually creates economic growth. It doesn't. It \njust moves money around. Taking it from the private sector to be spent \nby the government removes critical capital that is needed to create \njobs.\n  I noticed, in catching up on reading some of the newspapers over the \nweekend, that Treasury Secretary Geithner weighed into this debate a \nlittle bit. Recall that over the last several weeks there has been a \ndebate about whether we should prevent all taxes from going up or \nsimply prevent a tax increase on the so-called middle class. The idea \nis that middle-class families spend whatever money they have available. \nThat plays into this Keynesian economic notion that it advances \nspending so we should let them keep more of their money but that \nwealthier people--the people in the top two brackets--don't spend their \nmoney and, therefore, they do not contribute to economic growth. But of \ncourse it totally misses the point that money saved is money ultimately \ninvested. If it is invested, it is either put in a bank, which can then \nlend more money to people who need to borrow or it is directly invested \nin stocks or bonds or some other enterprise which generally results in \nthe acquisition of more equipment or the hiring of more people, both of \nwhich are essential to reducing unemployment and getting the economy \nback moving again.\n  Well, Treasury Secretary Geithner was testifying before the Congress \nabout the possibility of imposing penalties on China because of its \ncurrency policies. According to an article in Friday's Washington \nTimes--on the front page:\n\n       While taking his toughest stance to date on China's need to \n     speed up the pace of currency reform, Treasury Secretary \n     Timothy F. Geithner echoed China's point that doing that by \n     itself will not eliminate the gigantic $230 billion trade \n     deficit with China or restore millions of manufacturing jobs \n     lost in the recession.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the article:\n\n       ``Americans also must save more and invest more while \n     consuming less of the world's bounty,'' he said, ``to bring a \n     better balance to trade.''\n\n  He is right. America does need to save more and invest more. That is \nthe way you restore not just the manufacturing jobs lost in the \nrecession but a lot of the other jobs as well.\n  Reporting on the same story in another newspaper, Secretary Geithner \nis quoted as saying:\n\n       We are concerned . . . that the pace of appreciation has \n     been too slow. The most important things we can do to make \n     manufacturing stronger in the United States are going to be \n     about the policies we pursue in the United States.\n\n  I think he is right and that the policies we have to pursue are the \npolicies of savings and investment--exactly what he said. It may be \nfine for the U.S. economy to spend more money, but the reality is, each \nof our families and our businesses are better off if we save and invest \nat this important time in our history.\n  So let there be no mistake; the Secretary's promotion of savings and \ninvestment is contrary to this Keynesian notion that all we have to do \nis spend more money and the economy will get better. There is a need to \nsave and a need to invest. That is what enables businesses to create \nmore jobs.\n  I think it is very important to remind everyone that economic growth \nstems from combining three separate inputs--labor, capital, and \ntechnology. These three factors of production result in output that we \ncan then consume. Without labor, without capital--that is the savings \nand investment part--and technology, which enhances our productivity, \nthere can be no consumption. Focusing on policies that stimulate \nconsumption targets the wrong side of the equation.\n  In order to get the economy going, we need to focus on the inputs, \nand that is where the second philosophy of economic growth comes in. \nSome people refer to it as supply-side economics. The fundamental \nprinciple of supply-side economics is that people work harder and take \nmore risks when there are more opportunities for economic gain and less \ngovernment intrusion.\n  Translating this economic philosophy into policy means reducing \ngovernment consumption by cutting spending; thus, leaving resources in \nthe private sector. It also means not raising taxes on anyone, \nespecially in these difficult economic times--certainly not on the very \nemployers that we count on to hire more workers. Who employs 25 percent \nof our workplace? Small businesses. Who would bear the brunt of tax \nincreases in the upper two brackets? Small businesses. So the last \nthing we should be doing is raising taxes on anyone, most especially \nour small businesses to which we are looking to produce more jobs.\n\n  There is plenty of evidence that the economic theory I am talking \nabout works in practice. We have abundant evidence of what works and \nwhat does not. A recent study was conducted by Harvard economists \nAlberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna, who recently studied more than 100 \nfiscal adjustments in 21 separate countries over the past 40 years. The \ncountries are all in the OECD. These are the more economically advanced \ncountries of the world.\n  The fiscal adjustments that led to economic expansions were generally \nbased around spending cuts. By contrast, the adjustments that led to \neconomic recessions were based around tax increases. Thus, spending \ncuts, not tax hikes, appear to be the more effective strategy for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Using data from more than 90 different OECD countries, Alesina and \nArdagna also compared the relative benefits of spending increases and \ntax cuts. Their conclusion: Tax cuts are a much better way to spur \neconomic growth.\n  Unfortunately, the current administration and Congress have done the \nexact opposite of what these two economists from Harvard have proposed. \nThey have dramatically increased Federal spending and are now \nthreatening to implement a massive tax hike, exactly the wrong \nprescription. I believe it is long past time for Congress to consider \nan alternative strategy, a strategy that rejects misguided income tax \nincreases and, instead, focuses on targeted spending reductions; a \nstrategy that lowers our corporate tax rate, which is the second \nhighest of all of the OECD countries; a strategy that blocks unelected \nFederal bureaucrats from imposing new energy taxes on small businesses \nand middle-class households; a strategy that restructures our three \nbiggest entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--\nto prevent a future fiscal crisis; a strategy that reins in overall \nhealth care costs through market-oriented, consumer-driven reforms; a \nstrategy that promotes free trade across the globe and strengthens our \nbilateral relationships in the process; a strategy that embraces clear, \ntransparent fiscal regulations to end taxpayer bailouts and discourage \nexcessive leveraging.\n  These are just some of the recommendations that come from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. I note that they track very closely a \npiece that\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nfour economists and George Shultz, a former Cabinet member--in fact, \ntwo different Secretaries in the Cabinet of the President of the United \nStates--George Shultz, Michael Boskin, John Cogan, Allan Meltzer, and \nJohn Taylor. They wrote a piece in the September 16 Wall Street Journal \ncalled ``Principles for Economic Revival.'' These principles track very \nclosely the principles I have just identified and provide what I think \nis a very good blueprint for moving forward.\n  Just a final note. I would note parochially that starting in the \nthird paragraph of their piece: ``The Noble Prize-winning economist \nEdward Prescott'' is from Arizona State University. I visited with Dr. \nPrescott, and I can affirm the things he teaches in his classes as well \nas what he teaches by his writings are the principles upon which we can \nbuild economic growth. They are what I said in the very beginning of my \nremarks. They are the principles of incentive for more economic output \nand reward.\n  He talks, in this piece, about the way higher tax rates on labor are \nassociated with the reductions in the labor output, and therefore the \nproductivity of the country, the wages of the people, and the economic \ncondition of the country.\n  Also, the authors have a very interesting chart in this Wall Street \nJournal piece called ``The Cost of Washington.'' It is astonishing to \nsee on paper the cost of World War I--in fact, the cost of the Civil \nWar before that, the cost of World War II--pretty high. Then it went \nback down again. These are all costs as a percent of GDP.\n  Now when we have the biggest gross domestic product ever, \ndramatically larger even than what we had in World War II, we have \ncosts of the Federal Government that exceed even the cost as a \npercentage of GDP of World War II.\n  The President's folks, as well as those who advise Congress, have all \nsaid this is unsustainable. It is one of the reasons it is time for us, \nas I said, to get back to principles for economic revival and focus on \nreducing unnecessary spending and making certain that, especially in \nthese times, we resist the notion of raising taxes on any Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent this Wall Street Journal op-ed be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 16, 2010]\n\n                    Principles for Economic Revival\n\n (By George P. Shultz, Michael J. Boskin, John F. Cogan, Allan Meltzer \n                          and John B. Taylor)\n\n       America's financial crisis, deep recession and anemic \n     recovery have largely been driven by economic policies that \n     have deviated from proven fact-based principles. To return to \n     prosperity we must get back to these principles.\n       The most fundamental starting point is that people respond \n     to incentives and disincentives. Tax rates are a great \n     example because the data are so clear and the results so \n     powerful. A wealth of evidence shows that high tax rates \n     reduce work effort, retard investment and lower productivity \n     growth. Raise taxes, and living standards stagnate.\n       Nobel Prize-winning economist Edward Prescott examined \n     international labor market data and showed that changes in \n     tax rates on labor are associated with changes in employment \n     and hours worked. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the effective \n     tax rate on work increased by an average of 28% in Germany, \n     France and Italy. Over that same period, work hours fell by \n     an average of 22% in those three countries. When higher taxes \n     reduce the reward for work, you get less of it.\n       Long-lasting economic policies based on a long-term \n     strategy work; temporary policies don't. The difference \n     between the effect of permanent tax rate cuts and one-time \n     temporary tax rebates is also well-documented. The former \n     creates a sustainable increase in economic output, the latter \n     at best only a transitory blip. Temporary policies create \n     uncertainty that dampen economic output as market \n     participants, unsure about whether and how policies might \n     change, delay their decisions.\n       Having ``skin in the game,'' unsurprisingly, leads to \n     superior outcomes. As Milton Friedman famously observed: \n     ``Nobody spends somebody else's money as wisely as they spend \n     their own.'' When legislators put other people's money at \n     risk--as when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought risky \n     mortgages--crisis and economic hardship inevitably result. \n     When minimal co-payments and low deductibles are mandated in \n     the insurance market, wasteful health-care spending balloons.\n       Rule-based policies provide the foundation of a high-growth \n     market economy. Abiding by such policies minimizes capricious \n     discretionary actions, such as the recent ad hoc bailouts, \n     which too often had deleterious consequences. For most of the \n     1980s and '90s monetary policy was conducted in a predictable \n     rule-like manner. As a result, the economy was far more \n     stable. We avoided lengthy economic contractions like the \n     Great Depression of the 1930s and the rapid inflation of the \n     1970s.\n       The history of recent economic policy is one of massive \n     deviations from these basic tenets. The result has been a \n     crippling recession and now a weak, nearly nonexistent \n     recovery. The deviations began with policies--like the \n     Federal Reserve holding interest rates too low for too long--\n     that fueled the unsustainable housing boom. Federal housing \n     policies allowed down payments on home loans as low as zero. \n     Banks were encouraged to make risky loans, and securitization \n     separated lenders from their loans. Neither borrower nor \n     lender had sufficient skin in the game. Lax enforcement of \n     existing regulations allowed both investment and commercial \n     banks to circumvent long-established banking rules to take on \n     far too much leverage. Regulators, not regulations, failed.\n       The departures from sound principles continued when the Fed \n     and the Treasury responded with arbitrary and unpredictable \n     bailouts of banks, auto companies and financial institutions. \n     They financed their actions with unprecedented money creation \n     and massive issuance of debt. These frantic moves spooked \n     already turbulent markets and led to the financial panic.\n       More deviations occurred when the government responded with \n     ineffective temporary stimulus packages. The 2008 tax rebate \n     and the 2009 spending stimulus bills failed to improve the \n     economy. Cash for clunkers and the first-time home buyers tax \n     credit merely moved purchases forward by a few months.\n       Then there's the recent health-care legislation, which \n     imposes taxes on savings and investment and gives the \n     government control over health-care decisions. Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac now sit with an estimated $400 billion cost to \n     taxpayers and no path to resolution. Hundreds of new complex \n     regulations lurk in the 2010 financial reform bill with most \n     of the critical details left to regulators. So uncertainty \n     reigns and nearly $2 trillion in cash sits in corporate \n     coffers.\n       Since the onset of the financial crisis, annual federal \n     spending has increased by an extraordinary $800 billion--more \n     than $10,000 for every American family. This has driven the \n     budget deficit to 10% of GDP, far above the previous \n     peacetime record. The Obama administration has proposed to \n     lock a sizable portion of that additional spending into \n     government programs and to finance it with higher taxes and \n     debt. The Fed recently announced it would continue buying \n     long-term Treasury debt, adding to the risk of future \n     inflation.\n       There is perhaps no better indicator of the destructive \n     path that these policy deviations have put us on than the \n     federal budget. The nearby chart puts the fiscal problem in \n     perspective. It shows federal spending as a percent of GDP, \n     which is now at 24%, up sharply from 18.2% in 2000.\n       Future federal spending, driven mainly by retirement and \n     health-care promises, is likely to increase beyond 30% of GDP \n     in 20 years and then keep rising, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office. The reckless expansions of both \n     entitlements and discretionary programs in recent years have \n     only added to our long-term fiscal problem.\n       As the chart shows, in all of U.S. history, there has been \n     only one period of sustained decline in federal spending \n     relative to GDP. From 1983 to 2001, federal spending relative \n     to GDP declined by five percentage points. Two factors \n     dominated this remarkable period. First was strong economic \n     growth. Second was modest spending restraint--on domestic \n     spending in the 1980s and on defense in the 1990s.\n       The good news is that we can change these destructive \n     policies by adopting a strategy based on proven economic \n     principles:\n       First, take tax increases off the table. Higher tax rates \n     are destructive to growth and would ratify the recent \n     spending excesses. Our complex tax code is badly in need of \n     overhaul to make America more competitive. For example, the \n     U.S. corporate tax is one of the highest in the world. That's \n     why many tax reform proposals integrate personal and \n     corporate income taxes with fewer special tax breaks and \n     lower tax rates.\n       But in the current climate, with the very credit-worthiness \n     of the United States at stake, our program keeps the present \n     tax regime in place while avoiding the severe economic drag \n     of higher tax rates.\n       Second, balance the federal budget by reducing spending. \n     The publicly held debt must be brought down to the pre-crisis \n     safety zone. To do this, the excessive spending of recent \n     years must be removed before it becomes a permanent budget \n     fixture. The government should begin by rescinding unspent \n     ``stimulus'' and TARP funds, ratcheting down domestic \n     appropriations to their pre-binge levels, and repealing \n     entitlement expansions, most notably the subsidies in the \n     health-care bill.\n       The next step is restructuring public activities between \n     federal and state governments. The federal government has \n     taken on more responsibilities than it can properly manage \n     and efficiently finance. The 1996 welfare reform, which \n     transferred authority and financing for welfare from the \n     federal to the state level, should serve as the model. This \n     reform reduced welfare dependency and lowered costs, \n     benefiting taxpayers and welfare recipients.\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\n       Third, modify Social Security and health-care entitlements \n     to reduce their explosive future growth. Social Security now \n     promises much higher benefits to future retirees than to \n     today's retirees. The typical 30-year-old today is scheduled \n     to get an inflation-adjusted retirement benefit that is \n     50% higher than the benefit for a typical current retiree.\n       Benefits paid to future retirees should remain at the same \n     level, in terms of purchasing power, that today's retirees \n     receive. A combination of indexing initial benefits to prices \n     rather than to wages and increasing the program's retirement \n     age would achieve this goal. They should be phased-in \n     gradually so that current retirees and those nearing \n     retirement are not affected.\n       Health care is far too important to the American economy to \n     be left in its current state. In markets other than health \n     care, the legendary American shopper, armed with money and \n     information, has kept quality high and costs low. In health \n     care, service providers, unaided by consumers with sufficient \n     skin in the game, make the purchasing decisions. Third-party \n     payers--employers, governments and insurance companies--have \n     resorted to regulatory schemes and price controls to stem the \n     resulting cost growth.\n       The key to making Medicare affordable while maintaining the \n     quality of health care is more patient involvement, more \n     choices among Medicare health plans, and more competition. \n     Co-payments should be raised to make patients and their \n     physicians more cost-conscious. Monthly premiums should be \n     lowered to provide seniors with more disposable income to \n     make these choices. A menu of additional Medicare plans, some \n     with lower premiums, higher co-payments and improved \n     catastrophic coverage, should be added to the current one-\n     size-fits-all program to encourage competition.\n       Similarly for Medicaid, modest co-payments should be \n     introduced except for preventive services. The program should \n     be turned over entirely to the states with federal financing \n     supplied by a ``no strings attached'' block grant. States \n     should then allow Medicaid recipients to purchase a health \n     plan of their choosing with a risk-adjusted Medicaid grant \n     that phases out as income rises.\n       The 2010 health-care law undermined positive reforms \n     underway since the late 1990s, including higher co-payments \n     and health savings accounts. The law should be repealed \n     before its regulations and price controls further damage \n     availability and quality of care. It should be replaced with \n     policies that target specific health market concerns: \n     quality, affordability and access. Making out-of-pocket \n     expenditures and individual purchases of health insurance tax \n     deductible, enhancing health savings accounts, and improving \n     access to medical information are keys to more consumer \n     involvement. Allowing consumers to buy insurance across state \n     lines will lower the cost of insurance.\n       Fourth, enact a moratorium on all new regulations for the \n     next three years, with an exception for national security and \n     public safety. Going forward, regulations should be \n     transparent and simple, pass rigorous cost-benefit tests, and \n     rely to a maximum extent on market-based incentives instead \n     of command and control. Direct and indirect cost estimates of \n     regulations and subsidies should be published before new \n     regulations are put into law.\n       Off-budget financing should end by closing Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac. The Bureau of Consumer Finance Protection and \n     all other government agencies should be on the budget that \n     Congress annually approves. An enhanced bankruptcy process \n     for failing financial firms should be enacted in order to end \n     the need for bailouts. Higher bank capital requirements that \n     rise with the size of the bank should be phased in.\n       Fifth, monetary policy should be less discretionary and \n     more rule-like. The Federal Reserve should announce and \n     follow a monetary policy rule, such as the Taylor rule, in \n     which the short-term interest rate is determined by the \n     supply and demand for money and is adjusted through changes \n     in the money supply when inflation rises above or falls below \n     the target, or when the economy goes into a recession. When \n     monetary policy decisions follow such a rule, economic \n     stability and growth increase.\n       In order to reduce the size of the Fed's bloated balance \n     sheet without causing more market disruption, the Fed should \n     announce and follow a clear and predictable exit rule, which \n     describes a contingency path for bringing bank reserves back \n     to normal levels. It should also announce and follow a \n     lender-of-last-resort rule designed to protect the payment \n     system and the economy--not failing banks. Such a rule would \n     end the erratic bailout policy that leads to crises.\n       The United States should, along with other countries, agree \n     to a target for inflation in order to increase expected price \n     stability and exchange rate stability. A new accord between \n     the Federal Reserve and Treasury should reestablish the Fed's \n     independence and accountability so that it is not called on \n     to monetize the debt or engage in credit allocation. A \n     monetary rule is a requisite for restoring the Fed's \n     independence.\n       These pro-growth policies provide the surest path back to \n     prosperity.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask a pretty \nstraightforward question: Why on Earth is this administration standing \nby and watching our global competitors gain the upper hand over U.S. \nbusinesses?\n  Last week, the European Union announced that it is taking steps to \napprove an agreement with South Korea. I have to tip my hat to the \nEuropeans. South Korea represents the 12th largest economy, and \nEurope's businesses are now one step closer to much greater access to \nthe 12th largest economy in the world. Meanwhile, the United States \nfails to act on a trade agreement negotiated with South Korea more than \n3 years ago, ready for action, actually. Zero action, though, has been \ntaken since this agreement has been finalized by this administration. \nWe all know it is up to the President to send the agreement to Congress \nfor approval before it can go into effect. But that has not happened. \nOn the other hand, other nations are taking advantage of opportunities \nto save their businesses billions of dollars, while the United States \nis simply stuck in neutral.\n  Under our agreement with Korea, most fees our exporters pay--\ntariffs--to Korea would be completely eliminated, saving U.S. \nbusinesses literally billions of dollars. In fact, nearly 95 percent of \nour exports of consumer and industrial products would become duty free \nwithin 3 years and the rest would be eliminated over time. Nearly two-\nthirds of our agricultural exports would also become duty free under \nthis agreement, and perhaps most significant is the estimate by the \nU.S. International Trade Commission itself that our agreement with \nSouth Korea would add $10 to $12 billion to our economy.\n  So what does this mean in real dollars for real businesses? Well, the \nagreement would increase U.S. exports by about $10 billion annually. \nThe way I look at it, our economy could use a $10 billion boost. \nInstead, our agreement with South Korea languishes, and we sit on the \nsidelines while other countries clearly are gaining the upper hand and \nwe are losing this marketplace.\n  If we could ever enact this agreement, American job creators could \nfairly compete in the South Korean market. Instead, they are at a \ndistinct disadvantage, and the key to a level playing field--this trade \nagreement--is collecting dust on a shelf at the White House.\n  The time for the United States to act on our agreement with Korea is \nnot only now, it should have been months ago. Our failure to act is \ninhibiting job creation, inspiring our competitors, who are winning, \nand frustrating our trading partners. Last week was just the latest \nevidence that our trading partners have lost patience with us and \ndecided to find new dance partners. You see, our trading partners look \nat this and say: There is no leadership.\n  In June, I came to the Senate floor to express my concern over \nreports that an official from the South Korean Embassy said the \nfollowing:\n\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\n\n       The U.S. runs the risk of losing the Korean market within a \n     decade if we cannot get a free trade agreement ratified.\n\n  Let me repeat what he said: Within a decade, we lose this market.\n  Those reports also warned that South Korea was likely to complete a \nfree-trade agreement with the European Union by January of next year. \nWell, here we are 3 months later, and that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  Most recently, upon announcing the new agreement just last week, \nSouth Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade released a \nstatement saying that their deal with the EU ``will bring about \neconomic benefits more than a free trade pact signed with the United \nStates.'' You see, they signed this agreement 3 months ahead of \nschedule, and our trading partners look at all of the dithering, and \nthey are ready to move forward without us.\n  We should enact our pending trade agreement with South Korea as well \nas the pending trade agreements with Colombia and Panama as quickly as \npossible. Increasing our market share in countries around the world \nwill provide greater opportunities for our businesses, allowing them to \nexpand their operations and to hire more people right here at home. You \ncan translate foreign trade to real jobs for real people in this \ncountry who are looking for work. This would help get our economy \nmoving again. But for that to happen, the Obama administration must \nsend Congress the pending agreements for an up-or-down vote. That is \nthe next step. That has been the next step for months and months. The \nPresident must simply send the agreements for approval.\n\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to the pending trade agreements, what we \nhave seen from this administration has been a lot of talk but no \naction. If you listen to the President's own words, you would think the \nadministration just can't wait to submit the agreements to Congress. \nJust last week, President Obama said he would like to see congressional \napproval of the Korean agreement as soon as possible. That is not the \nfirst time he has made those statements. Going all the way back to the \nState of the Union Address in January, President Obama said the \nfollowing:\n\n       We have to seek new markets aggressively just as our \n     competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other \n     nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create \n     jobs on our shores.\n\n  The President was right about that when he said that so many months \nago. In fact, it bears repeating. In the President's own words:\n\n       If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign \n     trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our \n     shores.\n\n  So the President of the United States is on record saying that the \npending trade agreements would create jobs. They would. But these words \nring hollow when you do not follow up with action.\n  As the U.S. unemployment rate has hovered around 10 percent for most \nof this year, my question is and I think the question of this nation \nis, What are we waiting for? Why are we waiting? There is no silver \nbullet here, but our pending trade agreements would be enormously \nhelpful. They would be the absolute right step in the right direction. \nYou see, when roughly 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside \nthe United States, the global marketplace represents unrivaled \nopportunities. But, unfortunately, while the Senate has spent most of \nthis year on a massive spending spree, three measures that even the \nPresident admits will create jobs are withering on the vine. Our \nbusinesses and job creators watch as their global competitors simply \nrun by them. They are sitting on the sidelines faced with uncertainty \nand high tariffs that bar their entry in any reasonable way to the \nforeign marketplace, uncertainty about new regulations, uncertainty \nabout our economic recovery, uncertainty about this administration's \ncommitment to these trade agreements.\n  The lack of any kind of coherent position from the White House is a \nserious part of the problem. Yes, I have heard the speeches. The \nPresident says he wants action. He started saying it a long time ago. \nYet he takes no action. I would like to know where this administration \nstands. The agreements are signed and ready. The ball is in the \nadministration's court. If the President has no intention of sending \nthese agreements to us, say so. Let the American public know this.\n  Taking action could not be easier: simply drop the agreements in the \nmail to Congress or have somebody walk them over here. The rest of the \nworld is not wasting any time taking advantage of the opportunities and \nbenefits provided by expanded trade. You see, they need jobs too. And \nthey see the world's population and say: Why would we not want to sell \nour products to those people? Meanwhile, the United States is depriving \nour businesses of new markets, our people of jobs and new \nopportunities. And it delays economic recovery while, unfortunately, \nour competitors gain the upper hand.\n  If the President is serious about enacting trade deals to create new \njobs, I am ready to work with him. I have said that over and over. I \nwill come to the floor and speak on behalf of these agreements, and I \nknow many of my colleagues are ready to do the same.\n  I urge the President to send the trade agreements to Congress once \nagain for a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7191-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7191-S7193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the upcoming vote \ntomorrow at 2:15 on the Defense authorization bill. I don't know the \nstate of play, but it looks as though we will bring to the floor a \nDefense authorization bill without any ability to amend the bill beyond \na very limited set of amendments. If one is watching the political \ndiscourse at the moment, they would not realize we are at war in two \ndifferent theaters and that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon, and that \nmaybe a year from now they will have one. We are talking about domestic \npolitics and spending. That is good. But what is equally important is \nnational security.\n  The Defense authorization bill is coming to the Senate floor \ntomorrow, and we have a don't ask, don't tell policy change within the \nbill that basically says we are going to change the law that would get \nrid of don't ask, don't tell; a policy that has worked very well, that \nwe would receive input from the military, and we are going to change \nthe law before we ask our men and women in uniform about their opinion. \nThat is a huge mistake. We were told last year there would be a study \namong all the services about the effect of don't ask, don't tell on \nrecruiting and retention and how it would affect the Armed Forces.\n  Before we can get the study done, I think the Congress is going to \nrepeal the law because our Democratic friends believe in the fall there \nwill be more Republicans. So they are going to try to do it now. We \nshould not repeal don't ask, don't tell until we get input from our men \nand women who are serving. That is one thing that is driving this bill.\n  The DREAM Act is a piece of legislation that would give legal status \nto young children who were brought into the country illegally, brought \nhere as children as illegal immigrants. They have lived most of their \nlives here. It would allow them to go to school under State tuition. It \nwould give them legal status. That is an issue that needs to be talked \nabout in terms of comprehensive immigration reform, not the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  If someone were listening to the debate on the Defense authorization \nbill, they would believe the biggest national security threats we face \nare abortions in military hospitals, the DREAM Act, which has to do \nwith citizenship for young illegal immigrants, and don't ask, don't \ntell. We are not talking about what happens if Iran gets a nuclear \nweapon, how we win in Afghanistan, or what we need to do to get Iraq \nright. We are on the 10 yard line, but we are not there yet.\n  I have an amendment I would like to offer to the body that would get \n99\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nvotes. It says stop reading terrorists their Miranda rights. This is \nnot crime we are fighting. We are fighting a war. I don't believe in \ntorture; I believe in living within our values. But there is a \ndifference between a law enforcement activity and fighting a war.\n  When we capture a terrorist who just tried to blow up an airplane \nover Detroit, the last thing we need to do is read them their Miranda \nrights. We should take them off the airplane, turn them over to the \nmilitary, the CIA, and let them be questioned about future attacks \nwithin our values--not torture but firmly and effectively asked about \nintelligence.\n  The moment we read somebody their Miranda rights, we go into the area \nof law enforcement. We are fighting a war, not a crime. I have a bill \nthat would change our habeas review process where an enemy prisoner is \nallowed to go to Federal court under Supreme Court holdings, and when \nthey go to court, the habeas review doesn't have any uniform standards. \nIn one case they let the guy go because the government couldn't prove \nhe was a member of al-Qaida on the day he was captured. But they could \nprove without a doubt that he had trained with al-Qaida, swore an oath \nto al-Qaida right after 9/11. The burden should be on the enemy \ncombatant to prove they are not a member of al-Qaida once we have \nestablished they were at some point in time.\n  The whole habeas review system needs to be looked at. Our judges are \ncrying out for some congressional involvement to give them uniform \nstandards.\n  We have 48 people in prison at Guantanamo Bay held for years without \ntrial. Under the law of war, we can hold an enemy prisoner indefinitely \nwithout trial because it is part of a war. Under domestic criminal law, \nwe have to charge somebody with a crime or let them go. That is a \ndilemma we should not face. If someone is being held as an enemy \ncombatant, there ought to be a legal process to make that determination \nwith an annual review. I would like to create that legal process. I \nwould like to create some rational legal system that recognizes we are \nat war, not fighting a crime. But the only thing I can talk about is \ndon't ask, don't tell and the DREAM Act. This is ridiculous.\n  We have men and women in harm's way. This Nation is under siege. We \nhave not adjusted our laws since 9/11 to be at war within our values. \nThe extremes can't be the norm. The choice between waterboarding and \nthe Army Field Manual in terms of interrogation should not be the two \nchoices. The CIA today is out of the interrogation business. The \nExecutive order issued by President Obama denies the CIA the ability to \nuse enhanced interrogation techniques that this body passed under the \nDetainee Treatment Act, so the CIA is basically an organization without \nany ability to question someone. If we capture terrorists tomorrow, \nwhere will we put them? Guantanamo Bay hadn't been used in years. We \nare a nation without a jail. These are big issues that need to be \naddressed in a comprehensive fashion.\n  The Defense authorization bill is the natural venue. But under the \nprocess before the Senate, it is being shut down, and the Defense \nauthorization bill is no longer a vehicle to deal with defense matters. \nIt is now a political checklist before the November elections. The \nHispanic community, check; they got a vote on the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it the understanding of the Senator from South \nCarolina that we would be taking up the DREAM Act which, if going \nthrough the regular process, would go to the Judiciary Committee, and \nthe don't ask, don't tell issue and perhaps something about secret \nholds, and then go off of the bill until after the elections in a very \nconstrictive timeframe of a lameduck session?\n  What is the Senator's view about what the priorities of the \nleadership are? Is it political? Why else would we take up only certain \namendments and then move off a bill that would then resume possibly for \nsome truncated period after the election? What is that all about?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Sherlock Holmes said what is left on the table, when you \nrule everything out, is the answer. It makes no sense to me for us to \nbring the Defense authorization bill to the floor of the Senate at any \ntime where the Senator from Arizona and I cannot offer an amendment \nabout how we try a terrorist. Should Khalid Sheikh Mohammed be given a \nFederal court right? Should he be put in New York City or any other \nFederal court and tried as a normal criminal, or should he be tried in \na military court as an enemy combatant?\n  These are big issues. Under the construct created--and the reason I \nwill vote no when I would normally vote yes--I cannot offer amendments. \nWe are going to be voting on the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is a hot \ntopic in the immigration world but not very hot among our troops.\n  I have been to Afghanistan and Iraq numerous times. I haven't had one \nsoldier or airman or sailor or marine or Coast Guard member ask me \nabout the DREAM Act. They want to know are they going to get paid more \nand do they have the tools to win the war. This is politics at its \nworst, may I say.\n  As a Republican, I stand here knowing our party has probably abused \npower in the past but not like this. This, to me, is going to a new \nlevel. We are in two wars. Iran is on the verge of making a \nbreakthrough on the nuclear weapons front. We have a Defense bill where \nwe can't amend it to talk about the war on terror or about legal \nchanges--stop reading terrorists their Miranda rights. We will be \nvoting on the DREAM Act which is checking a block. We will be voting on \ndon't ask, don't tell in a way in which I think is offensive to the men \nand women who serve.\n\n  The Senator was promised last year, as the ranking member, when he \nasked the question, that our men and women would give us input before \nthe administration would move to change don't ask, don't tell. That has \nall been turned upside down. The law is now that it will be repealed \nand we ask later.\n  This idea about secret holds in the Senate, that is probably an \ninternal matter that needs to be resolved but not on Defense \nauthorization. The answer is, this is politics.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If we do address the issue on the Defense authorization \nbill or if we were addressing the issue, would it be more appropriate \nto assess the impact on battle effectiveness and morale on the men and \nwomen serving and then arrive at a decision as to whether that \nlegislation or any other legislation, although this is very important \nlegislation, should be repealed? Instead, isn't it true the construct \nof the way it went through the Armed Services Committee is that the \nthree individuals who support repeal--the President, who made a \npolitical promise; the Secretary of Defense, whom we admire; and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--will make a determination as to \nwhether the study has been completed sufficiently to ensure the repeal \nof don't ask, don't tell without difficulty as opposed to taking a \nsurvey, finding out about the impact on morale and battle readiness and \nthen make a determination?\n  Also, according to this process set up in the Armed Services \nCommittee, the four service chiefs--Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air \nForce--are left out of the decisionmaking. Why? Because they have \ncalled for exactly what I was just describing, which is a study to \nassess the impact on morale and effectiveness prior to repeal. In other \nwords, in this instance, the fix is in.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator makes a good point. He has been ranking \nmember. Obviously, his military record is well known. He was promised--\nI took it as a promise--last year that we would not change don't ask, \ndon't tell until we got input from those who serve our country in \nuniform. That process is ongoing. But now the law we are expected to \nvote on tomorrow changes don't ask, don't tell. It completely reverses \nthat policy but allows us to get input later. That is quite offensive. \nWe know there isn't going to be a snowball's chance in hell they are \nactually going to listen to what the men and women say because the \nwhole goal is to get that vote for a specific constituency.\n  Special interest groups are dominating this bill unlike any time \nbefore. We have changed the law about abortions in military hospitals, \nwe have the DREAM Act which has zero to do with\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nnational defense, and now we have a major change in don't ask, don't \ntell in a way that is contrary.\n  I spoke to the incoming Commandant of the Marine Corps who will be up \nfor a vote soon. He said he was very concerned about making this change \nnow. We are in two wars. There is a lot going on in the world. This is \na major social change. He thinks it would be smart to listen to the \nmarines and other servicemembers before we make the change. If the bill \nbecomes law, we will not have done that. That is a huge mistake.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership to make sure the \nmen and women in uniform are heard from before Congress acts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One more question: The issue is the proposal to include \nthe so-called DREAM Act. I think every Member of Congress, every \nAmerican citizen has some sympathy for individuals who were brought to \nthis country without making the decision to do so, not forgetting that \nthe people who brought them to this country were breaking our laws when \nthey did so. Isn't it also true that if we address the DREAM Act or \nother parts of comprehensive immigration reform before securing the \nborders, then 1, 2, 5, 10 years from now we will be faced with another \ngeneration of young people who were brought here against their will who \nhave a compelling story to tell?\n  In other words, isn't the moral of this story--to harken back to the \n1980s--under our beloved Ronald Reagan we gave amnesty to a couple \nmillion people, and they said they would secure the borders, and we \nended up with 12 million people who were here illegally? So isn't that \nthe situation we all want to remedy, but we want to make sure we do not \nhave to remedy it again?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the Senator, his point is well taken. If the \nDREAM Act is not considered part of comprehensive immigration reform, \nit will be a huge mistake. The reason we have 12 million people here \nillegally in our country is because you can get to America pretty \neasily illegally, obviously. You can walk across the street in some \nplaces. So you have to control the border.\n  Visa overstays are 40 percent of the illegal immigration problem. If \nyou do not do that, then you are never going to stop the third wave of \nillegal immigration. You have to deal with why they come: to get jobs. \nWe need better employer verification. We need a temporary worker \nprogram so employers can hire people in a win-win situation, where \npeople from other countries can come here and work, make some money, \nand go back home. It helps us; it helps them. That is what you need to \ndo with immigration, comprehensive reform.\n  The DREAM Act is about November politics. It is an emotional topic \nthat if you did it in isolation would be undercutting comprehensive \nreform. Certainly it has nothing to do with defense authorization. It \nis trying to check a block.\n  For the people who came to my office last week who were literally \npraying that I would vote for the DREAM Act in the Defense \nauthorization bill, you are certainly being used and abused, in my \nview. This is an emotional topic, and at the end of the day, all I can \ntell you is, this is not a way to change immigration. This is not \ncomprehensive immigration reform. This is not good defense policy. This \nis just sheer, raw politics at a time when we could do better and \nshould do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7193-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3454, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 3454) to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2011 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have enacted a National Defense \nAuthorization Act every year for the last 48 years, and we need to do \nthe same this year. I hope we can at least make some progress during \nthe next few days and weeks on this bill.\n  This year's bill would continue the increases in compensation and \nquality of life that our service men and women and their families \ndeserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing military \noperations around the world.\n  For example, the bill would extend over 30 types of bonuses and \nspecial pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, reenlistment, and \ncontinued service by Active-Duty and Reserve military personnel.\n  The bill would authorize continued TRICARE coverage for eligible \ndependents of servicemembers up to age 26.\n  The bill would improve care for our wounded warriors by addressing \ninequities in rules for involuntary administrative separations based on \nmedical conditions and requiring new education and training programs on \nthe use of pharmaceuticals for patients in wounded warrior units.\n  The bill would authorize and allow the waiver of maximum age \nlimitations to enable certain highly qualified enlisted members who \nserved in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom to \nenter the military service academies.\n  The bill also includes important funding and authorities needed to \nprovide our troops the equipment and support they will continue to need \nas long as they remain on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For example, the bill would enhance the military's ability to rapidly \nacquire and field new capabilities in response to urgent needs on the \nbattlefield by expanding the authority of the Department of Defense to \nwaive statutory requirements when urgently needed to save lives on the \nbattlefield.\n  The bill would fully fund the President's request to train and equip \nthe Afghan National Army and Afghan Police--growing the capabilities of \nthese security forces to prepare them to take over increased \nresponsibility for Afghanistan's security.\n  The bill would extend for another year the authority for the \nSecretary of Defense to transfer equipment coming out of Iraq as our \ntroops withdraw to the security forces of Iraq and Afghanistan, \nproviding through that transfer an important tool for our commanders \nlooking to accelerate the growth of these security forces.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions that will help improve the \nmanagement of the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies.\n  For example, the bill would require the Department of Defense to \nestablish a comprehensive process for evaluating and addressing urgent \noperational needs identified on the battlefield.\n  The bill would address shortcomings in the management of private \nsecurity contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan by making contractors \nexpressly responsible for the conduct of their subcontractors and \nestablishing specific contractual remedies for failures to comply with \nthe requirements and directives.\n  The bill would require the Department of Defense to establish \nacquisition baselines for the Missile Defense Agency's programs and \nprovide annual reports to Congress on progress toward achieving those \nbaselines.\n  The bill also includes important legislative provisions that would \npromote DOD's cybersecurity and energy security efforts--two important \ninitiatives that would help strengthen our national defense and our \nNation.\n  This bill does include a handful of contentious provisions on which \nthere is disagreement in the Senate. These provisions were debated in \ncommittee. I expect them to be debated again on the Senate floor, if we \ncan proceed tomorrow, as I hope we can. We are going to have votes on a \nnumber of those issues and other contentious issues, and the Senate \nwill work its will if we are allowed to get to the point where we can \ndebate this bill.\n  One of the issues which has been raised is whether amendments should \nbe offered or are offerable to this bill, such as the DREAM Act, which \nare not\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\nrelevant to the bill. The Senator from Arizona recently said the \nfollowing, and he has repeated it:\n\n       [F]or many, many years, we never put any extraneous items \n     on the [DOD authorization] bill, because it was so important \n     to defense and we just didn't allow it.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Starting last year, Carl Levin and Harry Reid put hate \n     crimes on it.\n\n  The Senator from Arizona is incorrect. He is incorrect on a number of \naccounts. First of all, the Senate previously considered hate crimes \namendments to the national defense authorization bill. We did it in \n2001. We did it in 2005. We did it again in 2008 on the national \ndefense authorization bill. It was not the first time that hate crimes \nwas added to the defense authorization bill, and each time the hate \ncrimes amendment was approved by overwhelming bipartisan votes: 57 to \n42, 65 to 33, and 60 to 39. It received anywhere from 8 to 18 \nRepublican votes. The only thing that was new about last year's action \nrelative to hate crimes was that for the first time the provision was \nnot dropped in conference. It was included in the enacted legislation.\n\n  Secondly, the Senator from Arizona is incorrect when he says ``we \nnever put any extraneous items on the [defense authorization] bill . . \n. we just didn't allow it'' is incorrect for another reason. During our \nconsideration of Defense Authorization Acts over the last dozen years, \nand before, the Senate has debated other amendments, nonrelevant \namendments, on many issues, including on concealed weapons, indecency \nstandards, the extension of pay-go budget procedures, and secret holds \non nominations, among other issues.\n  As a matter of fact, in the year 2000, the Senator from Arizona \noffered a nonrelevant amendment to the defense authorization bill. His \namendment proposed to require campaign finance disclosure by the so-\ncalled 527 organizations as an amendment to national defense \nauthorization. Senator Warner opposed it, as floor manager of the bill. \nSenator Warner, as chairman and floor manager, argued it was not \nrelevant to the bill. Indeed, Senator Warner argued it could endanger \nthe passage of the bill and urged Senator McCain not to offer that \nnonrelevant amendment. Senator McCain's response:\n\n       I yield to no one in this body as to my advocacy for our \n     Nation's defense and the men and women in the military.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       But if we want to give these men and women in the military \n     confidence in their Government, we should have fully \n     disclosed who it is that contributes to the political \n     campaigns.\n\n  When Senator Warner was asked if he was upset with Senator McCain for \ntying up the Senate with nonrelevant amendments on the defense \nauthorization bill, Senator Warner stated:\n\n       I don't get upset at anything. The man--\n\n  The Senator he is referring to, Senator McCain--\n\n     is acting under the rules.\n\n  I supported the McCain amendment at that time, and I also supported \nthe right of the Senator from Arizona to offer it, not because it was \nrelevant to the defense authorization bill--it was not--but because it \nwas the only opportunity, apparently, to consider that bill, and it was \nthe right thing to do, in my judgment.\n  By a vote of 57 to 42, the Senate agreed, and the nonrelevant McCain \namendment was adopted to the defense authorization bill. By the way, by \ncomparison, last year's hate crimes amendment was adopted by a vote of \n63 to 28.\n  Particular concern has also been expressed about the committee's \ndecision to cut $1 billion of the $2 billion that the President \nrequested for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. This decision of the \ncommittee was consistent with the previously expressed view of the \nArmed Services Committee and of the Congress that the Government of \nIraq should assume a greater responsibility for the financial burden of \nbuilding Iraqi security forces as U.S. forces draw down.\n  The Iraqis are in a better position to pay for their defense than we \nare. Last year, we provided only $1 billion. We should not be \nincreasing that amount as Iraqi resources and finances get stronger and \ntheir oil revenues get higher.\n  The American taxpayers have already paid over $18 billion to build \nthe capacity of the Iraqi Army and police. By contrast, the Government \nof Iraq has failed to adequately invest in its own security forces. \nAccording to a recent DOD report, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense \nrequested $7.4 billion in 2010, but the Ministry of Finance approved \nonly $4.9 billion, choosing to fund little more than personnel costs \nand to rely almost entirely on the United States to pay for even the \nmost basic equipment needed by the Iraqi Army. Iraq, which according to \nGAO analysis, has a cumulative budget surplus of $52 billion through \nthe end of fiscal year 2009 and as much as $5 billion in unspent \nsecurity funds, should be well positioned to pay for its own military \nequipment instead of coming to us for large handouts.\n\n  The argument has been made that the money the committee cut from the \nIraqi Security Forces Fund was used to pay for porkbarrel projects. \nHowever, the definition of ``porkbarrel projects'' used for this \npurpose appears to be anything other than what the administration \nrequests. I question why spending money on Iraqi troops should be \nconsidered good government, but if we spend the same amount of money on \nour own military instead, it is considered wasteful porkbarrel \nspending. We could have no higher priority as a committee or as a \nCongress than supporting our own defense, and I am proud of the fact \nthat our bill would increase the money available for this purpose by \ncutting back on subsidies for the Iraqis.\n  Here is the process we use in our committee. This is how we \naccomplish where we are today. Every year, our committee staff works \nhard to identify excess or unneeded spending in the Defense budget \nrequest. For example, we identify unsuccessful programs where we appear \nto be sending good money after bad, programs that are getting money \nbefore they need it or are getting more money than they can reasonably \nspend in a year; programs that cannot spend all the money they have \nbecause of schedule delays, and programs that are scheduled to receive \nfunding increases, even though the requirement is declining. We would \nnot be doing our job for the Congress and the American people if we \nfail to undertake a thorough review and to cut excess or unneeded \nspending from the budget. When we find unneeded spending, we are then \nable to shift it to support added force structure or force \nmodernization and the quality of life for our troops. This is much the \nsame process that the Secretary of Defense goes through to identify \nexcess overhead, duplicative programs and other wasteful spending and \nshift the funds to higher priority defense needs.\n  This year, we reviewed the Department's $725 billion budget proposal \nand identified several billion dollars of unneeded spending--just over \none-half of 1 percent of the total budget. What did we spend the money \non? Mainly modernizing weapons systems, supporting readiness, and \nsupporting the troops. More specifically, this is what the committee \nproposes to spend the money on that was cut as unneeded from other \nprograms.\n  This is a relatively long list, but I do wish to give a fairly \nextensive list of what the additional spending was by the Armed \nServices Committee when we found that some of the spending in the \nbudget was unneeded for the reasons I just gave.\n  Here is a list: $532 million to fully fund high-priority requirements \nidentified by the Chief of Naval Operations for ship depot maintenance, \naircraft depot maintenance, and spare parts; $363 million to improve \nmissile defense capabilities against existing regional missile threats \nand provide better protection against such missiles for our deployed \nforces and our allies; $337 million to fully fund high priority weapons \nsustainment and depot maintenance requirements identified by the Air \nForce Chief of Staff; $325 million to procure additional F-18 aircraft \nto address a looming shortfall of strike fighter aircraft and take \nadvantage of better prices we will get through a multiyear contract; \n$310 million for new facilities, all of which meet the McCain-Glenn \nscreening requirements for military construction and have been \ndetermined by the military to be mission essential, to support \noperations and training, and ensure that our troops are ready for \ndeployment; $244 million to augment the capability of our \ncommunications satellites, continue the\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\ndevelopment of infrared sensors for next-generation satellites, and \nprovide for improved space protection and space situational awareness; \n$213 million for advanced technologies, for advanced weapons systems, \nincluding basic and applied research and materials, science for lighter \nand stronger materials, new sensors, lasers, and information \ntechnology; $184 million for unfunded procurement priorities identified \nby the Army Chief of Staff to meet force protection, mobility, \ncommunication, and other needs for deployed forces in Afghanistan, \nincluding the Line of Communication Bridge, the Lightweight Counter-\nMortar Radar, the Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver, \nthe Tactical Local Area Network, and the Forward Entry Device for the \nartillery tactical data system; $170 million for the Department's \nEnergy Conservation Improvement Program to competitively fund \nmeritorious programs that have a savings-to-investment ratio of 1.25 or \nhigher and a simple payback period of 10 years or less; $113 million \nfor unfunded requirements identified by the Commander of U.S. Special \nOperations Command for ground mobility vehicles, deployable \ncommunications equipment, thermal and night vision goggles, and \nnonlethal weapons technologies; $102 million to continue the JSTARS \nreengining program to ensure that these aircraft have the onstation \ncapability needed to provide real-time intelligence to our ground \nforces engaged in combat; $100 million to enhance the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons by providing funding needed for \nfacility design, maintenance, and upgrades, provide diagnostic \nequipment, and address operational safety issues; $100 million for new \nquality-of-life facilities such as dormitories, emergency service \ncenters, and health clinics, all of which have been determined by the \nmilitary to be mission essential; $88 million for research and \ndevelopment to reduce the Department's dependency on fossil fuels \nthrough improved energy storage, power systems, renewable energy \nproduction, and energy efficiency in Defense programs; $78 million for \nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities and programs \nthat are delivering critical capabilities for our troops in \nAfghanistan; $78 million to meet antiterrorism and force protection \nrequirements at military bases; $76 million to improve the combat \ncapability of Navy submarines; $72 million for improved medical care \nfor our troops and their families, including $22 million for continuity \nof medical care and to prevent increases in fees and $50 million for \ncritical medical research on trauma care, blast injuries, visual \nimpairment, and other battlefield-related injuries; $71 million to \nimprove the Navy's ability to operate with unmanned systems, improve \ncountermeasures and improve the ability of DOD air and sea systems to \nhandle threats from enemy missiles and shoulder-fired weapons and make \noperational system improvements on Navy ships; $70 million to modernize \nNavy facilities and improve their capability to support current \noperations and new technology developments; $59 million for upgrades \nfor Army weapons systems to enhance operational capabilities and \nmodernize the force; $58 million for cyber-security technology \ndevelopment and demonstrations to enhance protections available for \ncritical DOD infrastructure and information; $57 million for advanced \nmanufacturing technologies to reduce the time required to produce high-\ndemand items such as body and vehicle armor, IED jammers and MRAP \nvehicles and to modernize the Department of Defense test capabilities \nfacilities to ensure that new weapons systems meet warfighter \nrequirements; $56 million for communications facilities and special \noperations facilities, all of which have been determined by the \nmilitary to be mission essential; $46 million for nonproliferation \nprograms, including the screening of cargo containers coming into the \nUnited States, plutonium disposition, and related research and \ndevelopment; $45 million for Impact Aid to ensure a quality education \nfor military dependents by compensating local school districts that \nlose property tax revenue due to the presence of tax-exempt military \ninstallations; $35 million for the National Guard to assist State and \nlocal law enforcement with counternarcotics operations; $34 million for \nthe Department of Defense inspector general to continue growth designed \nto provide more effective oversight and help identify waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Department of Defense programs; $30 million to reduce \ntechnical risk and increase program performance in the Army's Paladin \nself-propelled howitzer integrated management program; $26 million \nfor simulators and trainers for the Army to reduce training costs and \nincrease the preparedness of our troops for the battlefield in Iraq and \nAfghanistan; and $25 million to fund a competitive program to protect \ncritical mission training sites by preventing or reducing encroachment \nthrough the creation of compatible-use buffer zones.\n\n  These are real military needs. These are not ``bridges to nowhere''--\nquite the opposite. This year, we took $75 million that the Department \nof Defense planned to spend on military museums and spent it instead on \nmore immediate military needs consistent with our committee policy that \nmilitary museums should be funded through private donations rather than \ntaxpayer funds.\n  I am not going to tell the Presiding Officer or anybody else that \nevery judgment the committee made was correct. There is no way I could \nagree to that. In fact, some of the decisions we made I didn't agree \nwith, but I can say the money that was added was added for what we saw \nas needed measures to modernize our forces and provide for our troops. \nOthers may disagree. Some may honestly believe that any spending not \nincluded in the administration budget, no matter how important it may \nbe to the military, is wasteful. However, we will not be able to have \nthat debate and vote on any amendments to the funding proposed by the \ncommittee unless we vote tomorrow to proceed to consideration of this \nbill.\n  We currently have 50,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \non the ground in Iraq and roughly twice as many in Afghanistan. While \nthere are some issues on which we may disagree, I think we all know we \nmust provide our troops the support they need as long as they remain in \nharm's way. Senate action on the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2011 will improve the quality of life of our men and women \nin uniform. It will give them the tools they need to remain the most \neffective fighting force in the world. Most important of all, it will \nsend an important message that we as a nation stand behind them and \nappreciate their service.\n  I hope our colleagues will allow us to proceed to consideration of \nthis bill. There obviously will be many amendments offered, some to \nchange or strike the language which is in the bill. That is \nunderstandable. There will be some amendments aimed at adding \nprovisions to the bill, and that is not unusual either. As I said, both \nrelevant and nonrelevant amendments have been debated to this bill in \nthe past. It is not unusual. It complicates, obviously, the life of the \nmanager, but that is what we are here for, to consider amendments--both \nrelevant and nonrelevant amendments--to the bill and to try to get a \nDefense bill passed.\n  I hope we can make progress on this bill this week. As somebody who \nmay be overly optimistic, I would love to see this bill passed prior to \nour next recess. But our goal should be to make progress on this bill, \nand in order to do that, we will need to adopt cloture tomorrow. I hope \nthe Senate does that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief because I know there will \nbe a lot more debate tomorrow.\n  The distinguished chairman just mentioned a number of authorized \nprograms that sound pretty good. They were put in without debate, \ndiscussion or amendments. He also left out several that might be of \ninterest to taxpayers, which may be the reason why we see such anger \nabout the kind of spending--out-of-control spending and unnecessary \nspending.\n  Here is $1 million for foreign language correlation and translation; \n$3 million for plant-based vaccine development; $4.5 million for \ndecision and energy reduction tool. The list goes on and on. Here is $5 \nmillion for operator driving simulator; $1 million for Permafrost \nTunnel; $2.5 million for body temperature conditioner.\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n  All of these, in the eyes of the chairman, are more important than \ntaking care of our allies and cementing success in our operations in \nIraq, which was a result of the surge which the chairman, of course, \nadamantly opposed.\n  Here is $7.6 million for a Quiet Propulsion Load House; $3 million \nfor tribology research. The list goes on and on: $8 million for a \nphysical fitness center.\n  By the way, none of these were requested by the Department of \nDefense.\n  So we will be going into this some more tomorrow, and we will request \nan earmark for where they went--one of the key elements of it. None of \nit is completed. All of those earmarks are designated for certain \nplaces and certain manufacturers. It is something the people of this \ncountry, again, steadfastly are in opposition to.\n\n  I was interested to hear the chairman talk about amendments being \nallowed and that there will be debate and discussion. That is not the \nmessage we got through the media, which the majority leader didn't \nshare with us. My understanding is that we are going to take up three \nissues. He is going to fill up the tree, which means no other \namendments will be allowed. The issues will be the secret holds, the \nDREAM Act, and, of course, don't ask, don't tell. I hope the chairman \nis accurate here because there are many issues that many Americans \nwould feel are very important: treatment of terrorists, Guantanamo Bay, \nand so many other issues that affect the readiness of the men and women \nand their training and ability, as opposed to the DREAM Act and a \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell.\n  Let me point out again that this issue is not on don't ask, don't \ntell, not an assessment of the effect on the readiness and morale of \nthe men and women in the military. This language is a repeal, then \nsigned onto by the President of the United States, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One wonders, \nwhat about the Chief of Staff of the Army? What about the Chief of \nNaval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of \nStaff of the Air Force, all of whom have objected to this provision \nbecause it is being railroaded through without a proper assessment on \nthe morale and effectiveness of our military?\n  I read from the bill itself that this Secretary's memorandum says:\n\n       . . . determine any impacts to military readiness, military \n     effectiveness, unit cohesion [et cetera] that may result from \n     repeal of the law.\n\n  That may result from the repeal of the law. Every provision says that \nthe law will be repealed if the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sign off on a report that \ndoesn't assess the effect on morale and readiness of the men and women \nin the military. It would only assess impacts of repeal. That is not \nright. We are in two wars. Should we not assess the impact on the \nreadiness, the morale, and effectiveness of the men and women who are \nin harm's way, who would be affected by the repeal of don't ask, don't \ntell? Should we not have that assessment?\n  What the chairman has done and what the majority of the Democrats \nhave done is in blatant disregard for the morale, effectiveness, \nrecruitment, and retention of the men and women serving in the military \ntoday. Why couldn't we have done what our service chiefs want and what \nour senior enlisted people want, and that is an assessment of battle \neffectiveness and morale regarding a repeal of it, and then decide \nwhether to repeal don't ask, don't tell?\n  This is really a remarkable act on the part of the Democrats because \nthis is a political issue, just as the DREAM Act is a political issue. \nIt is a political issue. I understand the season. I understand it is \nnot that far between now and the elections. But to use the Defense \nbill, which has to do with defending our national security interests \nwhen we are in two wars, to pursue a social agenda and legislative \nagenda to galvanize voting blocks I think is reprehensible.\n  We will be talking a lot about this in the next day or so. I appeal \nto the American people, who understand what we are about here.\n  I wish to return to the DREAM Act for another minute. If we enact any \nlegislation that provides people with citizenship in this country \nwithout securing our borders, then we have placed ourselves in a \nsituation where we will have more people in this country illegally and \nwe will have to address that issue again. It is no longer a border \nissue; it is a national security issue. The drug cartels and the human \nsmugglers have now posed a threat to our Nation's security. That is why \nour Secretary of State, just a couple weeks ago, said the situation in \nMexico was comparable to that of Colombia in the 1980s, when they had \nan active insurgency called the FARC.\n  To use the Defense authorization bill as a vehicle to enact \nlegislation, which there would be numerous amendments to, there would \nbe hours and hours of debate--by the way, the amendment I proposed \nabout 10 years ago was a rifle shot on a specific issue. This is, of \ncourse, a major piece of legislation that affects at least, I am told, \n800,000 people who are living in this country illegally.\n  I hope that we will return to the days I remember in the past when we \nhad unlimited amendments, unlimited debate, and that we move forward in \na bipartisan fashion on this issue. Unfortunately, the politicization \nof this very important legislation that affects our ability to fight \nand win wars is being compromised for short-term political purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to briefly comment on a number \nof points the Senator from Arizona made. First, he read a list of items \nthat he thought were wasteful items that we added to the bill. I went \nthrough a long list of the items we added to the bill, probably three \npages of types of items that we added in the Armed Services Committee \nthat support the troops, their readiness, their capabilities, their \nbenefits.\n  He suggested--in fact, stated that these spending items were put in \nthe bill without debate, discussion, or amendment. I first want to \ncomment on that because, as the Presiding Officer knows as a very \nvalued and esteemed member of our committee, we spent days on markup. I \nthink we have at least 60 amendments--at least that is my recollection.\n  Every proposed funding item in this bill and every item of the bill \nand report language was shared with the minority staff at least a full \nweek before the beginning of the markup. This is, by the way, about \ntwice as much time as was provided by any other committee chairman I \ncan remember in the 30-plus years I have been here in order to give the \nminority staff an opportunity to look at what the proposed markup \ndocuments were.\n  We then provided the minority staff with several days to suggest \nchanges to the proposed language. A number of significant changes, as a \nmatter of fact, were made on the basis of those discussions and \nrecommendations from the minority staff.\n  After the changes were made, then the full package was provided to \nall the members of the committee and their staffs. Again, several days \nearlier than this had been done in any previous year. So every item the \nSenator from Arizona mentioned, like every other spending item in the \nbill, was subject to amendment in committee. I believe it was 2 days of \ncommittee deliberations. Again, dozens and dozens of amendments were \nadopted, some defeated. But a large number of amendments were dealt \nwith.\n  The opportunity was more than I think has historically been the case \nfor the minority staff, and obviously the majority staff as well, to \nmake recommendations for changes prior to the markup document being \npresented to members for amendment, and many of those changes were \nmade.\n  Now, just a couple of examples that the Senator from Arizona used as \nbeing evidence of wasteful spending that we added. One was $3 million \nfor plant-based vaccine development. The background for that $3 million \nwe added is\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\nthe Department of Defense has been working to develop rapid processes \nfor manufacturing vaccines for a variety of biological threat agents in \norder to safeguard our troops in the battlefield.\n  The most promising path so far to a speedy response for new vaccines \nis the use of plants to produce millions of vaccine doses in a matter \nof weeks at a very low cost, as compared to the 6-plus months for \nstandard production processes that cost many times as much.\n  So that funding is very valuable funding. I do not think most \nobjective observers would consider that to be pork. It will help meet \nmilitary needs by continuing the progress toward rapid, tailored \nvaccine production for new diseases for biological threats.\n  Another one which was mentioned by my friend from Arizona was the \nmoney we added for a physical fitness center at the Malmstrom Air Force \nBase. Now, fitness is a military requirement. According to the Air \nForce, the existing fitness center at Malmstrom Air Force Base, which \nwas built in 1957, so that is now over 50 years ago, ``does not \nadequately satisfy personnel or infrastructure demands.'' The Air Force \nsaid in the absence of a new fitness center, ``there will continue to \nbe very few options to maintain physical fitness during the winter \nmonths.'' The project meets the criteria established for military \nconstruction projects more than a decade ago by Senators Glenn and \nMcCain.\n  Those are just a couple of the items Senator McCain mentioned. \nAnother point the Senator from Arizona made is that the language \nrelative to don't ask, don't tell does not give the Department of \nDefense the opportunity to consider the impact of the change on morale \nand readiness, recruiting and retention of our troops. Here is what the \nlanguage of our bill does. We were very careful in order to be sure \nthere would be a certification that there would be no negative impact \nin terms of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, \nand recruiting and retention.\n  We changed the language in the bill so it was not a direct repeal of \ndon't ask, don't tell, but rather that that policy is going to stay in \neffect explicitly. This is in subsection C, that don't ask, don't tell \nshall remain in effect until such time that all of the requirements and \ncertifications by subsection B are met. If these requirements and \ncertifications are not met, section 654 of title 10--that is the don't \nask, don't tell policy--shall remain in effect.\n  One of the certifications that is required before there is a change \nin policy says:\n\n       The implementation of necessary policies and regulations \n     pursuant to the discretion provided by the amendments made by \n     subsection F--\n\n  Here is the key language--\n\n     is consistent with the standards of military readiness, \n     military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and \n     retention of the Armed Forces.\n\n  This policy will stay in effect unless and until there is, No. 1, a \nreport--which is underway now--which the Secretary of Defense is going \nto provide to the Congress relative to the impact of the change in \npolicy. But, secondly, the policy will stay in effect until the \nPresident transmits--that is unless and until--the President transmits \nto the congressional defense committees a written certification signed \nby the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, stating, again, the standards of military readiness, military \neffectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed \nForces are being met and would be met with a change in policy.\n  Those are just two points the Senator from Arizona made that I wish \nto commend at this time. I believe there is going to be opportunity for \nfurther debate tomorrow something like an hour and a half in the \nmorning, although that is being worked on at this time.\n  But further debate on this bill can be had by anybody who wishes to \nproceed to it. But I hope we can proceed to the consideration of this \nbill. This is a motion to proceed to consideration of the bill. All the \nrights of filibustering and extended debate will be preserved on the \nbill itself if we can only get to debate the bill. Amendments will be \navailable. Either amendments adding or amendments striking will be \navailable.\n  But we have to get to the bill. I mean, people are making arguments \nabout the bill which belong at the time of the debate on the bill. But \nunless we can get to the point where we can debate the bill, it is kind \nof a theoretical debate we are having--whether it is don't ask, don't \ntell, whether it is the DREAM Act, whether it is other things which \npeople would either like to change that are in the bill or would like \nto add to the bill.\n  As my good friend from Delaware who is presiding at the moment knows, \nthere are provisions in this bill that I opposed in committee that I \nwould like to see stricken from the bill. But to oppose debate on a \nbill because there are provisions in the bill that we do not like or we \nwould like to see added, it seems to me, engages in an exercise which \nis not what the intent of the Senate ever was. We should debate bills. \nWe should amend bills. We should offer amendments to strike provisions, \nto add provisions. But to deny the Senate the opportunity to get to the \npoint where we are debating on the Defense authorization bill is \nsomething which seems to me totally unacceptable.\n  We need to support our troops. This bill is a bill to support the men \nand women wearing the uniform of this country and their families. One \ncan argue there are provisions in this bill which should not be in the \nbill. Fine. Debate them. Vote on them. But to say we should not get to \nthe bill which contains provisions so critical for the well being and \nsuccess of our men and women in the Armed Forces, it seems to me, is \ntotally inconsistent with what the Armed Services Committee and this \nSenate need to be about, which is providing for the defense and \nsecurity of the country and the well being of the men and women who put \non the uniform of this country.\n  So I hope we will get cloture tomorrow and proceed to the debate, \nwhich is totally appropriate, on a whole bunch of issues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7197-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, today I recognize Alice and Edward \n``Buzz'' Palmer for their service and dedication to Chicago's African-\nAmerican community.\n  The Palmers have worked for many years in a variety of capacities to \nbuild a strong, involved, and educated African-American community in \nthe city of Chicago.\n  Alice graduated from high school at the age of 16, and with the help \nof four jobs and a scholarship, she was able to attend Indiana \nUniversity. When she graduated in 1965, she used her degree to help \nothers. She became an educator. While she taught at Malcolm X College, \nNorthwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, she \nalso managed to continue her own education, earning a master's degree \nfrom Roosevelt University and a Ph.D. from Northwestern.\n  Alice realized that education extended outside of the classroom, and \nso did her work. She helped create voter education programs and founded \nthe Metropolitan Chicago chapter of the YMCA's youth and government \nprogram. The YMCA program aims to inspire young people to civic \nengagement and create opportunities to interact with the political \nsystem through service learning and model government.\n  As a teacher, and later as a legislator, Alice firmly believed that \nall students could learn. She made it her job to see that each student \nhad that opportunity. She began a drop-out intervention program in the \nChicago\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nPublic Schools to give students the skills and encouragement to stay in \nschool. As an Illinois State senator, she made it a priority to bring \ncharter schools to Chicago. She knew the status quo in the public \nschools was not good enough, and she worked to create more opportunity \nfor Chicago's students.\n  Alice has always strived to provide the African-American community \nwith the education and tools necessary to build a better future. Alice \nshares that goal with her husband, Buzz.\n  Buzz grew up in Chicago and experienced the racism that plagued the \ncity in the 1940s and 1950s. After serving in the Air Force as an elite \nintelligence officer, he returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago \nPolice Department. There, Buzz observed firsthand the tense \nrelationship between the police and the African-American community, and \nin response, he created the African American Patrolman's League. The \nleague worked within the department and the African-American community \nto counteract racism and change the way the CPD was perceived and the \nway it behaved.\n  In the 1970s, Buzz focused his energy on addressing racial prejudice \nin the health care system. He started a community group that petitioned \nlocal hospitals to provide better quality health care for Black \nfamilies and to hire more African-American medical professionals. He \njoined with other health-focused community groups and Chicago area \nmedical schools to create the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers \nProgram. The program uses structured academics, counseling, \nmotivational and financial support to help underrepresented minorities \npursue degrees in medicine.\n  Over the years, Buzz expanded his view and took a keen interest in \nbetter connecting African Americans with the international community. \nTogether Alice and Buzz Palmer founded the Black Press Institute to \ncompile and edit news from Black media outlets throughout the United \nStates for distribution worldwide.\n  On October 2 of this year, Alice and Buzz Palmer are being honored \nwith lifetime achievement awards from the United Black Fund of Illinois \nfor their decades of work with the African-American community in \nChicago. I congratulate them on this award and thank them for their \nlifetime of dedication to Chicago and the African American community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7198-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7198-S7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal John C. Bishop\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Corporal \nJohn C. Bishop of the U.S. Marine Corps and Versailles, IN.\n  Corporal Bishop was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division. He lost his life on September 8, 2010, \nwhile serving bravely in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nHelmand province, Afghanistan. He was serving his third tour of duty \nand was 25 years old.\n  John graduated from Southwestern Shelby High School in 2003 and \nimmediately joined the Marines. John aspired to become a marine from a \nyoung age, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his older brother \nTyson. Tyson joined the Marines in 1993, and each time he returned \nhome, John would climb into his older brother's Marine uniform.\n  Today, I join John's family and friends in mourning his tragic death. \nHe is survived by his wife Cristle Bishop, who is expecting their first \ndaughter in October; his son K'Sean Bishop; his mother Sarah Thomas; \nhis brothers William Bishop, Mike Bishop, Anthony Thomas, Eric Thomas, \nJamey Bishop, and Tyson Bishop; and his sisters Nancy Braley and Amy \nParker.\n  As we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride in \nthe example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his service \nand his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of CPL John C. Bishop in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Phillip Chad Jenkins\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor the life of SSG Phillip \nChad Jenkins of the U.S. Army and Decatur, IN.\n  Staff Sergeant Jenkins was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 27th \nInfantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was only 26 years old \nwhen he lost his life on September 7, 2010, while bravely serving \nduring his second tour of duty in support of Operation New Dawn in \nBalad, Iraq. Staff Sergeant Jenkins' first tour was in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n  A Decatur native, Staff Sergeant Jenkins graduated from Bellmont High \nSchool in 2002 and joined the army soon after. While in high school, \nStaff Sergeant Jenkins enjoyed playing the saxophone in the school band \nand worked at Scott's Food & Pharmacy.\n  Staff Sergeant Jenkins was a dedicated soldier who always went above \nand beyond the call of duty. One of his fellow soldiers, Fritz \nBultemeyer, described Staff Sergeant Jenkins as ``a great American \nfallen hero.''\n  Today, I join Staff Sergeant Jenkins' family and friends in mourning \nhis death. He is survived by his wife Melissa; his two daughters Piper \nand Lindly; his mother and father Rose and David Jenkins; and his \nsister Cassie Jenkins.\n  We take pride in the example of this dedicated soldier and great \nAmerican hero, even as we struggle to express our grief over this loss. \nWe cherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor SSG \nMichael Bock of Springfield, NE.\n  Sergeant Bock grew up in Springfield, attending Elkhorn Mount Michael \nHigh School for 2 years before moving with his family to Leesburg, FL. \nAbout a month after graduating from Leesburg High School in 2002, \nSergeant Bock joined the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Marrying his high school sweetheart, Tiffany, in 2003, Sergeant Bock \nwas very much a family man. According to Tiffany, no matter what he was \ndoing or how long he was working, he would still call his family. He \neven got up in the middle of the night recently while in Afghanistan to \nget online and watch Zander, his 3-year-old son, blow out his birthday \ncandles.\n  Sergeant Bock was also very dedicated to his career in the Marine \nCorps. He served two tours in Iraq and also served in Australia and \nIndonesia, where he received a Marine Corps humanitarian ribbon for his \nhelp during the tsunami recovery in 2004.\n  Sergeant Bock's goals of starting a college fund for his son and \npurchasing a house for his family were interrupted on August 13, 2010. \nHe was on his second deployment in Afghanistan serving with the 3rd \nCombat Engineer Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary \nForce when he was killed while supporting combat operations in the \nHelmand province.\n  SSG Michael Bock knew the dangers he faced and the risks he took. He \nalso knew the importance of the work he did in the Marine Corps on \nbehalf of his fellow Americans. He risked--and ultimately sacrificed--\nhis own life so people a world away could have the chance to enjoy the \nfreedoms he had found in America. I join all Nebraskans in mourning the \nloss of Sergeant Bock and in offering my deepest condolences to this \nyoung hero's family.\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7199-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FIRST LIEUTENANT MARK NOZISKA\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor an American hero 1LT Mark \nNoziska of Papillion, NE.\n  First Lieutenant Noziska vowed to follow in his grandfather's \nfootsteps by joining the Army after the attacks of September 11, 2001. \nHe graduated from Papillion High School in 2004 and enlisted in the \nNebraska Army National Guard. In 2005 he was named Soldier of the Year. \nWhile serving in the Guard, Lieutenant Noziska went on to get a degree \nin criminal justice from the University of Nebraska--Omaha.\n  After earning his degree, Lieutenant Noziska joined the active Army \nand became an officer serving with Company D, 1st Battalion, 22nd \nInfantry out of Fort Carson, CO. Lieutenant Noziska was about a month \ninto his tour of duty in Afghanistan when his dream of eventually \nearning the rank of general was cut short by an improvised explosive \ndevice as he was serving as part of a dismounted patrol conducting \nclearance operations.\n  The life and service of 1LT Mark Noziska represents an example we can \nall look up to and seek to emulate. He served his country honorably and \nmade the ultimate sacrifice. Lieutenant Noziska made the most of his \nshort life, and the greatest tragedy is that now it is impossible to \nknow what more this promising young man might have accomplished. I join \nall Nebraskans, indeed all Americans, in mourning the loss of \nLieutenant Noziska and in offering my deepest condolences to this young \nhero's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7199-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7199-S7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \neditorial by Bono for the September 19, 2010, New York Times be printed \nin the Record. The editorial notes the language that I championed with \nSenator Cardin on requiring U.S.-listed extractive companies to reveal \ntheir payments which was incorporated in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 19, 2010]\n\n               M.D.G.'s for Beginners . . . and Finishers\n\n                               (By Bono)\n\n       I've noticed that New Yorkers, and I sometimes try to pass \n     for one these days, tend to greet the word ``summit'' with an \n     irritated roll of the eyes, a grunt, an impatient glance at \n     the wristwatch. In Manhattan, a summit has nothing to do with \n     crampons and ice picks, but refers instead to a large \n     gathering of important persons, head-of-state types and their \n     rock-star retinues in the vicinity of the United Nations \n     building and creates, therefore, a near total immobilization \n     of the East Side. Can world peace possibly be worth this? \n     Never, never . . . Eleanor Roosevelt, look what you've done . \n     . . .\n       Recent global summit meetings, from Copenhagen to Toronto, \n     have frankly been a bust, so the world, which may not know it \n     yet, is overdue for a good multilateral confab--one that's \n     not just about the gabbing but about the doing. The subject \n     of the summit meeting at the United Nations this week is one \n     whose monumental importance is matched only by its minuscule \n     brand recognition: the Millennium Development Goals, \n     henceforth known as the M.D.G.'s (God save us from such dull \n     shorthand).\n       The M.D.G.'s are possibly the most visionary deal that most \n     people have never heard of. In the run-up to the 21st \n     century, a grand global bargain was negotiated at a series of \n     summit meetings and then signed in 2000. The United Nations' \n     ``Millennium Declaration'' pledged to ``ensure that \n     globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's \n     people,'' especially the most marginalized in developing \n     countries. It wasn't a promise of rich nations to poor ones; \n     it was a pact, a partnership, in which each side would meet \n     obligations to its own citizens and to one another.\n       Of course, this is the sort of airy-fairy stuff that people \n     at summit meetings tend to say and get away with because no \n     one else can bear to pay attention. The 2000 gathering was \n     different, though, because signatories agreed to specific \n     goals on a specific timeline: cutting hunger and poverty in \n     half, giving all girls and boys a basic education, reducing \n     infant and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-\n     quarters respectively, and reversing the spread of AIDS, \n     tuberculosis and malaria. All by 2015. Give it an A for \n     Ambition.\n       So where are we now, 10 years on, with some ``first-world'' \n     economies looking as if they could go bang, and some second- \n     and third-level economies looking as if they could be \n     propping us up?\n       Well, I'd direct you to the plenary sessions and panel \n     discussions for a detailed answer . . . but if you're, eh, \n     busy this week . . . my view, based on the data and what I've \n     seen on the ground, is that in many places it's going better \n     than you'd think.\n       Much better, in fact. Tens of millions more kids are in \n     school thanks to debt cancellation. Millions of lives have \n     been saved through the battle against preventable disease, \n     thanks especially to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria. Apart from fallout from the market \n     meltdown, economic growth in Africa has been gathering pace--\n     over 5 percent per year in the decade ending in 2009. Poverty \n     declined by 1 percent a year from 1999 to 2005.\n       The gains made by countries like Ghana show the progress \n     the Millennium Goals have helped create.\n       At the same time, the struggles of places like Congo remind \n     us of the distance left to travel. There are serious \n     headwinds: 64 million people have been thrown back into \n     poverty as a result of the financial crises, and 150 million \n     are hungry because of the food crisis. And extending the \n     metaphor, there are storms on the horizon: the poor will be \n     hit first--and worst--by climate change.\n       So there should be no Champagne toasts at this year's \n     summit meeting. The 10th birthday of our millennium is, or \n     ought to be, a purposeful affair, a redoubling of efforts. \n     After all, there's only five years before 2015, only five \n     years to make all that Second Avenue gridlock worth it. With \n     that in mind I'd like to offer three near-term tests of our \n     commitment to the M.D.G.'s.\n       1. Find what works and then expand on it. Will mechanisms \n     like the Global Fund get the resources to do the job?\n       Energetic, efficient and effective, the fund saves a \n     staggering 4,000 lives a day. Even a Wall Streeter would have \n     to admit, that's some return on investment. But few are aware \n     of it, a fact that allows key countries--from the United \n     States to Britain, France and Germany--to go unnoticed if \n     they ease off the throttle. The unsung successes of the fund \n     should be, well, sung, and after this summit meeting, its \n     work needs to be fully financed. This would help end the \n     absurdity of death by mosquito, and the preventable calamity \n     of 1,000 babies being born every day with H.I.V., passed to \n     them by their mothers who had no access to the effective, \n     inexpensive medicines that exist.\n       2. Governance as an effect multiplier. In this column last \n     spring, I described some Africans I've met who see corruption \n     as more deadly than the deadliest of diseases, a cancer that \n     eats at the foundation of good governance even as the \n     foundation is being built. I don't just mean ``their'' \n     corruption; I mean ours, too. For example, multinational oil \n     companies. They want oil, and governments of poor countries \n     rich in just one thing, black gold, want to sell it to them. \n     All well and good. Except the way it too often happens, as \n     democracy campaigners in these countries point out, is not at \n     all good. Some of these companies knowingly participate in a \n     system of backhanders and bribery that ends up cheating the \n     host nation and turning what should be a resource blessing \n     into a kind of curse of black market cabals.\n       Well, I'm pleased to give you an update on an intervention \n     that some of us thought of and fought for as critical: hidden \n     somewhere in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill (admit it . \n     . . you haven't read it all either) there is a hugely \n     significant ``transparency'' amendment, added by Senators \n     Richard Lugar and Benjamin Cardin. Now energy companies \n     traded on American exchanges will have to reveal every \n     payment they make to government officials. If money changes \n     hands, it will happen in the open. This is the kind of \n     daylight that makes the cockroaches scurry.\n       The British government should institute the same \n     requirement for companies trading in Britain, as should the \n     rest of the European Union and ultimately all the G-20 \n     nations. According to the African entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim, \n     who has emerged as one of the most important voices on that \n     continent, transparency could do more to transform Africa \n     than even debt cancellation has. Measures like this one \n     should be central to any renewed Millennium Development Goal \n     strategy.\n       And the cost to us is zero, nada. It's a clear thought in a \n     traffic jam.\n       3. Demand clarity; measure inputs and outputs.\n       Speaking of transparency, let's have a little more, please, \n     when it comes to the question of who is doing what toward \n     which goal and to what effect. We have to know where we are \n     to know how far we've left to go.\n       Right now it's near impossible to keep track. Walk (if you \n     dare) into M.D.G. World and you will encounter a dizzying \n     array of vague financing and policy commitments on critical \n     issues, from maternal mortality to agricultural development. \n     You come across a load of bureau-babble that too often is \n     used to hide double counting, or mask double standards. This \n     is the stuff that feeds the cynics.\n       What we need is an independent unit--made up of people from \n     governments, the private sector and civil society--to track \n     pledges and progress, not just on aid but also on trade, \n     governance, investment. It's essential for the credibility of \n     the United Nations, the M.D.G.'s, and all who work toward \n     them.\n       And that was the deal, wasn't it? The promise we made at \n     the start of this century was not to perpetuate the old \n     relationships between donors and recipients, but to create \n     new ones, with true partners accountable to each other and \n     above all to the citizens these\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n     systems are supposed to work for. Strikes me as the right \n     sort of arrangement for an age of austerity as well as \n     interdependence. (The age of interrupted affluence should \n     sharpen our focus on future markets for our sake as well as \n     theirs.)\n       No leader scheduled to speak at the summit meeting is more \n     painfully aware of this context than President Obama, who one \n     year ago pledged to put forth a global plan to reach the \n     development goals. If promoting transparency and investing in \n     what works is at the core of that strategy, he can assure \n     Americans that their dollars are reinforcing their values, \n     and their leadership in the world is undiminished. Action is \n     required to make these words, these dull statistics, sing. \n     The tune may not be pop but it won't leave your head--this \n     practical, achievable idea that the world, now out of kilter, \n     can re-balance itself and offer all, not just some, a chance \n     to exit the unfathomable deprivation that brings about the \n     need for such global bargains.\n       I understand the critics who groan or snooze through the \n     pious pronouncements we will hear from the podium in the \n     General Assembly. But still in my heart and mind, \n     undiminished and undaunted, is this thought planted by Nelson \n     Mandela in his quest to tackle extreme poverty: ``Sometimes \n     it falls upon a generation to be great.''\n       We have a lot to prove, but if the M.D.G. agreement had not \n     been made in 2000, much less would have happened than has \n     happened. Already, we've seen transformative results for \n     millions of people whose lives are shaped by the priorities \n     of people they will never know or meet--the very people \n     causing gridlock this week. For this at least, the world \n     should thank New Yorkers for the loan of their city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7200-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE: IMPACT ON THERAPY SERVICES\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, for the past 6 months I have come to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate to offer my doctor's ``second opinion'' about \nthe health reform law. Day after day, week after week, we continue to \nsee disturbing news reports uncovering the law's consequences--\nconsequences that restrict individual freedoms, erode patient access to \nmedical care, and increase our Nation's debt and deficit.\n  Specifically, I have listened closely as President Obama and \ncongressional Democrats repeatedly try to convince the American people \nthat the health care law does not cut Medicare. Having practiced \nmedicine for well over two decades, I can tell you that the Nation's \nMedicare patients and Medicare providers are not fooled. They know the \nDemocrat's health care law cuts over $500 billion from the Medicare \nProgram. They know the law does not use that money to make sure \nMedicare is strong and solvent for generations to come. They know the \nlaw raids Medicare and uses the money to start a brand new entitlement \nprogram for the nonelderly.\n  America's seniors, and the medical professionals who treat them, \nunderstand that if we take over $500 billion away from Medicare then \npatients will lose benefits. They understand that if we take over $500 \nbillion away from Medicare, then the quality of care will go down. They \nunderstand it will be increasingly difficult to see a doctor--\nespecially in rural and frontier States like Wyoming. And they \nunderstand the local community hospitals, home health agencies, nursing \nhomes, and skilled nursing facilities will struggle to keep their doors \nopen.\n  Over the August work period, I traveled all across the State of \nWyoming--talking to folks at town meetings, parades, picnics, fairs, \nand rodeos. Everyone agrees Medicare is going broke--and that the new \nhealth care law does nothing to fix the problem. In fact, it only \nserves to make a bad situation worse.\n  I want to share with the Senate a guest editorial printed in the \nCasper Journal. Written by Kathy Blair, a board certified orthopedic \nphysical therapist, the article explains how proposed Medicare \nreimbursement cuts to physical and occupational therapists will limit \npatient access to medical care.\n  On Friday, June 25, 2010, the Obama administration released its \nproposed 2011 Physician Fee Schedule rule and regulation. The draft \nrule sets Medicare payments for individual physician services. As \nKathy's editorial explains, the new health care law requires the \nAdministration to institute a so-called Multiple Procedure Payment \nReduction--MPPR. Originally designed to impact payment for multiple \nsurgeries performed simultaneously, the administration now plans to \napply the MPPR policy to physical and occupational therapy services. \nThis move is expected to cut Medicare physical and occupational therapy \npayments next year by 12 percent.\n  I thank Kathy Blair for bringing this important matter to the \nSenate's attention and ask unanimous consent to have her editorial \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Casper Journal, Aug. 18-24, 2010]\n\n     Proposed Medicare Policy May Reduce Physical Therapy Services\n\n                          (By Dr. Kathy Blair)\n\n       On June 25, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule that updates 2011 \n     payment rates for physician services, outpatient physical \n     therapy services and other services. In the rule, CMS \n     proposes to implement a multiple procedure payment reduction \n     (MPPR) policy that would result in significant reductions in \n     payment for outpatient therapy services, regardless of the \n     setting in which the services are delivered. It will apply to \n     physician offices, outpatient private practice settings and \n     outpatient services in hospitals, as well as some home health \n     and skilled nursing services (Part B).\n       Estimates indicate that these changes will result in a 12- \n     to 13-percent decrease in payment for outpatient physical \n     therapy services in 2011. These cuts, along with the \n     sustainable growth rate (SCR) cuts and therapy cap, would \n     combine to reduce reimbursement by as much as 35 percent in \n     2011.\n       Physical therapists may have to elect not to see Medicare \n     beneficiaries or close their doors as a result of such \n     significant reductions in reimbursement. It will clearly have \n     an impact on the ability of Medicare beneficiaries to gain \n     access to needed therapy services.\n       Access to necessary therapy services has the potential to \n     decrease costs associated with the management of conditions \n     typically seen by physical therapists under the Medicare \n     program. Therapy services are important to keep Medicare \n     beneficiaries healthy and functioning in their homes or the \n     facilities in which they reside.\n       Additionally, individuals considering a career in physical \n     therapy may reconsider their choice. The inability to serve \n     the rehabilitation needs of seniors and individuals with \n     disabilities due to unsustainable payment cuts would limit \n     access today and has the potential to worsen health care \n     workforce issues in the future.\n       CMS needs to hear from you to understand the implications \n     the MPPR policy will have on physical therapy practices and \n     the healthcare of all Medicare recipients.

Mr. President, today, I have the distinct pleasure of \nrecognizing before the Senate some of the most talented and brightest \nyoung people in the United States. The 2010 Davidson Fellows Award is \nbeing given to 20 young students who are under the age of 18 and have \nalready demonstrated superior ability and achievement in the areas \nscience, music, literature, mathematics, and technology. I would like \nto take this time to recognize each of these extraordinary young \nindividuals and their projects.\n  In the area of science, we have 12 young students with remarkable \nprojects that have contributed to scientific progress. This includes \nKyle Loh, a 16-year-old young man from Piscataway, NJ, who conducted \nscreening of chemical libraries and identified compounds that can help \nconvert human and mouse skin cells into pluripotent stem cells. \nPluripotent stem cells have the potential to differentiate into many \ndifferent cell types. The chemical compounds he identified obviate the \nneed to destroy embryos. Kyle's studies advance regenerative medicine \nand provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the \nconversion of skin cells into pluripotent stem cells.\n  Jonathan Rajaseelan, a 17-year-old young man from Millersville, PA, \nsynthesized six new chemical carbene complexes of the metal Rhodium. \nRhodium complexes act as catalysts in multiple organic synthesis \nreactions, including the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and \nindustrial chemicals. The catalytic effects of his complexes make these \nprocesses safer, inexpensive, and less\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\nenvironmentally hazardous by eliminating the need for large quantities \nof hydrogen gas, a dangerous explosive. Jonathan's work has the \npotential to contribute to greener methods of making medicines, \npharmaceuticals, and other chemical products.\n  Eric Brooks, a 16-year-old young man from Hewlett, NY, studied the \ngenetic factors affecting metastatic progression of prostate cancer. \nApproximately 30 percent of men with prostate cancer will die from it, \nbut it is difficult to predict who will get the metastatic diagnosis. \nEric developed models based on evolutionary selection to identify genes \nthat may affect metastatic potential either positively or negatively. \nHis observations may be used to design better clinical predictors to \nindicate who must undergo painful treatment and for whom the treatment \nis unnecessary.\n  Meredith Lehmann, a 14-year-old young woman from La Jolla, CA, \nresearched the spread of epidemics. Using trip data from all 3,076 \ncounties in the continental United States, she found long distance auto \ntravel, which accounts for five times as many passenger-miles as air \ntravel, governs simulated epidemic evolution. Large hub airports near \npopulation centers are not disproportionately more important in \ncontrast to existing research. Meredith's findings suggest epidemic \nmodels should incorporate automobile and air travel data, but \ntransportation network restrictions are unlikely to be effective.\n  Laurie Rumker, a 17-year-old young woman from Portland, OR, \ninvestigated the susceptibility of organoclay to biodegradation by \nmicroorganisms within river sediments. Organoclay is a chemically \nmodified clay material used to prevent hydrophobic pollutants from \nrising into the water ecosystem. Through spectrophotometric analyses \nand oxygen uptake tests, Laurie found biodegradation of the chemical \nstructures within organoclay which could impair the ability of the \norganoclay to adsorb and retain pollutants. Laurie's work has important \nimplications for the treatment of contaminated sediments.\n  Benjamin Song, a 16-year-old young man from Audubon, PA, researched \ncolon cancer biomarkers in urine. Colon cancer is the second leading \ncause of cancer death in the United States, even with the sensitive but \ninvasive colonoscopy. Benjamin designed and tested polymerase chain \nreaction assays targeting a known colon cancer epigenetic marker. His \nwork shows potential for a urine test for colon cancer that is \nnoninvasive, fast, affordable, and sensitive. In addition, his method \ncould be adapted to virtually any cancers with known DNA alterations.\n  Merry Sun, a 16-year-old young woman from Chappaqua, NY, studied \ntherapeutic ultrasound's potential in treating recurrent and metastatic \ncancers. Traditional therapies like radiation, chemotherapy, and \nsurgical resection are ineffective in immune responses against tumor \ncells. Merry found that therapeutic ultrasound causes stress and light \ndamage to tumor cells, which alerts the immune system to respond and \ntarget the tumor. Her results demonstrate the possibility of a novel, \nnon-invasive, non-toxic cancer therapy that treats solid tumors as well \nas systemic metastases.\n  James Ting, a 17-year-old young man from Holmdel, NJ, synthesized \nbismuth nanowires which demonstrate quantum confinement, the reduction \nof electrons to a one-dimensional axis. By using physical vapor \ndeposition, he created lawns of bismuth nanowires as well as isolating \nsingle nanowires to add to silicon chips. James' research focuses on \nthe creation of single electron transistors, which are useful in the \nnew field of spintronics. The spins of these electrons could then be \nharnessed and used for information storage and act as the building \nblocks for quantum computers.\n  Scott Boisvert, a 16-year-old young man from Chandler, AZ, \ndemonstrated a link between amphibian aquatic environments and the \ngrowth of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has \ncontributed to the loss of over 32 percent of amphibian species \nworldwide. Using ion chromatography and ion-coupled plasma \nspectrometry, Scott studied how the water chemistry of a habitat \naffects the growth of the microorganism. Scott's project has broad \nimplications for understanding the pathogen's propensity to infect an \namphibian host and controlling the spread of infection, benefiting \nconservation efforts.\n  Janie Gu, a 16-year-old young woman from Morganville, NJ, researched \nnoise reduction of atomic magnetometer systems, advanced devices that \nmeasure magnetic fields with extreme precision. To increase the signal-\nto-noise ratio, she tested the loss factors, such as measurements of \nmagnetic noise produced, of various ferromagnetic materials for use in \nthe magnetic shield around the system, improving the precision by more \nthan 44 percent. Janie's work has applications in the military, \nmedicine, information storage, mineral and oil detection, space \nexploration and fundamental physics experiments.\n  Rebecca Jolitz, a 15-year-old young woman from Los Gatos, CA, \nexamined whether hypolithic cyanobacteria, a photosynthetic organism \nfound under rocks in climatically extreme environments, could \ntheoretically have enough sunlight to survive on Mars. Using an \noriginal computer program that simulated a million individual beams of \nsunlight hitting a Martian rock, Rebecca found that there was enough \nlight for cyanobacteria to survive on Mars, indicating that Mars may \nnot be a dead world. Rebecca's research could help to discover the \nmeans through which life on Mars may exist.\n  Sahil Khetpal, a 17-year-old young man from Plano, TX, developed a \ncarbon nanotube-based drug-delivery system for tumor targeted \nchemotherapy and photo-therapy of cancer, a dual therapy. This \nversatile platform attacks tumors on two fronts and mitigates the \nsevere side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. He also \ninvestigated a gadonanotube for the development of a new drug delivery \nsystem. Sahil's system has the potential to both diagnose cancer at an \nearlier stage and provide the dual therapy mechanism to efficiently \ncombat it.\n  In the area of music, there are two talented young musicians that \nhave produced significant contributions to the art of music. Yeeren \nLow, a 13-year-old young man from East Stroudsburg, PA, explored and \nexperimented with sound in various aspects of music through five \ncompositions. In his portfolio, Art of Sound, his goal is to enrich the \nbody of the contemporary classical music genre, and create new musical \nexpressions and listening experiences. Yeeren is particularly \ninterested in promoting greater awareness and exposure to the richness \nof the classical music genre, thus contributing to its wider \nrecognition, appreciation and overall advancement.\n  Kevin Hu, a 16-year-old young man from Naperville, IL, traverses the \nglobe and explores cross-sections of humanity in his violin portfolio, \nSociomusicology: Exploring and Sharing the Worlds of Music. His \nportfolio includes selections of music that, at times, were repressed \nby political regimes, or conversely, celebrated for their heartbreaking \nbeauty, all while representing an array of raw humanity. Kevin's goal \nis to present music as a tangible and dynamic tool in human healing, \nself-discovery, and dignity.\n  In the area of literature, we have one creative and inspired student, \nJohn Michael Colon, a 17-year-old young man from Wayside, NJ. John's \nportfolio, Art as Empathy: A Study of the Syncretic Potential of \nLiterature, demonstrates the utility of literature and art in society. \nHe writes that although human beings want to communicate their \nfundamental experience, this worldview is too ineffable to express \ndirectly; art and literature articulate this on a visceral level. John \nMichael proposes through art and literature, the expression of ideas \ncan help tame the tendency to dehumanize others by helping us see their \nideas the same way we see ours, inspiring empathy.\n  We have two bright young individuals whose projects have advanced the \nfield of mathematics. Damien Jiang, a 17-year-old young man from \nRaleigh, NC, studied the parallel chip-firing game, PCFG. Though not a \ngame, the PCFG is played on a graph, or network of nodes and edges, and \nis closely related to a variety of mathematical models for complex \nphenomena such as earthquakes, avalanches, and forest fires. By running \ncomputer simulations of randomized PCFGs, Damien studied their tendency \nto reach a cycle of repeating configurations, and mathematically proved \na theorem about its\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\nbehavior on a graph. Damien's work has broad applications in disaster \npreparedness.\n  Jonathan Li, a 17-year-old young man from Laguna Niguel, CA, \ndeveloped a mathematical model and computer simulation to analyze tumor \ngrowth and is the first to study motility and contact inhibition, a \nmechanism that limits cell growth when pressured by neighboring cells. \nHis research also revealed an inherent flaw of the Cellular Potts \nModel, used to simulate cellular structure behavior. Jonathan's work \nprovides a method to predict the effects of motility on tumor \ndevelopment and can be used to identify cancer phenotypes that \nchemotherapy drugs can target, potentially improving treatment.\n  Finally, in the area of technology, we honor three innovative young \nminds. Anna Kornfeld Simpson, a 17-year-old young woman from San Diego, \nCA, developed a chemical-detecting robot. She used porous silicon, a \nmaterial that changes color in the presence of chemicals like alcohols \nor nerve gas, and simple, low-cost circuit elements to detect color \nchange. The robotic microcomputer then ``sees'' the chemical instead of \n``smelling'' it. Prototypes had a 100 percent response rate. Anna's \nwork has applications in security and counterterrorism, monitoring \nindustrial settings for toxins, and exploring locations too hazardous \nfor humans.\n  Alexander Gilbert, a 16-year-old young man from McLean, VA, developed \na computer algorithm which improves contrast in magnetic resonance \nimaging, MRI. His program has been successfully applied to brain MRI \nimages, enabling more accurate image definition of tissues, such as \nareas of demyelination, or plaques, which are often present in patients \nwith multiple sclerosis. Alexander's work is pertinent to MRIs of the \nspine and other areas, and offers the potential for better diagnosis \nand monitoring of multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases \nincluding Alzheimer's disease.\n  Gavin Ovsak, a 16-year-old young man from Hopkins, MN, designed a \ndevice to allow disabled individuals more effective access to \ncomputers. His project, known as CHAD, circuit head accessibility \ndevice, is a circuit board integrated onto a baseball hat to replace \nthe functions of a computer mouse through head movements and a bite \nsensor. Gavin's work is less expensive, more efficient, and uses fewer \ncomplex software interfaces than are currently available in the \nassistive technology market, equalizing access to the social, \noccupational, and global significance of the Internet.\n  I often say that America's gifted and talented students possess \nremarkable potential. These 20 young individuals have demonstrated more \nthan potential. They have already made significant contributions to our \nsociety in their short lives and one can scarcely begin to imagine how \nmuch they will contribute to society throughout their lives, thanks in \nno small part to the encouragement of the Davidson Institute as well as \ntheir parents and mentors. They are an inspiration and a reminder that \nif we fully support our most talented young people, we can look forward \nto a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7202-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO IRVING BURGIE\n\n Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I stand today to honor a great man \nof American music--a man whose name is largely unknown, but his music \nis known and loved around the world. This man is Mr. Irving Burgie.\n  Mr. Irving Burgie more popularly known as ``Lord Burgess'' was born \nin Brooklyn, NY, in 1924. He was raised in the close-knit West Indian-\nAmerican community of New York City during the Great Depression.\n  The Second World War took him from Brooklyn to the other side of the \nworld in the jungles of what is now Thailand. Under the guns of the \nJapanese army, a young Irving Burgie and other troops in the segregated \nArmy of the time built and maintained the famous ``Burma Road.''\n  Following the war, Mr. Burgie studied music at Julliard, the \nUniversity of Arizona, and the University of California.\n  While performing in New York in the mid-1950s, he met Harry \nBelafonte. This was the beginning of a collaboration that would lead to \nthe 1956 release of ``Calypso,'' the first album to sell 1 million \ncopies. The album included Irving Burgie's adaptation of ``The Banana \nBoat Song'' better known as ``Day-O'' and spent 99 weeks on the charts.\n  Irving Burgie is credited with composing and arranging over 50 songs \non ASCAP. He wrote the ``National Anthem of Barbados'' his beloved \nmother's native land. His world-famous songs, including ``Island in the \nSun'' and ``Jamaica Farewell,'' have been recorded by Harry Belafonte, \nMiriam Makeba, The Kingston Trio and Jimmy Buffet and featured in the \nhit movies ``Island in the Sun'' and ``Beetlejuice.''\n  In his later years, Mr. Irving Burgie helped to form the Black Men of \nQueens County Federation, an organization devoted to helping African-\nAmerican young men find their own success, through mentoring and \nscholarship programs. He later established the Irving Burgie Award for \nExcellence in Literary and Creative Arts.\n  Irving Burgie is a songwriter, author, and committed citizen who has \nbrought joy to the world through music and has contributed to the best \nof American culture and society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7202-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7202-S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID KRANZ\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, with great honor and pride, today \nI pay tribute to a retiring member of the Fourth Estate in my home \nState of South Dakota. David Kranz is retiring after a journalism \ncareer that has spanned 42 years, an impressive mark in any profession \nbut most certainly in the newspaper field.\n  David, the son of Wilfred and Sally Kranz, was born November 3, 1945. \nAfter attending Holy Rosary Grade School in Kranzburg, he graduated \nfrom Watertown High School and obtained his degree in journalism in \n1968 from South Dakota State University.\n  David began his career by spending 8 years as a city reporter and \ncity editor at the Austin Daily Herald in Minnesota, where he began \npenning a political column. It would be that political column that \nwould define and shape David's journalism career. He left Austin in \n1976 and moved back to his beloved home State of South Dakota to become \nmanaging editor of the Mitchell Daily Republic, a position he held \nuntil 1983 when he left to work for South Dakota's largest newspaper, \nthe Sioux Falls Argus Leader. From executive city editor and managing \neditor to reporter and columnist, there wasn't much David didn't \nwitness, or comment on, during his 24 years with the Argus Leader.\n  Dave Kranz ranks with other widely known and popular journalists from \nSouth Dakota, including Tom Brokaw, Al Neuharth and Ken Bode. People in \npolitical circles valued Dave's wit and wisdom, his speculation and \nsatire, his candor, and commentary.\n  David received the National Scripps-Howard Public Service Reporting \nAward at the National Press Club. He also has earned numerous state and \nnational awards, was recognized for countless individual stories, and \nwas presented with the SDSU Distinguished Alumni Award.\n  There is perhaps no better tribute to a person than to listen to the \nheartfelt words of one's peers. Here are just a few of David's \ncontemporaries in the journalism world and what they have to say about \nthis dedicated writer.\n  ``Dave is the heart and conscience of South Dakota journalism. He was \na walking databank of history, trends and current events long before \nthe term was invented. Dave has a special knack for telling the stories \nof real South Dakotans and giving them the dignity and devotion they \ndeserve. He has a gift of friendship that transcends his craft and puts \nhim on a first-name basis with people all over the state,'' says Chuck \nRaasch of the Gannett News Service.\n  Distinguished professor Robert Burns of the South Dakota State \nUniversity and the University of South Dakota, said of Dave, ``He \nenjoys a high readership because of the quality and timing of his \nreporting. David's column is consistently timely and accurate because \nhe has cultivated an excellent professional relationship with the \nleading political actors and political observers in our state. \nPolitical actors are candid in\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\ntheir discussions with him because they know he will be fair in his \nreporting of political developments and news.''\n  Sioux Falls Argus Leader publisher Randell Beck says, ``Dave is the \nhardest working journalist I know. He's often at work when I arrive--\nhunkered down, on the phone, in his cubicle that is eternally \noverstuffed with reports, stacks of old papers, scrawled notes on \nnapkins--and he's often there when I leave.''\n  I am among those who have long valued Dave's political instincts, wit \nand wisdom. During my years in the State legislature and in Congress, I \nmissed very few of his political columns. I always knew Dave would be \nwell prepared when he interviewed me. Over his career, David has \ninterviewed every national political candidate and office holder who \ncame to South Dakota. David was always fair and honest in his \nreporting.\n  David and I would frequently meet for coffee where it was often more \ninteresting to hear the political news from him directly rather than \nwaiting for his column to appear in the paper. I sometimes got more out \nof those coffees than he did from me. But most importantly, I valued \nhis friendship and insight. I know he will have more time now to add to \nhis impressive collections of baseball cards and political buttons. He \nmay also find more time to follow his beloved Atlanta Braves.\n  Thank you, David, for sharing your career with the newspaper readers \nand the citizens of South Dakota--a career filled with professionalism \nand dedication. You are a true credit to your craft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7203-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DELBERT F. REYNOLDS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate \nDelbert F. Reynolds on his retirement as the field office director of \nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development office in \nWisconsin.\n  For the past 41 years, Mr. Reynolds has dedicated himself to helping \nothers through his work with HUD. During his tenure, he served under \neight Presidents and 13 of the 15 HUD Secretaries. In 1987, he became \ndirector of the Milwaukee Field Office, where he coordinated and \noversaw all programs assigned to the office. His 23 years in this \nposition make him the longest serving field office director in \nMilwaukee's history and an asset to our State that will be greatly \nmissed.\n  While director, Mr. Reynolds has contributed significantly to HUD and \nits programs. His insight and experience lead to his selection as \nspecial adviser to HUD policymakers. In Wisconsin, he created many \nsuccessful programs, which were then incorporated on a national level.\n  Mr. Reynolds's leadership and dedication have not gone unnoticed by \nhis peers. He has received numerous awards for his service, including \nthe Manager of the Year Award and the Vice President's National \nPerformance Review--Hammer--Award in 1998. Given to those who work \ntowards a better government, this award recognized Mr. Reynolds for his \nteam's efforts on Section 8 financial management. His awards reflect \nnot only his contributions to HUD and our Nation but also his \ncommendable work ethic.\n  A native of Milwaukee and an alumnus from the University of \nWisconsin, Mr. Reynolds exemplifies dedication to providing quality, \naffordable housing to the people of Wisconsin and public service at its \nfinest. On behalf of our State, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for \nthe 41 years of service Mr. Reynolds has provided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7203-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REVEREND SAM MANN\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the work of Reverend Sam Mann, a leader in the Kansas \nCity community. Reverend Mann's retirement is yet one more wonderful \nmilestone in a life of service.\n  Sam was raised in Eufala, AL, and made Kansas City his home as a \nyoung man. Over the years, he has been a tireless civil rights advocate \nin Kansas City and the Nation. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. and participated in numerous activities to raise awareness of race \nand justice issues.\n  Since 1971, Sam has been the pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist \nChurch in downtown Kansas City. He has been the executive director of \nUnited Inner City Services, a multiservice community-based agency, \nsince 1967.\n  I have always known Reverend Mann as ``rubber band.'' This derives \nfrom the time I was walking with him through a roomful of young \nchildren who were attending a program he had designed that predated his \nestablishment of the St. Mark center. From the beginning, Sam was \nalways looking out for children. As we were walking through the room, \nthe children were pulling on his coattail saying, ``Reverend Mann, \nReverend Mann'' but it sounded like ``rubber band, rubber band.'' From \nthat day forward, he has always been ``rubber band'' to me.\n  Sam believes in the importance of education and has been a strong \nadvocate for early childhood education. Under his leadership, St. Mark \nChild and Family Development Center was established. This center \nstarted in a church basement and now is located in a beautiful state-\nof-the-art facility. In addition, the center serves as a neighborhood \nanchor, providing a safe, warm and attractive site for a variety of \ncommunity services. St. Mark annually serves approximately 225 very low \nand low-income families through its early childhood education program, \nbefore- and after-school program and summer camp. These children and \ntheir families have been forever impacted by Sam's work and dedication.\n  Sam was the founder of the Presbyterian Urban Ministers Network, was \na cosponsor of Kansas City's Urban Peace & Justice Summit, and served \non the Board of the Black Archives of Mid-America. For 25 years, he has \nserved as chair of Kansas City's local chapter of the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference.\n  While we hope that retirement affords Sam some much deserved \nrelaxation and time on the golf course, we also look forward to his \ncontinued involvement in education projects and social justice issues \nimportant to the lives of Kansas Citians.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and \nhonoring Reverend Sam Mann on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7203-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7203-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "20", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/20/senate-section/article/S7203-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7203-S7204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4785.

A bill to designate a mountain and icefield in the State of \nAlaska as the ``Mount Stevens'' and ``Ted Stevens Icefield'', \nrespectively; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is very near to my heart, a bill to provide a lasting permanent \ntribute to former Alaska U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, who died Aug. 9th in \na plane crash in southwest Alaska during a fishing trip. The bill \nactually calls for creation of two permanent tributes to the Senator, \nthe naming of Alaska's currently highest unnamed mountain peak in honor \nof the Senator, calling the 13,895-foot peak in southern Denali \nNational Park, Mount Stevens, and the naming of part of the State's \nlargest ice field in the Chugach Mountains as the Ted Stevens Icefield.\n  Ted Stevens, a colleague of most of us in this body, and a lawmaker \nthat I interned for more than 30 years ago, truly was Alaska. He was \nthe State's senator for all but 11 years of its current existence as a \nState. During his more than 40 years in the Senate he played a \nsignificant role in the transformation of Alaska from an impoverished \nterritory to a full-fledged State. Senator Stevens, a pilot during \nWorld War II, came to Alaska as a U.S. Attorney in the then territory \nof Alaska in 1956. He later served in the Eisenhower Administration \nwhere he was a leading force in writing the legislation that led to the \nadmission of Alaska as the 49th State in the Union on Jan. 3, 1959.\n  In 1961, he moved back from Washington, D.C. to Alaska where he was \nelected to the Alaska House of Representatives just after the state's \ngreat earthquake in 1964. He was subsequently elected as Speaker pro \ntempore and majority leader until his appointment to the U.S. Senate on \nChristmas Eve of 1968 upon the death of one of the State's two original \nsenators, E.L. ``Bob'' Bartlett. He was elected in his own right 7 \ntimes over the next 40 years, becoming the longest-serving Republican \nSenator in U.S. history. Stevens was third in line for the Presidency \nfrom 2003 through 2007.\n  While he is remembered by all in Alaska for his tireless efforts to \nwin Federal support to develop the young State's largely 19th Century \nfrontier infrastructure, he did so much more for all Alaskans. He \nworked tirelessly to enact the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act that \nsettled aboriginal land claims and gave Alaska Natives the right to \nselect about 44 million acres of Alaska's 365-million acres to protect \ntheir long-term economic, cultural and political future.\n  Ted helped the State develop an economy by authoring the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline Authorization Act, which permitted oil to flow to market from \nthe State's North Slope. He authored the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act and the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries \nEnforcement Act that ended the foreign domination of fishing fleets in \nAlaskan and American waters, allowing the State's commercial fishing \nindustry to rebound. He was a leader in telecommunication policies, \nleading efforts to pass the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that paved \nthe way to an era of digital television and communications in this \ncountry and also launched telemedicine and distance learning. And he \nattempted to make the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \nas workable as possible for the State, while protecting more than 100 \nmillion acres of Alaska in parks and refuges--the largest single \nconservation bill in the Nation's history.\n  Ted was a committed sportsman, who loved outdoor pursuits such as \nfishing and hunting, and also amateur sports, authoring the Ted Stevens \nAmateur and Olympic Sports Act, Title IX amendments to encourage \nwomen's sports, and the Carol M. White Physical Education Program that \ndid so much to improve physical education in schools and colleges \nnationwide. He also became a true expert on defense issues, providing \nunconditional support to the Armed Forces of the United States in his \nrole as chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense \nAppropriations for more than two decades.\n  Ted Stevens truly was a mountain of a man in policy development for \nthe State of Alaska and thus it is a pleasure to seek to name both a \nmountain and an ice field in his honor. The peak proposed for naming is \nthe peak referred to as South Hunter peak in the climbing community. It \nis located on the southern side of Denali National Park. At 13,895 feet \nit is the largest peak still unnamed in the State and also a peak \nvisible on a clear day from the Parks Highway, the main north-south \nroad for travelers between Fairbanks and Anchorage, two cities in \nAlaska that Ted is most associated with helping develop.\n  The ice field in the uplands of the Chugach Mountains is the base for \nthe Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Matanuska, Nelchina, Tazlina, Valdez and \nShoup Glaciers--the Harvard being particularly appropriate to be \nassociated with a man who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1950. \nThe entire Chugach Icefield, at 8,340 square miles, the largest in \nAlaska, will provide a fitting tribute for a senator whose breadth of \nknowledge covered all of Alaska's 586,000 square miles and whose love \nof the State and its residents was even larger.\n  This bill follows proper procedure by directing the U.S. Geographical \nPlace Names Board to name the peak and ice field for the State's former \nsenior senator, it not being done directly by Congress. But to \nguarantee timely action, it requires the board to act within 30 days of \nthe bill's enactment.\n  While there are a number of facilities in Alaska that bear the name \nof Senator Stevens, this bill will guarantee that future generations of \nAlaskans will remember him when they engage in the outdoor pursuits \nthat all Alaskans love, from mountain climbing to fishing in the waters \nof Prince William Sound and the rivers of South central Alaska, all \nfueled by the meltwater from the huge ice field that dominates the \nSouth central landscape.\n  This is a fitting tribute for a mentor and friend, to whom Alaskans \nowe so much. I hope for quick passage of this act by this Congress to \nprovide another lasting legacy for Senator Ted Stevens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Specter, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Bayh, Mr. Voinovich, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3804. A bill to combat online infringement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few things are more important to the future \nof the American economy and job creation than protecting our \nintellectual property. The Chamber of Commerce estimates that American \nintellectual property accounts for more than $5 trillion of the \ncountry's gross domestic product, and IP-intensive industries employ \nmore than 18 million workers. Each year, online piracy and the sale of \ncounterfeit goods cost American businesses billions of dollars, and \nresult in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. Studies recently cited by \nthe AFL-CIO estimate that digital theft of movies and music alone costs \nmore than 200,000 jobs. This is unacceptable in any economic climate. \nIt is devastating today.\n  The severity of the problem continues to increase and businesses of \nall types and sizes--and their employees--are the victims. In Vermont, \ncompanies like Burton Snowboards and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company are \nwell recognized brands that depend on the enforcement of our \nintellectual property laws to keep their businesses thriving.\n  The growth of the digital marketplace is extraordinary and it gives \ncreators and producers new opportunities to reach consumers. But it \nalso brings with it the perils of piracy and counterfeiting. The \nincreased usage and accessibility of the Internet has transformed it \ninto the new Main Street. Internet purchases have become so commonplace \nthat consumers are less wary of online shopping and therefore more \neasily victimized by online products that may have health, safety or \nother quality concerns when they are counterfeit.\n  Today, I am introducing the bipartisan Combating Online Infringement \nand Counterfeits Act, which will provide the Justice Department with an \nimportant tool to crack down on Web sites dedicated to online \ninfringement.\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nThis legislation will protect the investment American companies make in \ndeveloping brands and creating content and will protect the jobs \nassociated with those investments. Protecting intellectual property is \nnot uniquely a Democratic or Republican priority--it is a bipartisan \npriority.\n  The Justice Department is currently limited in the remedies available \nto prevent Web sites dedicated to offering infringing content. These \nWeb sites are often based overseas yet target American consumers. \nAmerican consumers are too often deceived into thinking the products \nthey are purchasing are legitimate because the Web sites reside at \nfamiliar-sounding domain names and are complete with corporate \nadvertising, credit card acceptance, and advertising links that make \nthem appear legitimate.\n  The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act will give the \nDepartment of Justice an expedited process for cracking down on these \nrogue Web sites, regardless of whether the Web site's owner is located \ninside or outside of the United States. This legislation authorizes the \nJustice Department to file an in rem civil action against the domain \nname, and to seek an order from the court that the domain name is used \nto access a Web site that is dedicated to infringing activities. Once \nthe court issues an order against the domain name, the Attorney General \nwould have the authority to serve the domain name's U.S. based registry \nor registrar with that order, which would then be required to suspend \nthe infringing domain name.\n  Where the registry or registrar is not located in the United States, \nthe Act would provide the Attorney General the authority to serve the \norder on other specified third parties at its discretion, including \nInternet service providers, payment processors, and online ad network \nproviders. These third parties, which are critical to the financial \nviability of the infringing Web site's business, would then be required \nto stop doing business with that Web site by, for example, blocking \nonline access to the rogue site or not processing the Web site's \npurchases.\n  This legislation will provide the Department of Justice with an \nimportant tool to protect American consumers, American businesses, and \nAmerican jobs. We should not expect that enactment of the legislation \nwill completely solve the problem of online infringement, but it will \nmake it more difficult for foreign entities to profit off American hard \nwork and ingenuity. This bill targets the most egregious actors, and is \nan important first step to putting a stop to online piracy and sale of \ncounterfeit goods.\n  I look forward to working with all Senators to pass this important, \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for S. 3804, \nthe Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, as introduced \nby Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Over the years, Senator Leahy and \nI have tackled some of the most complex issues related to intellectual \nproperty enforcement. With the introduction of today's bill, we narrow \nour focus on the pervasive practice of online piracy and \ncounterfeiting.\n  In our global economy the Internet has become the glue of \ninternational commerce--connecting consumers with a wide-array of \nproducts and services worldwide. But it has also become a tool for \nonline thieves to sell counterfeit and pirated goods. These online \nthieves are making hundreds of millions of dollars by luring consumers \nto what appear to be legitimate websites, where unauthorized downloads, \nstreaming or downloaded copyrighted content and counterfeit goods are \nsold. Not only do these websites facilitate massive theft of American \nIP, but they undermine legitimate commerce.\n  We cannot afford to not act, especially when, by some estimates, IP \naccounts for a third of the market value of all U.S. stocks--\napproximately five trillion dollars or more. That accounts for more \nthan 40 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and is greater than \nthe entire GDP of any other nation in the world.\n  Utah is considered a very popular state for film and television \nproduction activity. Nothing compares to the red rock of Southern Utah \nor the sweeping grandeur of the Wasatch Mountains. Not to mention \nUtah's workforce is one of the most highly educated and hardworking \naround. It is estimated that the motion picture and television \nindustries are responsible for over 6,930 direct jobs and $180.8 \nmillion in wages in Utah. That is why we must combat online piracy and \ncounterfeiting, for they threaten the vitality of the U.S. economy and \nits workforce.\n  Just recently the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus, on \nwhich I serve as cochairman, introduced the 2010 International Piracy \nWatch List, a report of those nations where copyright piracy has \nreached alarming levels. For the first time the Caucus also highlighted \nthe problem of websites that provide unauthorized access to copyrighted \nworks made by U.S. creators. The websites singled out were China's \nBaidu, Canada's isoHunt, Ukraine's MP3fiesta, Sweden's Pirate Bay, \nGermany's Rapidshare and Luxembourg's RMX4U. This is a sobering \nreminder of just how organized and sophisticated these websites have \nbecome in perpetrating online criminal activity.\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\n  There is no quick fix to this problem, unfortunately. But one thing \nis for certain: doing nothing is not an option. We must explore ways, \nalbeit in incremental steps, to take down offending websites. For this \nreason, I believe the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits \nAct is a critical step forward in our ongoing fight against online \npiracy and counterfeiting.\n  If enacted, the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act \nwould provide the Department of Justice, DOJ, an expedited process for \ncracking down on websites that traffic in pirated goods or services.\n  The bill would also authorize the DOJ to file an in rem civil action \nagainst a domain name, and seek a preliminary order from the court that \nthe domain name is being used to sell infringing material.\n  If this legislation is enacted, the DOJ will be required to publish \nnotice of the action promptly after filing, and it would have to \ndemonstrate that the owners of the site engaged in substantial and \nrepeated online piracy or counterfeiting. The bill also includes \nsubstantial safeguards to prevent abuse by the DOJ. For example, a \nFederal court would have the final say as to whether a particular site \nwould be cut off from supportive services. In addition, the bill would \nallow owners or site operators to petition the court to lift the order.\n  I am pleased with the progress that we have made so far on this bill \nand look forward to working with my colleagues on further refinements \nas it moves through the legislative process. We must take steps to \ncombat those websites that are profiting from stolen American \nintellectual property.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 3805. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants for \nStates to implement minimum and enhanced DNA collection processes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Katie \nSepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2010. I am pleased that Senators \nUdall of New Mexico, Schumer, and Bennet of Colorado, are joining me \ntoday in sponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  Similar legislation, which was championed in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Teague, overwhelmingly passed that body \nwith a bipartisan vote of 357 to 32. The bill is named after Katie \nSepich, a promising graduate student attending New Mexico State \nUniversity who was tragically murdered in 2003.\n  The man who killed Katie was arrested for aggravated assault about \nthree months after the murder. Although police had collected the \nkiller's DNA from the crime scene, because there was no requirement \nthat DNA be taken from individuals arrested for serious felonies, \npolice weren't able to get a match until about three years after the \nmurder when the man was sent to prison after being convicted of \nunrelated crimes.\n  If New Mexico had the arrestee law then that it has today it would \nhave taken three months, not three years, to solve the crime. Katie's \nmother, Jayann, has worked tirelessly at the state and Federal level to \ngive law enforcement the tools they need to promptly solve crimes and \nensure that other mothers don't have to suffer the same horrible ordeal \nthat her family has. I commend Congressman Teague for taking up this \ncause in the House, and I look forward to helping with this effort in \nthe Senate.\n  We can't get Katie back, or the other lives that have been lost to \nthese senseless crimes, but we can do something to help solve cases and \nprevent similar crimes from occurring in the future. One such step is \nto enhance the capacity of states to collect the DNA of individuals \narrested for certain felony crimes, which would substantially increase \nthe ability of law enforcement to match DNA found at crimes scenes with \nthat of suspects and individuals who have been previously arrested, \ncharged, or convicted of crimes.\n  The Federal Government and about half the states, including New \nMexico, currently collect arrestee DNA for serious offenses. This has \nproven to be a very effective tool in solving cases, and it makes sense \nto incentivize states to continue and to expand this effort. Since New \nMexico implemented ``Katie's Law'' in 2007, there have been about 100 \nmatches of arrestees. It is also important to note that DNA collection \nhas not only demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of saving lives \nand preventing crimes, but it has also proved to be an important means \nof ensuring that innocent individuals are not mistakenly jailed for \ncrimes they did not commit.\n  Let me take a moment to specifically describe what this legislation \nwould, and would not, do. First, this legislation is aimed at creating \nan incentive for states to enact arrestee DNA collection programs. It \nis not a mandate. States that meet minimum collection guidelines could \napply for DOJ grant assistance in covering the first-year costs that \nthey have incurred or will incur in implementing the standards. If they \nenact laws in accordance with the enhanced guidelines, States would be \neligible for an additional bonus payment.\n  Second, the bill encourages DNA testing for serious felonies, such as \nmurder, sex crimes, aggravated assault, and burglary. It is narrowly \ntailored to apply to the most serious crimes. Third, the legislation \nprovides that all of the expungement provisions under federal law are \napplicable. Arrestees who have their DNA included in the federal \ndatabase may have their records expunged if their conviction is \noverturned, they are acquitted, or charges are dismissed or not filed \nwithin the applicable time period. Furthermore, the bill provides that \nas a condition of receiving a grant states must notify individuals who \nsubmit samples of the relevant expungement procedures and post the \ninformation on a public Web site.\n  Lastly, I would like to address the concerns some have raised about \nthe constitutionality of collecting arrestee DNA. Although courts have \nupheld the collection of arrestee DNA, I recognize that the question of \nwhether the collection of a DNA sample from an arrestee is consistent \nwith the Fourth Amendment isn't a completely settled question of law. \nSome courts have viewed the collection as something akin to \nfingerprinting and other courts have viewed it as a more intrusive \nsearch, such as the taking of a blood sample. However, the Department \nof Justice has stated that it believes that this legislation is \nconstitutional and is supportive of encouraging states to pass DNA \narrestee laws. I believe that such programs, with appropriate \nsafeguards in place, have demonstrated that they can be a very \neffective mechanism to save lives, solve crimes, and prevent wrongful \nconvictions.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n  S. 3806. A bill to protect Federal employees and visitors, improve \nthe security of Federal facilities and authorize and modernize the \nFederal Protective Service; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nCollins, Akaka, and Voinovich today to introduce the bipartisan SECURE \nFacilities Act of 2010--legislation that would modernize and reform an \nimportant but often overlooked agency within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS: the Federal Protective Service, FPS.\n  FPS--with just 1,200 full time employees and approximately 15,000 \ncontract guards--is responsible for security at 9,000 Federal buildings \nacross the land. That mission, unfortunately, is in grave peril--due to \nsevere budget shortfalls, mismanagement, and multiple operational \nchallenges. That is why we are introducing legislation today to reform \nthe agency, provide it with adequate resources, strengthen its \nmanagement capabilities, and help it function at a higher level so it \ncan protect visitors and employees at Federal buildings across this \ncountry more effectively.\n  Let me provide some background. When FPS was folded into DHS in 2003, \nit lost access to supplemental funding from its previous parent \nagency--the General Services Administration. FPS immediately ran into \ntrouble. It had\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\ndifficulty paying its bills, budget cuts hurt employee training and \nother important functions, and personnel cuts negatively affected the \nagency's performance. All this occurred even as the agency was given \nmore responsibilities, and the Administration was trying to downsize \nthe FPS workforce by one-third.\n  To assist us in our oversight of the agency, Senators Collins, Akaka, \nVoinovich, and I asked the Government Accountability Office, GAO, in \nFebruary 2007 to initiate a comprehensive review of the FPS. GAO \nreported to Congress 8 times between 2004 and 2010 on the financial and \nmanagement challenges at FPS, and made 32 recommendations for \nimprovement, some of which FPS adopted.\n  What did GAO find? Unfortunately, it found a seriously dysfunctional \nagency that lacked much, if any, focus or strategy for accomplishing \nits mission--where guards were caught sleeping on the job, and GAO \ninvestigators were able to successfully smuggle bomb-making ingredients \npast security to build an explosive device in a restroom and then \nstroll around the building undetected. GAO's review concluded that \ncontract guards lacked adequate training, FPS personnel suffered from \nlow morale, oversight of the contract guards was poor, and that many of \nthe standards that guide Federal building security and guard behavior \nare outdated.\n  The SECURE Facilities Act of 2010 addresses these shortcomings and \nincorporates recommendations from GAO. For the first time, we would \nformally authorize the Federal Protective Service and the interagency \ngovernment body responsible for establishing security standards for all \nFederal facilities, the Interagency Security Committee. Our legislation \nalso addresses four major challenges.\n  First, the bill ensures that FPS has sufficient personnel to carry \nout its mission. Though the agency has assumed increased \nresponsibilities since it joined DHS, it has done so with fewer \npersonnel.\n  Second, our legislation tackles deficiencies within the contract \nguard program. FPS contract guards are the first line of defense at \nFederal facilities, so we must ensure they are held to a high standard \nand are prepared and equipped to face the many different kinds of \nthreats Federal buildings are vulnerable to.\n  Third, the bill ensures the FPS is focused and prepared to address \nthe threat of explosives. The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City drew our attention to this threat, \nbut FPS has been slow to deploy sufficient countermeasures to detect \nand deter this type of attack.\n\n  Fourth, our bill is mindful of the delicate balance between public \naccess and security. We have worked to ensure that the emphasis on \nsecuring Federal facilities remains on security but we also support \navenues of appeal if a building tenant believes a security \ncountermeasure unduly hinders public access. If the Federal Protective \nService is to be held accountable--by Congress, the administration, and \nthe American people--it should no longer be forced to defend Federal \nagencies that choose to implement less costly and potentially less \neffective security countermeasures for buildings.\n  Our bill would provide additional funding for the agency by directing \nOMB to adjust the building security fees paid by other agencies to \nensure adequate funding for FPS. We would provide sufficient resources \nso that FPS can hire 500 full time employees over the next 4 years. We \nwould also ensure that FPS never employs fewer than 1,200 full time \nemployees at any point--a conservative number that may well require an \nincrease over time.\n  While many of those additional 500 new employees will be law \nenforcement officers, the legislation also provides FPS with the \nflexibility to hire additional administrative and support personnel, \nallowing it to improve its overall management, strengthen its oversight \nof contract guards, monitor contractor performance, and share contract \nassessments throughout the agency. The legislation also provides \nFederal law enforcement retirement benefits to FPS officers, to help \nthe agency recruit and retain quality personnel.\n  The bill further would require the FPS to maintain overt and covert \ntesting programs to assess the training of guards, the security of \nFederal facilities, and to establish procedures for retraining or \nterminating ineffective guards. The bill ensures the basic documents \noutlining a security guard's general and specific responsibilities, the \nSecurity Guard Information Manual, and their post orders, are up to \ndate and periodically reviewed.\n  We would require DHS to establish performance-based standards for \ncheckpoint detection technologies for explosives and other threats at \nFederal facilities. It would allow FPS officers to carry firearms off \nduty, as most other Federal law enforcement officers can, allowing them \nto respond to incidents more quickly. Finally, the bill includes \nseveral reporting requirements, including one on agency personnel \nneeds, one on retention rates of contract guards, and another looking \nat the feasibility of federalizing the contract guard workforce.\n  We are deeply indebted to the excellent work of GAO which we \nhighlighted in a July 8, 2009, Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearing. At the hearing, GAO unveiled the results of \nits year-long investigation conducted at the Committee's request. GAO \nvisited 6 of 11 FPS regions throughout the country and observed the \nguard inspection process; interviewed regional managers, inspectors, \nguards and contract guard managers; met with representatives from \nsecurity guard companies; analyzed guard contract requirements, guard \ntraining and certification requirements, and guard instruction \ndocuments.\n  GAO found that the security provided at Federal buildings by FPS \npersonnel and contract security guards fell well short of what we \nexpect of them. Some guards lacked basic security or x-ray machine \ntraining. The FPS was hard pressed to identify which guards were \nqualified or effective, leading to several embarrassing incidents. One \nguard used a government computer to run an adult website during his \nshift, while another inattentive guard allowed a baby in a carrier to \npass through an X-ray machine. A third guard was photographed asleep at \nhis station.\n  GAO's special investigations unit conducted its own covert tests at \nten high security Federal facilities in several different cities. Using \nreadily available components to make a liquid-based improvised \nexplosive device, they smuggled the components through security, \nmanufactured a bomb in a public restroom, and then moved throughout the \nFederal building undetected. Some of the buildings tested by GAO \ninvestigators house district offices for our colleagues right here in \nthe House and Senate. I note, however, that while the components were \nreal, the actual explosive liquids were diluted to ensure the bomb was \nnot functional.\n  Based on the Committee's and GAO's oversight work over the past \nseveral years, it is clear that Congress must move quickly to address \nthe remaining security vulnerabilities associated with our Federal \nbuildings.\n  I am confident that this comprehensive, bipartisan legislation will \nfoster meaningful reform, modernize the Federal Protective Service, and \nimprove the security of our Federal facilities across the country. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill and I thank Senator Collins, \nSenator Akaka, Senator Voinovich and their hardworking staffs for all \nthat they have done on this issue so we could introduce this bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SECURE Act \nof 2010--Supporting Employee Competency and Updating Readiness \nEnhancements. This bill would help to improve inadequate security at \ntoo many of our Federal buildings.\n  As a Nation, we have learned several hard truths: Terrorists are \nintent on attacking the United States, and their tactics continue to \nevolve. The early identification of a security gap can save countless \nlives if we act promptly to close it. There is no substitute for pre-\nemptive action to detect, disrupt, and defend against terrorist plots.\n  As we remember the lives lost when terrorists attacked the United \nStates 9 years ago, we must avoid complacency. Our country's defenses \nmust be nimble, multi-layered, informed by timely intelligence, and \ncoordinated across multiple agencies.\n  This is difficult work, requiring painstaking attention to detail and \nan unwavering focus. We must remain vigilant to the threats we face. \nUnfortunately, the evidence indicates that there are significant \nsecurity problems at Federal buildings, where thousands of employees \nserve thousands more of our citizens every work day.\n  The Federal Protective Service, FPS, is charged with securing nearly \n9,000 Federal facilities and protecting the government employees who \nwork in them, and the Americans who use them to access vital services.\n  But, independent investigations by the Government Accountability \nOffice and the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General have \ndocumented serious and systemic security flaws within the operations of \nthe FPS. These lapses place Federal employees and private citizens at \nrisk.\n  In June of last year, for example, GAO's undercover investigators \nsmuggled bomb-making materials into 10 Federal office buildings. Every \nsingle building GAO targeted was breached--a perfect record of security \nfailure. At each facility, concealed bomb components passed through \ncheckpoints monitored by FPS guards. Once inside, the covert GAO \ninvestigators were able to assemble the simulated explosive devices \nwithout interruption.\n\n  A July 2009 GAO report documented training flaws for FPS contract \nguards, some of whom failed to receive mandatory training on the \noperation of metal detectors and x-ray equipment. Other contract guards \nwere deficient in key certifications such as CPR, First Aid, and \nfirearms training. All told, GAO found that 62 percent of the FPS \ncontract guards it reviewed lacked valid certifications in one or more \nof these areas.\n  This review also found that FPS did little to ensure compliance with \nrules and regulations and failed to conduct inspections of guard posts \nafter regular business hours. When GAO investigators tested these \nposts, they found some guards sleeping on an overnight shift.\n  In another example, an inattentive guard allowed a baby in a carrier \nto pass through an x-ray machine on its conveyor belt. That guard was \nfired, but he ultimately won a lawsuit against the FPS because the \nagency could not document that he had received required training on the \nmachine.\n  A few months earlier, in April 2009, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Inspector General also found critical failings in the FPS \ncontract guard program. The Inspector General's recommendations \nincluded many concrete steps to strengthen contract guard performance, \nsuch as improving the award and management of contracts and increasing \nthe amount of training and number of compliance inspections.\n  These reports demonstrate that American taxpayers are simply not \nreceiving the security they have paid for and that they expect FPS to \nprovide. The reports also show the vulnerabilities facing Federal \nemployees and Federal infrastructure because of lax security.\n  While shining a light on these failings in multiple hearings, our \nCommittee pressed the FPS to take action to close these security gaps. \nAlthough some tentative steps have been taken by FPS, we can no longer \nwait for OMB and DHS to implement the absolutely critical security \nmeasures necessary to help protect our Federal buildings, our Federal \nemployees, and the American public.\n  The legislation that I introduce today, with Senators Lieberman, \nAkaka, and Voinovich, would help close these security gaps at our \nFederal buildings.\n  First, the bill would mandate the Interagency Security Committee, \nwhich was established by Executive Order 6 months after the Oklahoma \nCity bombing, to increase security standards at Federal facilities. The \nISC, comprised of representatives from agencies across the government, \nwould establish risk-based performance standards for the security of \nfederal buildings. FPS would then enforce these requirements based on \nthe risk tier assigned the facility by the ISC.\n\n  Prior reports clearly demonstrate that FPS lacks authority to require \ntenant agencies of a Federal facility to comply with recommended \nsecurity countermeasures.\n  For example, although FPS may ask tenant agencies to purchase or \nrepair security equipment like cameras and x-ray machines, based on the \nISC's recommended security countermeasures, these tenant agencies can \nrefuse to purchase or repair the equipment based on cost.\n  Since FPS has no enforcement mechanism, these machines are not \nupgraded, or remain inoperable, and security suffers. With so much at \nstake, tenant agencies should not be able to effectively overrule the \nsecurity experts on the ISC and at FPS.\n  To address this problem, our legislation would provide FPS the \nauthority needed to mandate the implementation of security measures at \na facility. FPS also would have the authority to inspect federal \nfacilities to enforce compliance.\n  The bill would allow the FPS Director to charge additional fees if \ntenant agencies fail to comply with applicable security standards. In \nsuch cases, the Secretary also must notify Congress of the non-\ncompliant facilities.\n  Our bill also would require an independent analysis of FPS's long-\nterm staffing needs.\n  The Government has an obligation to protect our Nation's security, \nand our Federal buildings are targets for violence.

Mr. LEVIN (for Mr. Durbin) proposed an amendment to the bill \nS. 624, to provide 100,000,000 people with first-time access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation on a sustainable basis by 2015 by \nimproving the capacity of the United States Government to fully \nimplement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005; as \nfollows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Water for \n     the World Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 \n     (Public Law 109-121)--\n       (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for \n     developing countries a specific policy objective of United \n     States foreign assistance programs;\n       (B) requires the Secretary of State to--\n       (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role of water and \n     sanitation policy; and\n       (ii) improve the effectiveness of United States assistance \n     programs undertaken in support of that strategy;\n       (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium \n     Development Goals; and\n       (D) seeks to reduce by half between 1990 (the baseline \n     year) and 2015--\n       (i) the proportion of people who are unable to reach or \n     afford safe drinking water; and\n       (ii) the proportion of people without access to basic \n     sanitation.\n       (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General \n     Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the \n     International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the \n     impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, \n     economic and social development, and the environment.\n       (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318, \n     which--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Sanitation; and\n       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public \n     health, poverty reduction, economic and social development, \n     and the environment.\n       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n     sanitation efforts--\n       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack \n     access to safe drinking water; and\n       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to \n     basic sanitation services.\n       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n     poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and\n       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n       (6) Water scarcity has negative consequences for \n     agricultural productivity and food security for the \n     1,200,000,000 people who, as of 2010, suffer from chronic \n     hunger and seriously threatens the ability of the world to \n     more than double food production to meet the demands of a \n     projected population of 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.\n       (7) According to the November 2008 report entitled, \n     ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National \n     Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future \n     population growth to exacerbate already limited access to \n     water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.\n       (8) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n     commissioned by the United Nations, more than \\1/5\\ of the \n     world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted \n     or excessively withdrawn.\n       (9) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n     instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n     the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n     has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic \n     groups and local farming communities.\n       (10) In order to further the United States contribution to \n     safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the \n     challenges described in this section; and\n       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the \n     highest levels of United States foreign assistance and \n     diplomatic deliberations, including those related to issues \n     of global health, food security, the environment, global \n     warming, and maternal and child mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     help undertake a global effort to bring sustainable access to \n     clean water and sanitation to poor people throughout the \n     world.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to enable first-time access to safe water and \n     sanitation, on a sustainable basis, for 100,000,000 people in \n     high priority countries (as designated under section 6(f) of \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2152h note) within 6 years of the date of enactment of \n     this Act through direct funding, development activities, and \n     partnerships; and\n       (2) to enhance the capacity of the United States Government \n     to fully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \n     Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n\n     SEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Water for \n     the World Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 \n     (Public Law 109-121)--\n       (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for \n     developing countries a specific policy objective of United \n     States foreign assistance programs;\n       (B) requires the Secretary of State to--\n       (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role of water and \n     sanitation policy; and\n       (ii) improve the effectiveness of United States assistance \n     programs undertaken in support of that strategy;\n       (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium \n     Development Goals; and\n       (D) seeks to reduce by half between 1990 (the baseline \n     year) and 2015--\n       (i) the proportion of people who are unable to reach or \n     afford safe drinking water; and\n       (ii) the proportion of people without access to basic \n     sanitation.\n       (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General \n     Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the \n     International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the \n     impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, \n     economic and social development, and the environment.\n       (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318, \n     which--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Sanitation; and\n       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public \n     health, poverty reduction, economic and social development, \n     and the environment.\n       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n     sanitation efforts--\n       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack \n     access to safe drinking water; and\n       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to \n     basic sanitation services.\n       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n     poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and\n       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n       (6) Water scarcity has negative consequences for \n     agricultural productivity and food security for the \n     1,200,000,000 people who, as of 2010, suffer from chronic \n     hunger and seriously threatens the ability of the world to \n     more than double food production to meet the demands of a \n     projected population of 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.\n       (7) The effects of climate change are expected to produce \n     severe consequences for water availability and resource \n     management in the future, with 2,800,000,000 people in more \n     than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water \n     shortages by 2025.\n       (8) According to the November 2008 report entitled, \n     ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National \n     Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future \n     population growth to exacerbate already limited access to \n     water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.\n       (9) A 2009 report published in the Proceedings of the \n     National Academy of Sciences projects that the effects of \n     climate change will produce long-term droughts and raise sea \n     levels for the next 1,000 years, regardless of future efforts \n     to combat climate change.\n       (10) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n     commissioned by the United Nations, more than \\1/5\\ of the \n     world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted \n     or excessively withdrawn.\n       (11) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n     instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n     the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n     has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic \n     groups and local farming communities.\n       (12) In order to further the United States contribution to \n     safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the \n     challenges described in this section; and\n       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the \n     highest levels of United States foreign assistance and \n     diplomatic deliberations, including those related to issues \n     of global health, food security, the environment, global \n     warming, and maternal and child mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     lead a global effort to bring sustainable access to clean \n     water and sanitation to poor people throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to enable first-time access to safe water and \n     sanitation, on a sustainable basis, for 100,000,000 people in \n     high priority countries (as designated under section 6(f) of \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2152h note) within 6 years of the date of enactment of \n     this Act through direct funding, development activities, and \n     partnerships; and\n       (2) to enhance the capacity of the United States Government \n     to fully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \n     Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n\n     SEC. 5. DEVELOPING UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CAPACITY.\n\n       Section 135 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2152h) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Senior Advisor for Water.--\n       ``(1) In general.--To carry out the purposes of subsection \n     (a), the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development shall designate a senior advisor to \n     coordinate and conduct the activities described in this \n     section and the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of \n     2005 (Public Law 109-121).

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for each of the 6 fiscal years beginning after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act such sums as may be necessary to \n     carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, \n     pursuant to the criteria set forth in the Senator Paul Simon \n     Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n       (b) Use of Funds.--Any amounts appropriated to implement \n     this Act shall be primarily allocated for activities related \n     to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, with the passage of the Paul Simon \nWater for the World Act, the Senate will take an important step in \nfighting poverty and saving the lives of the world's poor by increasing \naccess to the most fundamental human need--clean water.\n  I introduced this bill in honor of my friend and mentor, the man \nwhose seat I now occupy in the Senate, the late Senator Paul Simon. \nSolving the global water crisis was his last great campaign and the \ntopic of a book he authored called ``Tapped Out: The Coming World \nCrisis in Water and What We Can Do About It.''\n  If he were here today, he would be proud of the Senate's action.\n  I was joined in this effort by Senators Bob Corker, Patty Murray and \n31 other cosponsors from both sides of the aisle--and would like to \nthank all of them for their support and commitment to addressing one of \nthe defining challenges of the 21st century.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Tom Coburn for working \nconstructively with me to advance legislation that we both could agree \nupon. And finally I would like to express my appreciation to Foreign \nRelations Committee Chairman John Kerry and Ranking Member Richard \nLugar for their critical support of this bill.\n  While we have made progress in recent years on clean water and \nsanitation, tragically nearly 1 billion people around the world still \nlack access to clean, safe water. More than 2 billion people lack \naccess to basic sanitation. Most of these people live on less than $2 a \nday.\n  They are the voiceless and the powerless of the world, but today the \nU.S. Senate sent a clear message to them, ``We hear you, we see what \nyou're going through, and we want to help with this most basic of human \nneeds.''\n  We want to help because the global water crisis is not just a problem \nfor Africa or the Middle East, but rather a problem for all of \nhumanity.\n  Mr. President, competition for water is often at the heart of \ninternational conflict--just look at the conflict in Darfur.\n  The burdens of water in the developing world fall most solidly on the \nwomen. So many thousands of women in Africa spend hours every day \ncarrying water back and forth.\n  Young girls are often denied the opportunity to go to school because \nthey have work to do. They have to carry water, often walking several \nhours both ways.\n  And sick children miss nearly 300 million school days a year from \nwater-related causes. An estimated 320 million productive work days are \nlost to illness resulting from unsafe drinking water and lack of access \nto sanitation.\n  Quite simply, the global water crisis is a quiet killer. In the \ndeveloping world, water-related diseases claim the lives of 5,000 \nchildren every day.\n  During my trips overseas, I have seen the hardships that befall \npopulations without clean water and sanitation, and I've also seen the \ntransformation that gaining access to these basic human needs creates.\n  Earlier this year I traveled to Africa with Senator Sherrod Brown \nwhere we visited a number of countries, including Ethiopia. We visited \na slum outside Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, where we were greeted by \ntwo beautiful little girls who gave us flowers and invited us to a \ncoffee ceremony.\n\n  The 380 inhabitants of this area lived without running water until a \nnongovernmental organization called AMREF installed a simple but \ncritical water kiosk that now provides safe drinking water, showers, \ntoilet facilities, and even jobs to the community.\n  The same two girls who greeted us beamed with pride as we looked at \nthe source of water and sanitation that did not exist before. What \nseems so ordinary to us in the developed world, access to water and \nsanitation, changed the lives of these two young girls living in \nsqualor outside Addis Ababa.\n  But you do not have to travel halfway around the world to see the \ndevastating consequences of a lack of clean water and sanitation--\ntravel just 90 minutes from Miami to Haiti.\n  There are no public sewage treatment or disposal systems anywhere in \nthe country. Even in the capital, Port-au-Prince, a city of 2 million \npeople, the drainage canals are choked with garbage and sewage.\n  And this was before the earthquake.\n  It is no wonder that Haiti has the highest infant and child mortality \nrate in the Western Hemisphere. One-third of Haiti's children do not \nlive to see the age of five.\n  The leading killer? Water-borne diseases: hepatitis, typhoid and \ndiarrhea.\n  The goal of the bill passed today is to reach an additional 100 \nmillion of the world's poorest people with sustainable, first-time \naccess to safe drinking water and basic sanitation over the next 6 \nyears.\n  This would represent the largest single commitment of any donor \ncountry to meeting the Millennium Development Goal on water, which is \nto reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation by 2015.\n  I believe American leadership in helping provide the world's poor \nwith such a fundamental human need as clean water is not only the right \nthing to do, but the smart thing to do.\n  In fact, for every $1 invested in safe drinking water and sanitation, \nan estimated $8 is saved in work time, productivity and health care \ncosts in poor countries.\n  Throughout history, civilized nations have put aside political \ndifferences to address compelling issues of life and survival. Today, \non this issue, by passing the Paul Simon Water for the World Act, the \nSenate did just that.\n  I now urge my colleagues in the House to work with Representatives \nEarl Blumenauer and Donald Payne, House Foreign Affairs Committee \nChairman Howard Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and \nSpeaker Pelosi to do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute amendment be considered; that a Durbin amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, be agreed to; that the substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third \ntime and passed; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate; and that any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
