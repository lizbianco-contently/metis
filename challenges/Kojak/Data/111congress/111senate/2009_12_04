Mr. President, the amendment process continues to crawl \nforward, and this historic health reform bill continues to evolve and \nimprove. This is a good bill. It saves lives, saves money, and saves \nMedicare. It makes health insurance more affordable, makes health \ninsurance companies more accountable, and makes our economy stronger. \nThe Democrats know we can make it even better. This is happening \nbecause of the dedicated hard work from throughout the Democratic \ncaucus--from veteran Senators and newer Senators, by the hands of men \nand women from diverse parts of the country and good public servants \nfrom all points of the political spectrum.\n  Senator Mikulski of Maryland, who for decades has been a champion for \nwomen's health, made it better by making sure women can get the \nmammograms, the checkups and preventive care they need to stay healthy \nand get them at no cost.\n  Senator Bennet of Colorado, who has served skillfully in this body \nfor less than a year, made it better by reaffirming our commitment to \nMedicare. He made it better by ensuring seniors get the care they need \nand the quality of life they deserve.\n  That positive trend will continue today. Senator Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland, who came to Congress with a class of Senators elected with a \nstrong mandate to change the way Washington works, has proposed an \namendment based on common sense and accountability. It says the money \ndedicated to the health care of American seniors and of people with \ndisabilities should be used only for those precise purposes.\n\n[[Page S12356]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are less interested in solving \nproblems than they are in creating them. The day before this floor \ndebate began, the assistant Republican leader--the junior Senator from \nArizona--said: ``There is no way to fix this bill.'' Of course, that is \nabsolutely totally wrong.\n  All Senators know there is a reliable way to improve legislation--to \nimprove this bill. It has been in use for 220 years. It is called the \nlegislative process. It is called doing our job.\n  As this bill continues to improve, I, once again, remind my \ncolleagues not to lose sight of the bigger picture. As we delve into \nthe details and debate the fine print, let us not forget why we are \nhere. Our goal remains the same it was the day we began this debate \nmany months ago. It remains the same as it was a year and a half ago, \nwhen Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus first held a series \nof hearings that led to the legislation that is now before us.\n  Our goal remains the same as it was last November when the American \npeople called in a loud and clear voice for change. It remains the same \nas it did 31 years ago, when Senator Ted Kennedy called it shameful \nthat ``in our unbelievably rich land, the quality of health care \navailable to many of our people is unbelievably poor, and the cost is \nunbelievably high.''\n  It remains the same as it did the day President Truman sounded a call \nto action to ensure that American families are protected from what he \ncalled ``the economic effects of sickness.'' That was more than 64 \nyears ago, and more than half of today's Senators weren't even born \nthen. That constant goal has been and remains this: We must make it \npossible for every American--each and every American--to afford to live \na healthy life.\n  Each moment in this fight is historic. No bill to put health care \ndecisions in the hands of the people has ever come this far. But the \nmost historic days of the journey lie ahead. We can only seize that \nopportunity if this debate is about facts, not about fear.\n  I remind my colleagues that if we are to truly help the American \npeople and the American economy, if we are to sincerely do the work our \nneighbors sent us to do, if we are to leave our children and \ngrandchildren a better inheritance than a deep deficit and a broken \nhealth care system--if we are to do any of these things--we must work \ntogether and not against each other. We must work as partners, not as \npartisans.\n  This is not the first time I have asked my Republican friends to \nthink of the real families across this Nation who face real problems--\nfamilies with real diseases, real sicknesses, real medical bills, and \nreal fears. It is not the first time I have warned that America has no \nplace for those who hope for failure.\n  This is not the first time I have extended my hand across the aisle \nand asked my Republican friends to abandon their shortsighted strategy \nto bring the Senate to a screeching halt; for example, issuing an \ninformational guide on how to stop and slow things. That doesn't work. \nWe need a strategy that says we can win because that will mean the \nAmerican people do not lose.\n  So I hope that, for the first time, we will have people of good will \non the Republican side of this Chamber who will walk over and say: \nLet's work together to get some things done. I have had a couple good \nconversations the last few days with some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I hope we can move forward. This is a bill that \ndoesn't look at a person who is sick or hurt or afraid as being a \nDemocrat or a Republican or an Independent. They are Americans. They \nare from Virginia, Montana, Nevada and from all over America and they \nare people who are calling upon us to do the right thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12356-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we had a very clarifying vote on the \nSenate floor about the direction of our friends on the other side with \nregard to our health care system. Yesterday, all but two of them voted \nto preserve nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare, the health \nprogram for our seniors. In the runup to that vote, they said these \ncuts were not cuts and that Medicare Advantage in particular is not a \npart of Medicare, arguments plainly contradicted by the text of the \nbill itself, by the Department of Health and Human Services, by the \nindependent Congressional Budget Office, and by the experience of \nseniors themselves.\n  Seniors do not want Senators fooling with Medicare. Let me say that \nagain. Seniors do not want Senators fooling with Medicare. They want us \nto fix it, to strengthen it, to preserve it for future generations--not \nraid it like a giant piggy bank in order to create some entirely new \ngovernment program.\n  Yesterday's vote was particularly distressing for the nearly 11 \nmillion seniors on Medicare Advantage. So today Members will have an \nopportunity to undo the damage they voted to do to this program. With \nyesterday's vote, proponents of this measure authorized $120 billion in \ncuts to Medicare Advantage and in the process they expressly voted to \nviolate the President's pledge that seniors who like the plans they \nhave can keep them. The President has said seniors who like the plans \nthey have can keep them--because you can't cut $120 billion from a \nbenefits program, obviously, without cutting benefits.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has been crystal clear on this \nmatter. When asked about the effect these cuts would have on Medicare \nAdvantage, the Director of CBO was unequivocal. He said that \napproximately half of Medicare Advantage benefits will be cut for \nnearly 11 million seniors enrolled in this program under this bill.\n  This is the Director of the Congressional Budget Office being \nunequivocal. He said that approximately half of Medicare Advantage \nbenefits will be cut for nearly 11 million seniors enrolled in this \nprogram under this bill. That is what our friends on the other side \nvoted for yesterday and they know it.\n  One Democrat last night was explicit. He admitted that after \nyesterday's votes, Democrats will not be able to say that ``if you like \nwhat you have you can keep it.'' This is one of our Democrat colleagues \nyesterday saying: ``If you like what you have you can keep it'' can no \nlonger be said.\n  He went on to say ``that basic commitment that a lot of us around \nhere have made will be called into question.'' I think that is highly \nlikely.\n  Our friends have a couple of choices here today. They can reaffirm \ntheir plan to cut benefits for nearly one-fourth of all seniors \nenrolled in Medicare, they can admit that the President's pledge about \nkeeping the plan you like no longer applies, or they can reverse part \nof yesterday's vote later today by voting with Republicans to restore \nthose cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12356-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Also pending is a motion to commit by the Senator from \nUtah on Medicare Advantage. It would be my hope that the Senate will \nvote on these matters today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 a.m. will be for \ndebate only with the time equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first \nportion of time.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, experts and economists of every political \nstripe agree that preserving America's long-term economic security \nmeans reforming the way we provide and pay for health care. Health care \nspending makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy. Future generations can \nexpect the burden of insurmountable debt if we fail to act.\n  The fiscal challenges we may face in years to come pale in comparison \nto the threat of uncontrolled Federal health care spending. The chart \nbehind me essentially shows that. The chart shows the percentage annual \ngrowth rates beginning in 2004. The red is the economy, the blue is \nhealth care costs. Clearly, over time, especially as the economy dipped \nduring this great recession, the gap between economic growth and health \ncare spending has widened. Projections are that in future years they \nwill widen more and more. As you can see out to 2018, the total economy \nis projected. Near 2018 the economy is above 4 percent and health care \nspending is 7 or 8 percent.\n  Doing nothing means health care spending continues to grow faster \nthan our economy. That is what that chart shows quite dramatically. \nDoing nothing means entitlement spending more than doubles by the year \n2050. That is taking one-fifth of our gross domestic product.\n  But it is not simply the Federal budget on the line, it is the family \nbudget too. Incredibly, in total we are spending 80 times as much on \nhealth care today as we did five decades ago--80 times more on health \ncare today than we did five decades ago. Now family budgets are \nbreaking under the strain--already. That is going to get worse if we do \nnothing. The cost of the average family health care plan will reach \n$24,000 in the year 2016. That is not too many years away from now. \nThis represents an 84-percent increase over 2008 premium levels. That \nmeans, if we do nothing, in fewer than 10 years most families would \nhave to dedicate half of their household budget to health insurance. \nFor years we have heard the warnings from Federal budget experts. Now \nwe are hearing every day from folks back home who simply cannot afford \nthe care they need.\n  We have an obligation to act. Now we have an opportunity to act. The \ncountry's leading economists and Federal budget experts laid out \nstrategies and options for getting costs under control. We have taken \ntheir recommendations to heart. There is a lot of agreement among those \nwho study these issues of what we must do. Now we have a bill that does \nwhat they suggest. It also passes the test of fiscal responsibility.\n  We have many reasons to vote for this bill. It protects and even \nincreases Medicare benefits for seniors. It achieves near universal \ncoverage in less than 10 years. That means it achieves the goal of \nvirtually everybody having health insurance in that period of time. It \nslows the growth of Federal health care spending. It stops insurance \nindustry discrimination and, based on independent, nonpartisan \nanalysis, makes a serious dent in our Federal deficit.\n  This chart behind me represents what 2 weeks ago the Congressional \nBudget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed in no uncertain \nterms, that deficits go down under this plan. The official cost \nestimate reads as follows:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Tax estimates that on balance the direct spending and revenue \n     effects of enacting this Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act legislation would yield a net reduction in Federal \n     deficits of $130 billion over the years 2010 to 2019. That is \n     represented by the green bar on the left. It is a net $130 \n     billion reduction during the first 10 years of this bill.\n\n  In addition to reducing the Federal deficit, in the first decade, the \nCBO also tells us that the bill decreases the deficit by a much greater \namount, by $650 billion, in the second decade.\n  According to the CBO, this bill also slows the growth of Medicare \ncosts, which has been a principal goal in our Medicare debate since day \none. Medicare spending would grow 6 percent annually instead of 8 \npercent annually. In other words, Medicare would continue to grow but, \nunlike today, it will grow at a sustainable rate.\n  Of course, no projections, even from the Congressional Budget Office, \ncan be certain. We can safely say this bill will put us on the right \ntrack. We can safely say this bill is better than doing nothing. No \nhonest assessment challenges the case for acting now to slow the growth \nof Federal spending. No honest assessment challenges the case. And no \nhonest assessment of this bill challenges the CBO analysis. I have not \nheard one. I have not heard an honest challenge to the CBO analysis, \nnor have I heard of a good, honest case for not acting now to slow the \ngrowth of Federal spending, which means we have many reasons to pass \nhealth care reform, not the least of which is the long-term financial \nhealth of the economy and our Nation. But the reasons for passing this \nare much more than simply facts and figures. This is about Americans \nfrom every corner of this great country, struggling to make ends meet, \nforced into bankruptcy by medical tragedy. This is about stopping \ninsurance industry discrimination; this is about saving Medicare for \nour seniors and reducing the deficit for our grandchildren.\n  I don't know which other Senators wish to speak. Senator Bingaman \nwishes to gain recognition in the time we have.\n  Let me ascertain how much time we have and how many speakers we have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 40 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Baucus for his \nleadership on this issue. I have mentioned to him many times that I \nstrongly believe without his leadership, we would not be where we are \ntoday in our effort to reform health care. I congratulate him on the \nsuperb effort he has made.\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about health care reform both \nas it affects the country but also as it affects my home State of New \nMexico. First, I would like to discuss the context for this health \nreform bill, and that is the very serious problem we face in the \ncountry with the growing cost of health care, if the Congress fails to \nact. We have a chart I will put up, since everyone has charts. This is \na chart that shows what is happening to all health care costs and has \nbeen happening since 1960. We can see that as a percent of the gross \ndomestic product, back in 1960 we were spending right at 5 percent of \nGDP on all health care. Today we are spending much more like 16 percent \nof the gross domestic product on health care. The projections for the \nfuture, if we do not act to reform the health care system, are very \nserious indeed.\n  Let me allude to an article in the morning New York Times. This is by \nNobel award-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University. He \ntalks about this issue of fiscal responsibility and the impact of \nhealth care reform on the deficit. It talks about how some Senators \nhave concerns about going ahead with this health care reform bill \nbecause of what it might cost. He makes the point:\n\n       But if they're really concerned with fiscal responsibility, \n     they shouldn't be worried about what would happen if health \n     reform passes. They should, instead, be worried about what \n     would happen if it doesn't pass. For America can't get \n     control of its budget without controlling health care costs--\n     and this is our last, best chance to deal with these costs in \n     a rational way.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full column from the New York Times\n\n[[Page S12358]]\n\nof this morning be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As this chart demonstrates, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, if we don't act to deal with the growth in \nhealth care costs, Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid combined \nwill grow from 5 percent of GDP today to almost 10 percent by 2035. By \n2080, the government would be spending almost as much as a share of the \neconomy on just its two major health care programs as it has spent on \nall of its programs and services in recent years.\n  Let me put up another chart that demonstrates that most of this \nincrease in cost is not the result of our aging population. We do have \nan aging population; that does add to the cost of health care because \nas people get older they tend to need more health care. The dark blue \nshows the increase expected in health care costs by virtue of aging. \nBut the lighter blue talks about the effect of excess cost growth that \nis not related to aging; that is, the growth in health care cost is out \nof control in our current system. Such spending is unsustainable. It \nhas led the Congressional Budget Office to say:\n\n       Slowing the growth rate of outlays for Medicare and \n     Medicaid is the central long-term challenge for fiscal \n     policy.\n\n  Moreover, across the country, premiums continue to increase. They are \nbecoming more and more unaffordable for individuals and for businesses. \nI hear on a regular basis when I go around New Mexico--and I am sure \nall my colleagues hear from their constituents as they travel in their \nStates--that people cannot continue to pay more and more each year for \ntheir health care coverage. According to an August report by the \nCommonwealth Fund, nationally, family premiums for employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance increased 119 percent between 1999 and 2008. If cost \ngrowth continues on its current course, those premiums could increase \nanother 94 percent to an average of $23,842 per family by 2020. I am \nnot sure what the circumstance is in many States, but I know in New \nMexico there are many families who cannot afford to pay $23,800 in \nhealth care premiums.\n  Nowhere is the unsustainable growth felt more acutely than in my home \nState. Without health reform, in my State we are projected to \nexperience the greatest increase in health insurance premiums of any \nState in the Union. For example, the average employer-sponsored \ninsurance premium for a family in New Mexico was about $6,000 in the \nyear 2000. By 2006, this rate had almost doubled, or the cost had \nalmost doubled to $11,000. By 2016, the amount is expected to rise to \nan astonishing $28,000. In addition, health insurance premiums in New \nMexico make up a larger percentage of New Mexico's income, the income \nof the average New Mexico family, than almost all other States. We are \npaying 31.18 percent. Over 31 percent of the average income of a family \nin New Mexico is going to pay for health care. This is expected to grow \nto 56 percent if we do not reform our health care system.\n  It is important to highlight that the higher spending on health care \nin the United States does not necessarily prolong lives. I hear a lot \nof speeches about how we have the greatest health care system in the \nworld. We are the envy of the world. People would just love to have \naccess to our health care system. This chart illustrates that in 2000, \nthe United States spent more on health care than any other country in \nthe world, an average of $4,500 per person. That was in 2000. \nSwitzerland was the second highest at $3,300, substantially less. \nEssentially, its cost per person was 71 percent of what it was in the \nUnited States during that year. Nevertheless, the average U.S. life \nexpectancy comes out at 27th in the world. Our life expectancy average \nis 77 years. Many countries, 26 to be exact, achieve higher life \nexpectancy rates with significantly lower spending on health care.\n  Data from the McKinsey Global Institute clearly indicates there is a \nconsiderable level of waste in our current system. McKinsey estimates \nthat the United States spends nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion annually in excess \nof other similarly situated nations. Of this, about $224 billion in \nexcess costs are found in hospital care. About $178 billion are found \nin outpatient care. Together these account for more than 80 percent of \nU.S. spending above the levels of other nations.\n  Here is one other chart. This is one I have used before on the Senate \nfloor. Not surprisingly, as costs and inefficiencies continue to build, \naccess to health care is becoming more and more difficult for middle- \nand lower-income Americans. This chart indicates the rate of \nuninsurance throughout the country. First, on the left-hand side is the \nyear 2000; on the right-hand side is 2008. We can see the dark blue \nStates are States where 23 percent or more of the population ages 18 to \n64 are uninsured. Back in the year 2000, New Mexico and Texas were the \nonly two States where the rate of uninsurance exceeded 23 percent. Now \nwe can see the rate of uninsurance exceeds 23 percent for many of the \nStates, particularly across the southern part of the country.\n  We have a very serious problem that needs addressing. It is clear \nthat the U.S. health care system is failing many Americans. The \nsituation is becoming more and more urgent. According to a study \npublished by the Harvard Medical School in August, medical costs have \nled to almost two-thirds of the bankruptcies in this country. More than \n26 percent of bankruptcies are attributable to health care problems. \nThe study found that most medical debtors were well educated, owned \ntheir own homes, had middle-class occupations and, shockingly, three \nquarters had health insurance. So these were people who had coverage, \nbut the coverage was not adequate to meet the needs. Unfortunately, for \nmany individuals, the very high cost of medical care leads them to \ndelay or to avoid receiving medical care altogether.\n  The Urban Institute reports that 137,000 people in this country died \nbetween 2000 and 2006 because they lacked health insurance. That \nincludes 22,000 people in 2006. Clearly, the need for national health \nreform has never been so great.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the legislation we \nare debating, introduced by Senator Reid and others a few weeks ago, \nincludes the key reforms we have come up with and that the experts have \ncome up with, aimed at addressing these very serious problems, while \nprotecting the aspects of our health system that are working today.\n  First, this bill includes long-overdue reforms to increase the \nefficiency and quality of the health care system while reducing overall \ncost. For example, the legislation includes payment reforms that I have \nchampioned to shift from a fee-for-service payment system to a bundled \npayment system. This will reshape our health care reimbursement system \nto reward better care and not simply more care as it currently does \ntoday.\n  Second, it includes a broad new framework to ensure that all \nAmericans have access to quality and affordable health care. This \nincludes creation of a new health insurance exchange in each State \nwhich will provide Americans a centralized source of meaningful private \ninsurance as well as refundable tax credits to ensure that coverage is \naffordable.\n  Finally, these new health insurance exchanges will help improve \nchoices by allowing families and businesses to compare insurance plans \non the basis of price and performance. This puts families, rather than \nthe insurance companies or the government bureaucrats, in charge of \nhealth care. It helps people to decide which quality, affordable \ninsurance option is right for them.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which is cited here--quite frankly, \nI notice that the Congressional Budget Office is cited by both \nDemocrats and the Republicans in this debate, and that is a credit to \nthe CBO. They are seen as nonpartisan, and they are nonpartisan. I \ncongratulate Doug Elmendorf for the good work CBO has been doing in \nsupport of our efforts to come to the right answer on health care \nreform--the CBO forecasts that this legislation would not add to the \ndeficit.\n  As the chart Senator Baucus had a few minutes ago clearly indicates, \nthe deficit would be reduced in the first 10 years by $130 billion. It \nwould be reduced in the second 10 years, going up to 2029, by something \nover $600 billion.\n  Let me also point out the contrast. We are talking about a bill which \nthe\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office says will reduce the size of the deficit in \nfuture decades. I can remember a couple Congresses ago when we had a \ndebate on adding subpart D to Medicare, Part D to Medicare. There are \nmany on the floor who are concerned about cost today--at least they say \nso in their speeches--who were very anxious to add that legislation to \nMedicare, adding another $500 billion. That was estimated by the CBO at \nthat time: another $500 billion over a 10-year period to the cost that \nMedicare was bearing.\n  The efforts we are making in this legislation to bring under control \nthe cost growth in Medicare is essential if we are going to keep \nMedicare solvent in the future, and part of the solvency problem \nMedicare has in the future, frankly, is related to what we did in \nsubpart D.\n  On the subject of premium cost, CBO has also found that in the \nindividual market, the amount that subsidized enrollees would pay for \nnon coverage would be roughly 56 percent to 59 percent lower, on \naverage, than the premiums charged in the individual market under \ncurrent law. Among enrollees in the individual market who would not \nreceive new subsidies, average premiums would increase by less than 10 \nto 13 percent. The legislation would have smaller effects on premiums \nfor employment-based coverage. Its greatest impact would be on smaller \nemployers qualifying for new health insurance tax credits. For these \nbusinesses and their employees, CBO predicts premiums would decrease by \nabout 8 percent to 11 percent compared with their costs under current \nlaw.\n  This is consistent with estimates of the impact in my home State of \nNew Mexico, where average families may see a decrease in premiums of as \nmuch as 60 percent. In addition, about two-thirds of New Mexicans could \npotentially qualify for subsidies or Medicaid and nearly a quarter \nwould qualify for near full subsidies or Medicaid.\n  An overall decrease in premium costs also is consistent with the \nexperience in Massachusetts where there has been an enormous reduction \nin the cost of nongroup insurance in the State after they enacted \nsimilar reform to what we are considering now in the Senate. After \nreform the average individual premium in Massachusetts fell from $8537 \nat the end of 2006 to $5143 in mid-2009, a 40 percent reduction while \nthe rest of the Nation was seeing a 14 percent increase.\n  Finally, much of the debate on health care reform has focused on \ninsurance coverage but it is important to recognize that as we expand \ncoverage to include more Americans, the demand for health care services \nwill also increase. A strong health care workforce is therefore \nessential for successful health reform. Within the United States, \napproximately 25 percent of counties are designated health professions \nshortage areas--a measure indicating that there is insufficient medical \nstaff to properly serve that geographic area. The problem is even more \napparent in rural States such as New Mexico. For example, 32 out of 33 \ncounties in my State has this shortage designation. As a result, New \nMexico ranks last compared to all other states with regard to both \naccess to health care and utilization of preventative medicine.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act we are debating \ncontains key provisions to improve access and delivery of health care \nservices throughout the Nation. These provisions include increasing the \nsupply of physicians, nurses, and other health care providers; \nenhancing workforce education and training; and providing support to \nthe existing workforce.\n  I applaud Senators Reid, Baucus, Dodd, Harkin, and many other \ncolleagues who have worked so hard on this bill. This legislation \nrepresents true healthcare reform. It is time for the Senate to put \npartisanship aside and enact this critical and long overdue \nlegislation.\n  I see my time is up and there are others waiting to speak. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 4, 2009]\n\n                             Reform Or Else\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Health care reform hangs in the balance. Its fate rests \n     with a handful of ``centrist'' senators--senators who claim \n     to be mainly worried about whether the proposed legislation \n     is fiscally responsible.\n       But if they're really concerned with fiscal responsibility, \n     they shouldn't be worried about what would happen if health \n     reform passes. They should, instead, be worried about what \n     would happen if it doesn't pass. For America can't get \n     control of its budget without controlling health care costs--\n     and this is our last, best chance to deal with these costs in \n     a rational way.\n       Some background: Long-term fiscal projections for the \n     United States, paint a grim picture. Unless there are major \n     policy changes, expenditure will consistently grow faster \n     than revenue, eventually leading to a debt crisis.\n       What's behind these projections? An aging population, which \n     will raise the cost of Social Security, is part of the story. \n     But the main driver of future deficits is the ever-rising \n     cost of Medicare and Medicaid. If health care costs rise in \n     the future as they have in the past, fiscal catastrophe \n     awaits.\n       You might think, given this picture, that extending \n     coverage to those who would otherwise be uninsured would \n     exacerbate the problem. But you'd be wrong, for two reasons.\n       First, the uninsured in America are, on average, relatively \n     young and healthy; covering them wouldn't raise overall \n     health care costs very much.\n       Second, the proposed health care reform links the expansion \n     of coverage to serious cost-control measures for Medicare. \n     Think of it as a grand bargain: coverage for (almost) \n     everyone, tied to an effort to ensure that health care \n     dollars are well spent.\n       Are we talking about real savings, or just window dressing? \n     Well, the health care economists I respect are seriously \n     impressed by the cost-control measures in the Senate bill, \n     which include efforts to improve incentives for cost-\n     effective care, the use of medical research to guide doctors \n     toward treatments that actually work, and more. This is ``the \n     best effort anyone has made,'' says Jonathan Gruber of the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A letter signed by 23 \n     prominent health care experts--including Mark McClellan, who \n     headed Medicare under the Bush administration--declares that \n     the bill's cost-control measures ``will reduce long-term \n     deficits.''\n       The fact that we're seeing the first really serious attempt \n     to control health care costs as part of a bill that tries to \n     cover the uninsured seems to confirm what would-be reformers \n     have been saying for years: The path to cost control runs \n     through universality. We can only tackle out-of-control costs \n     as part of a deal that also provides Americans with the \n     security of guaranteed health care.\n       That observation in itself should make anyone concerned \n     with fiscal responsibility support this reform. Over the next \n     decade, the Congressional Budget Office has concluded, the \n     proposed legislation would reduce, not increase, the budget \n     deficit. And by giving us a chance, finally, to rein in the \n     ever-growing spending of Medicare, it would greatly improve \n     our long-run fiscal prospects.\n       But there's another reason failure to pass reform would be \n     devastating--namely, the nature of the opposition.\n       The Republican campaign against health care reform has \n     rested in part on the traditional arguments, arguments that \n     go back to the days when Ronald Reagan was trying to scare \n     Americans into opposing Medicare--denunciations of \n     ``socialized medicine,'' claims that universal health \n     coverage is the road to tyranny, etc.\n       But in the closing rounds of the health care fight, the \n     G.O.P. has focused more and more on an effort to demonize \n     cost-control efforts. The Senate bill would impose \n     ``draconian cuts'' on Medicare, says Senator John McCain, who \n     proposed much deeper cuts just last year as part of his \n     presidential campaign. ``If you're a senior and you're on \n     Medicare, you better be afraid of this bill,'' says Senator \n     Tom Coburn.\n       If these tactics work, and health reform fails, think of \n     the message this would convey: It would signal that any \n     effort to deal with the biggest budget problem we face will \n     be successfully played by political opponents as an attack on \n     older Americans. It would be a long time before anyone was \n     willing to take on the challenge again; remember that after \n     the failure of the Clinton effort, it was 16 years before the \n     next try at health reform.\n       That's why anyone who is truly concerned about fiscal \n     policy should be anxious to see health reform succeed. If it \n     fails, the demagogues will have soon, and we probably won't \n     deal with our biggest fiscal problem until we're forced into \n     action by a nasty debt crisis.\n       So to the centrists still sitting on the fence over health \n     reform: If you care about fiscal responsibility, you better \n     be afraid of what will happen if reform fails.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains under the control of \nthe majority?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-four minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We might be able to find extra time, too, if the Senator \nis looking for extra time. Right now, according to the number of \nSenators who\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\nwant to speak, that is all we have in this first block. But sometimes \nwe can work things out--if the Senator wants to talk a little longer. \nBut right now it is 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2870\n\n  Mr. President, today in the United States of America, approximately \n200 million of our citizens are elderly or disabled. These are not mere \nstatistics. They are family members and loved ones--vulnerable, \nchallenged, and often forgotten. But they were not forgotten by their \nfriend and advocate, Senator Ted Kennedy. He understood a fair and \ncivilized society should be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Sadly, millions of seniors and persons living with disabilities \nstruggle to obtain the services and supports they need to live \nfulfilling lives and to remain in their communities among their friends \nand families--in what they hoped would be their productive golden \nyears.\n  As Senator Kennedy understood, it is morally wrong for so many \ndisabled men and women who need assistance to be forced to face the \nheartbreaking choices: Do I abandon my job, spend down my savings, move \nout of my home, give up my American dream in order to qualify for \nMedicaid, the only government program that can provide me with the \nsupports I need, or do I forgo my independence and resign myself to \nliving the rest of my life confined to a facility?\n  Senator Kennedy also understood it is morally wrong when that infirm \nor elderly individual's friends or loved ones must also face \nheartbreaking choices: Do I give up my job and commit my time to care \nfor my infirm parent at the expense of my own family and children or do \nI resign myself to confining my aging mother or father to a facility?\n  Families across this country understand this heart-wrenching crisis \nall too well. A recent SCAN poll found that nearly 60 percent of those \nsurveyed had a personal experience with long-term care. As this chart \ndemonstrates, nearly 80 percent would be more likely to support health \ncare reform if--if--it included a long-term care program. These \nfamilies know the current long-term care industry is not meeting their \ncurrent needs and that change must come.\n  As always, Senator Kennedy cared how our society would be judged. He \ndid not just sit by. He acted. He drafted the Community Living \nAssistance Services and Supports Act, known as the CLASS Act, which we \nare debating this morning. This program was at the heart of his effort \nto help people with functional limitations and their families to obtain \nthe services and supports they need. It gives them the chance to \nmaintain their independence and remain active, productive members of \ntheir communities.\n  Under the CLASS Act, a worker in Massachusetts, or any other State, \ncan choose to pay a premium into this voluntary insurance program \nthrough affordable payroll deductions. After contributing for 5 years, \nthey become eligible for a cash benefit of at least $50 a day if they \nbecome disabled. That cash benefit can make the difference in allowing \na disabled person to live with independence, self-respect, and dignity.\n  For example, it can pay for having a ramp installed to their home or \nto pay for needed transportation or to purchase a computer to work from \nhome and remain self-sufficient. It can also pay for a caregiver to \ncome to their home, help them bathe, get dressed, and cook meals--\nservices that otherwise often fall to family and friends who are forced \nto work reduced hours on their own jobs or quit those jobs altogether \nto provide that needed care.\n  Currently, long-term care, as we know it, is paid for through a \nfragmented combination of sources, including family budgets, Medicaid, \nMedicare, and private insurance. Without a prior and voluntary \ninsurance investment, which the CLASS Act offers, paying for long-term \ncare can be financially catastrophic for many individuals and families, \nsince home care and nursing homes can cost over $70,000 a year.\n  Only one in five individuals can afford private long-term care \ninsurance, and many are excluded because of preexisting conditions. \nMedicare's role in providing long-term services is extremely limited, \ncovering only short-term skilled nursing care and home health. This \nlack of options forces many people to turn to Medicaid, which is our \nNation's primary payer and only safety net program providing \ncomprehensive long-term care services and supports.\n  But who is eligible for Medicaid? People only qualify for Medicaid if \nthey are or become poor. This criterion forces many families to \nimpoverish themselves to obtain the Medicaid support they need. We have \nall heard the stories: The family member works hard all his or her \nlife, and then due to an accident they cannot afford to pay for needed \nservices and supports out of their pocket. So they now must give up \ntheir savings to become eligible to turn to the government and to \nMedicaid to provide the proper care they need to survive. No one wins--\nnot the disabled or elderly parent, not the family caregiver, not the \ngovernment, and not Medicaid.\n  I have a letter from a woman who lives on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. \nShe knows firsthand how powerful the CLASS Act could be for families. \nJerilyn has been caring for her sister who is brain damaged, legally \nblind, paralyzed, and incontinent. Jerilyn writes:\n\n       Caring for my sister at home has saved the state thousands \n     and thousands of dollars every year and we have done this \n     care for 38 years. We fight every year to get sufficient \n     hours for PCA care with Mass Health. We are holding down full \n     time jobs which also supplement my sister's care. This is so \n     wrong. Instead of encouraging families who want to keep their \n     loved ones at home and save the state money, they work \n     against us so I believe we will give up and just place them \n     in nursing homes . . . which in turn cost the state more \n     money . . . is this not totally crazy?\n\n  She is asking the right question. The CLASS Act will help turn this \nserious, no-win situation into an everyone-wins result. It gives \nindividuals with disabilities and their families the funds they need to \nobtain some of the services they need without having to resort to \nMedicaid.\n  The current reliance on Medicaid is not only a strain on our \nfamilies, it is also a strain on our already overburdened Medicaid \nsystem. Today, Medicaid spends nearly $50 billion a year on long-term \nservices and supports. Estimates indicate that by 2045 that spending \ncould exceed $200 billion. Obviously, this current course is \nunsustainable.\n  In addition, the private insurance industry is not doing enough to \nmeet the growing demand for such care. Aging baby boomers and longer \nlifespans will increase the demand for long-term care dramatically for \ndecades to come. Yet 95 percent of people over age 45 do not have \nprivate long-term care insurance, and fewer and fewer people are able \nto buy such coverage.\n  Make no mistake, as it stands today, if someone without adequate \nlong-term care coverage becomes disabled, they will more than likely \nhave to turn to the already overburdened Medicaid system to get the \nhelp they need. The CLASS Act is designed to specifically remedy this \nlooming crisis by giving people an affordable option other than \nMedicaid. The act will save the system over $1.6 billion over the first \n4 years that people start receiving benefits.\n  Some opponents of the CLASS Act argue that the program will not be \nsustainable over time and that it will become insolvent and end up \ncosting taxpayers large amounts. That argument could not be further \nfrom the truth.\n  Let's give proper credit where it is due. With the help of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, we have taken real steps to \nensure that the program remains solvent for years to come. The act \nestablishes a strong work requirement to make sure the funds continue \nto come into the program from the payroll tax deduction or from an \nindividual's voluntarily paid premium. It requires the Secretary of HHS \nto review and set the premiums annually to ensure that the program will \nremain solvent for the next 75 years. It directs the Secretary, in \naddition, to review the cost projections 20 years into the future. \nFinally, it mandates that no taxpayer funds will be used to pay \nbenefits.\n  Let me repeat that final point, since I have often heard it \nmisrepresented.\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\nNo taxpayer funds will be used to pay benefits. Benefits will be paid \nthrough self-funded and voluntary premiums.\n  During the markup in the HELP Committee this summer, Senator Dodd led \na main discussion about this program. With the help of the Republicans \non the committee, especially Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, additional \nsafeguards were included to ensure that the act will stand on strong \nfinancial footing for years to come. After the committee adopted \nSenator Gregg's 75-year solvency amendment, the program won strong \nwords of support from both parties. We credit Senator Gregg for that \nconstructive contribution.\n  This CLASS Act will do all the things it should do. It will provide \nfinancial and health security to elderly and infirm Americans. It will \nstrengthen Medicare. It will make health reform the exact thing the \nAmerican people need.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin, the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Baucus.\n  I come to the floor to talk about the many ways in which this bill \nwill have a positive impact for seniors.\n  Over the past year, we have seen confusion about what health care \nreform will mean for Americans and particularly for seniors. I had \nhoped that once the Senate voted to move forward with debate on one \nmerged bill, we could offer some definitive answers on how health \nreform will help them. Unfortunately, here we are on the floor, \ncontinuing to send mixed messages about some very concrete provisions. \nAs chairman of the Aging Committee, I wish to help set the record \nstraight for older Americans.\n  This health reform bill is not going to cut Medicare benefits. \nIndependent groups such as the AARP and the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare have said this bill will \nstrengthen Medicare and not harm it. AARP believes this bill will \ntransition Medicare to a more efficient system, where quality health \ncare outcomes are rewarded and waste, which experts believe accounts \nfor up to 30 percent of Medicare spending, is reduced.\n  In terms of the cuts to Medicare Advantage, this bill will only cut \nback on overpayments to these private Medicare plans. Benefits will not \nbe affected. AARP also supports these cuts because they understand that \nmost of the overpayments are going to insurance company profits, not to \nseniors' benefits, and that this overspending is putting Medicare on a \nfaster path to insolvency. Experts say by making these cuts, health \nreform will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 5 years, \nwithout making one cut to guaranteed benefits.\n  I understand people complain that this bill is too long. But any bill \nthat seeks to offer choice and meet the needs of so many Americans is, \nby necessity, complex. We cannot gloss over these vital issues. So I \nwould like to take a minute to share with you some of the provisions \nthat have not received as much attention but are, nevertheless, crucial \nto improving America's health care system. There is a lot in this bill \nfor older Americans, retirees, and those planning ahead for a healthy \nand happy long life. The Aging Committee has worked closely with the \nleadership of the HELP and Finance Committees to improve several of our \nprovisions, most of which have bipartisan support. I wish to \nparticularly thank Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, and \nMajority Leader Reid for being so willing to work with us on these \nimportant issues.\n\n  We have enlisted help from seniors groups of every stripe to ensure \nhealth reform makes commonsense improvements that, in some cases, are \ndesperately needed.\n  This bill will significantly improve the standard of care in nursing \nhomes nationwide for the first time in 22 years. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, for working together to make sure this important \nissue was not overlooked as part of health reform. In and of itself, \nthis is a huge undertaking, but it is just one piece of the puzzle to \ncomprehensively reform our health care system.\n  This bill will also train and expand the health care workforce so \nthey are prepared to care for the growing elderly population. By \nimplementing recommendations from the Institutes of Medicine, we will \nbegin to address the severe shortage we face of direct care workers.\n  This bill will protect vulnerable patients by creating a nationwide \nsystem of background checks for long-term care workers. This policy is \nmore than just a good idea in theory. We have implemented it in seven \nStates and seen its results. Comprehensive background checks are \nroutine for those who work with young children, and we should be \nprotecting vulnerable seniors and disabled Americans in the same way.\n  This bill will make it easier for seniors to get the care they need \nin their own homes because when it comes to long-term care, one size \ndoes not fit all. The goal of long-term care should be to allow older \nor disabled Americans to live as independently as possible.\n  This bill will help update our current long-term care system in order \nto offer choices tailored to an individual's needs. It will also help \nto alleviate the huge financial and emotional burden on married couples \nwho need long-term care. I worked with my colleague, Senator Cantwell, \nto ensure that married couples who receive care in their home and \ncommunity are not required to spend the vast majority of their assets \nto receive assistance.\n  The committee has also helped to include a provision that will \nbenefit all Americans regardless of age by helping to lower the costs \nof prescription drugs and medical devices.\n  Our policy aims to make transparent the influence of industry gifts \nand payments to doctors.\n  Although these are only a few of the Aging Committee's priorities, \nthis bill makes many other improvements to our current health care \nsystem for older Americans.\n  The Senate bill will reduce the cost of preventive services and add a \nnew focus on paying doctors to keep patients well and not just paying \nthem for when their patients get sick.\n  Today, seniors pay 20 percent of the cost of many preventive \nservices. By eliminating the copayment and deductibles through Medicare \nfor important services such as immunizations, cholesterol screenings, \nbone calcium-level screenings, and colonoscopies, we will help save \nlives as well as lower health care costs.\n  The bill will also provide for the first time an annual wellness \nvisit at no cost to the beneficiary. Patients will be able to receive a \npersonalized health risk assessment for chronic disease, have a \ncomplete review of their personal and family medical history, and \nreceive a plan for their care.\n  This bill will remove the ability of insurance companies to deny \naccess to consumers based on preexisting conditions. We know having \nhealth care is essential throughout one's life from beginning to end, \nbut many older Americans count the days until they become eligible for \nMedicare because they are not able to find insurance coverage at any \ncost due to a health condition in their past.\n  I could go on about the many other improvements, small and large, \nthat will benefit our Nation's seniors, but I will stop here and simply \nurge my colleagues to work to educate seniors and not scare them about \nthe important changes this bill will make to provide them with better \nhealth care at lower cost.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains for the majority?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that there be an additional 5 \nminutes on each side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Oregon, which should be 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes this morning \ntalking about Medicare Advantage and particularly to highlight the fact \nthat I\n\n[[Page S12362]]\n\nthink it is important to support the language put together by the \nchairman of the Finance Committee on Medicare Advantage and to reject \nthe amendment offered by our friend from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  I wish to begin my comments with respect to Medicare Advantage by \npointing out that it is clear that not all Medicare Advantage is \ncreated equal. Some of Medicare Advantage is a model of efficiency, and \nsome of it is pretty much a rip-off of both taxpayers and seniors. I \nwould refer, as it relates to the abusive plans, to the very important \nhearings chaired by Senator Baucus in the Finance Committee. I recall \non one occasion sitting next to our friend from Arkansas, Senator \nLincoln. We had witnesses describe how Medicare Advantage was being \nsold door-to-door in her part of the country by individuals dressed up \nin scrubs as physicians and health care providers. In the discussion of \nhow to handle it, we looked at various kinds of reforms to rein in \nabusive practices. I came to the conclusion that when you do something \nsuch as that, the CEOs ought to be put in jail. That is what is \ndocumented on the record as it relates to the hearings held in the \nSenate Finance Committee and why I come to the floor to make it clear \nthat I think it is important to distinguish between the good-quality \nMedicare Advantage plans and those that have been living high on the \nhog through some of the overpayments we have documented on this floor.\n  My State has the highest percentage of older people in Medicare \nAdvantage in the country. I had an opportunity to work closely with \nChairman Baucus in terms of addressing Medicare Advantage, and I think \nthat with the chairman's leadership, it has been possible to show you \ncan find savings in the Medicare Program without harming older people, \nwithout reducing their guaranteed benefits, their essential benefits, \nas we have learned, with Medicare Advantage. The way Chairman Baucus \ngoes about doing that is by forcing the inefficient Medicare Advantage \nplans to follow the model of the efficient ones. The way we have been \nable to do that is essentially through a two-part strategy: first, \nencourage competitive bidding and, second, provide incentives for \nquality, which is done through the bonus payment provisions that are in \nthe legislation.\n  First, on competitive bidding, you have plan bids, and you use the \nplan bids to set Medicare Advantage benchmarks which would encourage \nthe plans to compete more directly on the basis of price and quality \nrather than on the level of extra benefits offered to those who are \nenrolling. With the competitive bidding, plans compete to be the most \nefficient and hold down costs. I commend Chairman Baucus for \nmaking this a central part of the way Medicare Advantage would be \nhandled. Certainly our part of the country has shown this as a path to \nget more value for the Medicare Advantage dollar in the days ahead.\n\n  In addition, in the Finance Committee I offered an amendment with \nseveral colleagues that would boost the payments to those plans that, \naccording to the government--and the government uses a system of stars, \nin effect, to reward quality--our amendment would boost the payments to \nthose Medicare Advantage plans with four- and five-star quality \nratings.\n  So, in effect, with our legislation there are both carrots and \nsticks. Competitive bidding plus bonus payments offers both, so the \nplans compete to provide the best value for seniors. By encouraging the \nplans to be more efficient, it is possible to achieve significant \nsavings for older people, help shore up the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund, and meet the cost-saving goals of the legislation.\n  One point that has been discussed by colleagues on the floor of the \nSenate is this matter of individuals being able to keep what they have. \nI have heard that is not the case with Medicare Advantage plans; that \nsomehow, under the legislation that has been offered by the Finance \nCommittee, older people would not be able to keep what they have, \naccording to some on the floor. That is simply inaccurate. Seniors who \nhave Medicare Advantage plans under the Baucus legislation will be able \nto keep those plans. They will be able to stay with what they have, \nkeep their guaranteed, essential benefits, and through the language \nthat has been authored now in the legislation before us, there will be \nlower costs for taxpayers.\n  Last point. I have heard a lot of talk about grandma on the floor of \nthe Senate. I spent the bulk of my professional life in effect working \nwith grandma. I was the cofounder of the Oregon Gray Panthers and ran \nthe legal aid program for older people in our home State for a number \nof years. I want it understood that I think with the Baucus legislation \non Medicare Advantage, that proves it is possible to make savings in \nthe Medicare Program without cutting essential benefits. Using \ncommonsense principles of competitive bidding, No. 1, and incentives \nfor quality, I think grandma is going to be just fine under our \nlanguage for Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the majority \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And on the minority side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifty-five minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the majority \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, during the next 55 minutes, we will \nhave several Republican Senators come to the floor. I ask unanimous \nconsent that during that time, Senator McCain be allowed to be the \nmanager of a colloquy among the Republican Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before Senator McCain begins, if I may, \nI wish to take a moment to establish where we are today and what \nhappened yesterday as a lead-in to what he is about to discuss.\n  Yesterday, Senator McCain offered an amendment on the floor of the \nSenate that would do two things: It would send this 2,074-page \nDemocratic health care bill back to the Finance Committee and say to \nthem, No. 1, take out the cuts in Medicare, and No. 2, any savings in \nMedicare must go to make Medicare more solvent. That is what the McCain \namendment would have accomplished. That was defeated. Fifty-eight \nDemocrats said yes to the cuts in Medicare. They said yes to using the \nmoney that comes from these cuts to create a new entitlement program. \nForty Republicans and two Democrats said, no, we don't want cuts to \nMedicare and we do not want a new entitlement program.\n  So yesterday we made it clear that the central core of this bill \nincludes nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare. There is no \nquestion about that. Everyone concedes that. The President said that \nwhen he addressed us. The Congressional Budget Office says that. The \nquestion is whether it is a good idea or a bad idea, and yesterday, by \n58 votes, the Democrats said yes to these cuts in Medicare.\n  Today, we want to talk about one aspect of those cuts which is \nMedicare Advantage. We are going to talk about these cuts in a careful, \naccurate way so the 11 million seniors who have Medicare Advantage \nunderstand exactly what the risk is to their Medicare Advantage \npolicies.\n  We can see that a portion of the overall Medicare cuts that the \nDemocrats approved yesterday is a $120 billion cut over the next 10 \nyears to the Medicare Advantage program. Now, what is Medicare \nAdvantage? Medicare Advantage is an option seniors have. If you choose \nthis option, Medicare pays a fixed amount every year for your care, to \ncompanies that might come to you and offer a Medicare Advantage plan \nwhich you can choose instead of the original Medicare plan.\n  Many seniors choose these plans--11 million seniors. Nearly one out \nof four seniors in America who are part of Medicare chooses the \nMedicare Advantage plan. In my home State of Tennessee, the number is \nabout 230,000 Tennesseans.\n  Why do they choose it? Well, it includes some benefits they may not \nhave in the original Medicare plan. These benefits include dental care, \nvision care, hearing coverage, reduced hospital deductibles, lower co-\npayments, lower premiums, coordinated\n\n[[Page S12363]]\n\nchronic care management, and physical fitness programs.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oregon was on the floor and he \nmentioned grandma. I have mentioned grandma a few times--no disrespect \nto grandpa; he is in the same boat. He said grandma didn't need to \nworry about her Medicare Advantage plan because none of the benefits \nwould be cut. That is not what the Director of the CBO, who is often \ncited by the chairman of the Finance Committee, has said. He said that \nhalf of the benefits currently provided to seniors under Medicare \nAdvantage would disappear under the Finance Committee plan, which is \nmuch like the plan we are considering. The benefits that would \ndisappear would include those I mentioned.\n  Today, with Senator McCain leading the discussion, we wish to talk \nabout the Medicare Advantage plan, and why cuts to Medicare Advantage \nplay a central part of this $2.5 trillion bill. Cuts to Medicare pay \nfor about half of that $2.5 trillion cost, and the ones we are talking \nabout today are the Medicare Advantage plans. I understand there will \nbe an amendment by Senator Hatch, who has joined us, and I am sure he \nwill talk about his own amendment. He was present on the Finance \nCommittee when Medicare Advantage was created. I understand there will \nbe an amendment to send this back to the Finance Committee saying don't \ncut Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. For those who missed Senator Hatch's important \nstatement last night, which he will add to today, I point out that he \nwas able to take a trip down memory lane. In June 2003, when the \nMedicare Modernization Act was before the Senate, several of our \ncolleagues, including Senators Schumer and Kerry, offered a bipartisan \namendment on the floor to provide additional funding for benefits under \nthe Medicare Advantage Program.\n  But amnesia is not confined to one side of the aisle around here. I \nask my friend from Tennessee--you know this discussion about Medicare \nAdvantage--we have to better understand what is this program and why is \nit so popular. Is it because it offers seniors a chance to get \nadditional benefits? Maybe the Senator can give a short definition of \nthat. I think the American people may not be totally clear on what we \nare discussing here and why 11 million Americans--over 300,000 citizens \nin my own State--have chosen Medicare Advantage, and that has prompted, \naccording to Bloomberg, Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, to say, ``We are \nnot going to be able to say 'if you like what you have, you can keep \nit.''' ``That basic commitment that a lot of us around here have made \nwill be called into question.''\n  The title of that is ``Dem Senator Says Medicare Advantage Cuts Break \nPresident's Pledge.''\n  Maybe the Senator from Tennessee can give me a brief outline of what \nseniors get under Medicare Advantage and why it is so popular with \n330,000 senior citizens in my State and 11 million in the country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I can do that. The Senator is correct. If the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, said that, he is merely repeating \nwhat the Director of the CBO stated, when he said that fully half of \nthe benefits of Medicare Advantage will be lost.\n  To answer the Senator's question, Medicare Advantage is an option \nthat 11 million of the 40 million seniors who are on Medicare have \nchosen. The reason they choose it is because it is a plan offered by \nprivate companies, often to people in rural areas, often to \nminorities----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Lower income seniors.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, lower income Americans also choose these. They \noften choose it because the plans generally offer these benefits: \ndental care, vision care, hearing coverage, reduced hospital \ndeductibles, lower co-payments, lower premiums, coordinated chronic \ncare management, and physical fitness programs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. The reason I ask this, he mentioned \nthat Medicare Advantage would allow seniors to have dental care, vision \ncare, hearing care, physical fitness--it is fascinating. This allows \nour senior citizens to have dental, vision, hearing, and physical \nfitness care, and that is a little strange because, as was pointed out \nto me, that is exactly what we have here in the Senate. About 100 paces \nfrom here, if I need some doctor care immediately, if I need some \nvision care, if I need some dental care, I can get it. Next to my \noffice in the Russell Senate Office Building, for the last several \nmonths--and I don't know at what cost, but I would like to get entered \ninto the Record how many tens of millions of dollars it is. But they \nare renovating a gym. So my colleagues yesterday voted against keeping \nthe Medicare Advantage Program, when we have, right here, the best \nMedicare Advantage Program ever heard of in the world--free hearing, \nfree vision, free dental--and they are expanding a gymnasium in a many-\nmonths-long project. I will get the cost of that, although that may be \nhard to do.\n  Let me get this straight. Again, the American people should \nunderstand this. We voted to cut drastically a program that seniors \nhave taken advantage of, which gives them additional hearing, vision, \ndental, and physical fitness care, while we practice it here every \nsingle day. Every day, there is a physician on duty--more than one--not \nvery far from where I speak, who is ready to give us instant care. If \nhospitalization is needed, we can get instant transportation to the \nBethesda Naval Hospital, where we will get free care. Incredibly, the \nSenate, on largely partisan lines, yesterday voted against senior \ncitizens in this country, most of whom have paid a lot more into the \nprogram than we have. We are going to deprive them of what we have \nevery single day we are members of the Senate.\n  That is an exercise in hypocrisy. The Senator from Pennsylvania has \nit right, because the President, time after time, said to the American \npeople: If you like the insurance policy you have today, you can keep \nit. How many hundreds of times have we heard him say that at townhall \nmeetings? And his administration mouthpieces say the same thing. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania is right when he says, ``We are not going to \nbe able to say if you like what you have, you can keep it. That basic \ncommitment that a lot of us around here have made will be called into \nquestion.''\n  I will say a couple words, and I will talk more about this later. \nEvery time the Senator from Montana and others are on the floor, they \ntalk about the fact that AARP now supports this blatant transfer of \nfunding from the Medicare Program, which the seniors have earned, into \na brandnew entitlement--a $2.5 trillion entitlement program. That is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n  For your information, AARP has received $18 million in stimulus \nmoney. There is a job creator for you. AARP, which has given its full-\nthroated support to the Democratic health care legislation, even though \nseniors remain largely opposed, received an $18 million grant in the \neconomic stimulus package for a job training program that has not \ncreated any jobs, according to the Obama administration's recovery.gov \nWeb site. That is astonishing to me because from everything I have ever \nseen, they have created millions of jobs, including in the ninth \ncongressional district of Arizona, where they said they created \nthousands of jobs. Unfortunately, we only have eight congressional \ndistricts, but that is OK.\n  In February, Politico reported that AARP was putting pressure on \nRepublican Members of Congress to support the stimulus package. Since \nthen, AARP has moved on to lobbying for passage of health care \nlegislation, even though Democratic proposals have called for several \nhundred billion dollars in cuts to Medicare--a program that the group \ntypically defends tooth and nail when Republicans propose cutting it. \nIt turns out that AARP is also in a position to benefit financially if \nthe health care legislation passes, because seniors losing benefits as \na result of cuts to Medicare Advantage will be forced to buy Medigap \npolicies, which is the main source of AARP revenue. Barry Rand, chief \nexecutive of AARP, was a big donor to the Obama campaign and has \nretained a cozy relationship with the administration. That is shocking \nnews.\n  So, my friends, also I might add that in 2006, AARP received $18 \nmillion from the Federal Government, and we are reserving additional \nFederal moneys that they get.\n  The most important thing is this, and let's make it clear: AARP will \nreceive direct benefits because seniors\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\nwho have cuts in their Medicare Advantage and other Medicare programs \ncan buy--guess what--a Medigap insurance policy from AARP--in other \nwords, to cover the things being cut back under this legislation, and \nit costs $175 a month. The Medicare Advantage premiums are zero for \nmost seniors or $35 a month. Again, if the Medicare Advantage plans go \naway, people would have to buy a Medigap plan sold by--you got it--\nAARP. And some low-income seniors could not afford $175 a month.\n  That is why the Senator from Tennessee stated that if we drive people \nout of Medicare Advantage, we are harming low-income seniors all over \nthis country. We are harming them. We are doing them a great \ndisservice. If you think with 17 percent real unemployment in my State \nthat seniors who are unemployed and down on their luck are going to be \nable to afford the AARP Medigap policy for $175 a month, come and visit \nmy State and I will tell you they can't.\n  It is interesting, the conversation about high-income seniors, and \nhow we are going to tax people with Cadillac plans and all of those \nthings, when what we are doing is harming the lowest income seniors in \nrural areas of America.\n  Mr. KYL. Will my colleague yield for a quick point?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator was making the point that you cannot take $120 \nbillion out of the program without hurting folks. Those on the other \nside of the aisle said we can do that--we can cut it by $120 billion \nand it still won't hurt anybody. My colleague asked the Senator from \nTennessee exactly what some of the benefits were and he repeated them. \nI went to get the actual statistical number of how much it will \nactually reduce benefits in terms of actuarial value. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, in the year 2019, when fully implemented, \nhere is the statistic: The actuarial value of the reduction in benefits \nunder Medicare Advantage is 64 percent; in dollar terms, it goes from \n$135 a month down to $49 a month. In other words, the very things my \ncolleague talks about--vision care, dental, all of those things----\n  Mr. McCAIN. All of the things we routinely use in the Senate. I hope \nthose who voted to harm the seniors in this country and not allow them \nto have dental, vision, and other health care would unilaterally \ndisavow the use of the physician care and vision care and hearing care \navailable to all of us 24 hours a day right here in the Senate.\n  Mr. KYL. The last point. I want to say that I hear my colleague \nloudly and clearly. I hope the American people do too because you \ncannot call a $120 billion cut something that doesn't hurt people, and \nespecially when the Congressional Budget Office itself says, yes, that \nreduces these very benefits from a value of $135 a month down to $49 a \nmonth. That is a huge cut in the value of the services they receive \nunder Medicare Advantage. That is what we are trying to prevent by this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I mention one other thing? I will not spend that \nmuch more time on AARP. But the reason I do is because every time the \nSenator from Montana stands up, he talks about AARP endorsing this rip-\noff of the American people.\n  Let me quote again from a Bloomberg article entitled ``AARP's Stealth \nFees Often Sting Seniors With Costlier Insurance.'' I quote from the \nBloomberg article just briefly:\n\n       Arthur Laupus joined AARP because he thought the nonprofit \n     senior-citizen-advocacy group would make his retirement years \n     easier. He signed up for an auto insurance policy endorsed by \n     AARP, believing the advertising that said he would save \n     money.\n       He didn't. When Laupus, 71, compared his car insurance rate \n     with a dozen other companies, he found he was paying twice \n     the average. Why? One reason, he learned, was because AARP \n     was taking a cut out of his premium before sending the money \n     to Hartford Financial Services Group, the provider of the \n     coverage. . . .\n       AARP uses the royalties and fees to fund about half the \n     expenses that pay for activities such as publishing brochures \n     about health care and consumer fraud--as well as for paying \n     down the $200 million bond debt that funded the association's \n     marble and brassstudded Washington headquarters.\n       In addition, AARP holds clients' insurance premiums for as \n     long as a month and invests the money, which added $40.4 \n     million to its revenue in 2007. . . .\n       During the past decade, royalties and fees have made up an \n     increasing percentage of AARP's income, rising to 43 percent \n     of its $1.17 billion in revenue in 2007 from 11 percent in \n     1999, according to AARP data.\n\n  This is a Bloomberg article. This is not from the Republican Policy \nCommittee.\n  The point is, who gains? Who gains from this legislation? Who is \ngoing to make hundreds of millions of dollars more because they provide \nthe Medigap policies people will be deprived of when we kill off \nMedicare Advantage? AARP.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from Idaho, and the Senator from Wyoming have all come to the \nfloor, in addition to the sponsor of the motion, Senator Hatch. I am \nsure they are prepared to reflect on who is hurt by these cuts.\n  The only thing I would emphasize is what the Senator from Arizona has \nsaid is that disproportionately low-income Americans in Texas, Idaho, \nTennessee, Wyoming, and Utah are hurt. Only one-third of eligible White \nseniors who do not have Medicaid or employer-based insurance are \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage. But the number increases to 40 percent \nfor African Americans and 53 percent for Hispanics.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator again, he described the benefits \nthat are provided under the Medicare Advantage program that seniors can \nhave if they want, right? Are those same benefits--dental, vision, \nhearing, and fitness care--available under regular Medicare today?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. My understanding is the answer is no. That it is the \nreason 11 million Americans choose Medicare Advantage because these \nbenefits are not available under the original Medicare plan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In Montana, there are 27,000 enrollees who will see a 24-\npercent decrease. In Connecticut, there are 94,000 enrollees who will \nsee a 14-percent decrease. By the way, some special deals have been cut \nfor three States I understand--Oregon, New York, and Florida. We are \ngoing to try to fix that. There is no reason one State should be \nshielded any more than another from these draconian measures. We are \ngoing to try to fix that situation.\n  The reason I bring up this issue, present-day Medicare beneficiaries \ndo not have vision, they do not have dental care, they do not have \nfitness. Yet we in the Senate enjoy it every single day. So yesterday \nwe voted to deprive seniors from the ability to have the same \nprivileges that we enjoy every single day in the Senate. I would argue \nthat is an exercise in hypocrisy.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I might say we are operating under a colloquy managed \nby Senator McCain. So Republican Senators are free to engage in \ndiscussion.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate what the \nSenators have been talking about because what Senator McCain is saying \nis that these seniors who are low income have an affordable option, and \nit is less expensive than the AARP option that would give them this \nextra care--the eye care, the dental care, the hearing aids. It is an \naffordable extra option.\n  In Texas, we have over 500,000 seniors enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage. One of the great things about Medicare Advantage is that it \nis available in rural areas, and it gives them choices that they might \nnot be able to afford with other programs that are Medigap. This one is \naffordable. That is why we are fighting so hard to restore the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Medicare Advantage costs about 14 percent more than traditional \nMedicare because it provides a wide range of these extra benefits we \nhave discussed--dental, eye care, hearing aids and, in many cases, it \npays providers more. Republicans, of course, are open to discussing how \nto improve the Medicare Advantage payment formula. We want to be more \nefficient with taxpayer dollars, but do we want to do that in the \ncontext of creating a massive new entitlement program and ask Medicare \nto pay for it or to cut lifesaving benefits for seniors? Is that what \nwe want to do, I ask Senator Crapo?\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is absolutely the case. I would like to point out, \nwhen we had the Finance Committee markup, I asked CBO Director \nElmendorf directly whether provisions in the bill,\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\nwhich are still in the bill, would reduce the benefits that Medicare \nrecipients received. His response was:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current \n     law, yes.\n\n  There has been a lot of talk here about we are not cutting Medicare \nbenefits or we are or it is this or that. The bottom line is, the CBO \nDirector said it: Yes, we are cutting benefits.\n  I would like to ask the sponsor of this motion a question because I \nknow there are some who are saying the reason we are cutting Medicare \nAdvantage is that it is so expensive, and we should be cutting Medicare \nand controlling its costs; that it is about 14 percent more expensive \nthan fee-for-service Medicare.\n  Some people say if you are defending Medicare Advantage, you are \ndefending overpayments in health care plans. Would the Senator from \nUtah like to respond to that criticism some are making?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted to. To be clear, so-called \noverpayments to Medicare Advantage plans do not go to the plans. As a \nmatter of fact, they go to the seniors in the form of extra benefits. \nThat is a pretty important point a lot of people miss. Seventy-five \npercent of the additional payments to Medicare Advantage plans are used \nto provide seniors with extra benefits, including chronic care \nmanagement--you would think you would want to do that--hearing aids, \neyeglasses. The other 25 percent of any extra payments are returned to \nthe Federal Government. I cannot imagine why anybody would not want to \ndo that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nUtah to also respond to the arguments that claim that the government \ncannot afford now to continue overpaying these private plans and that \nthe Medicare trust fund is going broke. Of course, we tried actually \nseveral years ago to shore up the Medicare Program, trying to do it in \na responsible way, not cutting out the Medicare benefits these seniors \ncan receive as an affordable option. What does the Senator say to that?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Texas pointed out the Medicare trust fund \nis going broke. Yet what do we have on the other side? They take almost \n$500 billion out of Medicare. Trust me, I am deeply concerned about the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say it is my understanding that Dr. Barrasso has \nactually seen Medicare Advantage patients. He and Dr. Coburn are \nprobably the only two. Maybe we could let him give us the benefit of \nhis experience and also not only the benefit of his experience, but I \nam sure he is going to tell us what the impact is going to be on the \nlow-income seniors from his State.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with the Senator from Arizona that people \nchoose to be on Medicare Advantage. Mr. President, 11 million people \nhave chosen to be on Medicare Advantage because it is a wise choice to \nmake because they get better benefits. They get dental care, they get \nthe vision care, they get the hearing aids, they get the fitness thing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Just as we do.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Just as we do. It works in preventive care and \ncoordinated care.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't think they have as nice a gym, though, as we are \ngoing to get.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is also no surprise when people read about this and \nlearn about it that they would want to be on Medicare Advantage. What \nthe Senator from Utah has said, the sponsor of this motion, is that the \nmoney that goes into this program is for the benefit of the seniors. It \nis for services for the seniors on Medicare. To me, this whole bill \nbasically guts Medicare, raids Medicare to start a whole new program.\n  Today, as the Senator from Arizona has mentioned in these articles, \nthe Associated Press and USA Today said:\n\n       Senate Democrats closed ranks Thursday behind $460 billion \n     in politically risky Medicare cuts at the heart of health \n     care legislation. . . .\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Approval would have stripped out money to pay for expanding \n     coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans.\n\n  So they are going to take $460 billion, it says, away from our \nseniors who depend on it for their Medicare and start a whole new \ngovernment program. The Washington Times, front-page story headline, \nreads: ``Democrats Win $400B in Medicare Cuts. McCain Pushed for \nAnother Way to Pay for It.''\n  I look at this and say this is not fair to our seniors, not fair to \nthe patients I have taken care of for 25 years in Wyoming, taken care \nof folks--taken care of folks--when grandmom breaks her hip, what we \nneed to do for our patients. These are choices people have made.\n  Mr. President, 11 million Americans have chosen Medicare Advantage \nbecause there is an advantage to them for the health care they get--the \nadditional services, the coordinated care, the preventive care. Anyone \nwho looks at this and studies it says: I want to sign up.\n  It has been wonderful in rural areas and big cities. This has helped \na lot of people in the country. It is not surprising that one out of \nfour people in the country on Medicare have chosen Medicare Advantage, \nbut yet what we are seeing here is Democrats want to get rid of \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me get this straight. Basically, by removing the \nchoices that seniors have as a part of Medicare Advantage--dental, \nvision, hearing, fitness--we are taking away from them what we \nourselves enjoy every single day in the Senate?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We are taking it away from seniors and using all that \nmoney to start a new government program when we know Medicare is going \nto go broke by 2017.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are listening to only one of the two doctors in the \nSenate who knows, who has been on the ground, has met with the people, \nwho understands what this means to senior citizens. One-quarter of them \nare on Medicare Advantage.\n  In the end, I believe we not only actually help seniors be more \nhealthy but save a lot of money in the end. Trust me, I am deeply \nconcerned about the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. We have been \nsounding that alarm for years. That is why it is so shocking we are \ndebating a $2.5 trillion health reform bill that does almost nothing to \nmake sure Medicare is sound and, in fact, does a lot of things to make \nit unsound, or almost nothing to make sure Medicare is around for \nfuture generations.\n  Instead, we are just creating another Federal entitlement program \nthat we cannot afford while Medicare has $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is absolutely right. A lot of people trying to \ndefend these cuts are saying these extra costs in the Medicare \nAdvantage Programs are just going to make insurance companies' profits \nbigger and help pay for large CEO salaries. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. The reality is, as the Senator from Utah already \nindicated, 75 percent of this 14 percent extra payment in these plans \ngo to provide the seniors with the extra benefits we are talking about, \nand then 25 percent is returned to the Federal Government, not to \ninsurance companies, not to CEOs.\n  I have a chart. We are going to make it into a bigger one. But those \nwho support this program say we are not cutting Medicare benefits. This \nchart--I apologize it is a little bit small--but this is a chart of the \nUnited States. It shows what is happening to the benefits of Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries. As you might guess, the dark red is more than \n50 percent reduction in the benefits of the people in those dark red \nStates. In the medium red color, it is between a 25- and 50-percent \nreduction in coverage. The only States that do not have a reduction in \ncoverage are the white ones. There are three or four States that are \nnot seeing deep cuts in Medicare Advantage benefits.\n  Those who say--like the President who said it was one of his goals--\nif you like what you have, you can keep it--not if you live in one of \nthe States that is not in white on this chart because your benefits \nwill be cut.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Idaho to go \nback over a point he made a moment ago because he went over it quickly \nand it is such an important point and one reflected by the chart behind \nhim about what he just said. Repeatedly we are told that seniors won't \nlose benefits if you cut nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare. So if you \ncould take\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\na moment--I believe you were in the Finance Committee markup where the \nbill was being written that was offered by the distinguished Finance \nCommittee chairman, and I believe you were talking to the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, who is often cited by our friends on the \nother side as the nonpartisan authority for exactly what the bill does, \nand you asked him whether the benefits of Medicare Advantage recipients \nwould be cut. Would you describe that in a little more detail so people \nunderstand exactly the scenario?\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes, I would. This chart shows the last two sentences of \nour colloquy when we were in the Finance Committee, but it went on for \nsome time. But the bottom line is that I was asking the Director of CBO \nwhether the cuts to Medicare Advantage that are in the bill would \nreduce benefits to senior citizens, and he said yes. And the reason he \nused this phrase here, which says ``for those who would be enrolled \notherwise under current law,'' the reason he prefaced it that way--\nwhich we don't have on the chart--is that for future seniors it will \nnot be a viable option. So in the future, those who are not on it now \nwon't have a significant viable option to get on it because it is going \nto be gutted.\n  So he was saying that for those 75 percent--and by the way, Medicare \nAdvantage is the most popular part of Medicare today. It is the fastest \ngrowing part of Medicare. It is popular because it provides these \nadditional benefits that seniors have to pay so significantly for to \nget in supplemental insurance that AARP is going to provide. So what \nthe CBO Director said was that for the future, those who aren't already \non it won't get it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could the Senator from Texas and I go back to one of the \nthings I mentioned earlier, because in Texas, how many are under \nMedicare Advantage?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Five hundred thousand of my constituents are on \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Five hundred thousand in your State, and there is no \n``shielding.'' According to this Bloomberg article and according to our \nknowledge, it says:\n\n       Senators Charles Schumer of New York, Bill Nelson of \n     Florida, and Ron Wyden of Oregon are among those who secured \n     special provisions shielding constituents from cuts. Casey--\n\n  Referring to Senator Casey of Pennsylvania--\n\n     says he wants ``very comparable'' protections for his State--\n     surprisingly enough--where more than one-third of Medicare \n     beneficiaries participate in Medicare Advantage. ``It's the \n     kind of thing that will likely be addressed on the floor,'' \n     he said.\n\n  Well, I eagerly look forward to working, on the other side of the \naisle, with all the Members from those States, with the exception of \nNew York, Florida, and Oregon, who have earned special shielding from \nthese cuts. I look forward to working with them, and let's fix it for \nall of us; right, Senator Hatch?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. Go ahead.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I would say to the Senator from Arizona, I was \nwondering if every State could have the same treatment. Why not have \nevery State get this shielding for their Medicare Advantage? That is 11 \nmillion people in this country who would then be helped by a fair \nassessment of this all over the country.\n  But let me just point out one other provision. The way they have been \nshielded is through grandfathering. What about people who----\n  Mr. McCAIN. And was that shielding done on the floor of the Senate, \nin open debate and in discussion of the issue?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Oh, no. Now, amazingly----\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was done in an office over here, where we still await \nthe white smoke.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The white smoke, that is correct. But then the \nquestion arises: What about the future, where people will say: That is \nwhat I can afford and what I want to have. But grandfathering doesn't \ninclude anyone who might want to join in the future; it is only the \npeople already in the system. And for how long they live, that is \ngreat, but what about the future?\n  So this is a great program. It is affordable for the lower income \npeople. This shielding is only for three States now, but I would like \nto see us all have the same capabilities for our constituents. And what \nabout our future constituents?\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield on that point, because the Senator \nfrom Arizona has raised an important point. If this is such a good \nprogram for these four States, why isn't it a good program for \neverybody?\n  But more importantly, the Senator is the expert around here on \nearmarks. Is this not a classic earmark? And didn't we hear from the \nother side of the aisle that we were going to have open government; \nthat we were not going to have this type of exercise occur within major \nbills; that bills weren't going to be loaded up with special earmarks \nassisting one Member or another? As the expert on the issue of \nearmarks, would the Senator comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say this is probably the classic hometown \nprotectionism that we see in earmarking and benefits that we see in the \nearmarking process.\n  But also, I would remind the Senator from New Hampshire, as we have \nall discussed several times, a year ago last October, our then-\ncandidate for President said: It is all going to be on C-SPAN. Well, \nthe C-SPAN cameras are still waiting outside Senator Reid's offices to \ngo in and film these negotiations so that, as President Obama said, all \nAmericans can see who is on the side of the pharmaceutical companies \nand who is on the side of the American people.\n  C-SPAN, keep waiting. We are going to try to get you in.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could ask one more question because I have been \nlistening to this debate, and I came over because I wanted to \nparticipate a little. I think it has been an excellent and informative \ndebate.\n  I have been looking at the numbers here, and I know the numbers are \nbig--big--in this first 10-year period--almost $500 billion in \nreductions in Medicare spending. But I think the point we need to make \nis that it doesn't end there. It doesn't end there. Those Medicare \nspending reductions go on into the next decade, too, and over the first \ntwo decades of this bill, Medicare spending reductions will account for \n$3 trillion--$3 trillion. How can anybody argue against what the \nSenator from Idaho said, which is that this translates into real \nreductions in Medicare benefits?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't the vitally important point in this discussion that \nthis massive mountain being carved out of Medicare is not being used to \nsave Medicare? It is creating a huge new entitlement program. So here \nwe are with Medicare going broke in 7 years, and we are taking money \nout of it in order to create a new program. That is the crime that is \nbeing committed here.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely right. And the new program, by \nthe way, will not be solvent either. So we are compounding the \ninsolvency of the future, and we are passing that on to our children.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are taking $\\1/2\\ trillion out of a program that is \ngoing to be insolvent before the end of this decade and we are giving \nit to another program that is already insolvent.\n  Mr. GREGG. That will be insolvent.\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be insolvent. It is almost insane what they are \ndoing. And they wonder why the American people are having such a \ndifficult time, why we have 10 percent unemployed, why the \nunderemployment is 17 percent in this country. Those are people who are \ntrying to get part-time jobs because they can't get full-time jobs. So \n17 percent is the real number.\n  This whole program is about helping low-income people and minorities, \nwhen you stop and think about it. That is what Medicare Advantage does. \nAs the distinguished Senator from Arizona has said, they can't afford \nthese supplemental policies on which AARP will make a lot of money if \nthey can kill this program. There are a lot of gaps in traditional \nMedicare benefits, including high cost sharing and no out-of-pocket \nlimits. That is why 89 percent of seniors have some form of \nsupplemental coverage on top of Medicare. For many low-income Americans \nand minorities, Medicare Advantage is the only way they can afford the \nsupplemental coverage.\n  I compliment all of my colleagues here on the floor--the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona; the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho; the distinguished Senator from Texas; our only\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\ndoctor on the floor right now and one of only two in the Senate, \nSenator Barrasso from Wyoming; and, of course, our leader in the \nSenate, both on the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg and, of course, \nSenator Alexander. You guys have really summed this up.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say again that we have had spirited debate and \ndiscussion on this floor, but it is clear the majority of the American \npeople do not support the proposal that is before us, and they do not \nsupport meeting in private, mostly in secret, closed negotiations.\n  Again, I renew our offer to the Democrats and to the administration: \nLet's get together in a room with the C-SPAN cameras and any other \noutlet, and let's sit down and do some serious negotiations on the \nareas we can agree on, which there are many, and let's save Medicare, \nlet's fix this system, and let's do it together in the way the American \npeople want us to--in a bipartisan fashion, not behind closed doors, so \nthe American people can see us work together for a change.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their many contributions. We are \nready to talk. We are ready to talk, but we won't be driven.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to return to a point that \nwas made earlier about the President promising, and it being understood \nby everyone, that if you like what you have, you can keep it. On \nMedicare Advantage, once again, the CMS has estimated--and I would ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah to verify this--that enrollment in \nMedicare Advantage will decrease by 64 percent under this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. A lot of seniors are going to be badly hurt by these cuts, \nno question, and the poor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. And 8.5 million seniors would be deprived.\n  Mr. HATCH. And a lot of them are minorities, by the way. This is \namazing to me, how we go through all kinds of demagoguing about low-\nincome people and minorities, and yet they are going to take one of the \nmost important benefits away from them. That benefit is mentioned in \nthe Medicare handbook for 2010, yet they act as if it is not part of \nMedicare. I can't believe some of the arguments that have come from the \nother side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, the senior \nmember on the Budget Committee, a person who is well-known for his \nknowledge of the economy, of the budgetary situation in America, what \nhappens if we pass this massive bill? What happens to America's \neconomy?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, my view is this: First off, we know a couple of \nfacts--that we grow the government by $2.5 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod when this bill is fully implemented. We also know the tax \nincreases during that period will be approximately $1.2 trillion, tax \nincreases and fees, and they are not going to fall on the wealthy, they \nare going to fall on the small businessperson trying to create the \nextra job. We also know there will be an entire sea change in the way \npeople get their health care, that the government will be stepping in \nbetween you and your doctor and basically making a decision as to what \nyour doctor can tell you you can have for health care, what the \nprovider will tell you you can have for health care.\n  There is something that hasn't been discussed much. We know the \ninnovations in health care which have done so much to make America the \nbest place to get health care in the world and which have put us on the \ncutting edge of drugs that have improved the lives of millions of \npeople, not only in the United States but across the world, will be \nsignificantly chilled because there will not be an interest in \ninvesting capital in a market that is so controlled by the government.\n  In the end, it is fairly obvious to anybody who has been around this \nplace that there isn't going to be $3 trillion in reductions of \nMedicare spending over the next 20 years and there isn't going to be \n$500 billion in Medicare spending cuts in the next 10 years. So all \nthat spending is going to fall on the backs of our children in the form \nof debt.\n  We already have a nation that is on an unsustainable path under the \npresent budget scenario without this health care bill. Our deficits are \n$1 trillion a year, on average, for the next 10 years. That is without \nthis bill. Our public debt goes from 35 percent of the gross national \nproduct to 80 percent of the gross national product. We become \ninsolvent at the end of this decade--not this decade but the decade \nstarting today, 10 years from today. That is aggravated dramatically by \nexploding the size of the government under this bill rather than taking \nthe step-by-step approach that has been proposed by our side to reform \nhealth care, to make it more effective and make it deliver more \nservices to more people at a better cost.\n  A number of times I have heard people on the other side of the aisle \nget up and say that CBO says this bill reduces the cost of health care \nspending to the Federal Government. It is just the opposite--just the \nopposite. The CBO letter specifically said that the cost to the Federal \nGovernment of health care goes up--goes up--under this bill in the 10-\nyear period. So this bill does not turn down the cost of health care, \nit does explode the size of government, it does put the government into \nthe business of managing your health care, and as a result, I think it \nis going to reduce the quality of life of our children.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not have the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator has pointed out he does not believe they can \nafford all these programs. The Senator is not suggesting this is a \ngame, is he?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am suggesting it is very difficult, under any scenario, \nto believe this Congress is going to do anything other than spend the \nmoney that is put in this bill. It is certainly not going to end up \nmaking the reductions in Medicare it proposes in this bill. If it does \nmake those reductions, though, I think the Senator from Utah has been \nabsolutely right in saying those reductions should go to making the \nMedicare system solvent. They should not go to creating a brand new \nentitlement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On that point I think Senator Crapo wishes to exactly \nemphasize the point of Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I wish to make a comment or two and then engage with the \nranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  Often people talk about driving the cost curve down. Frankly, when \nyou talk to Americans about what they want in health care reform, the \nvast majority of them say the reason we need health care reform is \nbecause of the skyrocketing cost of health care and health care \ninsurance. Those who are promoting this bill say they are bending that \ncost curve down. My question is which cost curve are they talking \nabout? Is it the size of government? Are they bending the size of \ngovernment growth down? No, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, \nthey are growing government by $2.5 trillion for the first true 10-year \nperiod of the bill.\n  Are they driving personal health care costs down? No, the CBO report \nwe recently got said 30 percent of Americans will see their health \ninsurance go up, and the other 70 percent will, at best, see it stay \nabout what it is today, rising at the same levels it is today.\n  Are they talking about the Federal deficit? The chairman of the \nBudget Committee has indicated to us we are going to see skyrocketing \ndeficits. Those who claim this bill is going to reduce the deficit can \nsay so only if they take into account all of their budget gimmicks, \nsuch as not counting the first 4 years of the spending, or the hundreds \nof billions of dollar of taxes that are going to be imposed on the \nAmerican people, or the Medicare cuts we have been talking about. Take \nany one of those three out of this bill and it drives the deficit up in \na skyrocketing fashion, is that not correct, Senator?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator from New Hampshire ever heard of \nlegislation where you pay in the first 4 years before a single benefit \ncomes about? Nowadays I see these advertisements that you can buy a car \nand you don't have to make a payment for a year and then you can start \nmaking payments. In this deal it is the reverse; you make payments and \nthen perhaps you get the benefits after some years.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, I think, wishes to comment, too.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would direct my comment to the Senator from New\n\n[[Page S12368]]\n\nHampshire, too. The President of the United States said something a few \nweeks ago that I thought was profound and that I agreed with, he said \nthis debate is not just about health care; it is about the role of the \nFederal Government in the everyday lives of the American people. I \nbelieve he is exactly right about that, which is why so many Americans \nare turning against this bill.\n  Would the Senator from New Hampshire agree the President was correct, \nthat this debate is about, in my words now, Washington takeovers, more \ntaxes, more spending, and more debt? It is not just about health care. \nThe enormous interest across the country in these votes comes from a \nmuch larger picture than this health care bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Tennessee has once again hit the \nnail on the head. I respect the President's forthrightness. The \nPresident has said very simply he believes that prosperity comes from \ngrowing the government. When this bill passes, we will see the largest \ngrowth in government in the history of our country. This is going to be \n16 percent of our economy basically managed by the Federal Government. \nYou are going to see the Government explode in size. Does that lead to \nprosperity? I don't happen to think it does. It certainly doesn't lead \nto prosperity if along with that massive expansion in the size of the \ngovernment you are going to see your deficit go up significantly, your \ndebt go up significantly, or the tax burden go up significantly, which \nreduces productivity, or if you take a large segment of our society, \nour seniors, 35 million today, 70 million by the year 2019, and say to \nthem they are not going to have the ability to have a solvent Medicare \nsystem because the way that system might have been made more solvent is \nnow being used to create a brandnew entitlement, a massive new \nentitlement for a whole group of people who never paid for an insurance \npolicy and never paid into the Medicare insurance fund.\n  I think the Senator has touched the base. We have seen automobiles, \nwe have seen financial institutions, we have seen the student loans, \nand now we are seeing health care all taken over by the government or \npartially taken over by the government. Clearly the goal is, as the \nPresident said, expand the size of the government, create prosperity, \nuse the European model. I don't happen to be attracted to the European \nmodel. I think the American model works better where you have a \ngovernment you can afford and give entrepreneurs a chance to go out and \ntake risks and create jobs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Hutchison will conclude.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We have been talking about Medicare Advantage and \nlosing this great option for lower income seniors, which is so \nimportant. I was reminded that we have not even talked about the $135 \nbillion that would be taken out of hospitals in this bill. These are \nthe care providers. We are talking about taking away benefit options in \neye care and dental care and hearing aids, sort of basic things seniors \nneed, but also undercutting the hospitals that treat them, so the care \nprovided in the hospitals themselves would also have to be cut back.\n  It does not pass common sense to cut Medicare in order to create a \nnew big entitlement program. We have all said that Medicare is on life \nsupport anyway, everyone understands that. So you take almost a $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion out of a program that is working for seniors, that gives \noptions to seniors such as Medicare Advantage, and you take away their \ncare to pay for another entitlement program that is not specifically \ndesigned for them.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and ask him to finish the comments \non what is happening to this bill, this country, and our seniors. We \nneed to stop it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues. It has been a lot of fun. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent that we \nextend for an additional hour the period for debate only with no \nfurther amendments or motions in order during the hour; and that the \ntime be equally divided between the two sides, with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling the \nsecond 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe there is 3 minutes remaining on the first \nblock, on the majority side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the Coburn amendment No. 2789 requiring all Members of \nCongress to enroll in the new public health insurance option. I wish to \nadd my name to Senator Coburn's amendment. Seventeen years ago when I \nfirst ran for Congress I promised I would pay my own health insurance \nuntil Congress paid health insurance for everyone. I have paid out of \nmy pocket since then. I look forward with great eagerness to joining \nthe public option as soon as it is available.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think I will use my 2 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. And 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. OK. I want to make three basic points. The Senator from \nArizona talks about, gee, all these Medicare Advantage plans have \ndental and vision coverage. He goes on to say, so do Members of \nCongress.\n  The fact is that is not automatically true. The fact is Members of \nCongress choose among various private plans. Some plans offer dental \nand vision, some do not. Aetna is a company that Members of Congress \ncould choose from under FEHBP and others that Members of Congress can \nchoose from. Those do provide dental and vision coverage. But there are \nothers--I think Blue Cross and Blue Shield does not provide dental and \nvision coverage.\n  I make that point because this is exactly what we are trying to set \nup in these exchanges. People could participate in the exchanges, where \nthey would buy private coverage and they could choose among various \nprivate plans which coverage they want. Do they want a plan that covers \ndental and vision, or not? That is exactly what we are trying to do in \nthe exchange, as is the case for Members of Congress. Medicare \nAdvantage plans do provide dental and vision. I think that is great.\n  I see my time has expired. At the appropriate time I wish to go into \ngreater detail and explain why what we do in this bill I think makes \neminent sense.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \ntake. I don't think I am going to speak more than 6 or 7 minutes, for \nthe benefit of my colleagues who may want some of this time.\n  I want to tell my colleagues why I am supporting the Hatch amendment. \nIn my home State of Iowa there are 64,000 seniors enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage. These are seniors who have come to rely on lower cost and \nparticularly additional benefits that Medicare Advantage provides, as \nopposed to traditional Medicare. Yesterday I came to the floor to point \nout that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are playing word \ngames to cover up the fact that they are raiding Medicare, cutting \nbenefits by 64 percent for these 11 million seniors who have chosen \nvoluntarily to go on Medicare Advantage as opposed to traditional \nMedicare. Let me repeat: This bill cuts Medicare benefits, or let's say \nraids Medicare, by 64 percent for 11 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle keep saying they are not \ncutting and they use these words, ``they are not cutting guaranteed \nbenefits.'' But this is not even the case. Because we have this new \nindependent Medicare advisory board that is set up in this legislation, \nit is given very specific authority to cut payments to Medicare Part D. \nThis will result in higher costs and less guaranteed benefits for \nMedicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part D.\n  But I want to leave that debate for later. I want to visit with my \ncolleagues now about Medicare Advantage. Mr. President, 64,000 seniors \nin Iowa and 11 million seniors nationwide do not care about the \ngobbledy-gook type words we use here in town, as legal as they are--\n``guaranteed benefits'' on the one hand and the words ``additional \nbenefit'' on the other hand. In other words, guaranteed benefits or,\n\n[[Page S12369]]\n\nas the other side wants us to believe, somehow additional benefits \nprovided under Medicare.\n  I say that is Washington nonsense. I want to bring a little bit of \nMidwestern common sense to this debate. Our constituents want to know \nthat Congress is not cutting Medicare benefits they have come to rely \nupon and that would include, under Medicare Advantage, dental care, \neyeglasses, hearing aids, and other additional benefits provided by \nthis program that they voluntarily chose, Medicare Advantage.\n  I know that to be the case. I have at least 1,000 letters I have \nreceived since last summer on this point. But I want to read one from \nMiss Purificacion S. Gallardo of Iowa City, IA.\n\n       I am writing to urge you to oppose cuts to Medicare \n     Advantage. . . . This plan was a great help to me when my \n     late husband, who passed away in May, was hospitalized. . . \n     . I was able to afford to pay the hospital without going \n     bankrupt. We seniors who live on a fixed income depend on \n     our benefits from Medicare Advantage. I am retired and \n     don't know how I would have managed without [Medicare \n     Advantage].\n\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want \nseniors, even people such as my constituent from Iowa City, Ms. \nGallardo, to know that this 2,074-page bill is cutting their benefits. \nBecause the other side will say they are simply cutting so-called \noverpayments to Medicare Advantage plans. That doesn't make any \ndifference to Ms. Gallardo. They fail to mention, 75 percent of these \nso-called overpayments must be spent for additional benefits--not only \nfree money for a company to use or free money that benefits a Medicare \nAdvantage recipient without any concern about what it costs--75 percent \nof these payments must be spent for additional benefits. Then where \ndoes the rest of it go? The rest of it comes back to the Federal \nTreasury. Cuts to these Medicare Advantage payments are, in fact, cuts \nin Medicare benefits.\n  I am more than happy to have a debate on how to reform Medicare \nAdvantage payments. We should always be looking for ways to make \npayments more efficient. But the solution is not to cut benefits by 64 \npercent, on which seniors have come to rely, to fund an entirely new \nentitlement program this country can't afford. At a time when seniors \nare in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the Great \nDepression, we should not be debating a bill that forces them to spend \nmore money on health care, and that is exactly what this 2,074-page \nbill will do. Seniors who lose their Medicare Advantage as a result of \nthis bill may be forced to buy a Medigap plan to fill in all the holes \nin traditional Medicare. That is why more low-income seniors enroll in \nMedicare Advantage. The so-called overpayments my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle keep decrying help fill in the significant cost \nsharing and premiums that exist in traditional Medicare.\n  This bill will force low-income seniors, who pay little to nothing \nunder Medicare Advantage, to come up with $175 per month to buy a \nMedigap plan. That doesn't sound like that is a very good way to help \nseniors. That sounds like this bill is paying for an entirely new \nentitlement program and paying for it, quite frankly, on the backs of \n11 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I support the Hatch amendment. Let's take the $120 billion in \nMedicare Advantage cuts back to the Finance Committee and find a way to \nimprove the program without hurting 11 million seniors.\n  I yield 5 minutes, as the manager on this side, to Senator Hutchison.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa has discussed. I specifically liked the fact that he \nis relating this to where we are today. Sometimes it seems as though we \nare in a vacuum, not realizing how stretched people are right now. We \nare in a time of joblessness, people are worried about keeping their \njobs, worried about having lost their jobs, where they are going to get \ntheir health care. We have seniors who are stretched because they are \nnot able to earn income. We are in a distressed time. There is no doubt \nabout it. To talk about cutting Medicare by almost $500 billion is \nastounding. I am concerned about hospitals. We talked for the last 45 \nminutes about the cuts to benefits--the hearing aids, the dental work \nseniors need, the eye care seniors need.\n  What about the cuts to care provided in a hospital? Hospitals that \ntreat a large share of low-income seniors get an extra payment from \nMedicare. Medicare already makes reduced payments to providers, to \ndoctors but also to hospitals, to hospice, to nursing homes, and home \nhealth agencies for senior services. And yet proposed is a cut of \nalmost $500 billion. All of these serve our seniors in such great ways. \nLook at the cuts, almost a $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years. This is not \nsustainable. We cannot take away from Medicare, cut services, cut \nreimbursements to providers. What is going to happen to a hospital? \nWhat is going to happen to a hospital in a rural area, especially that \nis barely hanging on right now because they are trying to make ends \nmeet in a more expensive treatment area and they lose the added payment \nthat would make them whole in the treatment of low-income seniors?\n  The Texas Hospital Association estimates that $2 billion will cut in \npayments to hospitals for treating a large volume of low-income \nMedicare patients, $2 billion out of our economy. Mr. President, 254 \ncounties in Texas, more than one-fourth, do not even have an acute care \nhospital within their boundaries. With these kinds of cuts to rural \nhospitals, we are talking about losing more hospitals. There is no \ndoubt about it. They are already struggling. Why would we pay for \nhealth care reform on the backs of our senior citizens? Why would we \ntake away a program they have that is tailored for their needs in order \nto pay for another big government program that is going to cost $2.5 \ntrillion, most of which is going to be added to the deficit, added to \nthe debt, and we are already hitting the ceiling of the debt at $12 \ntrillion? We are in a very tough financial time. We are in a time that \nis hard for people who have lost jobs, hard for seniors stretched to \nmake ends meet, hard for hospitals serving seniors and not getting paid \nthe full cost of the treatment. Yet we are talking about cutting these \nservices.\n  Of the $135 billion in Medicare cuts to hospitals, $2 billion is for \nthe reimbursement rates that will no longer be making hospitals whole. \nI went to the major medical centers in Texas--in Dallas, Houston. Then \nI went to rural areas. It is the topic of conversation. Anyone who is \ndealing with a hospital in a rural area, they are all saying: What are \nyou doing?\n  Of course, we are not doing anything. We are fighting these health \ncare cuts. But we have to make sure they know what is happening so we \ncan achieve that result.\n  I understand my time has expired. I think the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas the rest of the time on our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I yield \nmyself the remainder of our time, which I understand is until 10 after \nthe hour.\n  I wish to talk about taxes, which is our subject, and in a different \nway than others did. The stated purpose of the Democrats' health care \nproposal is to do two things: lower cost and increase coverage. This \nbill is a miserable failure on both counts. Under the plan, premiums \nare expected to increase, as a result of new taxes, new regulations, \nand restrictions. In general, you are going to pay more for your health \ninsurance thanks to the Democrats' 2,000-page bill. This is in direct \ncontradiction to the stated goals of the bill itself. I will be \nspecific about that in a moment.\n  The second issue is coverage. Again, we find a miserable failure. The \nmost often cited number of uninsured Americans is 47 million Americans. \nI saw some interesting numbers in a Washington Post opinion piece the \nother day which kind of ranks out the uninsured and how they are broken \ndown. This is very significant. Of the 47 million, 39 percent reside in \nthe five States of California, Florida, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. \nThose are our border States. Indeed, it is estimated that 9.1 million \nof the 47 million are illegal immigrants, people in this country \nillegally. Secondly, of the 47 million, 9.7 million have incomes above \n$75,000 and choose not to purchase health insurance. This bill would \nsolve that issue by using the coercive power of the Federal Government \nto force citizens to allocate their resources in a manner that\n\n[[Page S12370]]\n\nmeets the approval of bureaucrats in Washington and of politicians. The \nbill makes it a crime not to have health insurance. If you don't get \nit, you get taxed.\n  Lastly, a total of 14 million of the 47 million are currently \neligible for current government programs--Medicaid, Medicare, SCHIP, \nand so forth--and choose not to sign up. If you do the math, that \nreduces that 47 million down, if you take out the illegals and the \nothers for the reasons I stated, to about 14 million. So this, by and \nlarge, is what people are talking about when they mention the 47 \nmillion uninsured Americans. These numbers shed some interesting light \non the composition of the number of uninsured Americans that gets \nthrown around. President Obama, interestingly, uses a different number. \nHe doesn't use 47 million. He uses 30 million. I think he wants to \navoid the immigration issue, and it is probably wise of him to do so. \nHe doesn't want to be accused of giving rich benefits to people who are \nhere illegally. I noted, with great interest, the CBO's estimate of the \nnumber of Americans who will not have health insurance, even if this \nbill were to be enacted over the wishes of the majority of the American \npeople, 24 million. This bill still leaves 24 million Americans \nuninsured, after spending $2.5 trillion to do just that, while at the \nsame time making health care more expensive for the rest of us.\n  I hear the other side often throwing numbers around without any \ndocumentation. I use the CBO and other nonpartisan, credible sources so \nwe can avoid doing that. President Obama wants to spend $2.5 trillion \nin new health care promises at a time when the country can't afford the \npromises we have already made, and we have a record 1-year budget \ndeficit which, by the way, means that 47 cents out of every dollar the \nFederal Government spends this year is borrowed. In 10 years, 16 \npercent or nearly $1 out of every $5 the government spends will be \nspent solely on interest payments on the debt. President Obama's budget \ndoubles the Federal debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years. We have \ntalked about this on the floor. I don't think there is disagreement.\n  On top of this, we face $67 trillion in unfunded liabilities from our \ncurrent entitlements of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This \nhealth care plan layers yet another unaffordable entitlement on top of \nMedicare and Medicaid and Social Security and the other entitlements we \nhave, all in a system that is already crumbling. It seems to me this \nbill is exactly what the American people do not need. That is why most \nAmericans are reporting that this bill is something they do not want at \nthis time or ever. I think it is common sense.\n\n  Reading through the legislation, one is struck by the myriad of ways \nthis bill raises taxes on America's citizens--from job-creating small \nbusinesses, to middle-class families. I count about a dozen of them, \nadding up to about $500 billion in tax increases over the next few \nyears--$\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes. So everyone should get ready to \npay a higher health care bill and a higher tax bill should this measure \nbecome law.\n  Some might be inclined to say: But President Obama promised he would \nnot raise taxes. That was, indeed, a campaign promise of the current \nadministration, that no one making under $250,000 per year would see \ntheir taxes go up.\n  Let me just go ahead and quote that. This is what President Obama \nsaid during the campaign:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes.\n\n  So we started analyzing this bill, and guess what we found out. When \nthe bill is fully enacted, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation--keep in mind, I am quoting sources here that are credible \nsources and nonpartisan sources--the Joint Committee on Taxation found \nthat, on average, individuals making over $50,000 and families making \nover $75,000 would see their taxes go up. Let me repeat that. \nIndividuals making over $50,000 and families making over $75,000 would \nhave their taxes go up under this bill. Indeed, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, 42 million middle-class families and \nindividuals--those making less than $200,000, on average, will pay \nhigher taxes in this bill. President Obama's health care reform bill \ncurrently under consideration in the Senate raises revenues to a large \nextent on the backs of middle-class Americans despite Candidate Obama's \npledge not to do that.\n  So let's look at some of these instances where we get taxed. I am \ngetting this, again, from the Joint Tax Committee and from CBO. If you \nhave health insurance, you get taxed. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, new excise taxes applied to health \ninsurance providers will end up taxing the beneficiaries. This tax also \nhas the effect of increasing premiums as well. So you are double-taxed \non this deal.\n  Now, that is if you do have health insurance. What if you do not have \nhealth insurance? You still get taxed. Under this bill, you get taxed \nif you do not carry health insurance, as a penalty. Where does this \nburden fall? You guessed it: middle-class Americans. CBO has said that \nhalf of the Americans affected by this provision make between $22,800 \nand $68,000 for a family of four. That is middle-class America.\n  If you take prescription drugs, you get taxed. That is another area. \nAccording to the JTC and CBO, new taxes in the bill applied to the \nprovision of prescription drugs will end up raising the cost of those \ndrugs. So you are taxed again.\n  If you happen to need a medical device--this is something I am really \nsensitive to, and I have not heard much discussion of this issue on the \nfloor so far. It is a difficult thing. I was talking to Senator Enzi. \nHe said people do not really know what medical devices are. The \nstents--these are things that are available here in America. You cannot \nfind them in many of the other countries. So if you need a medical \ndevice, you get taxed. If you have high out-of-pocket medical bills, \nyou get taxed.\n  My son-in-law, Brad Swan, installs pacemakers and defibrillators. \nThis morning, I was talking to him, and he told me what happened last \nnight. He said that at 1 o'clock in the morning, they got a call to go \nout to the emergency room of St. Francis Hospital in my city of Tulsa, \nOK, and they had an 8-year-old boy who had no heartbeat. He was born \nwith congenital heart disease. He put in a pacemaker at that time, and \nhe was perfectly healthy in the morning. I think most doctors would \nagree that without it, that child would not have lived. My older sister \nMarilyn faced a similar situation 9 years ago. She is alive today. She \nis healthy today. She would not be alive today without it. That is how \nserious this is.\n  Dr. Stanley DeFehr is from Bartlesville, OK. I talked to him this \nmorning about this, about the significance of the medical devices. I am \ngoing to quote his answer. I wrote it down. He said:\n\n       The decision of who needs a pacemaker could be complicated, \n     particularly the decision to put in a pacemaker on someone we \n     might consider quite elderly. But it's a false economy to \n     deny putting one in because of their risk of falling \n     (breaking a hip or shoulder). In the case where they fall, \n     the costs become quite high. The cost of a pacemaker pales in \n     comparison to the cost of a stroke or multiple fractures.\n\n  A pacemaker, by the way, costs about $5,000 and lasts about 10 years. \nThat is $500 a year--not a bad deal. So I think this is a quality-of-\nlife issue that we could lose with the Democrats' government-run health \ncare schemes.\n  So those are some examples of what we can do to pay higher taxes \nunder this bill. If you have health insurance, you pay higher taxes. If \nyou do not have it, you pay higher taxes. If you purchase a medical \ndevice, you have higher taxes. If you pay your own medical bills out of \nyour pocket, you have higher taxes. If you take prescription drugs, you \nhave higher taxes. All of these activities are taxed mercilessly under \nthis legislation.\n  I want to turn now to examine one tax provision in particular that I \nfind strikingly dishonest, damaging, and expensive to the taxpayer. It \nis an additional Medicare payroll tax that is in this legislation, and \nit is a perfect example of how this bill is going to tax you. You have \nto go into the bill to find these things. There are clandestine taxes \nin the bill that will hit you when you do not expect them to.\n  Basically, the bill says that people making $200,000 a year are going \nto pay an additional payroll tax called the\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\nhospital insurance payroll tax that raises over $53 billion. Keep in \nmind, this is above the taxes we are already paying. They are getting \nthese people at $200,000. You might think that is a lot of money. But \nthere is a catch to this. They did not index it. So if you do not index \nthe $200,000, then a period of time goes by, and it is far less than \nthe amount it sounds like today. In fact, I would say in 10 years from \nnow that $200,000 would pretty much fit a lot of the middle-income \npeople in America. So there is this increase with an additional \nMedicare payroll tax in this bill that raises $50 billion. It is not \nindexed, and we know how that is going to extend to other people now.\n  I remember Candidate Obama making a firm pledge not to raise taxes on \nmiddle-class Americans. However, this health care reform bill before us \nbreaks that pledge on numerous occasions. But it is not unlike the new \ntaxes which will be imposed on other measures the Democratic Congress \nand President Obama would like to enact. I just mentioned the $500 \nbillion in new taxes this health bill raises.\n  There is another tax in another program going on, which I have talked \nabout on this floor many times; that is, the cap and trade. That is \nstill on the floor. That could come up at any time. Of course, that is \nnot something that would be $500 billion over a 10-year period; that \nwould tax the American people in excess of $300 billion every year.\n  I have quoted as my sources the Wharton School of Economics, MIT, \nCRA, and others that have done evaluations. So it is not just this \nbill, even though this bill is what we are talking about today; we \nstill have the problem of other legislation being promoted by the \nPresident and by the Democrats here.\n  The Obama administration's own Treasury Department estimated that \ncap-and-trade legislation would cost each family in America $1,761 a \nyear. It is much more than that in heartland America. In Oklahoma, it \nwould be closer to $3,300 a year. So we are talking about some very \nlarge tax increases.\n  But, again, back to the health care bill, I noted earlier that the \ngovernment-run health care system, as proposed by the President and by \nthe Democrats, is expected to cost $2.5 trillion on top of the already \nexploding record deficits. This bill will increase payments we make on \nour country's ever-exploding Federal debt. This Democratic Congress's \nagenda clearly includes more tax on Americans. They may be hidden, but \nthey are there. It is disingenuous. It is costly. It is another reason \nthis bill should not be passed by the Senate. I say ``another.'' The \nother and the main reason is that a government-run health system does \nnot work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand we are now under the order \nwhere there is a half hour allocated to the majority side; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I just want to help people understand this \nlegislation. I am sure many do, but I am sure there are some who do not \nwith respect to the choices people will have.\n  We have a uniquely American system of health care in America. It is \nroughly half public, half private. The goal of this legislation is to \nretain what we have; that is, basically have that same balance of \npublic and private. It has worked pretty well for America. It is \nuniquely American. We are not Canada. We are not Great Britain. We are \nnot Switzerland. We are the United States of America. I think it is \ngood to build on our current system and make our current system work \nbetter.\n  I am prompted to explain the choices, in part by the statements by \nthe senior Senator from Arizona, who said Medicare Advantage plans \nenable people to get eyeglasses and dental care. And that is true. But \nhe went on to say that, gee, shouldn't Members of Congress, who like \nall that and want to keep all that--that Members of Congress get free \ndental and free eyeglasses. Well, that is really not true. Members of \nCongress do not get that. But it is true Members of Congress \nparticipate in--all Federal employees, Members of Congress, people in \nthe Forest Service, people all around the country--all Federal \nemployees participate in the same system. It is called FEHBP. It is the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan, where Federal employees and \nMembers of Congress, all together, the same, can choose among many \ndifferent private health insurance plans. There is an open enrollment \nseason--in fact, we are in the midst of it right now--where Members of \nCongress and all Federal employees can look to see if they want to \nchoose a different insurance company or not. Some of those companies do \nprovide dental and vision coverage. Some do not. So if a Federal \nemployee wants to choose a plan that covers dental and vision, he or \nshe can do so. Just pay the premium, and you are covered with dental \nand vision.\n  We are setting up under this legislation an exchange that is very \nsimilar--almost identical--to the FEHBP, where people who do not have \nhealth insurance can go look on the exchange and choose, among private \ncompanies, which one makes the most sense for them. Some may have \ndental, some may have eyeglass coverage, some may not. That is just a \nchoice people can make.\n  In addition to that, there is even more choice, because currently a \nFederal employee does not have to join FEHBP. A Federal employee can \nchoose not to get health insurance if he or she does not want to or \nmaybe they get it through their spouse someplace else. The same can be \ntrue with the exchange set up in this legislation. The person could buy \namong different competing private plans that offer health insurance on \nthe exchange or a person can go outside the exchange because he or she \nthinks they can get a better deal, if that person wants to.\n  So I just want to make it clear that we are encouraging choice. We \nare encouraging competition. And I might say that under the \nlegislation, Members of Congress who fully participate in this will be \ncoequal with others. If there is a private option, Members of Congress \ncan participate in that as well. In fact, we are requiring Senators and \ntheir staffs--they do not have to participate in the exchange, but it \nis certainly available to them, and they can opt out if they want to.\n  Let me just say a little bit about Medicare Advantage. What does \nMedPAC say about Medicare Advantage? Several years ago, Congress \nestablished an advisory board that is now called MedPAC to advise them \non how Medicare should pay providers in traditional fee for service and \nprivate health insurers in Medicare Advantage. Again, Medicare \nAdvantage is with private companies. They have executives. They have \nstockholders. They are private companies. MedPAC advises us how much \nCongress should pay MedPAC and other Medicare providers in traditional \nfee for service. It is an independent agency. Its experts are \nnonpartisan, highly respected.\n  Each year, they send a report to Congress that examines issues in \nMedicare. Here is what MedPAC had to say about the current state of \nMedicare Advantage in its 2009 June report. I am going to quote now \nfrom this independent advisory panel:\n\n       First, we estimate that in 2009 Medicare pays about $12 \n     billion more for enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans than \n     it would if it were fee-for-service Medicare.\n\n  Second:\n\n       Current high payments have resulted in some plans that \n     bring no innovation but simply mimic fee-for-service Medicare \n     at a much higher cost to the program.\n\n  In other words, they are saying that Medicare Advantage plans get \npaid for a lot more but with no innovation compared to the fee-for-\nservice Medicare.\n  MedPAC says:\n\n       This situation is unfair to taxpayers and beneficiaries not \n     enrolled in Medicare Advantage who subsidize the higher \n     costs.\n\n  Well, that is pretty obvious.\n  In addition, MedPAC goes on to say:\n\n       The excessive payments encourage inefficient plans to enter \n     the program, further raising costs to Medicare.\n\n  There are so many dollars currently given to Medicare Advantage \nplans, according to MedPAC, that encourages inefficient plans to enter \nthe program. Why not? They are getting all of this extra money.\n  Further quoting:\n\n\n[[Page S12372]]\n\n\n       The cost of Medicare Advantage subsidies is borne by \n     taxpayers who finance the Medicare program and by all \n     Medicare beneficiaries via Part B premiums.\n\n  Or to say it differently, about 78 percent of Americans who are not \nin Medicare Advantage plans are paying, in effect, a $90-per-year tax \nfor which they get no benefit which goes into the Medicare Advantage \nplans.\n  In addition:\n\n       The Part B premium for all beneficiaries is increased by \n     about $3 a month, regardless of whether you receive the \n     benefit.\n\n  A couple of more quotes from MedPAC:\n\n       The additional Medicare Advantage payments hasten the \n     insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months.\n\n  That is an interesting statement. The additional payments hasten the \ninsolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months.\n  Going with quotes from MedPAC:\n\n       Although many plans are available, only some are of high \n     quality.\n\n  In addition, continuing the quote:\n\n       Only about half of the beneficiaries nationwide have access \n     to a plan that CMS rates as above average in overall plan \n     quality.\n\n  This is what MedPAC says. That is the nonpartisan expert that helps \nadvise Congress on what reimbursement levels should be.\n  We have heard day after day that this bill is cutting Medicare \nbenefits for our seniors. When my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle realized this bill does not cut, reduce, ration, or eliminate a \nsingle guaranteed benefit, they turned their argument to Medicare \nAdvantage. I think they finally recognize there are no guaranteed \nbenefits cut in this legislation, so they turn to Medicare Advantage. \nThey argue that the efficiencies and savings achieved by ending \nbillions of dollars of overpayments to these private plans will either \nend the program or dramatically cut services to beneficiaries.\n  But let's just look at the numbers. I have a chart behind me. This \nchart shows the yearly spending for Medicare Advantage in billions of \ndollars. So you can see from the chart that in the year 2009, $110 \nbillion will be spent on Medicare Advantage plans. That is the far \nleft. Moving to the right, 10 years later, in the year 2019, about $204 \nbillion is spent. So if we total it all up, about $1.7 trillion will be \nspent on Medicare Advantage plans over the next 10 years.\n  You see that little--what color is that? It is kind of orange, it is \nkind of an interesting sort of red--whatever it is, at the top of that \nchart. That represents the reduction in Medicare Advantage plan \npayments under this legislation. It is not very much, as you can tell \nby looking at the chart. It averages out, I think, to around a 10-\npercent reduction in Medicare Advantage payments.\n  So when we see these big crocodile tears, and we hear Medicare \nAdvantage is being cut; when we hear all of these dramatic statements \nthat so much is going to be taken away from seniors because Congress is \ncutting Medicare Advantage, the fact is, we are reducing the rate of \nincrease in Medicare Advantage payments by only about 10 percent, and \nunder this legislation about $1.7 trillion will be spent on Medicare \nAdvantage plans. Remember, MedPAC says these are overpayments. MedPAC \nsays this 10 percent reduction is what they should be paid.\n  Remember, too, these are private plans. These are private companies. \nIt is not Medicare. These are private companies receiving these \npayments, and they are insurance companies. It is interesting to me \nthat a lot of Members of Congress aren't too wild about insurance \ncompanies. Well, Medicare Advantage companies are insurance companies. \nThat is what they are. They are private insurance companies. They are \nprivate insurance companies. They have their private insurance company \nchief executive. They have their private insurance company officer. \nThey have their private insurance company stockholders. They have their \nprivate insurance company administrative costs and marketing expenses. \nThey are private insurance companies. That is what they are. So we \nshould not lose sight of all of that.\n  I wish to also point out that as private insurance companies, these \nMedicare Advantage plans are doing pretty well. Let me quote from an \nOppenheimer Capital analyst in a November 12 report about Medicare \nAdvantage plans. He said:\n\n       Between 2006 and 2009, we estimate that Medicare Advantage \n     accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in gross \n     profits among the larger plans in the industry, highlighted \n     by an estimated gross profit increase of $1.9 billion in \n     2009, relative to commercial risk earnings gains of nearly \n     $600 million.\n\n  Commercial risk earnings gains are the ordinary health insurance \ncompanies, but 75 percent of the gross profit increase was under \nMedicare Advantage plans, not traditional health insurance.\n  I might say, too--I don't have the papers; maybe I can find them. It \nis worth noting, it underlines the point that these are private \ncompanies. It is not traditional Medicare.\n  Here it is. Because it is interesting, let's look at the compensation \nof these insurance company executives of these Medicare Advantage \nplans, the CEOs. The total compensation of a CEO at Aetna is $24 \nmillion a year. The total compensation of the CEO at Coventry is $9 \nmillion a year; at Wellcare, $8 million; at Humana, $4.7 million a \nyear; and at United Health Care, $3 million. Now, people should be able \nto make some money and officers of companies should be able to do OK, \nbut here we are talking about very high salaries that these insurance \ncompanies pay to their top executives. Frankly, if there is a 10-\npercent reduction in the $1.7 trillion over 10 years, they could, you \nwould think, take some of that 10 percent maybe in salary reduction or \ndividends to stockholders, make other cost savings. It doesn't have to \ncome out of the beneficiaries. It is they, the executives, who are \nmaking these decisions of where the 10-percent reduction is allocated.\n  Bottom line, I just wish to say I am not opposed to Medicare \nAdvantage plans. Frankly, I think it is good we have Medicare Advantage \nplans. Medicare Advantage plans provide the competition to Medicare. \nThey help keep the system on its toes. But we have an obligation as \nMembers of this Senate to the taxpayers and to seniors to cut waste and \nto cut overpayments in a way that does not harm beneficiaries. These \nare reductions recommended to Congress by the best advisory board of \nexperts we could find. They didn't just come out of thin air and \nMembers of Congress thought this up. This was recommended to us by the \nMedPAC advisory board.\n  Second, there is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to seniors. That \nis absolute. There is no reduction in guaranteed benefits to Medicare \nAdvantage participants. So A, we are being fair. This chart shows it. \nWe are trying to find the right level of reimbursement set up in a way \nso there is no reduction in beneficiaries' benefits. In fact, in this \nlegislation, we add more benefits for Medicare participants, Medicare \nAdvantage, as well as traditional fee-for-service Medicare. I might add \nin this legislation we give an increase to Medicare Advantage plans \nthat show demonstrated improvement in quality.\n\n  As I mentioned, MedPAC said a lot of these plans are totally \ninefficient. A lot of these plans have no coordinated care. A lot of \nthese plans don't have any quality, but they get the extra money. So we \nare saying let's get to a compensation level that is fair. We do it on \na competitive bidding basis, take the average bid for an area, and we \nalso say let's make sure there is no reduction in guaranteed benefits \nat the same time. I think that is a responsible thing to do.\n  So all of these arguments, these sound bites, frankly, that you hear \nfrom the other side of the aisle are just that, they are sound bites. \nThey are not the honest analysis of what is going on.\n  So I encourage us to keep in mind, keep in perspective what we are \ndoing so we can help provide a better health care system for our \ncountry. This is only one part of it. There are many other parts, but \nthis is just this one part.\n  How much time do we have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I see Senator Dodd is on the floor. At this time I yield \nto the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank our distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\nfor debunking what has just been said on the Senate floor by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, laying out the facts of what \nis and is not happening with Medicare Advantage. I wish to build on \nthat as well.\n  I would encourage anyone who is interested to go to the Web site of \nAARP, one of the organizations we know to be champions for seniors, and \ntake a look at what they say about the myth that health care reform \nwill hurt Medicare. They lay out several things. One is:\n\n       None of the health care reform proposals being considered \n     by Congress would cut Medicare benefits or increase your out-\n     of-pocket costs for Medicare services.\n\n  Then, just this week, in supporting our efforts, they have put out a \nstatement, a letter, and at the end, again, they reiterated:\n\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  I find it interesting that a few years ago our colleagues quoted AARP \nall the time when we were debating the Medicare prescription drug \nbill--I would guess that every single one of our Republican colleagues \nused their support in putting forward their bill--and now they are \ntrying to disparage AARP, which is a very credible organization, \nbecause they don't agree with what AARP is saying. But I think the \nmillions of people who belong to AARP will be listening to what they \nare saying about the fact that we are not, in fact, cutting the \nguaranteed Medicare benefits.\n  In addition to that, we have the Alliance for Retired Americans and \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare all \nsaying they support what we are doing and they have debunked the \nRepublicans' scare tactics point by point.\n  So what is happening here? The reality is that colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, since the inception of Medicare, have been \nfighting even the existence of Medicare. It was Democrats and a \nDemocratic President in 1965 who passed Medicare over their objections. \nThe same arguments we are hearing today, we heard then. Now everyone \nsees that Medicare is a great American success story. But we have seen \nso many efforts.\n  In the 1990s, when I was a Member of the House, Speaker Gingrich said \nin his Contract With America in 1994 that they wanted to come in and \nchange Medicare, they couldn't directly do it so they would do it \nthrough the back door and let it ``wither on the vine''--those famous \nwords that we heard at that time in terms of trying to privatize \nMedicare, which is what I believe Medicare Advantage really is.\n  Then, recently, in the debate on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, we had 80 percent of the House Republicans support an \neffort to do away with Medicare at all, as we know it, as a guaranteed \nbenefit. Instead, give vouchers to seniors to buy from private for-\nprofit insurance companies. We know the reality of this. This is about \nthe for-profit insurance industry that right now is receiving \noverpayments. Whether it is the CBO or MedPAC--any analysis will say \nthey are receiving overpayments right now, and we are trying to ratchet \nthat back.\n\n  What is happening? Why should folks care? Of course, taxpayers care \nabout overpayments. We have maybe 15 to 20 percent of seniors right now \nwho are in the Medicare Advantage Program. We have been told by the \nBudget Office that 80 to 85 percent will see their premiums go up to \npay for overpayments to for-profit insurance companies. That is not \nfair. The vast majority of seniors and people with disabilities would \nsee their premiums go up under Medicare to pay for for-profit insurance \ncompanies that try to get a piece of the action under Medicare.\n  Secondly, we know the Medicare Advantage Program, as the chairman has \nsaid, and in reading the report, has actually made the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund worse. It is going to run out of money sooner if we \ndon't stop these overpayments. Our legislation, rather than having it \nrun out of money 18 months earlier, will increase the solvency by 5 \nyears. We are committed to increasing and continuing the solvency of \nthe trust fund and protecting Medicare for the future. We believe it is \na great American success story. We are proud that Democrats were the \nones who created Medicare, with a Democratic President. We are proud \nthat it is Democrats now who are coming forward to be able to make sure \nwe protect Medicare for the future.\n  What is happening here is that we are seeing a variety of stalling \ntactics, a variety of efforts on the other side not only to stop us \nfrom moving forward on health insurance reform, but efforts time and \ntime again to protect the for-profit insurance companies.\n  For the record, I want to read to you the list of Medicare benefits \neveryone receives now, which will continue regardless of this--whether \nwe cut back on some of the profits of the for-profit insurance \ncompanies: inpatient hospital care and nurses; doctor office visits; \nlaboratory tests and preventive screenings; skilled nursing; hospice \ncare; home health care; prescription drugs; ambulance services; durable \nmedical equipment, such as wheelchairs; emergency room care; kidney \ndialysis; outpatient mental health care; occupational physical therapy; \nimaging, such as x rays, CT scans, and so forth; organ transplants, and \na ``welcome to Medicare'' physical.\n  They are all covered now and will be covered under this legislation. \nThe difference is we are going to take the overpayment to the for-\nprofit insurance companies and put it back into Medicare to reduce the \ncost of prescription drugs, which has become the infamous doughnut \nhole, the gap in coverage. We will begin to close that by taking the \nexcess profit for the for-profit companies and putting it back into \nMedicare. We are going to reduce the premiums seniors pay for drugs and \nmedical care and eliminate copays so that people can get preventive \ncare without a fee, and we are going to strengthen Medicare for the \nfuture.\n  I will wrap up by saying this: This legislation, in total, is about \nsaving lives, about saving money, and about saving Medicare. We admit \nour goal is not to save the profits of the for-profit insurance \ncompanies. We are guilty of that. We are focused on making sure \nMedicare is strong, vibrant, and solvent for our future generations, as \nwell as our seniors today. By the way, we are going to make sure we are \nsaving lives and money in the process.\n  I strongly urge us to oppose any effort that is put forward that \nwould be done in the interest of the insurance industry and at the \nexpense of seniors in America. That is what these efforts to commit are \nall about. I hope we will reject them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend our colleague \nfrom Michigan, who is a member of the Finance Committee and has been a \nstalwart defender of the traditional Medicare Program and of our \nelderly not only in her State but around the country. She has offered, \nI think, some very cogent and worthwhile information this morning once \nagain on this subject matter.\n  We keep going around and around in this debate. It is a little \nfrustrating because we are talking about basically whether we are going \nto limit to some degree the profits of some private insurance companies \nthat are under the rubric of something called Medicare Advantage. \nAgain, these are private companies that are receiving subsidies, \nsupported by Medicare beneficiaries and the taxpayers of this country. \nWe are not talking about eliminating Medicare Advantage but rather--we \nhad a big chart a few minutes ago. We will get it in a few minutes. It \nshows we are not eliminating the program, we are restraining profit \ngrowth in the program.\n  We are rewarding Medicare Advantage in the bill, as the chairman \npointed out. Based on performance and quality, we actually give bonuses \nin Medicare Advantage--contrary to the arguments you have heard by \nthose who are heralding Medicare Advantage, despite the fact that the \nvery companies who argued for it to begin with, promised they were \ngoing to prove how they could reduce costs and be more efficient. In \nfact, today, it is quite the opposite. Right now the government pays \nthese Medicare Advantage insurance companies $1.14 to do the same thing \nfor seniors that Medicare does for $1. That is basically, on average, \nwhat it amounts to.\n  The question is, can we reduce the cost of the overpayments, which \nare basically ending up in the pockets of insurance companies? There is \nnothing wrong with profits in private companies, but let's declare them \nwhat they\n\n[[Page S12374]]\n\nare. This is not traditional Medicare. They are private companies that \nare anxious not only, I presume, to provide benefits to their \nbeneficiaries, but they are also looking to make a profit. There is \nnothing wrong with that, but since the premiums were set by statute, \nand we have an obligation to try to keep our costs down, we are trying \nto do so because the promises that were made have not been kept. The \ncosts are vastly exceeding the promises made.\n  The amendment we are going to hear about from our friends on the \nother side is nothing more than a recycled compilation of some of the \n``greatest hits'' we have heard: stalling with arcane obstruction \ntactics, while standing up for some of the private companies--and I \nhave no objection to standing up for private companies that do a good \njob, but when you do so at the expense of scaring seniors with baseless \nclaims, then I do object. That is what is going on here because, quite \nfrankly, today almost 80 percent of our elderly are paying $90 a year \nin additional premium costs, without getting any benefit from it \nwhatsoever, to provide benefits under the Medicare Advantage Program. \nThat is not equitable. The 80 percent of our elderly need to know that \nthey are being disadvantaged by this.\n  What the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Max Baucus, is \ntrying to do is bring some equity back into this. He pointed out--and \nit deserves being repeated--that nothing in the bill does away with \nMedicare Advantage. We are trying to get it back to a sense of reality \nand not, again, disadvantage 80 percent of our seniors.\n  Right now, there is Medicare ``disadvantage''--that is what it ought \nto be called, because that is what it does--disadvantages. Why should \n80 percent of the elderly in this country pay higher premiums, with no \nbenefits, at the expense of the 20 percent who are going to get some \nsmall advantage under this--but very little, because most of it ends up \nin profits. I will tell you why that happens in a minute.\n  To make my point, according to the Oppenheimer Capital analyst Carl \nMcDonald, in a report issued a month ago:\n\n       Between 2006 and 2009, we estimate that Medicare Advantage \n     accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in gross \n     profits among the larger plans in the industry, highlighted \n     by an estimated gross profit increase of $1.9 billion in \n     2009, relative to commercial risk earnings gains of nearly \n     $600 million.\n\n  I know the chairman of the Finance Committee made that point. \nSeventy-five percent of the increase in gross profits came from the \nMedicare Advantage plans. These profits come out of the pockets of the \nAmerican taxpayer because of the subsidies and, of course, the Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are paying those extra dollars every year, without \nreceiving any of the benefits at all. Our bill will protect and \nstrengthen Medicare and extend the life of the trust fund, as you have \nheard over and over again. That is not a fact to dispute. That is a \nfact. We extend the life of the Medicare Program. Part of the way our \nbill adds to the use of Medicare is to eliminate wasteful overpayments. \nThese are overpayments far beyond what was anticipated when the program \nwas written.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the government pays insurance companies \nin the Medicare Advantage Program $1.14 to do the very same things for \nseniors that traditional Medicare does for $1. So those are the \noverpayments we are trying to rein in. There is no evidence these \nwasteful overpayments do anything to improve the care of our seniors. \nAt the same time, they speed Medicare's descent into bankruptcy and \nraise premiums for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Our bill would end that waste and use the money we save to help \nseniors pay for prescription drugs by closing the doughnut hole. For \nthe second time in less than a week, our friends on the other side are \nusing these tactics to halt progress completely, fighting for these \nprofits and overpayments that, again, come out of the hide of taxpayers \nand our elderly.\n  If you look at this chart, if you extend to 2019, almost 10 years \nfrom now, what is the difference between what our bill does and what \nthose who want no change do? The difference is $20 billion. In the \npost-reform period, in 2019, it is $183 billion going to Medicare \nAdvantage. What the opposition wants is to hold it at $204 billion in \n2019. That is $20 billion. That is the savings we are looking for in \norder to reduce overpayments and provide those resources to the elderly \nso they can afford prescription drugs.\n  If you want to side with these companies--they are still going to \nmake a profit. This will not deprive them of that. The profit margins \nwill be far more realistic and it will reduce subsidies, as well as \noverpayments being made by the elderly who receive nothing from this \nprogram at all.\n  Let me make my case on this point. Senator Stabenow listed the \nguaranteed benefits under Medicare. The chairman did it as well. Also, \nwe add benefits as a result of our bill. In addition to the inpatient \nhospital care, doctor office visits, lab tests, kidney dialysis, \nemergency care, occupational therapy, organ transplants--all of these \nissues--we also do things in our bill that are not available presently. \nWe reduce the size of the Medicare doughnut hole. That is an added \nbenefit that does not exist today. We reduce premiums to pay for drugs \nand medical care. We eliminate the copays. What an advantage that is \nhere. Ask yourself whether you would like to eliminate copays or watch \nprivate companies make an additional $20 billion in 10 years. Which is \nthe better choice? Ask the overwhelming majority of seniors which they \nwould rather have--an elimination of the copays they are paying today, \nor continue to provide excess profits for the companies here that have \nmade so much under the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  Lastly, of course, and most important, we help keep Medicare solvent. \nPeople say: Give me some examples on why the differences exist between \nMedicare and Medicare Advantage. I have a couple of examples from my \nhome State that I think highlight the point. These come from the Center \nfor Medicare Advocacy, or CMA, which is a nonprofit organization, as my \ncolleagues know, that does casework on behalf of individuals who need \nassistance dealing with Medicare Advantage plans. They provided two \ncases from my State. I presume most of my colleagues could find cases \nin their own States.\n\n  A woman living in Madison, CT, a shoreline community in Connecticut, \nhad Lou Gehrig's disease, ALS. We are all familiar with ALS. We know \nthe stories people go through with that disease. She was in a Medicare \nAdvantage plan. She was denied coverage for home health care because \nshe was said to be ``stable.'' That was the quote, ``she was stable.'' \nThat is not a valid reason for denial, and she was hardly stable with \nALS. CMA, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, had to go to Federal court \nto get her care covered despite firm written support regarding her \nmedical condition from her doctors.\n  Here is a woman under Medicare Advantage with ALS being declared by \nMedicare Advantage ``she was stable.'' Her doctors said anything but \nthe case.\n  When my friends talk about rationing of care under the present \nsystem, here is Medicare Advantage, a private firm, making a medical \ndecision that should have been made between her and her doctor. They \neventually got it overturned, but they had to go to Federal court to \nget it overturned. That would not have happened under Medicare. If she \nhad been under Medicare, she would have gotten that help, no questions \nasked.\n  When people say there is no distinction, this is a live case.\n  Let me give the second one. A woman from Vernon, CT, and her husband \ntraveled to Florida to visit their daughter living there. When she got \nto Florida, she fell down and sustained some physical injuries. While \nbeing treated at a Florida hospital for her injuries, it was discovered \nthat she had a brain tumor, the reason she had the fall. She had no \nidea of this beforehand.\n  The Medicare Advantage plan covered treatment for the fall as an \nemergency--which Medicare Advantage plans must cover, even out of \nnetwork, by the way--but not any diagnosis or treatment for the brain \ntumor.\n  The woman had another daughter who was a nurse who lived in Utah. So \nthey traveled from Florida to Utah where she went for the cancer \ntreatment for the brain tumor. While undergoing chemotherapy, this \nwoman had a\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\nlife-threatening reaction to one of the medications from which she \nalmost died. The Medicare Advantage plan denied coverage for all of \nthis care because it was out of network. She was in Utah. They said no, \nleaving the client and her husband with $100,000 in bills.\n  Again, the Center for Medicare Advocacy went to court and battled \nagainst this decision. They were successful in recovering $90,000 out \nof the $100,000. This woman is now deceased, but she and her family \nwere left with over $10,000 in bills, all of which would have been \ncovered under traditional Medicare, but she had gone into a Medicare \nAdvantage plan. In both instances, they would have avoided having to go \nto Federal court, having to fight as hard as they did, going through \nthe trauma and turmoil. It is bad enough you have to wrestle with \ncancer or wrestle with a brain tumor, but then you get saddled with \n$100,000 in bills and Medicare would have taken care of them. This \nMedicare Advantage Program disadvantaged her in the process.\n  These are examples of how private Medicare Advantage does not always \noperate in good faith. They are not always there when you need them.\n  There are significant differences between Medicare Advantage and \nMedicare. With traditional Medicare, you know what services you get.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nservices so people can read about it, if people have not already done \nthat.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       No one is removing Medicare benefits. Every senior in \n     America will still get these benefits: Inpatient Hospital \n     Care and Nurses; Doctor's Office Visits; Laboratory Tests and \n     Preventive Screenings; Prescription Drugs; Ambulance \n     Services; Durable Medical Equipment--i.e., Wheelchairs; \n     Emergency Room Care; Kidney Dialysis; Outpatient Mental \n     Health Care; Occupational and Physical Therapy; Imaging (X-\n     rays, CTs, and EKGs); Organ Transplants; and ``Welcome to \n     Medicare'' Physical.\n       And under our legislation: Reduces the Size of the Medicare \n     ``Donut Hole''; Reduces premiums seniors pay for drugs and \n     medical care; Eliminates copays; and Helps keep Medicare \n     solvent.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, all medically necessary hospital care and \ndoctor office visits are covered under Medicare. You know you can get \nthese services from any Medicare provider anywhere in the country. Out \nof network you get this kind of help, whether you are in Utah, Florida, \nor Vernon, CT, where one woman was from. Medicare would have provided \nthat care. Here she was bouncing around the country and denied one \nplace after another under Medicare Advantage. With traditional \nMedicare, she would not have had to worry about a private insurance \nplan playing games with her coverage.\n  The Medicare Advantage plans run the show. They change the benefits. \nCost sharing goes on. This is why Medicare Advantage is not like \ntraditional Medicare. So when people say it is just like Medicare, no, \nit is not just like Medicare. If you doubt me, then call that family in \nMadison, CT, or call that woman's family from Vernon, CT. Ask them \nwhether Medicare Advantage is just like Medicare. You will get an \nearful from them on what they went through.\n  We should be clear that we are not eliminating Medicare Advantage. \nAgain, I appreciate Senator Baucus making this point. It needs to be \nmade over and over again. We are not eliminating it at all. We are \nreducing payments to private plans and making the system work more \nuniformly. We actually give bonus payments for care coordination and \nquality improvements. These plans can use those payments to improve \nbenefits for beneficiaries. So we are hardly eliminating it. We are \nmaking it work better.\n  I have serious reservations about how this plan operates, I will say \nthat, but I would not advocate on the floor of the Senate the \nelimination of Medicare Advantage. I do want to make it work better, \nand I do want to cut back when we have overpayments occurring. I don't \nthink it is fair that 80 percent of the seniors in my State or \nelsewhere are paying $90 a year extra to cover this program and get \nnone of the help from it and people under Medicare Advantage, who could \nhave been protected, are not because they opted to be in that plan and \nthen found out it is anything but what they thought it was.\n  We are going to hear these arguments over and over about Medicare \nAdvantage. A little truth in advertising is necessary here. So people \nunderstand, it is not Medicare and it is not an advantage, not under \nthe present system, not at all. That is what we have been trying to say \nover and over again here so people understand.\n  This is a good bill. This is a solid bill. This took a tremendous \namount of work in the Finance Committee, which had the responsibility \nof crafting these provisions which are highly complicated and very \ndelicate in what they do. What we have done is preserve and strengthen \nour Medicare system, expanding benefits for people, eliminating copays, \nallowing those preventive and screening services to be available to our \nelderly, seeing to it they will have prescription drugs at lower costs. \nThat is all in this bill. That is a great advantage.\n  What a tragedy it would be if in these next few days, after all the \ndebate, that we lose all the work that has been done to make these \nimprovements in our health care system.\n  I commend my colleague from Montana and my colleagues on the \ncommittee who worked so hard to put this bill together, this balance \ntogether that can make a great difference in people's lives.\n  I also thank our colleague from Rhode Island for offering his \namendment, which we are going to be considering at some point when we \nget to vote occasionally on some matters here. I hope at some point we \nget to do that. We have done it a couple of times. There has been over \na year of debate and discussion. I think the American people want to \nsee some action.\n  We think we have a good bill. It is going to take on important market \ninsurance reforms that ensure Americans can get access to health care \npromised by their insurance plans. It is going to make sure if someone \nloses his or her job, they can get insurance. It is going to improve \nthe quality of health care and focus our system more on prevention and \nwellness.\n  On top of all these things, it is going to reduce the deficit. As we \nhave heard over and over again, CBO is talking about saving $130 \nbillion in the first 10 years and $650 billion in the second.\n  I have to say something. The other day we got the news that CBO said \nthe premiums on the individual plans, the small business plans and the \nlarge business plans, are actually going to reduce premiums costs by as \nmuch as 20 percent in one area, and 3 percent in another. I would have \nthought there would be wild applause. Even those who oppose the bill \nwould have said: Isn't this great news? What we got was almost a deep \ndisappointment that CBO gave us a report that people are actually going \nto save money under this bill. All of a sudden they attack CBO because \nthey did not like the results coming out of CBO. I guarantee had they \ncome back and said they are going to increase premiums, we all would be \ntalking about that. Here we get a report that actually we are going to \nsave premium costs, reduce the costs to the Federal budget as has been \npointed out.\n  Senator Whitehouse is going to offer an amendment that makes clear \nthese savings we are talking about are used to strengthen Social \nSecurity, reduce the deficit, and contribute to the long-term solvency \nof the CLASS Act, that it will be for that purpose and that purpose \nalone.\n  The third part of his amendment is particularly important. Many of \nour colleagues have come to the floor in the last few days to claim the \nCLASS Act will be a long-term drain on the budget. It is not true. \nThanks to our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, the CLASS \nAct will be required by law to be solvent for 75 years. This was not in \nour original proposal. It was added in the HELP Committee markup by \nSenator Gregg, and I thank him for it.\n  The Gregg amendment was unanimously adopted in our markup. CBO says \nit produces $72 billion in savings for the Federal Government over the \nfirst 10 years of its existence and it will save nearly $2 billion for \nMedicaid.\n  We further added language to the bill to require the Secretary to \nmaintain enough reserves after the first 10 years to pay off any claims \nthat may emerge. We have included language to prevent\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\nFederal appropriations from being used to pay benefits to ensure the \nprogram is self-funded.\n  Finally, at the request of several Senators, the distinguished \nmajority leader made sure we did not use any of the savings in the \nCLASS Act for any other purpose than to pay for the CLASS Act itself. \nThis amendment offered by Senator Whitehouse will give Senators a \nchance to commit themselves to that purpose. Senators who claim the \nCLASS Act will hurt the Federal budget, of course, should vote for this \namendment because statutorily it will prohibit any of those funds from \nbeing used for any other purpose other than for the CLASS Act and the \nrecipients who want to use them. I commend him for that move and thank \nhim. When that vote occurs, I urge colleagues to vote for the \nWhitehouse amendment.\n  Lastly, I ask unanimous consent to be included as a cosponsor, along \nwith my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, of Senator Coburn's \namendment No. 2789 which adds Members of Congress to the public option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we added that provision to the HELP \nCommittee bill. Senator Coburn offered that amendment. Senator Kennedy, \nmyself, and others voted for that Coburn amendment. I think it may have \nshocked the Senator from Oklahoma at the time that we actually voted \nfor his amendment. I know Senator Brown has been added as a cosponsor. \nI have no objection to that amendment. That is how much I think the \npublic option would be worth. If we have a public option in this plan--\nand my hope is we will--there is nothing wrong with insisting Members \nof Congress be included in that public option proposal. His amendment \nsuggests that. We supported it in committee, and I am prepared to \nsupport it again on the floor of the Senate.\n  I point out, I wish we could get Members as well who are reluctant to \nsupport this bill to recognize that as Members of Congress today, we \nall have pretty good health care plans under the Federal employees \nbenefits package, some 23 options every year that are available to us, \nalong with the 8 million Federal employees in this country under those \nplans. I wish we could get others to recognize how valuable that is to \nall of us and our fellow Federal employees. Unfortunately, that does \nnot seem to be the case.\n\n  I hope before this is concluded we will have far more support for \nthis effort we have crafted and provided to our colleagues for their \nconsideration.\n  Again I compliment the Finance Committee and my friend from Montana \nfor the work he has done on this issue. It is very well thought out, \nvery balanced and fair.\n  I said this over and over: I challenge any Member to come to the \nfloor and identify a single guaranteed benefit under Medicare that is \ncut out under this bill. There is not one. Three days have gone by \nsince I made the charge that not a single guaranteed benefit under \nMedicare is cut. You will not find one; not one.\n  I see my friend from Wyoming has come to the floor. I know I have \nprobably gone over my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are playing things by ear. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Wyoming be recognized to speak \nfor debate only, and at a later point, we will figure out allocation of \ntime on both sides, if he wishes to speak now.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, Mr. President, I wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I would be in \ncharge of the next 30 minutes and then it would revert to the other \nside for 30 minutes after that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might modify that so this side gets the next 30 minutes \nafter that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. It is also my understanding that at any time there is an \nagreement to vote, we will cancel out what we are doing. But there is \nno agreement yet.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for setting up my speech so \nwell. He said there was not anyplace that anybody can show any decline \nin guaranteed benefits. With what I am about to say, I will try to do \nthat. Of course, the words ``guaranteed benefits'' do not show up \nanywhere in what we are doing. ``Benefits'' does but not ``guaranteed \nbenefits.'' In my opinion, getting to be in a nursing home or being \nable to see a doctor, some of those ought to be considered guaranteed \nbenefits. I will get into that a little bit in my speech and cover some \nof these areas that I think are very important to seniors. I am opposed \nto the $\\1/2\\ trillion of Medicare cuts in the Reid bill that are not \ngoing only to solve Medicare.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have attempted to argue this bill \ndoes not cut the Medicare Program. They further said that such cuts are \njustified and will not harm the program. They have also argued that no \nbeneficiaries will lose their benefits--their guaranteed benefits. They \nare very careful on that, and I understand why they are careful on that \nbecause there are other benefits that are being cut that will be \nconsidered by those people who will lose that benefit to be a \nguaranteed benefit.\n  Unfortunately, all of those statements are false. It does not matter \nhow many times my colleagues repeat these claims, they do not become \nany more accurate. This bill cuts $464 billion from the Medicare \nProgram. It slashes payments to hospitals, nursing homes, home health \nagencies, and hospices. These are cuts to the Medicare Program, and I \neven have the page numbers on those.\n  The moneys from these cuts do not go to shore up Medicare. The money \ngoes to new programs for others. These cuts will affect the care \nprovided to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  The American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes, \nsaid the cuts in the Reid bill would force layoffs, lower salaries, \nreduce benefits, and ultimately would hurt patients' quality of care. A \ncommission was set up to make even more cuts to save Medicare. It is in \nthe bill. There is a commission in there.\n  So with the side deals that have been made with lobbyists, the only \nplace these cuts can come from is from seniors. I will cover that in a \nlittle more detail later. I have heard similar statements from home \nhealth providers, that is more than $40 billion in cuts; hospice \nproviders, which is $8 billion in cuts; and hospitals, which is $130 \nbillion in cuts. If these Medicare cuts go into effect, it could drive \nmany providers out of the Medicare Program. That will mean patients do \nnot have the care they expect and they need.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have accused us of trying to scare \nMedicare beneficiaries. If seniors are scared by our statements, they \nshould be terrified by what the administration has to say about the \nDemocrats' health reform bill. The administration's own chief actuary, \nRichard Foster, recently wrote that the steep Medicare cuts in the \nHouse-passed health reform bill would make it difficult for many \nproviders to remain profitable and cause them to end their \nparticipation in Medicare. He went on to note this could jeopardize \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to care.\n  As the senior Senator from Tennessee noted yesterday, it is the \nMedicare cuts in the Reid bill that are actually scaring seniors. \nMedicare beneficiaries understand that if providers are no longer able \nto take Medicare patients, they--the seniors--will not get care. A lot \nof grandmas and grandpas have figured it out, and they are not going to \nstand for it.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has repeatedly said this bill \nwill not cut or reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefit. That statement \nseems to ignore what this bill will do to providers. If a Medicare \npatient cannot get into a nursing home, they do not have nursing home \nbenefits. If they can't find a home health aide willing to take \nMedicare patients, they do not have home health benefits. So the \npromise for coverage, when you can't get a doctor to see you, is not \nhealth care. You don't have benefits if you can't get a provider to \ntreat you. Unfortunately, that is exactly what this bill will do.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have also attempted to justify the \nMedicare cuts in the Reid bill by arguing that many of the trade \nassociations\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\nrepresenting health care providers have endorsed this bill. They are \ncorrect that several Washington-based trade associations and their \nlobbyists have endorsed the Reid bill. It is probably worth exploring \nwhy some of the groups have chosen to endorse this legislation.\n  In some cases, motivation is obvious. Some drug manufacturers are \nclearly motivated by self-interest and greed. They negotiated a secret \ndeal with the White House that will actually increase what Medicare \nspends on brand-name drugs--brand-name drugs. They didn't touch the \ngenerics. They are interested in the brand-name drugs.\n  Under the terms of their deal, the drug manufacturers will provide \ndiscounts on brand-name prescription drugs when the seniors are in the \nMedicare coverage gap--known as the doughnut hole. They make the \npayments directly to the customer. It doesn't go through Medicare but \ndirectly to the customer. That way they can maintain the customer \ncontact and keep them addicted to the brand name.\n  Generics are cheaper. A lot of people, when they go to the doughnut \nhole, switch to generics because that saves them money, and it saves us \nmoney. When they get through the doughnut hole, they will stay with \nwhatever they are on while in the doughnut hole. So if they are forced \nto stay on a brand name to get a little extra discount as they go \nthrough the doughnut hole, they will stay with the brand name when the \ntaxpayers are paying for it when it goes above the doughnut hole, which \nis the rest of the year. That could be a huge number. So while it looks \ngenerous by the drug companies, beware; their generosity is suspect \nwith what they will make when it gets through the doughnut hole.\n  Under the terms of the sweetheart deal between the White House and \nthe drugmakers, discounts are provided for these brand-name drugs. This \nwill encourage seniors to continue to get those more expensive drugs, \nand it will actually cost the taxpayers $15 billion because the deal \nwill actually increase Medicare costs.\n  In other cases, provider groups were promised special deals if they \nagreed to support the Reid bill--or whatever bill we were working on at \nthat time. For instance, recent press reports have described how the \nAmerican Medical Association was promised a permanent fix to the \nMedicare payment formula for doctors if they agreed to support this \nbill or a 1-year fix if there was an end to junk lawsuits. Under \ncurrent law, doctors' Medicare payments are scheduled to be cut by more \nthan 40 percent over the next decade. That is already in place. That is \nnot a part of the bill. The cost of fixing the flawed government-\nmandated formula will be more than $250 billion. We know that because \nwe have debated it on the Senate floor, and we decided we were going to \nhave to pay for that if we were going to do it.\n  So let's see, $464 billion in Medicare money we are using on other \nthings. That is why I keep saying Medicare money only ought to go to \nMedicare benefits, and that $250 billion for the doctors' fix might \nmake it possible for people to see the doctors.\n  I can understand why doctors want to fix this flawed government \nprice-control system--and that is what it is because they are telling \nthe doctors what they can charge a customer, regardless of how long a \ntime it is going to take them to take care of that patient. For a lot \nof them, they have discovered it costs more than what they are able to \nget. If they continue to do that, they have to go out of business. That \nis kind of the small business philosophy: You take in less money than \nwhat it costs to be in business, and you are out of business. So I \ndon't think they like that kind of a government price-control system.\n  As a result, 40 percent of the doctors will not take a patient on \nMedicaid, and it is growing in percentage now on Medicare in the same \nway. When you fix the price, some people can't afford to provide it for \nthat, so they can't take those patients.\n  I was talking to a friend of mine from Florida who said: Every time \nyou call a doctor now, they say: Are you on Medicare? If you say yes, \nthey say: We are not taking any new patients.\n  If you can't see a doctor, you don't have a benefit. It shows the \nexact problems that result from letting government bureaucrats use \nprice controls to set payment rates. What I don't understand is why the \nAMA continues to support the bill when they got nothing for their deal. \nWe didn't fix the $250 billion problem, and we haven't fixed the junk \nlawsuit problem.\n  I remember the President appearing at the National Convention of the \nAmerican Medical Association and promising that there would be tort \nreform; that there would be an end to these junk lawsuits. All of our \nattempts, either in the HELP Committee or in the Finance Committee, to \neven bring that up have been either voted down or denied. As a result, \nthere is nothing in this bill that is going to solve that problem. The \nbill does nothing to fix the Medicare payment formula for the doctors. \nInstead, it cuts $464 billion from Medicare and uses that money to \ncover the uninsured.\n  Even if these cuts can be made without hurting seniors, the \nRepublicans are saying: Use the money only for Medicare. Medicare money \nfor Medicare. Medicare funds should be used to fix Medicare's problems, \nsuch as this flawed payment formula that keeps doctors from taking \nseniors. Taking hundreds of billions of dollars out of the Medicare \nProgram now will only guarantee that it will be much harder to \npermanently fix the doctor payment issue in the future.\n  I cannot understand why the AMA continues to support this terrible \ndeal for doctors. If you can't see a doctor, your benefits--your \nguaranteed benefits--have been cut. Apparently, the members of the AMA \ndon't like the deal either. At a recent convention, up to 40 percent of \nthe current membership of the AMA voted to reject this deal. I know \nthat is not a majority, but most associations survive by consensus \nagreements. That means almost all of their membership agrees with the \ntack they are taking, not just slightly more than half. Their \nmembership is less than 20 percent of all doctors. It is a dwindling \nassociation.\n\n  Let's see, less than 20 percent of the doctors had 40 percent that \nopposed it. We are getting down to some pretty small percentages of \nthose who supported what the AMA did in their deal.\n  Finally, many provider groups have been reluctant to speak out \nagainst this bill because they have received threats from the White \nHouse and congressional Democrats. Nursing homes, home health agencies, \nand hospice providers have all reportedly been threatened with further \ncuts--further cuts--if they speak out against the bill. Is that freedom \nof speech, or is it just bad ethics? They have reportedly been told \nthat any public statements of opposition to the Reid bill will lead to \neven more severe cuts.\n  These providers have had to make the choice to silently accept \ndevastating cuts rather than oppose them and risk being utterly \ndestroyed. One of the Medicare Advantage providers is Humana, and I \nwill use them as an example. CMS said they couldn't let their customers \nknow what was about to happen, and chastised them for sending out a \nletter. I thought the customer deserved to know and that we were in a \nnew era of transparency. That doesn't sound very transparent to me. So \nhow can that happen in America?\n  At any rate, I hope my colleagues and the American people will take \nthese facts into account when they hear Senators talk about provider \ngroups supporting this bill. Unfortunately, health care provider \nsupport for this bill is being driven primarily by greed or stupidity \nor fear. We know this bill will not fix the problems in the American \nhealth care system. It will not lower health care costs. It will not \nlower insurance premiums. It will still leave 25 million people \nuninsured.\n  What this bill will do is spend $2.5 trillion and guarantee a much \nbigger role for the government in dictating how health care will be \nprovided in this country. If you are not under Medicare, yes, your \ngovernment is going to tell you what is adequate coverage, and they are \ngoing to force you to buy it or pay a penalty.\n  Given the recent experiences that doctors have had with Medicare \nprice controls, this is not an outcome that bodes well for America's \nhealth care providers or their patients. I remind everybody that in \nAugust there was an uproar, and that uproar continues. We don't notice \nit as much because we are not going to get to go home this weekend to \ntalk to our constituents. That\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\nmight be by design because we already know what our constituents are \nsaying.\n  They are saying: This bill is a bad deal for us. Where is the promise \nthat you were going to cut costs for us? Where are the other promises \nthat were made with this health care reform?\n  I would mention that the CBO found that premiums in the individual \nmarket will rise by 10 to 13 percent more than if Congress did nothing. \nThat is CBO. Family policies under the status quo are projected to cost \n$13,100 on the average, but under this health care bill it should jump \nto $15,200. That is not very good news for the people in my State or \nany other State. No big cost rise in U.S. premiums is seen in the \nstudy, said the New York Times.\n  The Washington Post declared: Senate health bill gets a boost. The \nWhite House crowed that the CBO report was more good news about what \nreform will mean for families struggling to keep up with skyrocketing \npremiums under the broken status quo. The Finance chairman, the Senator \nfrom Montana, chimed in from the Senate floor that health care reform \nwas fundamentally about lowering health care costs.\n  Yes, lowering costs is what health care reform is designed to do--\nlowering costs.\n  But then he said: And it will achieve this objective. Except that it \nwon't.\n  CBO says it expects employer-sponsored insurance costs to remain \nroughly in line with the status quo. That is the failure of this bill. \nMeanwhile, fixing the individual market is expensive and unstable, \nlargely because it does not enjoy the favorable tax treatment given to \njob-based coverage. You know, if you are buying insurance on your own, \nyou are not getting a tax break on it. If companies buy insurance for \nthe people working for them, they are getting a tax break.\n  In my 10 steps to solving health care, I mentioned and worked on \nmaking that fair. You have to be fair for both sides.\n  The Wyden-Bennett bill concentrates on making it fair for both sides. \nThat is one of the issues people in this country are concerned about, \nmaking it fair for both sides. This bill doesn't make it fair for both \nsides.\n  Talking about fixing the individual market, that is expensive and it \nis largely unstable, I will say again, due to the favorable tax \ntreatment given to job-based coverage which was supposed to be the \npurpose of reform. But CBO is confirming that new coverage mandates \nwill drive premiums higher.\n  Democrats are declaring victory, claiming these high insurance prices \ndon't count because they will be offset by new government subsidies. \nAbout 57 percent of the people who buy insurance through the bill's new \nexchanges that will supplant today's individual market will qualify for \nsubsidies that cover about two-thirds of the total premium so the bill \nwill increase cost but then disguise those costs by transferring them \nto taxpayers from individuals. Higher costs can be conjured away \nbecause they are suddenly on the government balance sheet.\n  The Reid bill has $371.9 billion in new health taxes that are \napparently not a new cost because they would be passed along to \nconsumers. Or perhaps they will be hidden in lost wages. This is the \npaleoliberal school of brute force wealth, redistribution and a very \nlong way from the repeated White House claims that reform is all about \nbending the cost curve. The only thing being bent here is the budget \ntruth.\n  Moreover, CBO is almost certainly underestimating the cost increases. \nBased on its county-by-county actuarial data, the insurer WellPoint has \ncalculated that this bill will cause some premiums to triple in the \nindividual market. I don't go by WellPoint, I go by what I found out in \nWyoming itself and that is an accurate picture, particularly for the \nyoung people in our State. Those who are young and healthy will see a \n300-percent increase. I think they are going to notice that. I don't \nthink they are going to be happy with it. Other associations have come \nto similar conclusions. The reason for that is the community rating, \nwhich forces insurers to charge nearly uniform rates regardless of \ncustomer health status or habits. Habits is an important one on that. \nCBO does not think this will have much of an effect, but costs \ninevitably rise when insurers are not allowed to price based on risk. \nThat is why today some 35 States impose no limits on premium variation \nand 6 allow wide differences among consumers.\n  That is not just WellPoint that is saying that. I have some peer-\nreviewed documents that also show that same thing from people from \ndifferent colleges. They have found that the State community rating \nlaws raise premiums in the individual market by 21 percent to 33 \npercent for families and 10 to 17 percent for singles. In New Jersey, \nwhich also requires the insurers to accept all comers, so-called \nguaranteed issue, premiums increased by as much as 227 percent.\n  Let's see, we just had some elections in New Jersey and things didn't \ngo well there. It probably wasn't just tied to insurance costs.\n  The political tragedy is that there are plenty of reform alternatives \nthat would reduce the cost of insurance. According to CBO, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office which we quote a lot, they did an \nevaluation on the relatively modest House GOP bill. The Republicans in \nthe House were limited to one amendment. There were three amendments \ntotal in a 1-day debate and passage of the health care bill over there. \nThat roused a lot of people in America, too. If you only get one \namendment, they had to do what we have avoided doing. We have four \ndifferent bills out there that solve what the President said he wanted \nsolved. That is not counting the Wyden-Bennett bill that also solves \nwhat the President said, that is not included in this bill.\n  What the House put together--it is relatively modest, but it would \nactually reduce premiums by 5 percent to 8 percent in the individual \nmarket in 2016 and by 7 to 10 percent for small businesses. It would \nnot increase the premiums, it would decrease the premiums.\n  The GOP reforms would also do so without imposing huge new taxes. We \nhave concentrated in the last few days about talking about the Medicare \nmoney that is being stolen to provide for the changes. We have not \ntalked yet about the extra taxes that are going to be put into place. \nThat is the other half of the package. But the Democrats do not care \nbecause this bill, they say, is about lowering costs. No, it is about \nputting Washington in charge of health insurance at any cost.\n  I see the Senator from Wyoming is here. We have 10 minutes remaining \non our time. If the Senator wishes to make some additional comments? He \nand I have been traveling in Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the time to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Wyoming, with \nwhom I have the privilege of serving, I saw a large story in USA Today. \nThis story says ``Senate Keeps Medicare Cuts in the Bill.''\n  What it says is:\n\n       Senate Democrats closed ranks Thursday behind $460 billion \n     in politically risky Medicare cuts at the heart of health \n     care legislation.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Approval would have stripped out money to pay for expanded \n     coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans.\n\n  As I read this, it says the Republicans tried to keep the Medicare \nmoney for people on Medicare, but the Democrats want to take $460 \nbillion away from seniors who depended upon Medicare and use it to \nstart a whole new government program. Am I reading this correctly?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is the way I read it. That is the way the people in \nWyoming are reading it and that is apparently the way people all over \nthe country are reading it, particularly seniors. Seniors are the ones \nupset about what is happening and it is easy to see why. Even though \nthe AARP says this is a good bill, they are saying: Wait a minute. I \nknow people in the nursing home. I know people--some of them are saying \nI am in the nursing home. I am hearing what is going to happen at my \nnursing home if these cuts go into place.\n  As I said continually, we can call them anything we want but the \nseniors are saying those are cuts. Those are cuts in my benefits. Those \nare cuts in what I expect. Those are cuts in what I have been getting. \nWhether you call it guaranteed benefit or just plain old\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\nbenefits or whatever it is, they are saying, yes, we are being cut.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would say when my colleague from \nWyoming and I held townhall meetings around the State of Wyoming, \npeople have said don't cut our Medicare. Yet what I see this bill doing \nis cutting our Medicare and specifically, right now, there are \nthousands of people in Wyoming who are on a program called Medicare \nAdvantage. There is an advantage to this program. That is why so many \nAmericans have signed up for the program.\n  As a matter of fact, about one in four Americans who depend upon \nMedicare for their health care in this country has chosen Medicare \nAdvantage, because there are some advantages being in this program \ncalled Medicare Advantage: dental, vision, hearing, fitness. Also, as a \npracticing doctor for 25 years, taking care of families in Wyoming, \nwhat I saw, the reason they liked this, if they were on Medicare, is \nbecause it dealt with prevention and it actually helped coordinate \ncare.\n  One of the things Medicare does not do as well is coordinate care and \nwork with prevention. We know how important prevention is in helping \npeople keep down the cost of their care--how good it is in terms of \ngiving people opportunities to stay healthy. That is why they call it \nprevention.\n  The bill in front of us, as I see it--I ask the Senator from \nWyoming--is a bill that is going to cut $120 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage, the program the people in our State like?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Wyoming is absolutely correct. We are \ngetting a lot of calls and mail, letters about that. Another thing the \nPresident promised, of course, is that everybody would have \ncatastrophic coverage. It fascinates me that the Wyoming people and the \npeople across America have figured out that Medicare doesn't have \ncatastrophic coverage. But Medicare Advantage provides catastrophic \ncoverage as well as a number of other things that Medicare does not \ncover. I think they realize, too, that if Medicare Advantage goes away, \nyes, they can get Medigap but Medigap is more expensive. It is also \ninteresting that the AARP sells Medigap.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I actually heard somebody say Medicare Advantage is not \nMedicare. But if you turn to the Centers for Medicare Services' 2010 \nOfficial Government Handbook--we are going to go into 2010 next month. \nIf you go to the official handbook for 2010, and the handbook is called \n``Medicare And You,'' it says a Medicare Advantage plan is ``another \nhealth coverage choice you may have as part of Medicare.'' People who \nactually look at this choose this. They make the choice because they \nsay this is a good deal for me. That is what Americans want. They want \nto get value for their money.\n  A recent poll said, in terms of Americans, when they send money to \nCongress, how much of that do they get back in value? They think about \n50 cents on the dollar. That is a national Gallop Poll. They have been \npolling on this for a long time and it is the highest number ever of \nwhat Americans think, in terms of the fact that they are getting very \nlittle value for their tax dollars. They see games being played. That \nis what I hear when I have telephone townhall meetings in Wyoming. They \nknow Senator Reid's bill steals $464 billion from Medicare. They know \nit raids the health care program they depend upon, not to make Medicare \nstronger, not to make Medicare more solvent, but as my colleague from \nWyoming tells me, to create a brandnew entitlement program. They are \nraiding Medicare to start another government program that is itself \ngoing to be insolvent.\n  I ask my colleague from Wyoming, are you seeing what I am seeing?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am seeing what you are seeing. I am noticing some people \ndo not know what an entitlement actually is. That is a bill that goes \non forever, that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has to make \nsure that it is paid in perpetuity unless there is some other major \nCongressional action that happens. We keep paying that bill over and \nover again. I think the Senator from Wyoming recognizes entitlements \nand some of the difficulties involved with that.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, an article in Bloomberg yesterday said \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation poll released this past month found that \n60 percent of seniors said they would be better off if Congress did not \nchange the health care system.\n  We know we need to do some changes. But this massive bill, this \n2,000-page bill that weighs 20 pounds, is not the right change we need. \nFor our seniors, people who rely on Medicare for their health care, to \nabsolutely raid $464 billion from Medicare, almost $\\1/2\\ trillion, \nthere is a point where more people--the baby boomers, more and more \npeople are added to the rolls every day. To raid this program to start \na whole new government program is not the right prescription for \nAmerica. It is not what our seniors want. It is not what they signed up \nfor. It is not why they are choosing Medicare Advantage. It is because \nit is a choice they make and that is why we right now have 11 million \nAmericans who are on Medicare Advantage. We have 11 million seniors--\nthat represents almost one-quarter of all Medicare patients in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. ENZI. We are being notified our time is up. We will continue. I \nhave several letters from Wyoming organizations that I want to have \nprinted in the Record, and I will do that at a later time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a few moment ago I started to describe an \namendment that will be offered by our colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Whitehouse, regarding the CLASS Act.\n  As a bit of background, the CLASS Act is a proposal that was \noriginally conceived by a former colleague and dear friend, Ted Kennedy \nof Massachusetts, years ago, the idea behind it being that we ought to \ntry to figure out a way to support people in this country who end up \nwith disabilities. Their disabilities are not so dramatic that they \nwould deprive them of the opportunity to continue with work but serious \nenough that they would require some additional help in order to provide \na basic standard-of-living, either a driver, some help on food \nassistance, whatever it may be.\n  Under present disability formulas, which are basically income-\nreplacement bills, in order to get some help if you are disabled, you \nalmost have to impoverish yourself to qualify and then be restrained \nabout how much you can actually earn, if you want to continue to work. \nSo while it has been a good program and certainly has helped a lot of \npeople, in a sense there are catch-22s in it, that to qualify for it, \nyou have to divest whatever you have acquired or earned and impoverish \nyourself. Then, even though you may be capable of continuing to work, \nyou are limited on how much you can actually earn under those programs.\n  It was the vision of Senator Kennedy years ago to try to come up with \na different idea, not to replace that but an idea that might allow for \npeople who are disabled to get some help during that period of \ndisability, however long it might last, without necessarily having to \nthen impoverish themselves or to limit their outside earnings, given \nthe fact that they may be able to continue to perform and, in fact, \nwould like to continue to work.\n  The question was, how could we do this, particularly in light of the \nfact that we don't want to necessarily be adding a cost to taxpayers. \nIt was his idea to come up with a totally voluntary program that \nindividuals would have to contribute to out of their own pocketbooks, \nnot out of taxpayers pocketbooks, by putting aside resources on a \nmonthly basis over a period of years--5 in the case of this bill--where \nthe plan would become vested and then to contribute that amount \nthereafter. Then, in such case if you found yourself disabled--and \nthere are criteria that would determine whether you met those \nthresholds--you would then qualify, based on the fact that you have \npaid your own money into this program continuously, without exception, \nto receive at least about $75 a day, providing assistance to you so \nthat you might get along and be able to continue to operate without \nhaving to impoverish yourself and put limitations on your work. At $75 \na day, that would provide over $27,000 a year for those individuals who \nmeet it. Again, entirely voluntary, your money, not public money--no \ntaxpayer money goes into the plan.\n\n[[Page S12380]]\n\n  Five million people under the age of 65 living in the community have \nlong-term care needs, and there are over 70,000 workers with severe \ndisabilities in the Nation today who need daily assistance to maintain \ntheir jobs and their independence. Long-term care supports and services \nare an area that is not currently affordable or accessible for millions \nof our fellow citizens. It is estimated that 65 percent of all those \nwho are 65 or over today will spend some time at home in need of long-\nterm care services, for which average costs run at least $18,000 a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, 1\\1/2\\ million people today are in nursing homes, and \nroughly 9 million of our fellow elderly Americans will need help with \nactivities of daily living during the current year. By the year 2030, \nthat number will increase to 14 million, as we watch the baby boom \npopulation age. And while those lives will be extended and hopefully \nthe quality improved, we all accept the notion that as we get older, we \nhave greater needs physically. That certainly is something anyone over \nthe age of 65 can tell you. So as the years progress, the quality of \ncare, longevity tables increase, the number of people who will need \nsome form of services or another will jump from 9 million today to \nroughly 14 million. Those numbers are apt to increase.\n  Many people who need long-term services and supports rely on unpaid \nfamily and friends to provide that care. They have children or \ngrandchildren who are around to provide that kind of assistance. A lot \ncan't, of course. But ultimately many of these individuals have to \nimpoverish themselves to qualify for Medicaid. We know what happens. \nThey transfer the house, their assets. They shove everything over to \ntheir children or someplace else so that they qualify for that title \nXIX window. They become desperately poor, so they can then qualify for \nMedicaid, which remains the primary payer for these services. The CLASS \nAct is designed to avoid that, if we can, in as many cases as possible \nby providing a lifetime cash benefit--voluntary, totally paid for by \nthe beneficiaries--that offers seniors and people with disabilities \nsome protection against the cost of paying for long-term care services \nand supports and helps them obtain services and supports that will \nenable them to remain in their homes, reside in their communities, and, \nin many cases, continue to work.\n  Let me tell you how the program works. The program is a totally \nvoluntary, self-funded insurance program with enrollment for people who \nare currently employed. Affordable premiums will be paid through \npayroll deduction, if the individual's employer decides to participate. \nIt is totally voluntary, nothing required whatsoever. If the employer \ndoes not want to participate, the employee would have to find some \nother way. If the employer decides to allow a payroll deduction, they \ncan do that. Participation by workers, again, is entirely voluntary. \nSelf-employed people or those whose employers do not offer the benefit \nwill also be able to join this program through a government payment \nmechanism.\n  Individuals qualify to receive benefits when they need help with \ncertain activities of daily living and they have paid premiums for at \nleast 5 years and have worked for at least 3 of those 5 years. \nBeneficiaries receive lifetime cash benefits based on the degree of \nimpairment, expected to average roughly $75 a day or roughly $27,000 a \nyear. Benefits can be used to maintain independence at home or in the \ncommunity and should be sufficient to cover typical costs of home care \nservices or adult daycare. Benefits can also be used to offset the cost \nof assisted living and nursing home care.\n  Let me tell you how the improved version of this act protects the \ntaxpayer. There have been issues raised about how they are going to be \nprotected under this program. All CLASS Act benefits are paid by \nvoluntary participants, not taxpayers. The CLASS Act actually would \nsave taxpayer dollars by reducing Medicaid costs--according to CBO, \nalmost $2 billion. CLASS Act premiums must be set at a level sufficient \nto guarantee actuarial soundness of the program.\n  We thank Senator Gregg for his amendment in the debate on the CLASS \nAct bill when it came up in committee.\n  The current CLASS Act includes significant improvements over earlier \nversions, such as tighter eligibility standards, a new reserve \nrequirement, and an absolute prohibition on the use of taxpayer dollars \nto pay benefits. The Congressional Budget Office determined that the \nimproved program is totally actuarially sound.\n  This bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, creates a \nvoluntary insurance program. Under the program, working people pay \npremiums for at least 5 years before it would vest. After that point, \nif the individual has paid in for 5 years and worked for at least 3 of \nthose 5 years and develops a disability, they can receive a cash \nbenefit of no less than $50 a day for as long as that disability \npersists. Contrary to popular belief, Medicare and most private health \ninsurance only pay for long-term care for a short period, meaning that \nmost people pay out of their own income or assets or their family's \nassets to provide this kind of benefit. Those with the most intense \nneeds will frequently exhaust these assets and have to rely on \nMedicaid, thus impoverishing themselves in order to qualify.\n  The CLASS Act provides essential options for 65 percent of those age \n65 and older who will need long-term care services at some point in \ntheir lives and for the 70,000 workers with severe disabilities in the \nNation today who need daily assistance to maintain their jobs and their \nindependence.\n  It has been said that this program is not financially stable and \namounts to nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. This program, they say, \nwill create a new government entitlement program. It is not a \ngovernment entitlement program--anything but. The CLASS Act does not \nconfer rights or an obligation on the government funding, nor does it \naffect receipt of or eligibility for other benefits. The program stands \non its own financial feet.\n\n  CBO has estimated the program to be actuarially sound for the next 75 \nyears. The CLASS Act is solvent, according to the CBO. The program \nwould run only on its own cashflows. CBO estimates an average monthly \npremium of $123 for an average daily cash benefit of $75 for those who \nqualify. It may not seem like much, but over a year that would provide \nneeded assistance for those who suffer under disabilities.\n  CBO uses very conservative participation rates. CBO assumes \nparticipation rates that do not consider that CLASS would offer a \nlifetime cash benefit, be endorsed by the government, and provide a \nconvenient way for employees to auto-enroll through their employers \nwith a voluntary opt-out. All of these features would increase \nparticipation rates, which will result in lower premiums, encourage \nenrollment, and make the program even stronger financially.\n  Solvency of the program is bolstered by flexibility to adjust the \nprogram. In their November 25 letter to the Congress, the CBO \nacknowledges that the legislation gives flexibility to the Health and \nHuman Services Secretary to adjust premiums and benefits where or if \never needed. This provides a lever to ensure that the program stays \nsolvent even if real life does not perfectly mirror the models of the \nCBO, as good as they are.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office discusses, the CLASS Act would \nfunction just like any other private long-term care insurance program \nwhich finances benefit payments from a premium reserve and interest \nincome off that reserve. Due to budget scorekeeping, the CBO finds that \npremium revenue exceeds benefit payments in the third decade but does \nnot take into consideration accumulated reserves and income off those \nreserves that keep the program fiscally independent.\n  Beyond being self-supporting and voluntary, this program can actually \ngenerate savings in Medicaid. Direct offset of the $75 daily benefit is \napplied toward any Medicaid long-term care costs. Beyond that, the \nCLASS Act program will help people live independently at home or in the \ncommunity. When people with disabilities get the services they need, \nthey are less likely to spend down to get Medicaid and less likely to \nenter a nursing home or hospital, all of which generates additional \nMedicaid savings.\n  Of course, what we don't calculate here, because I don't know how one \nwould calculate it, is that notion of independence. I suspect maybe all \nof us\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\nknow people who are on Medicaid and know the frustration particularly \nof someone who is otherwise healthy but suffers from disabilities who \nwould like to work and wants to keep independent. Yet if you go into \nthe Medicaid Program, there are huge restraints on your ability to do \nso. So by this program, aside from financially reducing Medicaid costs, \nwe are actually providing that additional sense of human dignity and \ndecency that just because you have a disability and you need help \ndoesn't mean you don't want to be self-sufficient and keep \nworking. There is the gratification of knowing you are contributing in \nsome way other than being shuttered away, having impoverished yourself, \nrelying on others' assets to take care of you because you do not have \nthose resources.\n\n  Senator Kennedy generated this idea years ago, and now I think it is \nimproved because of the amendments and ideas that have been suggested \nby a number of our colleagues here, as well as others, and we have \nactually strengthened the concept to give it the kind of financial \nindependence Members want it to have, sheltering these dollars against \nbeing used for other purposes, such as going off to some other program \nthat people may have a great desire to fund by tapping into these \nresources. We prohibit that from happening.\n  If employers do not want to have a payroll deduction, they do not \nhave to have that. No one is required to join the program. We believe, \nthough, when members of our society and country see the benefits of \nthis, they will gravitate to it as a wonderful way to ensure against \nthat dreaded possibility all of us face; that is, becoming disabled, \nbeing unable to work as much as we would like to, needing additional \nassistance and help, and, of course, having very few places to turn to \nget it.\n  The disability groups and others that support this, 275 \norganizations, aging, religious groups, disability organizations across \nthe country--I am not going to read all of them here because 275 names \nis a lot, but I have here the list of all 275 organizations that have \nstrongly supported this proposal. I cannot think of any finer way to \ncelebrate the memory of our former colleague, who cared so much about \nthis bill we are now engaged in debating, who brought this idea to the \ntable years ago, and who championed it for so many years.\n  Today, we have a chance to include this wonderful concept, this \ncreative, innovative idea. It saves money. It provides independence for \npeople. It gives them a chance to lead good lives. It provides support \nto their families who otherwise have to bear a lot of that burden. None \nof us want our children or our grandchildren to have to bear burdens as \nthey are trying to raise their own families. So here is a little idea \nthat has generated support, totally by voluntary contributions. There \nis no government money involved at all. And it is to give people a \nchance to live out the remaining time of their lives with decency and \ndignity, having the sense of making a contribution and making a \ndifference.\n  All of those facts I cannot put a dollar amount on. I cannot tell you \nwhat the financial benefit is of someone getting up in the morning, \ngetting a little help but going off to a job and knowing they are \nneeded and have worth and value as a human being. What is the dollar \namount on that? I cannot tell you, except I know it has value in our \ncountry. Or the alternative? Getting rid of all your assets, \nimpoverishing yourself, relying on your family or friends to take care \nof you in order to try to survive, when you could be doing more.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the Whitehouse amendment when it \nis offered to strengthen this program and that they will resoundingly \ndefeat the effort to cut this program out of the bill altogether. I \ncannot think of a worse thing we could do with a piece of legislation \nthat is designed to be creative, innovative, reduce costs, and make a \ndifference for millions of our fellow citizens. And a growing number--\nas was pointed out, by the year 2030, 14 million Americans in our \ncountry, and I suspect more--will be in need of services such as these.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Iowa on the floor, who has been as \nstrong a champion as this Congress has ever had when it comes to the \ndisabled in our country, having been the author of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, along with others but nonetheless the principal \narchitect of that effort, and he can speak more eloquently than any \nother human being I have ever known about why this program is important \nand what it means.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of 275 \norganizations that strongly endorse and support Senator Kennedy's CLASS \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank our friend and leader on \nthis issue, Senator Dodd, for his eloquence in supporting what so many \nof our elderly in this country want more desperately than just about \nanything else; that is, the peace of mind of knowing that if they \nshould become disabled, they will not be forced to go into a nursing \nhome, they will have some support, and they will be able to live in \ntheir homes in their communities. Talk to anyone with a disability--not \njust the elderly, anyone with a disability--and they will tell you how \nimportant it is that you have that kind of assurance that if, God \nforbid, you become disabled, your only hope will not be to go into a \nnursing home for the rest of your natural life.\n  Senator Kennedy worked on this for years. The couple times I talked \nto him this summer and this spring, this is what he wanted to talk to \nme about: making sure we included this in the bill. This was his cause, \nto make sure we had a program people could contribute to that would \nafford them some support if, in fact, they became disabled.\n  I do not understand the move by my Republican friends to strike this. \nThis is not a mandatory program. This does not force anyone to pay a \ndime. It is all voluntary. We say, if you want to, you can put some \nmoney aside during your working years in a fund that will vest so that \nif you become disabled, you can get some support to stay at home, maybe \nwith your own family, maybe with just enough support so you can get \nanother job and work even though you have a disability. This is \nvoluntary.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, why are you against \na voluntary program that will enable people to have that kind of peace \nof mind? Well, I have heard it said: Well, maybe the taxpayers will \nhave to pay for this and everything.\n  I will tell you this: In the committee, Senator Gregg--Senator Gregg \nfrom New Hampshire, Republican Senator Gregg, my good friend--offered \nan amendment to make sure the contributions were the only things that \nwould sustain this program, that it would not become an entitlement. \nHere is what he said, his own words:\n\n       I offered an amendment, which was ultimately accepted, that \n     would require that\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\n     CLASS Act premiums be based on a 75-year actuarial analysis \n     of the program's costs. My amendment ensures that instead of \n     promising more than we can deliver, the program will be \n     fiscally solvent and we won't be passing the buck--or really, \n     passing the debt--to future generations. I'm pleased the HELP \n     Committee unanimously accepted this amendment.\n\n  The CBO has scored this. This is completely paid for over 75 years--\nover 75 years. I do not understand why anyone would want to strike it.\n  What Senator Whitehouse has said--again, I think this is very \nappropriate for us--is that any savings we get from this be reinvested \neither in the CLASS Act--so when people do get disabled, maybe they \nwill get a little bit more money. So we have some savings in the CLASS \nAct. What Senator Whitehouse has said is, put those savings back in the \nCLASS Act or Social Security. It makes sense to me. So again, I think \nit is an improvement on the bill, what Senator Whitehouse is \nsuggesting.\n  I plead--I plead--with my fellow Senators, do not kill this program \naborning. We stood here on this floor 19 years ago, on July 20, 1990. \nWe stood on this floor to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThere were a few votes against it. In fact, there are one or two people \nstill here who voted against it. I think if you asked them now, they \nwould say it has been a pretty darn good bill. It has broken down a lot \nof barriers, opened a lot of doors for people with disabilities in our \ncountry, changed our environment in this country, not only in terms of \nphysical access, but I think, more importantly, it has changed how we \nview people with disabilities, no longer looking at people with a \ndisability to say, what is their disability, we now look at those \npeople and say, what are your abilities, what can you do--not just \nlooking at someone's disability. So we have come a long way.\n  The one thing we have never been able to really do is to set up a \nfunctioning system so people could put some money aside to protect \nthemselves in case they got disabled. Well, this is it. This is our \nchance. This is a big part of this health care bill, a big part.\n  Well, maybe, I suppose, if you are trying to kill the bill, you would \nwant to kill the CLASS Act. But this is vitally important for our \ncountry. It is really the next logical step after the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. It is going to provide for so many people in this \ncountry that security and that peace of mind of knowing they will not \nhave to go into a nursing home or an institution if they become \ndisabled. And it can happen to any one of us here on the Senate floor, \nour families, our staff, our loved ones. No one knows what might happen \nto us either from an accident or a physical ailment. No one knows. But \nshouldn't we at least have some part of this health care bill that \nprovides that kind of voluntary program? No one is forced into \nanything. I guess that is what perplexes me more than anything else--\nwhy my Republican friends want to prevent something like a voluntary \nprogram--a voluntary program--from going into existence that would do \nthis, that is fiscally sound for 75 years. I just do not get it.\n  So I hope we will support the Whitehouse amendment and make sure this \nfund is totally solvent. I think he is on the right track, that if \nthere are savings, to put the money back in there, so maybe that $75 a \nday could be maybe $80 a day, or something like that, to help people.\n  I see, Mr. President, we now have a statement from the AARP about the \nCLASS program. Here is what they said. They said:\n\n       Decades of talking to our members tell us that older \n     Americans want to live in their homes as they age. That's why \n     AARP strongly supports the Community Living Assistance \n     Services and Supports (CLASS) program, which recognizes that \n     older individuals and people with disabilities should have \n     the right to live independently in their own homes and \n     communities, and to receive the help they need without having \n     to spend down to poverty.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that statement from \nthe AARP printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAARP Statement on the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports \n                                Program\n\n       Washington.--AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond \n     released this statement today in support of the Community \n     Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program:\n       ``Decades of talking to our members tell us that older \n     Americans want to live in their homes as they age. That's why \n     AARP strongly supports the Community Living Assistance \n     Services and Supports (CLASS) program, which recognizes that \n     older individuals and people with disabilities should have \n     the right to live independently in their own homes and \n     communities, and to receive the help they need without having \n     to spend down to poverty.\n       ``With nearly 40 million members age 50-plus, AARP has \n     fought to strengthen long-term services and supports. We \n     thank the House and Senate for including the CLASS program in \n     their health care reform bills. The voluntary CLASS insurance \n     program will promote independence, choice, dignity and \n     personal responsibility. It is self-funded and fiscally \n     responsible. AARP believes the CLASS program has been \n     strengthened throughout the legislative process. We look \n     forward to working with Senate, House, and the Administration \n     to enact this critical program. America's seniors and persons \n     with disabilities deserve nothing less.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am going to put this in personal terms--\npersonal terms. I have told this story before, and I am going to tell \nit again because I think it indicates why we need a program such as \nthis.\n  I have a nephew, Kelly; my sister's boy. He got injured at a very \nyoung age; he was only 19 years old. It made him a severe paraplegic, \nalmost a quadriplegic. My sister and her husband did not have any money \nat all. Yet Kelly was able to go to college--go to school. He was able \nto get a job, able to live in a house by himself. He had his own little \nhome. He had his own van he drove that had a lift on it, and he could \nget his wheelchair in there and drive it to work. He actually started a \nsmall business and employed some people. He has lived a full life. He \nis now a man of about 50. He has had a great life. Even with that \ndisability, he has been able to get around and do things. He is a \ntaxpayer. He has paid taxes. He has employed people. Every night when \nhe goes home, he has to have a nurse come in the home and get him ready \nfor bed and for him to do his exercises and things such as that. Then, \nin the morning, he has to have another nurse to get him out of bed and \ntake care of his needs, get him ready to go. Actually, Kelly gets his \nown meals and stuff. Then he goes off to work and comes back. This \nhappens every day.\n  How was he able to afford to do that? He did not have any money. He \ndid not have any insurance. How was he able to afford to do that? He \ngot injured in the military. He got injured in the military. So for all \nthese years, the Veterans' Administration has been paying for this. It \nhas been wonderful. It has kept him out of an institution, kept him out \nof a nursing home, and it has allowed him to live by himself, to go to \nschool, to go to work, to be with his family, to be with his friends.\n  I have often thought, this is wonderful, but why should that just be \nfor people who are injured in the military? What about so many other \npeople who get injured like my nephew Kelly who are not in the \nmilitary, maybe even injured before they could go into the military? He \nwas only 19 when it happened to him. So for all these years, I have \nthought we should have some system in this country that would allow \npeople like my nephew--who were not in the military but who, through an \nunfortunate accident, became disabled--that they could have that same \nkind of life, where they could live in their own homes in their own \ncommunities with their own families, have their own friends. That is \nwhy this is so important. This is perhaps one of the most important \nthings we have done since the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act to make sure people with disabilities have a full, \nenjoyable, productive, quality life.\n\n  I hope Senators will decisively defeat the amendment that wants to \nstrike this. Say yes. Say yes to so many people with disabilities and \nyoung people today and working people today. Say yes that we are going \nto have a system whereby you will have the peace of mind of knowing \nthat if you want to contribute the money, you will be able to do so. \nSay no to the amendment that would strike that, and say yes to the \nWhitehouse amendment that actually supports the CLASS Act, makes sure \nthat any savings from it are reinvested in that program.\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S12384]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before we go to our next speaker, I wish to ask if I could \nrequest that the next half hour be equally divided; is that OK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican deputy leader.\n  Mr. KYL. I had hoped to take the next half hour, but if we could do \n40 minutes, equally divided, I could take 20.\n  Mr. DODD. Forty minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. KYL. Would I be able to take the first 20 minutes then?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. That would be under the same order as we had before, I \nwould ask the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are discussing the Hatch motion to \npreserve Medicare Advantage. I wish to give a little bit of background \nabout the Medicare Advantage Program. It was established with the goal \nof ensuring that beneficiaries all across the country would actually \nhave Medicare choices. Under the program, private health plans receive \ngovernment payments in order to serve Medicare beneficiaries. In \naddition to offering comparable coverage to Part A, which is for \nhospitals, and Part B, physician services, Medicare Advantage plans can \nalso offer Part D coverage, prescription drug benefits.\n  The central goal of the Medicare Advantage provisions was to ensure \nthat beneficiaries across the Nation, not just those in populous areas, \nwould have access to health plan options. Under the law, Medicare \nAdvantage plans must provide all physician and hospital Medicare \nbenefits.\n  Here is the key. I hope my colleagues will think about this for a \nmoment because this has been a little bit perhaps distorted in the \nconversation we have had. If a plan's costs to provide all the Medicare \nbenefits is less than the government payment, then by law, the plan \nmust apply the difference to provide additional benefits to the \nbeneficiary or to reduce premiums.\n  It seems to me that is what this whole reform was about in the first \ninstance, to try to ensure quality care and reduce the cost of \ninsurance to beneficiaries.\n  But what are these extra benefits? We have heard them discussed. They \ninclude, first of all, lower cost sharing, including out-of-pocket \nlimits on beneficiary cost sharing, as well as specific health benefits \nsuch as vision, dental care, hearing services, routine physical, cancer \nscreenings, and so on. Plans can also offer management services, which \ncan be particularly important to beneficiaries with chronic illnesses, \nand that is a protection, by the way, that does not exist in regular \nfee-for-service Medicare.\n  Today, every beneficiary has health plan choices. Since 2003, the \nnumber of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in private plans has nearly \ndoubled from 5.3 million to 10.2 million in the year 2009, according to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation. So these are very popular plans and \ngrowing in popularity.\n  Let's go back in time just a little bit to consider the history, back \nto 1972, because in past years my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle were all for Medicare Advantage. Over the years, Congress has \ntried to control spending by reducing payments to private Medicare \nplans. One problem was, severe payment reductions resulted in the \nelimination of plan options. For example, in 1997, the Balanced Budget \nAct reduced plan payments by $74.5 billion over 10 years. What \nhappened? Well, about three-quarters of a million beneficiaries, from \n1999 to 2003, had to change plans or else lose their health plan \naltogether. This included not only less populous and more rural areas \nof the country but also areas such as Long Island, NY.\n  Well, Congress heard from these seniors loudly and clearly. They were \nangry about losing their coverage. Many remember that the Medicare \nModernization Act was a landmark achievement which provided seniors \nwith prescription drug coverage, but it was necessary for another \nreason as well and that was to respond to the call of the seniors who \nwanted their private options back.\n  So, in 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act expanded plan options to \ninclude regional PPOs and restore plan payments. It was a deliberate, \nbipartisan decision to increase the plan's payments so they could enter \nrural areas of the country and even some of the urban areas--as I \nmentioned, Long Island. If my colleagues don't remember, let me remind \nthem.\n  Former Senator Clinton from New York, for example, said that these \nMedicare+Choice plans--that is now what we call the Medicare Advantage \nplans, and I am quoting:\n\n       . . . are feeling the squeeze in a system caught between \n     rapidly exploding costs and rapidly imploding finances. While \n     we debate the future of Medicare, we need to recognize that \n     there are people right now in our States who depend on these \n     plans today.\n\n  The current senior Senator from Massachusetts said at the time, and I \nquote:\n\n       I urge my colleagues to support the additional funding that \n     is urgently needed to strengthen the Medicare+Choice program \n     for seniors. This should be among our highest priorities in \n     this year's Medicare debate.\n\n  It was, and we did. So this is not something bad that we provided \nthis money to these plans. We provided it so the plans could provide \nthe benefits to seniors, particularly in areas where otherwise they \nwouldn't have those choices.\n  So why has this all of a sudden become unpopular with our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle? Well, obviously, first and foremost, they \nneed trillions of dollars to fund their bill, so they look around for \nwhere they can get some money and decide: Well, we can get $120 billion \nfrom here; this is one way we can help pay for the new entitlements \nunder their bill. But to them, there has to be some kind of \njustification to take that money, so the idea is: Well, it is not fair \nthat the government would pay money into this program for extra \nbenefits for seniors when that money could be spent on regular fee-for-\nservice Medicare. Of course, that argument presupposes that government \nhealth care is always superior to the plans offered in the private \nmarket, which these seniors have made clear, by doubling the enrollment \nin the private plans, is not the case. As I said, they have made their \npreference clear.\n  They asked us for choices, as Members of Congress enjoy. They want \naccess to private plans and these additional benefits, and we delivered \nas promised. We gave them the choices, Republicans and Democrats alike. \nNow they need the money, so they decide this is a way to get some money \nto pay for their new entitlement.\n\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have been talking about \noverpayments. There is no such thing as an overpayment in this program \nunder the law. No money goes to the plans. It is not as if the \ninsurance companies get the money from the government. The insurance \ncompanies, if their bid is under what the traditional Medicare bid is, \nhave to return 25 percent of it to the U.S. Government and the other 75 \npercent, by law, must go to their beneficiaries, either in the form of \nlower premiums or additional benefits. So these aren't overpayments to \nthe plans, as has been represented. As I said, 75 percent of the \nadditional payments must be used to provide seniors with extra \nbenefits, which could include lowering premiums, including chronic care \nmanagement, and so on. The other 25 percent is returned to the \ngovernment, so there is no overpayment.\n  Some on the other side argue that they are protecting guaranteed \nbenefits. Well, this is semantics. Nobody is going after the benefits \nMedicare has traditionally supplied. What we are pointing out and what \nthis amendment would prevent from happening is, the benefits under \nMedicare Advantage would not be cut, and there is no question--nobody \ncan deny--that those benefits would be cut. In fact, according to the \nCBO, by the year 2019, they will have been cut by 64 percent, a huge--\nalmost $90--over $90 in actuarial value. So my point is, seniors, of \ncourse, would like to keep what they have.\n  What about this promise if you like what you have, you get to keep \nit. Sorry. Not if you are on Medicare Advantage. As I said, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would cut benefits \nfrom $135 a month actuarial value to $49 actuarial\n\n[[Page S12385]]\n\nvalue. That is a real cut. It may not sound like much to some people, \nbut to our seniors, it is a huge hit. They are asking what happened to \nthis promise to let them keep what they have.\n  There is an interesting memo by James Capretta and Robert Book, who \nwrite for the Heritage Foundation, on the Medicare Advantage cuts, and \nhere is what they say:\n\n       Reform should mean more patient choice and health plan \n     accountability. But these current proposals would lead in the \n     opposite direction--toward a system of less choice, less \n     accountability, and eventually lower-quality health care.\n\n  That is what the Hatch motion is attempting to prevent, to preserve \nthese benefits for seniors.\n  I have gotten tons of calls, about 500 calls just in the last several \ndays, opposing cuts to Medicare Advantage. I haven't, by the way, \nreceived a single call from a senior citizen asking us to make these \ncuts. I have been reading from these letters. I have read about a dozen \nof these letters. Let me read a few from constituents who tell us the \nreal effect these cuts would have on them. Bear in mind, in my State we \nhave about 329,000 seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage \nplans.\n  One constituent from Phoenix says:\n\n       For the past month I have heard a lot about proposed \n     Medicare cuts. Finally, after years of being self-employed \n     and being able to afford only high deductible insurance, I am \n     now in Medicare and have a Medicare Advantage plan. Please \n     tell me you are not cutting Medicare Advantage. Have a heart. \n     Leave Medicare and Medicare Advantage alone.\n\n  We are trying.\n  A constituent from Peoria, AZ, says:\n\n       I oppose cuts to Medicare Advantage. I have two family \n     members receiving health care under this program. The care \n     has consistently been outstanding due to the efforts of our \n     case manager in coordinating patient care between providers \n     and patients. We have a voice in determining type and scope \n     of our care. Please do not cut Medicare Advantage!\n\n  Here is a note from a constituent from Apache Junction:\n\n       I have heard reports that if passed, the new government \n     health care plan would do away with or cut Medicare \n     Advantage. If so, it would nearly double my health care costs \n     with my present health care provider. I do not want any \n     legislation passed that would take away the Medicare \n     Advantage option for seniors.\n\n  Another constituent from Peoria:\n\n       President Obama has said we can keep the insurance we have \n     if we like it, but has said he wants to cut or eliminate \n     Medicare Advantage. What happens to the millions of people \n     who have Medicare Advantage? These are all seniors, many of \n     whom cannot afford to pay more. Why should so many seniors \n     have to sacrifice in order to help pay for universal \n     coverage? Why do we not hear more debate on this issue?\n\n  Well, to my constituent from Peoria, that is what this debate is all \nabout. We are trying to prevent these cuts.\n  Here is a constituent from Prescott Valley:\n\n       I have Medicare Advantage. My husband wants to retire from \n     his job where he has excellent health coverage for some \n     serious health concerns. So long as he has good medical \n     coverage, he does well. Should Medicare Advantage be cut, his \n     health would necessarily suffer after his retirement. We \n     cannot afford higher supplemental coverage. I don't want to \n     lose my husband. I have spent many a sleepless night \n     wondering how to keep my husband healthy once he retires. I \n     have several friends currently undergoing chemotherapy and \n     they are wondering if their health would be in jeopardy if \n     Medicare Advantage were cut. Are we not worth saving? \n     Clearly, there are many who want to spend our money on their \n     own priorities. God bless you, sir, for advocating on our \n     behalf!\n\n  These are real concerns from real people. They don't want us to cut \nMedicare Advantage.\n  The final point I wish to make is one of our colleagues was saying: \nWell, there are bad Medicare Advantage plans and good Medicare \nAdvantage plans. How do we know which ones are good and bad? It turns \nout the senior Senator from Florida devised a formula which protects a \nlot of folks in his State, especially in Broward County, Miami Dade \nCounty, and Palm Beach but doesn't protect very many other folks.\n  Maybe this is the definition of good versus bad. There are a few that \nare protected in Colorado, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. \nIn my State of Arizona, with a lot of retirees, very few are exempted \nfrom the cuts. This is not going to go over well--to exempt only a few \nin certain key areas, and none of the others.\n  Again, what happened to the promise that everyone gets to keep what \nthey have?\n  My bottom line in supporting the Hatch amendment is that we should \nnot punish seniors who signed up to have the choice of Medicare \nAdvantage. There are better ways to reform health care. We have talked \nabout those ways. Our senior citizens have paid into the program. They \nhave asked us for this program. Democrats and Republicans have \nsupported it in the past. Now, simply because somehow or other we have \nto scrape up money for the new entitlements in this legislation, we are \ngoing to attack the very program all of us have supported in the past.\n  It is unfair, it is not right, and we need to defeat those cuts in \nMedicare, and that is why the Hatch motion to preserve Medicare \nAdvantage should be supported by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona leaves, \non the point he made and the efforts by the members of the other party \nto strike Medicare Advantage, I have a letter that was sent to members \nof the Medicare conference on September 30, 2003, with more Democratic \nsigners who are still in the Senate than Republican signers who were in \nthe Senate, which set out all of the reasons Medicare Advantage was so \nvery important and why it needed to have more money put into the year \n2003.\n  For instance, I will read from the letter:\n\n       For nearly 5 million Medicare beneficiaries across America, \n     Medicare Plus Choice--\n\n  That is what it was called before Medicare Advantage--\n\n     is an essential program that provides high quality, \n     comprehensive, affordable health coverage. These seniors and \n     disabled Americans have voluntarily chosen to receive their \n     health coverage through Medicare HMOs and other private \n     sector plans because they have excellent value. To preserve \n     this important option for seniors across the country, \n     bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate as S. \n     590, the ``Medicare Plus Choice Equity and Access Act.''\n       Cosponsored by Senators Schumer and Santorum, S. 590 sought \n     to increase reimbursement rates and add new reimbursement \n     options. . . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. We have plenty of history in the Senate that is \nbipartisan that we ought to maintain--Medicare Advantage--rather than \ndo an injustice to it, as this legislation before the Senate is trying \nto do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2003.\n       Dear Medicare Conferee: We are writing to ask you, as a \n     member of the Medicare conference committee, to ensure that \n     the final Medicare bill includes a meaningful increase in \n     Medicare+Choice funding in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. While \n     the Senate bill makes a modest step toward this goal, we hope \n     that the stronger provisions in the House bill will be \n     preserved in conference.\n       For nearly 5 million Medicare beneficiaries across America, \n     Medicare+Choice is an essential program that provides high \n     quality, comprehensive, affordable health coverage. These \n     seniors and disabled Americans have voluntarily chosen to \n     receive their health coverage through Medicare HMOs and other \n     private sector plans because of their excellent value. To \n     preserve this important option for seniors across the \n     country, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate \n     as S. 590, the ``Medicare+Choice Equity and Access Act.''\n       Co-sponsored by Senators Schumer and Santorum, S. 590 \n     sought to increase reimbursement rates and add new \n     reimbursement options for Medicare+Choice programs. Although \n     the Senate version of the Medicare bill does include a modest \n     increase in reimbursement rates in FY 2005, we were pleased \n     to see that the House version contains a more comprehensive \n     commitment to strengthening Medicare+Choice beginning in \n     2004.\n       Medicare+Choice uses private sector innovations to offer \n     all of the traditional Medicare benefits in addition to extra \n     benefits such as prescription drug coverage, vision benefits, \n     and hearing aids. These added services are particularly \n     important to low-income seniors who cannot afford the high \n     out-of-pocket costs they would incur under the Medicare fee-\n     for-service program. In many cases, this program is the only \n     option for low-income seniors to receive comprehensive, \n     affordable health coverage.\n       But in recent years, lack of adequate government funding \n     for the Medicare+Choice program has steadily reduced the \n     health plan choices and benefits of seniors across the \n     nation. As funding increases have continually fallen short of \n     rising health care costs, seniors have watched the quality of \n     their health\n\n[[Page S12386]]\n\n     care decline. Each year, health plans deprived of essential \n     funding have been forced to eliminate benefits, increase \n     seniors' out-of-pocket costs, or even withdraw completely \n     from certain areas.\n       We strongly support additional Medicare+Choice funding for \n     two very important reasons: (1) to protect the health care \n     choices and benefits of the nearly 5 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries who are currently enrolled in private sector \n     health plans; and (2) to strengthen the foundation for future \n     health plan choices.\n       We believe that the Medicare+Choice funding provisions in \n     H.R. 1 are critically important to preserving choice and \n     quality for America's seniors. We urge you to include these \n     provisions in the final bill reported out of the Medicare \n     conference committee.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rick Santorum, John F. Kerry, Arlen Specter, Jon Corzine, \n           Gordon Smith, Jim Bunning, Dianne Feinstein, Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, Patty Murray, Charles E. Schumer, Frank R. \n           Lautenberg, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ron Wyden, Mark \n           Dayton, Norm Coleman, Mary L. Landrieu, Maria Cantwell, \n           Christopher J. Dodd.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Wyoming want the \nremainder of our 20 minutes?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, to correct something I heard on the \nfloor today, when the senior Senator from Connecticut had some concerns \nabout this, he said how private health plans deny claims. He said \nMedicare doesn't deny claims.\n  In the United States of America, the No. 1 denier of claims for \nhealth care is Medicare. The study that is out from a full year, from \nMarch 2007 to March 2008, Medicare rejected 475,000 claims of its 6.9 \nmillion claims filed, at the rate of 6.85 percent. When you compare \nthat to private insurance companies, the industry average for the \nclaims that are rejected is about 4.05 percent.\n  So Medicare rejects, by number, 10 times more than the largest \nprivate insurance company. A lot of these claims--I have followed this \nclosely because I have been the medical director of something called \nthe Wyoming Health Fairs, where people can get their blood tested at a \nlow cost. It is a preventive or prevention-designed program. Yet \nMedicare refuses to pay for prevention. It refuses to pay for these \nblood tests because they are preventive as opposed to diagnosing a \nspecific problem in a specific patient with a specific symptom.\n  What do our seniors in America do? They turn to a program called \nMedicare Advantage because it gives them the advantage to choose this \nprogram. It is one of the choices they have under Medicare. At this \npoint, 11 million Americans have chosen to participate in Medicare \nAdvantage and receive their health care through Medicare Advantage. We \nare talking about seniors who depend on Medicare for their health care.\n  The number of people signing up for Medicare Advantage has continued \nto increase, and now there are 11 million people--or one out of every \nfour seniors--on Medicare in this country. They know who they are and \nthey like the program. The reason they like the program is because they \nget additional services--services beyond what someone on the \ntraditional Medicare Program receives, such as dental care, hearing \ncare, eye care, preventive care, and coordinated care.\n  We hear a lot about the failings of the health care system, and there \nare many in this country, and one of them is that care is not \ncoordinated. People go from specialist to specialist. We need \ncoordinated care. Medicare Advantage does a much better job at \ncoordinating care than traditional Medicare.\n  It is baffling to me that the plan in front of us in the Senate today \nis trying to eliminate Medicare Advantage to the tune of over $100 \nbillion. When one looks at the cuts that are in this plan--it is $464 \nbillion in Medicare cuts, $135 billion for hospitals, $42 billion for \nhome health agencies, $15 billion for nursing homes, and $8 billion for \nhospice providers. But it is $120 billion for Medicare Advantage--the \nprogram that more seniors, as they learn about it, want to sign up for, \nbecause it is an advantage to them to have their health care through a \nprogram which focuses on preventive care, coordinated care, and helps \nthem stay healthy and live longer. Yet this Senate and this bill that \nSenator Reid has brought to the floor is trying to completely gut that \nprogram and deny our seniors who rely upon it from receiving the care \nthey have earned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nCommunity Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or CLASS Act, \nwhich was introduced by the late Senator Ted Kennedy. The CLASS Act \nwould create an optional insurance program to help pay for home care \nand other assistance for adults who become disabled. Those choosing to \nparticipate would pay monthly premiums into an insurance trust, and \nafter 5 years, could access a cash benefit if they become disabled and \nneed assistance.\n  Over 10 million Americans are currently in need of long-term care, \nand that number is expected to rise to 15 million in the next 10 years. \nThese individuals struggle to remain independent with limited \nassistance, and many turn to Medicaid as an insurer of last resort. In \norder to qualify, however, people need to go through a substantial \n``spend down'' of their assets and commit to unemployment to remain \neligible. Mr. President, this is totally inefficient. Instead of \nensuring that an individual can remain an independent and functional \nmember of society, the current policy requires that to receive \nassistance, a person basically becomes a ward of the State. Medicaid \npays for half of long-term care costs and increased expenditures are \nexpected to add $44 billion each year to Medicaid over the next decade. \nNot only is this unsustainable it is nonsensical.\n  This is as much about protecting people's dignity as it is about \nfiscal responsibility. Too many Americans fall on hard times, becoming \ndisabled from an accident or illness, with no safety net to help them \nstay independent. Ensuring that these people have an alternative to \nMedicaid, so that they can remain active and independent, will reduce \nthe Federal deficit by $73.4 billion over 10 years and save Medicaid \n$1.6 billion in the first 4 years benefits are available. Medicaid \nsavings will continue to grow over time as more beneficiaries utilize \nCLASS Act benefits instead of Medicaid.\n  And thanks to amendments accepted in the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, the bill language is stronger than ever. \nSenator Gregg, my colleague on the Budget Committee, amended the bill \nto require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set premiums \nthat are actuarially sound for a 75-year window, and maintain \nsustainable enrollment and benefit structure. While some have suggested \nthat the CLASS Act is fiscally not sound, the Gregg amendment should \nput those concerns to rest.\n  Long-term care reform has been a cornerstone of my work in public \noffice since my days in the Wisconsin State Senate. I have seen how \nimportant it is to give people options so that they can match the level \nof care and assistance to their personal needs. Pushing anyone and \neveryone into Medicaid, or into a nursing home, is a waste of \npotential, a waste of opportunity, and a waste of money. Medicaid and \nour Nation's nursing homes have a critical role to play for some \nAmericans. But for many Americans, it is simply not the right fit. The \nCLASS Act will ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent enrolling only \nthose who truly need Medicaid into the program, and help others save \nfor a time when they might need some assistance to remain independent. \nThe CLASS Act is a critical part of this health reform bill, and I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose any effort to weaken or strike this program \nfrom the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island wants to be \nheard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I will speak for just a moment because \nI know the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to speak. When he comes to \nthe floor, I will quickly yield to him. While there is a moment in \nbetween, I want\n\n[[Page S12387]]\n\nto speak to some of the arguments we have heard.\n  There is always the question of the substance of an argument. There \nis also the question of the credibility of an argument. I think as \npeople watch this debate and discuss the credibility of the concern \nexpressed by our friends on the other side of the aisle about the \ndeficit impact of the CLASS Act, it is worth considering a few facts \njust to evaluate that.\n  First is that the CLASS Act is required to be actuarially self-\nsustaining. People pay into it and, from those funds, under the \ninsurance principle, funds come back out. It is required to be self-\nsustaining that way.\n  Second, it is voluntary. Nobody has to contribute. If you want to \ncontribute, then you can become eligible for the benefit once you have \nvested. But nobody is forced into this; it is entirely voluntary. The \nCBO, on which we rely in a nonpartisan fashion, has said this is \nsolvent for 75 years.\n  Finally, because we think--at least on this side--this matters. It \nwill help the disabled and elderly at that critical point of decision, \nwhen their ability to stay home, their ability to stay independent, or \ntheir ability to stay at work depends on just a little bit of help to \naccommodate their age or disability, it is then that this will make a \ndifference. What a difference it will make in human lives.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut wishes to use an example. I will \nyield to him on his signal. We have seen this before. We saw this not \nlong ago on the public option, which would compete with insurers head \nto head on a fair and level playing field. It was completely voluntary, \nand it had to be actuarially self-sustaining. It had to meet the \nsolvency laws of the State in which it operated. In both cases, our \ncolleagues on the other side have rushed to the floor to talk about \ndeficits and how these will contribute to the deficit.\n  These are both actuarially self-sustaining programs required to stay \nsolvent. Yet here they come to raise the specter of deficits. But this \nis the same party that pays for 14-percent subsidies to private \ninsurers to compete with Medicare. As my son would say, duh, if you are \ngetting 14 percent extra, it is pretty easy to compete.\n  When they asked for that deal, they promised they would drive costs \ndown. In fact, they have driven costs up, and they put it in their \npockets. It is not fair to the insurers that are not in the program. It \nis greedy on their part. All we want to do is hold them to their \npromises.\n  Do we hear any concerns about the deficit problem on the 14-percent \nsubsidy for the Medicare Advantage Program? No, dead silence--guess \nwhat--because it helps the insurance industry.\n  When the Part D program came in, our friends on the other side forced \nthrough a provision--a unique provision--that gave the pharmaceutical \nindustry a special privilege that the U.S. Government could not \nnegotiate with it over price--could not negotiate with it. Lord knows \nhow much that has added to our deficit. But have they ever come to \ncomplain? No, because the beneficiary is the pharmaceutical industry. \nBut when things help regular people, when things help competition in \nthe insurance market, even where they are required to be actuarially \nself-sustaining and solvent, then suddenly they turn up. They can \ndetect the threat of deficit in parts per billion when it helps \nsomebody. But a patent, actual living, breathing, deficit-enhancing \nsubsidy that is on the books right now, they don't care about if it \nhelps the pharmaceutical industry or the insurance industry.\n  As we have this discussion, that is a point worth bearing in mind \nbecause it is not just the substance of the amendment, it is the \ncredibility of the argument that counts.\n  I said I would yield to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nwhen he arrived, and he has arrived. Without further ado, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Whitehouse, who has been among the more forthright and capable \nadvocates of what we are talking about today, not only with regard to \nhealth care generally, but in particular what brings us to the floor at \nthis moment, among several issues, but principally his work and the \nwork over many years that Senator Kennedy did for the so-called CLASS \nAct, the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act.\n  What is this all about? I wish to talk for a couple of minutes about \nhow it works. I think sometimes we get lost in the discussion about the \nfiner points of a policy or program and we tend to forget what it \nmeans. Here is what it means. Here is what it means for an American who \nis working and wants to continue working to support his or her family \nor to support themselves, contribute to our economy, demonstrate that \npeople who happen to live with a disability of one kind or another can \nbe so significant in our economy, can contribute so much with their \nability and their brain power and their ability to contribute in a very \npositive way.\n  We are talking about the dignity of work, whether the Senate is going \nto stand up and say: With this act, with this program for someone who \nhappens to have a disability and wants to work and wants to voluntarily \ncontribute premiums so they have some security, some peace of mind down \nthe road if they should need this help, we are talking about the \ndignity of that work.\n  This is a test of the Senate, whether we are going to stand up for \npeople who have a disability and their opportunity to work. It is a \nvery simple question. You either stand with them or you do not.\n  It is also about one important word, I think--independence, whether \nwe are going to say to someone who wants to work and has a disability, \nare they going to have the independence, the freedom to work and live \nthe life they choose?\n  Here is how it works. This is not complicated. This is not some \nmysterious program. Here is how it works. Here is how they qualify to \nget these benefits. They qualify to receive benefits when they do three \nthings. First, they need help with certain activities of daily living. \nWe all know what those are. There are so many people out there who can \nwork and can contribute if we give them a little help, just a little \nbit of help that we are talking about today to do the basic things in \nlife--to be able to wake up in the morning and, if you have a \ndisability, maybe have someone help you get ready for work, whether \nthat is getting in the shower, shaving, whatever you have to do to get \nready for work in the morning--activities of daily living, things that \npeople who do not have disabilities take for granted. That is the first \nthing you have to have is that need that we can all understand.\n  Secondly, this person would have to pay premiums for at least 5 years \nbefore they could benefit from the program. I said ``premiums.'' I did \nnot say a ``government subsidy.'' We are talking about premiums here, \nand this is a program that certainly has its origin in government, but \nthis is not exactly similar to the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nfor example, or Medicaid, where it is a government program that helps a \nparticular person, a person who happens to have a disability or is a \nchild. In this case, people are paying premiums, and they have to pay \nthose premiums for 5 years.\n  In addition to the need and paying premiums, the third requirement is \nthey have to work at least 3 of those 5 years. We are talking about \npeople who are employed, working people who happen to have a \ndisability. This is a creative program to help them do that.\n  Why do we get the opposition we do from across the aisle? I think it \nis pretty simple. We have a lot of folks across the aisle who want to \nkill this bill. So they are going to try to strike the CLASS Act, which \nis outrageous and insulting. They are going to try to strike whatever \nthey can, if they can, to kill the bill. So this is a bill-killing \nexercise. This is not a debate about the finer points of the CLASS Act. \nThis is a bill-killer exercise. It is very simple, and I think it will \ntell a lot about where people stand.\n  Let me go into a couple more details. I know we are almost out of \ntime. Here is what happens to that beneficiary--a person working, a \nperson who has a need, and a person who has paid premiums. That \nbeneficiary receives a lifetime cash benefit based on the degree of \nimpairment, not just any old formula. We want to make sure the benefit \ncorresponds to someone's impairment, their inability to do their job or \nlive their life the way they hope\n\n[[Page S12388]]\n\nto. It is expected to average about $75 a day or more in the case of an \nindividual. That is what we are talking about here.\n  We are not talking about, in this case, a government entitlement \nprogram. Few people are as passionately supportive of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program or Medicaid as I am. I believe there are \nprograms that are funded by the government, run by the government, that \nwork very well. But in this case, we are not talking about that kind of \na program. We are talking about a program that does not confer rights \nor an obligation on government funding, nor does it affect the receipt \nor eligibility for other benefits. The program stands on its own \nfinancial feet because people are paying premiums out of their own \npocket for 5 years to save for that day when they have a need because \nthey have some kind of disability. And it is solvent--solvent. It is a \nprogram that people sign up for voluntarily. It is a voluntary program.\n  When you line up all of the reasons to support this program that \nSenator Dodd, as the chairman of our committee, the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, this summer when we were debating this \nbill--he carried the ball for Senator Kennedy in the chairmanship of \nour committee and in our hearings and also for this program. I am \ngrateful for his leadership and also grateful for Senator Harkin's \nleadership to support this voluntary program. I am also grateful that \nSenator Whitehouse has lent his voice and his expertise and his focus \non getting this program as part of our health care reform bill.\n  It makes a lot of sense. It is solvent, and it will help those who \nhave a disability who want to work, who want to go to work every day \nand live a full life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield whatever time we may have remaining \nto Senator Kirk of Massachusetts, who has done an incredible job in \nvery difficult circumstances--replacing our beloved former colleague \nTed Kennedy from Massachusetts. He has been a valuable contribution \nover these days he has been here. I know he wishes to say a few words \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Baucus for \ntheir tireless leadership on this entire health care bill.\n  I wish to say a word about the CLASS Act. We have heard Senator Dodd \nand others say this is the core element of this health reform bill \nchampioned by Senator Edward Kennedy. I say if he were here today, he \nwould say this is not about politics; this is about the content of the \ncharacter of our Nation. He believed, as I do, and I know Senator Dodd \ndoes, this Nation is judged or should be judged on how we treat the \ninfirm and the weakest among us. This CLASS Act, as was eloquently \npointed out by Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, involves no taxpayer \nfunds, is fiscally solvent, and does what everyone says we must do: \nprovide independence, self-respect, and dignity to the infirm in our \nsociety.\n  Second, it keeps the caregivers and the loved ones from carrying that \nburden all by themselves and not having to sacrifice their jobs and \ntheir time and their heartache to share their children with perhaps one \nof their parents and dividing a family in that way.\n  This is at the heart of what our country should be about. It is not \nwho wins--the Republicans or the Democrats. It is not a government \nprogram. It is self-funded. It is voluntary. There is no taxpayer money \ninvolved. So what other reason could there be but politics to keep \npeople from coming together on this issue?\n  I urge my colleagues--all on this side and my Republican colleagues \non the other side--to think about those families who are facing this \nplight. They are Republicans, they are Independents, and they are \nDemocratic families as well. This is an American program for some \nveterans and others who have sacrificed.\n  I think the only thing we can do, the only right thing we can do, if \nthis is going to be a reflection of the character of this Nation, is to \nsupport the CLASS Act.\n  I thank Senator Dodd once again. I am proud to be standing at the \ndesk of Senator Edward Kennedy who believed deeply in this issue, who \nstarted a long time ago and wanted to see it fulfilled this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to, on behalf of the majority \nleader, propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments and \nmotion to commit, as listed in this agreement, with no other \namendments, motions to commit, or any other motion except a motion to \nreconsider and table upon the conclusion of any vote, being in order \nduring the pendency of this agreement; further, that prior to the \nsecond and succeeding votes, there be 2 minutes of debate, with all \ntime equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that any \namendment or motion covered under this agreement be subject to an \naffirmative 60-vote threshold, and that if any achieve that threshold, \nthen it be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that if it does not achieve that 60-vote \nthreshold, then it be withdrawn; that after the first vote in this \nsequence, the succeeding votes be 10 minutes in duration:\n  A Senator Whitehouse amendment re: Social Security fiscal \nresponsibility; the Republican leader's designee amendment re: fiscal \nresponsibility; Senator Stabenow's side-by-side amendment re: Medicare \nAdvantage; and Senator Hatch's motion to commit re: Medicare Advantage.\n  Further, that once this agreement is entered, the Republican leader's \ndesignee be recognized to call up the fiscal responsibility amendment; \nand that once it has been reported by number, Senator Stabenow be \nrecognized to call up the Medicare Advantage side-by-side amendment; \nthat upon disposition of the amendments and the motion in this \nagreement, the next two matters for consideration will be a Senator \nLincoln amendment regarding insurance executive compensation, and \nRepublican leader's designee motion to commit regarding home health \nagencies; that for the remainder of today's session, no further \namendments or motions to commit be in order, with the time until then \nbeing equally divided between the leaders or their designees, with \nMembers permitted to speak up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not be objecting, I see the assistant majority leader on the \nSenate floor. I think it would be helpful, as soon as the majority \nleader or someone on that side can do so, to indicate at what point \nduring the day tomorrow and at what point during the day on Sunday we \nmight be having additional votes. It might be helpful to our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in terms of planning for the weekend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say through the Chair to my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Kentucky, that we are \ngoing to come in at 10 in the morning. At this time, it appears Senator \nLincoln will be offering an amendment, and I would hope we can be ready \nat that time to have whatever the minority wants to do in regard to \nthat amendment. Then we are going to have an amendment offered by the \nRepublicans. I would hope that we can dispose of those two amendments \ntomorrow, maybe in the early afternoon--maybe 2:30 or 3 o'clock start \nvoting on them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So am I correct in assuming that the votes are most \nlikely going to be in the afternoon tomorrow, or both morning and \nafternoon?\n  Mr. REID. In the afternoon. I think we will need some debate in the \nmorning.\n\n[[Page S12389]]\n\n  Then Sunday morning, at the request of the Republican leader, we are \nnot going to come in until noon, or thereabouts.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think we are going to need some debate time. Oh, we \nwill have that in the afternoon.\n  Then on Sunday, obviously, we would not go in until noon on Sunday, \nand the votes will be----\n  Mr. REID. There is an event in Washington that a number of Senators \nare obligated to go to that is in the evening, so we will get everybody \nout of here by 6, 6:30 that night, at the latest.\n  I would also say, Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend, that \nwe Democrats are going to have a caucus--tentatively scheduled to have \none Sunday afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2901 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. 2901 \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2901 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To eliminate new entitlement programs and limit the \n     government control over the health care of American families)\n\n       Beginning on page 1925, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through line 15 on page 1979.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to speak to the amendment that we \njust filed at the desk. This amendment is very straightforward and very \nsimple. It does what a number of my colleagues on the other side have \nasked to do, and that is to strike the CLASS Act from the underlying \nhealth care reform bill that is being debated on the floor of the \nSenate right now.\n  I want to read some excerpts from a letter that seven Democratic \nSenators, including the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, put together asking that this CLASS Act not be included \nas part of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from which I will be quoting.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington DC, October 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: We write regarding the merger of the \n     Finance and HELP Committee health reform bills. We know you \n     face a great many difficult decisions now, one of which is \n     whether to include provisions from the HELP Committee bill \n     known as the CLASS Act in the merged bill.\n       We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senate's \n     merged bill, nor to use the savings as an offset for other \n     health items in the merger.\n       While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudable--finding a \n     way to provide long term care insurance to individuals--the \n     effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate \n     bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons.\n       CBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce the \n     deficit by $73 billion over ten years. But nearly all the \n     savings result from the fact that the initial payout of \n     benefits wouldn't begin until 2016 even though the program \n     begins collecting premiums in 2011. It is also clear that the \n     legislation increases the deficit in decades following the \n     first ten years. CBO has confirmed that the legislation \n     stand-alone would face a long-term deficit point of order in \n     the Senate.\n       Some have argued that the program is actuarially sound. But \n     this is the case because premiums are collected and placed in \n     a trust fund, which begins earning interest, and because the \n     HHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintain \n     actuarial solvency. We have grave concerns that the real \n     effect of the provisions would be to create a new federal \n     entitlement program with large, long-term spending increases \n     that far exceed revenues. This is especially the case if \n     savings from the first decade of the program are spent on \n     other health reform priorities.\n       Slowing the growth of health care costs should be a top \n     priority as we move forward with health reform. Inclusion of \n     the CLASS Act would reduce the amount of long-term cost \n     savings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill. The \n     CLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrong \n     direction and should not be used to help pay for other health \n     provisions that will become more expensive over time and \n     increase deficits.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We hope that fiscally \n     responsible measures to improve access to long-term care can \n     be considered in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kent Conrad.\n     Joe Lieberman.\n     Mary L. Landrieu.\n     Evan Bayh.\n     Blanche L. Lincoln.\n     E. Benjamin Nelson.\n     Mark R. Warner.\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the letter said:\n\n       We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senate's \n     merged bill, nor to use the savings as an offset for other \n     health items in the merger. While the goals of the CLASS Act \n     are laudable--finding a way to provide long term care \n     insurance to individuals--the effect of including this \n     legislation in the merged Senate bill would not be fiscally \n     responsible for several reasons.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       [N]early all the savings result from the fact that the \n     initial payout of benefits wouldn't begin until 2016 even \n     though the program begins collecting premiums in 2011. It is \n     also clear that the legislation increases the deficit in \n     decades following the first 10 years.\n\n  They go on to say in this letter, Mr. President:\n\n       We have grave concerns that the real effect of the \n     provisions would be to create a new Federal entitlement \n     program with large, long-term spending increases that far \n     exceed revenues. This is especially the case if savings from \n     the first decade of the program are spent on other health \n     reform priorities.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is a letter that was signed by the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, Senator Conrad of North Dakota, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Landrieu, Senator Lincoln, Senator Warner, Senator \nNelson, and Senator Bayh. Seven Democratic Senators have gone on the \nrecord saying the CLASS Act shouldn't be included in this legislation \nbecause it is not fiscally responsible.\n  The fact is, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, has described this as a Ponzi scheme of the first order--\nsomething that Bernie Madoff would be proud of.\n  Now, I have heard my colleagues get up and talk about how solvent \nthis is and what a great program this is. Well, there are programs out \nthere that are available for people to buy long-term care insurance. \nThe problem with this one is that it takes all the money that comes in \nin the early years and spends it on other government programs--in this \ncase health care reform--but who knows what other government programs \nare going to be created that will use the revenues that come in from \nthis plan that supposedly a lot of people are going to sign up for, and \nCBO says it is going to be fewer than 4 percent that will sign up.\n  In fact, no senior today is going to benefit from it because you have \nto work for 5 years. If you are a senior who is retired, you will not \nsee any benefit. This doesn't impact seniors, contrary to the assertion \nof some of my colleagues on the other side. It will impact future \ngenerations of Americans who are going to be stuck with the deficits \nand the debt that gets piled on them because of the outyears when this \nliability is incurred as people start getting paid out, from having \npaid in, and there is no money there. It is the classic definition of a \nPonzi scheme: The money comes in today, it gets spent on other things, \nand then someday, when the liability comes in and people start saying: \nI paid into this program, and I should get some benefit, there will be \nno money there. So we will borrow for it or tax for it or something \nelse.\n  They say, well, it is actuarially solvent over 75 years. Well, maybe, \nbecause you are running surpluses in the early years. But in the later \nyears, you are running huge deficits. In the early years the surpluses \nare being spent. They are not being put into paying benefits for this \nprogram, when those benefits start being demanded by the people who \nhave participated in the program.\n  Just look at what others have said about this program, Mr. President. \nI have quoted for you what the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, said with regard to this program; that it is a Ponzi \nscheme of the first order, and that is being echoed by others. But this \nis what the administration's chief health actuary said about the CLASS \nAct. He said it would result ``in a net Federal cost in the longer \nterm.'' The chief actuary also determined the program faces ``a \nsignificant risk of failure'' because the high cost will attract sicker \npeople and lead to low participation.\n\n[[Page S12390]]\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office agreed, saying:\n\n       The CLASS program included in the bill would generate net \n     receipts for the program in the initial years when total \n     premiums would exceed total benefit payments, but it would \n     eventually lead to net outlays when benefits exceed premiums. \n     . . . In the decade following 2029, the CLASS program would \n     begin to increase budget deficits.\n\n  This particular quote could come as a bit of a surprise because this \ncomes not from the CBO or the CMS actuary, but it comes from the \nWashington Post. The Washington Post called the CLASS Act a ``gimmick'' \n``designed to pretend that health care is fully paid for.'' The Post \ngoes on to say:\n\n       [T]he money that flows in during the 10 year budget window \n     will flow back out again. These are not ``savings'' that can \n     honestly be counted on the balance sheet of reform.\n\n  Even the Washington Post recognizes this for what it is. It is a \nsham. This is a budget gimmick, Mr. President, that is designed to \nobscure the cost of this program by generating surpluses in the early \nyears. It is supposed to generate $72 billion in the first 10-year \nwindow, so that counts on the balance sheet of health care reform to \nmake it look better. But this program is going to run deficits--\ndeficits as far the eye can see--once the chickens come home to roost. \nWho will pay the bill for that? Future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, this is not good policy. Certainly, if you look at \nprograms we already have on the books, Medicare is destined to be \nbankrupt in the year 2017. We have big problems down the road--unfunded \nliabilities in Social Security. This would create a huge new liability \ndown the road that would be unfunded because all the money that comes \nin during the early years is going to be spent. This is more of the \nsame old business as usual in Washington, DC, that the American people \nare fed up with. We can make people happy today by saying we are \ncreating this new program that makes the majority's health care reform \nbill look better because it obscures the real cost of this bill by \nrolling in these revenues in the early years. But there is a long-term \nimpact, according to the CBO, according to the actuary at Health and \nHuman Services, and according to a lot of our colleagues on the other \nside--the seven Democrats who signed the letter, including the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, who, as I said, has called this program a \nPonzi scheme of the first order; something that would make Bernie \nMadoff proud.\n  I don't know how my colleagues on the other side, with a straight \nface, can come to the Senate floor and say this is a great program, \nthat it is actuarially sound. Sure, it may be a benefit to a few \npeople, but I have to tell you, somewhere down the road, when the \nchickens come home to roost, there is going to be a huge liability that \nis going to be facing future taxpayers, future generations of \nAmericans, as we start to pile up more deficits and more debt as a \nresult of this Ponzi scheme.\n  This is a sham, Mr. President. I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment. It would strike the CLASS Act from the underlying bill, not \nallow those revenues to be assumed in paying for or understating the \ncost of this bill, and not pile mountains of debt onto future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Community Living Assistance and Services \nand Supports Act, known as the CLASS act, is a new, government-run, \ngovernment-funded program for longterm care, intended to compete with \nlong-term care plans provided by private insurers.\n  One of the oft-repeated arguments we have heard in favor of the CLASS \nact is that it would reduce budget deficits between 2010-2019.\n  First, when has a government program ever reduced budget deficits?\n  Second, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that this program \nwill actually add to future Federal budget deficits. The CBO writes: \n``The program would add to future federal budget deficits in large and \ngrowing fashion.''\n  Why would it do this?\n  The program offers returns that payments made into the system cannot \ncover--just like a Ponzi scheme, as Senator Conrad said. Participants \nwould have to pay into the system for five years before they start \ncollecting benefits. Under the Senate proposal, only active workers \ncould enroll in the program. So this would not be a program that would \nnot benefit seniors or the currently disabled. So, if a worker began \nmaking payments in 2011, he or she could not collect benefits until \n2016. So, for a time, the program would generate surplus receipts for \nthe government while Americans are paying in and not collecting \nbenefits. But eventually, we will reach a point when payments made into \nthis program cannot sustain promised benefits.\n  As the CBO tells us, the program would ``lead to net outlays when \nbenefits exceed premiums.'' (By the third decade of program operation--\n2030-2039--CBO assumes that CLASS begins to generate net increases in \nFederal outlays. The net increase in Federal outlays is estimated to be \n``on the order of tens of billions of dollars for each (succeeding) \nten-year period.''\n  CBO notes that the increase in net Federal outlays which will begin \nto occur after 2029 results despite the requirement that premiums be \nset to ensure the program's solvency over 75 years. The solvency \nrequirement counts interest income paid to the program's trust fund as \navailable to pay future benefits. However, CBO notes that those \ninterest payments are an intra-governmental transfer within the Federal \nbudget. Thus, CBO notes that from a budget scorekeeping perspective, \nthe CLASS program would inevitably add to future deficits (on a cash \nbasis) by more than it reduces deficits in the near term, even though \nthe premiums would be set to ensure solvency of the program.\n  The administration's chief health actuary said the CLASS Act would \nresult in ``a net federal cost in the longer term.''\n  Bottom line, this program is not sustainable outside the 10-year \nwindow.\n  That is why the Washington Post called it, ``a gimmick . . . designed \nto pretend that healthcare is fully paid for.''\n  The Post goes on:\n\n       Money that flows in during the 10-year budget window will \n     flow back out again. These are not `savings' that can \n     honestly be counted on the balance sheet of reform.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19 minutes remaining; on the \nRepublican side, 10\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Minnesota. Does he \nwish to be heard? How much time does my colleague need?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Senator. I need 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Take 4.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I will use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent to \nbe added as a cosponsor to the amendment of Senator Coburn, amendment \nNo. 2789, to require all Members of Congress to enroll in the public \noption. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment because I strongly \nsupport the public option and I will have no qualms at all enrolling in \nthis plan.\n  There is a lot of misinformation about the public option, so I want \nto be clear about why we need a public option and why I would be proud \nto enroll in a public health insurance plan.\n  We need a public option because health insurance premiums for \nMinnesota residents have risen 90 percent since 2000 and because \n444,000 Minnesotans went without health insurance in 2008. We need a \npublic option because, while millions of Americans struggle to pay for \nhealth care, insurance executives continue to make bloated, obscene \nsalaries. From 2000 to 2007, American families saw their premiums \nalmost double. During that same time, we saw more than 6 million more \nAmericans become uninsured. During that same period, insurance \ncompanies' profits rose 428 percent--428 percent in 8 years. They are \nmaking outrageous profits by gouging American families. That is why we \nneed a public option.\n  The public option will offer affordable premiums and a comprehensive \nbenefits package for Americans struggling with their health care costs. \nIt is going to provide the kind of coverage Americans need to be \nhealthy. The public option will foster competition among private health \ninsurance companies and lower long-term costs for Minnesotans and for \nfamilies all across the country. There is no cost for the public option \nto the Treasury. In fact, CBO estimates it saves $3 billion. It is a \nwin-win situation.\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\n  It is important to remember that a public option doesn't mean private \nhealth insurance goes away. In fact, after health reform, 188 million \nAmericans will have coverage through a private insurer. Only 2 percent \nof the overall insured population is projected to enroll in the public \noption. This is just another option you will have. It is an option \nbecause that is what the bill is about.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BROWN. I know my colleague joined with Senator Dodd, Senator \nMikulski, and me to push this amendment that Members of the House and \nSenate actually go on the public option, partly to show we believe in \nit. It is a little curious that two of the sponsors, at least, Senator \nCoburn and Senator Vitter and some others, are so much against the \npublic option that they want to pass this amendment. It sounds to me as \nif the Senator is serious about going on it, as I am, correct?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I talked to my wife Franni. We have been married 34 \nyears now. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said if this \npasses, we should do the public option. She said, absolutely. Yes, I am \nperfectly serious about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Minnesota has \nconsumed 4 minutes allotted by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota to be added as a cosponsor of the Coburn amendment is \nordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are talking right now about a program \nthat was well thought out, that was meant to help the poor and \nminorities. It was a bipartisan effort by Democrats and Republicans, \nand has worked amazingly well and is available to all recipients of \nMedicare.\n  Medicare Advantage came about in a bipartisan way to solve real \nproblems. We were not getting health care to rural America. We were not \ngetting health care, in many respects, to some of the poorer, some of \nthe minority folks in our country.\n  I want to read a special letter here. Let me read this letter. I know \nit may have been read before, but I am going to read it again. It is \ndated September 30, 2003. ``Dear Medicare Conferees.'' I happened to be \na member of that conference. I was one of those in there who led the \nfight for Medicare Advantage.\n\n       We are writing to ask you, as a member of the Medicare \n     conference committee, to ensure the final Medicare bill \n     includes a meaningful increase in Medicare+Choice--\n\n  That is the predecessor to Medicaid Advantage--\n\n       funding in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. While the Senate \n     bill makes a modest step toward this goal, we hope the \n     stronger provisions in the House bill will be preserved in \n     conference.\n       For nearly 5 million Medicare beneficiaries across America, \n     Medicare+Choice [the predecessor] is an essential program \n     that provides high quality, comprehensive, affordable health \n     coverage. These seniors and disabled Americans have \n     voluntarily chosen to receive their health coverage through \n     Medicare HMOs and other private plans because of their \n     excellent value. To preserve this important option for \n     seniors across the country, bipartisan legislation was \n     introduced in the Senate as S. 590, the ``Medicare+Choice \n     Equity and Access Act.''\n\n  That became Medicare Advantage.\n\n       Co-sponsored by Senators Schumer and Santorum, S. 590 \n     sought to increase reimbursement rates and add new \n     reimbursement options for Medicare+Choice programs.\n\n  It goes on to make a compelling case for what came from that \nconference as Medicare Advantage, and that was utterly pleasing to \neverybody who signed this letter.\n  By the way, let me just mention the Democrats who signed this letter, \nwho wanted Medicare Advantage: John Kerry, Arlen Specter, Dianne \nFeinstein, Joe Lieberman, Patty Murray, Charles Schumer, Frank \nLautenberg, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ron Wyden, Mark Dayton, Mary \nLandrieu, Maria Cantwell, and Christopher Dodd. Fourteen Democrats \nsigned this letter, along with a number of bipartisan Republicans, who \nbelieved we really needed to include Medicare Advantage.\n  Now, to take advantage, our colleagues on the other side want to do \naway with Medicare Advantage, except in 3 States that are, for the most \npart, Democratic States, leaving all the other 46 States high and dry.\n  Let me just say that this letter is in response--it was a letter \ngiven to the Medicare modernization conference committee. This \nconference committee gave them everything they wanted for Medicare \nAdvantage. This legislative grant of power gave the signatories the \nMedicare Advantage Program, which now 11 million senior citizens enjoy \ntoday.\n  Now those on the left want to do away with this important program \nthat benefits seniors and minorities in an amazing set of ways. I am \nagainst that effort. I hope our colleagues on the other side will \nrealize what they are doing. It just is not right. Vision care and \ndental care and so many other approaches that really work for this \nprogram will be taken away from these people. They are going to have to \nspend $175 to $200 a month to get what they got for an average of about \n$54 a month. These are people who need our help.\n  Let me change the subject for a minute because I understand my \ncolleague from Oregon was discussing Medicare Advantage and talking \nabout some Medicare Advantage companies living ``high off the hog'' and \ninferring that is a rationale for $120 billion in Medicare Advantage \ncuts. I have two responses to my colleague from Oregon. This is not \nabout Medicare Advantage insurance companies, this is about preserving \nthe choice of coverage for seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls 4 minutes 46 \nseconds; the Senator from Connecticut, 4 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. He also said that under the Reid bill, Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries will be able to keep what they have. You know, he is \nright about some Medicare Advantage beneficiaries being able to keep \nwhat they have due to the Nelson grandfathering amendment passed by the \nSenate Finance Committee this fall. But those protections primarily \napply to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Florida, Oregon, and New \nYork--beneficiaries living in other parts of the country. Rural areas \nwill not be protected.\n  So let's be clear when we say Medicare Advantage beneficiaries' \nbenefits will not be cut. These extra benefits include lower premiums, \ndeductibles, and copayments, dental coverage, and hearing aids, to name \nonly a few.\n  Bottom line: Most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries may not keep what \nthey have, contrary to the President's promise to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2899 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have an amendment that will be sent to \nthe desk pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement. I now call up my \namendment No. 2899.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2899 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows.\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that there is no reduction or elimination of any \nbenefits guaranteed by law to participants in Medicare Advantage plans)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO CUTS IN GUARANTEED BENEFITS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall result in the reduction or \n     elimination of any benefits guaranteed by law to participants \n     in Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment to\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\nclarify, once again, that we are not cutting any Medicare benefits. We \nare not cutting any of the guaranteed Medicare benefits people receive \nright now. In fact, AARP, which has been saying this on its Web site \nfor months, has released a letter now. It quotes this sentence:\n\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  Not only AARP but the Association for the Protection of Medicare and \nSocial Security, the Alliance for Retired Americans, and other seniors \norganizations all agree.\n  What we are talking about is saving Medicare, cutting down on \noverpayments that have been in place. Right now, 80 to 85 percent of \nthe seniors who get their benefits, their health care, through \ntraditional Medicare are paying more in premiums, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, than they otherwise would, because MedPAC \nestimates we are paying about $12 billion more for people in the \nprivate for-profit insurance system right now that is called Medicare \nAdvantage. The majority of seniors are subsidizing high insurance \ncompany profits and overpayments. What we have done in this bill is \ntake out the overpayments and, in fact, put in competition, competitive \nbidding. I thought that was something our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle supported--competitive bidding for reimbursements so we \nare not continuing the overpayments in Medicare Advantage that are \ncausing Medicare to go broke much sooner and causing the majority of \nseniors to subsidize high insurance company profits.\n  What we are seeing on the effort, unfortunately, of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle is an effort to support huge subsidies instead \nof supporting competitive bidding that is in the bill.\n  The reality is that the guaranteed benefits--inpatient care, doctor \nvisits, lab tests, preventive screenings, skilled nursing facilities, \nhospice care, home health care, prescription drugs, ambulance services, \ndurable medical equipment, emergency room care, kidney dialysis, \noutpatient mental health care, occupational and physical therapy, \nimaging such as x-ray, EKGs, organ transplants, and the ``Welcome to \nMedicare'' physical are all covered, as they have been, for all \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  What we are doing is taking overpayments to for-profit insurance \ncompanies and putting that back into increased benefits for every \nsenior. That is cutting down on prescription drug costs by closing the \ndoughnut hole and strengthening preventive care. And the most important \npiece of all: lengthening the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I have been reviewing the amendment of \nthe Senator from Michigan. This is very important to the people of \nFlorida because it deals with Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is \na very important program. It is not just some extra frills. It is the \nidea that our folks in Florida can get eye care, dental care, hearing \ncare, diabetic supplies, preventive medicine. Last week I went down to \na Medicare Advantage clinic in Miami, the Leone Center. This is a place \nwhere seniors are getting holistic health care. The intention of this \namendment is to guarantee the benefits in Medicare Advantage, but I am \nnot sure it is phrased that way. I have been reading the bill. I have \nbeen reading Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. I cannot find the \nphrase ``guaranteed benefit.'' I ask unanimous consent that the \n``guaranteed by law'' phrase in this amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Michigan be eliminated so that we would ensure that benefits of \neye care, dental care, preventative care, diabetic supplies, all the \nother things that are provided in Medicare Advantage, are actually \npreserved. No one is objecting to lower costs. No one is objecting to a \ncompetitive situation where we have companies providing more services \nfor less cost. We want to make sure the services are still there.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that phrase ``guaranteed by law'' be \neliminated from the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, I ask that my colleague \nwork with me. We will be happy to talk about how we might address what \nhe is concerned about. Unfortunately, the reality is, the for-profit \ncompanies are objecting to competitive bidding. The language my \ncolleague has suggested would include items that have been offered to \nthe in people in for-profit plans such as gym memberships and other \nthings that have been of great concern. Given that, I would have to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The time of the Senator from Florida has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I have watched from my office on C-SPAN and been on this \nfloor countless times in the last 3 or 4 days as my friends on the \nother side continue to do the bidding of the insurance companies. I \nhear them talk about Medicare Advantage, how great it is. I was in the \nHouse of Representatives 10 years ago when Medicare Advantage began, \nwhen the insurance companies said: We can save Medicare 5 percent on \nall its costs by bringing forward Medicare Advantage. Then when the \nRepublicans took control of everything, that savings of 5 percent, the \ninsurance companies decided, no, we can't save 5 percent anymore. We \nneed a 13-percent bonus. The chickens have come home to roost for the \ninsurance companies, for good and bad.\n  I refer to a Dow Jones story entitled ``Humana 3rd Quarter Profits Up \n65%, See Strong Medicare Advantage Gains.''\n  Let me excerpt from the first few paragraphs.\n\n       Humana Inc.'s third-quarter earnings rose 65% amid improved \n     margins at its government (i.e. Medicare Advantage) segment. \n     The company gave an initial 2010 forecast in which the health \n     insurer projects ``substantial'' Medicare Advantage \n     membership growth, resulting in revenue of $32 billion to $34 \n     billion--well above analysts' average estimate of $29.63 \n     billion. Humana's forecast takes into account reductions in \n     Medicare Advantage over-payments.\n\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island knows and the Presiding Officer and \nmy colleagues who have been strong supporters of Medicare, when we see \npeople who have opposed Medicare, opposed the creation of Medicare 40 \nyears ago, tried to privatize Medicare with Speaker Gingrich down the \nHall in the House of Representatives a dozen years ago, now they are \nMedicare's biggest defenders? I don't think so. They have been the \ninsurance industry's biggest defenders. That is what the debate the \nlast 3 days was all about. What is important is we guarantee Medicare \nservices, as we will. We quit subsidizing insurance companies, as we \nshould. And then that $90 tax every Medicare beneficiary has to pay, \nthat $90 that goes to insurance subsidies, will be taken away so \nMedicare fee-for-service, regular Medicare members, which is 81, 82, 83 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries, won't be paying that insurance \ncompany Republican tax they have had to pay ever since Medicare \nAdvantage subsidies to insurance companies were increased.\n  We need to get this bill moving. The stalling and delays should be \nover.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls 6 minutes 45 \nseconds, and the Senator from Iowa controls 2 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it was interesting to hear my friend from \nOhio. I plan to support the Hatch amendment regarding Medicare \nAdvantage, but it is not because I don't believe we need to do some \nthings to cause Medicare to be more solvent. I do believe that Medicare \nAdvantage does have some subsidies to insurance companies that are \nhigher than they should be. The fact is, this bill is taking money from \na program that is insolvent, Medicare, and using that to create an \nentitlement. I will support the Hatch amendment, even though I would \nlove to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle to do those\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\nthings, to make Medicare more solvent, but I think what is so \nobjectionable to all of us is to know that we have an insolvent \nMedicare Program that the trustees have said will be bankrupt in the \nyear 2017, and my friends on the other side of the aisle are taking \nmoney from that program to leverage a new entitlement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a basic choice. Will we continue \nto subsidize private health insurance companies that are overcharging \nthe Medicare Program by 14 percent? Will we take that money out of \nMedicare to continue the subsidy for profitable private health \ninsurance companies? It is that basic. I say to the Senator from \nTennessee, the Congressional Budget Office tells us, yes, untouched, \nthe Medicare program in 7 or 8 years faces insolvency. But this bill \nadds 5 years of solvency to Medicare right off the top--something he \nwon't acknowledge but he should. Let me also add, if we are going to \nbring down the cost of Medicare so that recipients get quality care, we \nhave to get rid of these outrageous subsidies to private health \ninsurance companies, the Medicare Advantage Program. We also have to be \nhonest about those providers overcharging Medicare. Why does it cost \ntwice as much in Miami for the same service that is given to Medicare \npatients in Rochester, MN? It should not. Somebody is ripping off the \nsystem. If we can't ask those honest questions, then I am afraid we \nwill not put Medicare on sound financial footing. We can do that. But \nwe can't do that by saying: We have got to continue to subsidize \nprivate health insurance companies out of Medicare. That is the Hatch \namendment. That is what we should vote against.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, those of us who have been privileged \nto hear our friends on the other side debate the public option have \nseen a relentless insistence on the public option operating on a level \nplaying field with the private insurance industry. I can't tell the \nnumber of times we have heard that. Indeed, even when we designed the \npublic option so that it did operate on a level playing field with the \nprivate insurance industry, they still complained. But now we have a \nsituation in which we have private industry operating at a 14-percent \nadvantage and subsidy against Medicare. Suddenly, the other side's \ninterest in a level playing field has evaporated. Suddenly their \ninterest is in doing what is, once again--in the astonishing \ncoincidence that characterizes debate--in the interest of the insurance \nindustry.\n  I have yet to see an argument made from the other side of the aisle \nthat doesn't happen to coincide with the interests of the insurance \nindustry. It could not be more stark on this point. If it is a public \noption, they want it to compete on a level playing field. And even then \nthey are against it. If it is privately subsidized coverage, getting an \nadvantage against the public system, then they are for it.\n  I urge consistency and support of the effort to bring some discipline \nto Medicare Advantage, as the private insurance industry promised. We \nare doing no more than holding them to their word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 30 seconds to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Casey, filed an amendment designed to spend $2.5 \nbillion to protect Medicare Advantage benefits for Pennsylvanians. What \nis going on? What is going on here? Why can't we protect every citizen? \nThat is five States that are ``protected'' and spending extra billions \nof dollars. Let's have an amendment that every State is treated the \nsame. Let's do that. I tell my colleagues, I intend to introduce an \namendment that will do so. That will take away the special exceptions \nthat are taken for special States to have special influence around \nhere.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, to put this in perspective, when I \nhear all of this debate, it is as though everything has to be more \ngovernment, bigger government, government is better than the private \nsector. Medicare Advantage is an option. It is not a mandate. It is an \noption that allows seniors another choice to get eye care, hearing \naids. Let's let seniors have this option. Let's not cut it away from \nthem. We need more competition, not less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it was interesting to hear the last \nspeaker say: Don't take away the option for seniors in Medicare \nAdvantage. Yet they have an amendment to take away the option for \npeople who buy insurance against having a disability so they can stay \nin their own homes and have support. It is voluntary. It is not \nmandatory. No one is forcing them to do anything, I say to my friend \nfrom Texas. Yet there is an amendment on that side to take away that \nvoluntary program, the CLASS Act, so that people can voluntarily put \nmoney into it to protect themselves against a future disability. Let's \nkind of keep our arguments a little bit straight.\n  A lot of people have talked about Medicare Advantage. I will not \nclose the argument on that. I will close on the necessity of keeping \nthe CLASS Act in this bill. I have spoken many times about that. It is \nnot a partisan issue. It is like when we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. It was not a partisan issue. This should not be a \npartisan issue too. We should not let politics get involved. Over 275 \ngroups representing people with disabilities of all ages, from AARP to \nParalyzed Veterans of America to the Interfaith Coalition, support the \nCLASS Act. It was unanimously adopted by the HELP Committee, \nunanimously adopted by Republicans and Democrats. Senator Gregg offered \nan amendment to insist that it be actuarially sound over 75 years, and \nit is actuarially sound over 75 years.\n  Secretary Sebelius said the administration supports it. President \nObama supports it. There is broad-based support for the CLASS Act.\n  Today we received some letters from people around the country. I \ndon't have time to read them all but just a couple. Here is one from \nArkansas:\n\n       My wife has a journalism degree, cerebral palsy and brings \n     money to the state of Arkansas with her stay at home job with \n     occasional travel. If her health worsens she could still earn \n     money for the state under the CLASS Act working from home \n     with the assistance from an attendant, [rather than having to \n     go to a nursing home.]\n\n  Here is Virginia:\n\n       I don't currently need the services under the CLASS Act, \n     but having been born with a disability I've always been \n     acutely aware of the possibility of serious issues down the \n     road . . . it would be a good thing for me, a thirty-year-old \n     working person, [to be able to put some money away.]\n\n  I beg my colleagues, for the sake of people with disabilities, let's \nnot adopt the amendment of the Republicans to take away the CLASS Act. \nIt was Senator Kennedy's premier goal.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one on issues \nassociated with improving the lives of seniors and the disabled.\n  As ranking member on the Aging Committee, I oversaw critical hearings \ninto deep and persistent problems in our Nation's nursing homes. I was \nthe principal author of the Medicare Part D prescription drug bill \nwhich is currently providing our seniors and people with disabilities \nwith affordable prescription medications.\n  On the disability front, one of my proudest achievements is the \nenactment of legislation I sponsored along with the late Senator Ted \nKennedy, the Family Opportunity Act, which extends Medicaid coverage to \ndisabled children.\n  In large part, through my efforts, the Money Follows the Person \nRebalancing\n\n[[Page S12394]]\n\nAct, and the option for States to implement a home- and community-based \nservices program were included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n  Along with Senator Kerry, I have introduced the Empowered At Home Act \nwhich, among other things, revises the income eligibility level for \nhome- and community-based services for elderly and disabled \nindividuals.\n  If I thought that the CLASS Act would add to this list of \nimprovements to the lives of seniors or the disabled, I would be first \nin line as a proud cosponsor of the CLASS Act.\n  But the CLASS Act does not strengthen the safety net for seniors and \nthe disabled.\n  The CLASS Act compounds the long-term entitlement spending problems \nwe already have by creating yet another new, unsustainable entitlement \nprogram.\n  The CLASS Act is just simply not viable in its current form.\n  It is almost certain to attract the people who are most likely to \nneed it--this is known as adverse selection.\n  That will cause premiums to increase and healthier people to drop out \nof the program.\n  It is the classic ``insurance death spiral.''\n  On November 13, the administration's own Chief Actuary confirmed \nthis. The Chief Actuary issued a dire warning in a report on the CLASS \nAct in the House bill which is virtually identical to the Senate \nversion.\n  The Chief Actuary said:\n\n       There is a significant risk the problem of adverse \n     selection would make the CLASS program unsustainable.\n\n  The CLASS Act has been characterized by the Washington Post editorial \npage as a ``gimmick.''\n  For the first 10 years, the CLASS Act saves money at the beginning \nbecause it collects premiums before benefits start getting paid out.\n  But sometime afterwards, it starts to lose money.\n  We all know what happens from there. It will become the taxpayers' \nresponsibility to rescue the program as it fails.\n  Look at the financial struggles of Social Security. Look at Medicare. \nLook at Medicaid.\n  Now go home and look at your children and grandchildren.\n  Voting to protect the premiums of a program that you know will fail \nis irresponsible.\n  Creating the unsustainable CLASS Act is irresponsible.\n  Adding the ticking timebomb of yet another unfunded liability to our \nchildren and grandchildren through the CLASS Act is irresponsible.\n  The responsible vote is to strike the CLASS Act from the bill; I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo items. First is an article from Fortune magazine on the CLASS Act. \nSecond is a letter signed by seven of my Democratic colleagues \nobjecting to the CLASS Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Fortune Magazine, Sept. 3, 2009]\n\n                  The Crazy Math of Health-Care Reform\n\n                            (By Shawn Tully)\n\n       Embedded in the health-care plan moving forward is a truly \n     gravity-defying new device: a costly entitlement program \n     portrayed as a way to save money. So how can you raise \n     billions with a program that can't even pay for itself? Only \n     by using the crazy math that governs in the world of health-\n     care reform.\n       The gimmick was hatched on July 15 when the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions approved a \n     federal insurance plan for long-term care called the \n     Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or \n     CLASS Act.\n       The plan, which would provide modest benefits to people who \n     can't perform such simple daily tasks as bathing or feeding \n     themselves, was one of Sen. Ted Kennedy's last crusades. It \n     quickly became a favorite among Democrats, who are now adding \n     the CLASS Act to the leading proposal in the House, H.R. \n     3200, passed by the Energy & Commerce Committee.\n       While no one doubts the bill's humane intentions, its \n     ardent champions have another motive as well. A budget \n     gimmick allows them to claim that CLASS Act helps pay for \n     health-care reform.\n       The Democrats are promising a ``deficit neutral'' plan, \n     which means that according to rules set by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, they need to find about $1 trillion in new \n     taxes and savings over the next ten years. Right how, the \n     House legislation stands around $250 billion short.\n       The CLASS Act looks like a gift: It brings in $58 billion \n     in net tax revenues by 2019, lowering the deficit by an \n     equivalent amount because only minor costs will be booked \n     during that period. Under the CBO rules, the CLASS Act \n     technically covers one-quarter of the $250 billion shortfall \n     in funds needed to pay for health-care reform.\n       The gimmick lies in looking only at the CBO's ten-year \n     budget window. The extra revenues are an illusion because of \n     the disaster lurking just beyond that horizon.\n       In fact, none of the $58 billion is available to pay for \n     the House bill. The CLASS Act is so poorly designed that the \n     $58 billion reserve and all future premiums won't come close \n     to covering the generous benefits it's promising.\n       Here's why the mechanics of the CLASS Act assure its \n     eventual collapse.\n       Under the bill, all working Americans would have the option \n     of contributing a payroll tax averaging $65 a month for long-\n     term care. The eventual benefit for most recipients would be \n     $75 a day or $27,000 a year.\n       It could be used towards nursing-home expenses, but the \n     main goal is to allow infirm Americans to get the care they \n     need from aides or therapists in their own homes so they're \n     not forced into nursing homes.\n       But the CLASS Act's premiums aren't remotely high enough to \n     cover a likely deluge of claims. ``It's a microcosm of many \n     of the weaknesses in the health-care reform bills,'' says \n     Steve Schoonveld of the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA), \n     which did an excellent analysis of the CLASS Act.\n       The plan's main problem is that it encourages what's known \n     as ``adverse selection''--it will attract an extremely high \n     proportion of people who are sick and near retirement, and a \n     relatively small share of the young and healthy needed to \n     create a sound insurance plan.\n       One big weakness is that the CLASS Act doesn't screen for \n     medical problems, or even require information about them. \n     Hence, workers or their spouses can sign up even if they're \n     already ill. By contrast, private plans require strict \n     testing.\n       Participants in the CLASS program can also start collecting \n     benefits after just five years, a period the AAA deems far \n     too short. Workers and their spouses can also stop paying \n     premiums, then rejoin when they get sick with no penalty.\n       As a result, the AAA expects that the plan will be swamped \n     by people who know they have medical problems when they sign \n     up, and demand benefits right after they've paid for five \n     years.\n       The AAA says that the plan would become insolvent by 2021--\n     just beyond the CBO's budget window--and would have to raise \n     its premiums to $180 a month to meet its costs, a 177% \n     increase.\n       That would put the CLASS Act into a death spiral, since \n     virtually all younger and even moderately healthy \n     participants would drop out. It would become a program \n     exclusively for the old and sick, driving premiums still \n     higher.\n       The most likely outcome is that we'll never get to the $180 \n     premiums needed to fund the plan. Congress will be forced to \n     pay enormous subsidies to keep the premiums low enough to \n     encourage young and healthy people to sign up. Pressure will \n     also be intense to raise the benefits to pay for more \n     nursing-home expenses.\n       Instead of funding the shortfall in the House bill, the \n     CLASS Act will create a giant budget shortfall of its own. \n     Unfortunately, gimmickry like this is the kind of thing that \n     has fanned public fears about health-care reform doing more \n     harm than good.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: We write regarding the merger of the \n     Finance and HELP Committee health reform bills. We know you \n     face a great many difficult decisions now, one of which is \n     whether to include provisions from the HELP Committee bill \n     known as the CLASS Act in the merged bill.\n       We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senate's \n     merged bill, nor to use the savings as an offset for other \n     health items in the merger.\n       While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudable--finding a \n     way to provide long term care insurance to individuals--the \n     effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate \n     bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons.\n       CBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce the \n     deficit by $73 billion over ten years. But nearly all the \n     savings result from the fact that the initial payout of \n     benefits wouldn't begin until 2016 even though the program \n     begins collecting premiums in 2011. It is also clear that the \n     legislation increases the deficit in decades following the \n     first ten years. CBO has confirmed that the legislation \n     stand-alone would face a long-term deficit point of order in \n     the Senate.\n       Some have argued that the program is actuarially sound. But \n     this is the case because premiums are collected and placed in \n     a trust fund, which begins earning interest, and because the \n     HHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintain \n     actuarial solvency. We have grave concerns that the real \n     effect of the provisions would be to create a new federal \n     entitlement program with large, long-term spending increases \n     that far exceed revenues. This is especially the case if \n     savings from the first decade of the program are spent on \n     other health reform priorities.\n\n[[Page S12395]]\n\n       Slowing the growth of health care costs should be a top \n     priority as we move forward with health reform. Inclusion of \n     the CLASS Act would reduce the amount of long-term cost \n     savings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill. The \n     CLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrong \n     direction and should not be used to help pay for other health \n     provisions that will become more expensive over time and \n     increase deficits.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We hope that fiscally \n     responsible measures to improve access to long-term care can \n     be considered in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kent Conrad.\n     Joe Lieberman.\n     Mary Landrieu.\n     Evan Bayh.\n     Blanche L.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the CLASS \nAct and vote against the Thune amendment that would strike the CLASS \nAct from the bill.\n  As you have heard, I hope, this afternoon, this bill is totally \nvoluntary. There are no requirements by employers or employees to be \ninvolved. This is a very creative idea using individuals' money to \ncontribute to their own long-term financial security if they are faced \nwith disabilities.\n  We have now, with the adoption of the Whitehouse amendment, secured \nthat these funds can never be used for any other purpose than for the \nCLASS Act. That was the concern most of our colleagues had, if these \nfunds would drift off. As a result of the Gregg amendment in our \ncommittee, it has now been determined that these programs will be \nactuarially sound for 75 years. We have fixed the problem CBO raised \nwith it.\n  It is a very creative and solid program that can make a huge \ndifference for millions of Americans to avoid going to Medicare, \ndivesting themselves of their assets, and allowing them to lead \nindependent lives with dignity. It is deserving of our support. I urge \nthe approval of this program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the CLASS Act is the same old Washington, \nsame old smoke and mirrors, same old games. I wish to read what the \nCongressional Budget Office and the chief actuary for the \nadministration have said:\n\n       The program would add to future Federal budget deficits in \n     large and growing fashion.\n\n  If we don't take this out of this legislation, if we allow this to \nbecome law, we are locking in future generations to deficits and debt \nas far as the eye can see.

Mr. President, this amendment is very clear. My \namendment states that nothing in this act shall result in the reduction \nor elimination of any benefits guaranteed by law to participants in \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  Right now, CBO tells us, and we understand from MedPAC that there is \n$12 billion in overpayments to for-profit insurance companies, which \nare additional costs that the Medicare recipients pay beyond what is \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Eighty-five percent of our seniors in Medicare are in traditional \nMedicare and, right now, we are told that every single senior citizen \nor person with disability in Medicare pays $90 extra; every couple pays \n$90 extra to pay for the overpayments to private for-profit insurance \ncompanies.\n  As AARP has said, this legislation does not reduce any guaranteed \nMedicare benefits. We are asking for competitive bidding--for-profit \ncompany competitive bidding--to bring down the overpayments. I ask for \nsupport for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, regarding this amendment, I had a \nconversation with my colleague from Michigan. The phrasing ``guaranteed \nby law'' doesn't guarantee anything. This isn't going to protect the \nbenefits of Medicare Advantage.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to the motion to commit \noffered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending motion would strike the \nsavings the bill achieves from Medicare Advantage.\n  Why are we seeking savings from Medicare Advantage? Because MedPAC \ntells us that the government pays the private insurance companies that \nprovide Medicare Advantage 14 percent more than we pay traditional \nMedicare; because these extra subsidies to Medicare Advantage cost the \nfour-fifths of seniors in traditional Medicare $90 more a year in \npremiums even though they get no benefits from Medicare Advantage; \nbecause MedPAC says that ``the additional Medicare Advantage payments \nhasten the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund by 18 months; \nbecause the private insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage \nare making three-quarters of their profits from these government \noverpayments, and they can find some of the savings there; because \nprivate insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage are paying \ntheir CEOs $24 million, $9 million, and $8 million a year, and they \ncould find some of the savings there; and because nothing we do in our \nbill reduces benefits under Medicare.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my motion \nto commit.\n  Simply put, this motion protects Medicare beneficiaries participating \nin the Medicare Advantage Program by eliminating the $120 billion in \ncuts to the Medicare Advantage Program in the Reid bill.\n  Let me make this point as clearly as I can. A vote against my \namendment is a vote for slashing benefits for 11 million seniors and \nlow-income Americans, including vision benefits, dental benefits, home \ncare for chronic illness, wellness programs, disease management \nprograms, limits on cost sharing for primary care physician visits, \nreduced premiums for Part B, reduced premiums for Part D, reduced cost \nsharing for breast and prostrate cancer screening.\n  When we did this, 14 Democrats, many of whom are sitting here in the \nSenate right now, supported this development of Medicare Advantage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Have no doubt, when you vote against my amendment, you \nwill be voting to cut these lifesaving and life-enhancing benefits. The \nchoice is yours and the choice is clear. Our Nation's seniors are \nwatching.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] moves to commit \n     H.R. 3590 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate with changes that do not \n     include cuts in payments to home health agencies totaling \n     negative $42.1 billion.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the motion \nthat was just read. One of the things that I think is so very important \nabout a debate on the Senate floor is we begin to understand what this \nlegislation does to real people. We have come to understand that $466 \nbillion in Medicare cuts that are shown over my left shoulder have real \nconsequences to real people all across the United States. These cuts \ncompromise care, they compromise access to services that real people \nneed in their daily lives. Robbing these funds from Medicare to create \na dramatic new entitlement program, in my judgment, is not sound policy \nand it is not sound government.\n  That is especially true in this case when the impact on seniors' \nhealth care is so profound. These cuts will reduce the quality of care \nmany Americans are receiving today and reduce the care these Americans \ndeserve.\n  I have to tell you, out of all these Medicare cuts, one of the \nlargest head-scratching cuts is the one to home health. The Senate bill \ncuts $42.1 billion for home health care. Home health is about 3.7 \npercent of the Medicare budget. It is an important program. Yet 9.1 \npercent of the Medicare cuts in the Senate bill are taken out of home \nhealth.\n  Medicare home health spends less today than it did over a decade ago, \nwhile serving a similar number of beneficiaries at less cost per \npatient. That is the kind of program we should celebrate. Yet this bill \nhas them on the chopping block.\n  Maybe there is some misunderstanding about what home health provides, \nso let me clear up the confusion. Home health care agencies care for \npatients of all ages. They provide a broad range of essential health \ncare in support services, real security in the comfort of a patient's \nhome. Nine thousand Medicare-approved home health agencies existed in \n2007. I am very pleased to report to you that 74 of those are in my \nhome State of Nebraska. Nurses, therapists, home care aides, and others \nwho serve elderly and disabled patients in their own homes drive nearly \n5 billion miles a year to provide these much needed services. They care \nfor about 12 million real people annually, with 428 million visits, \neach one providing that personal touch of care.\n  The services that are provided in this very essential program include \nrehabilitation therapies, telemedicine, wound care, pain management, \nand skilled nursing.\n  Who is eligible to receive Medicare home health services? We can \nanswer that question by going to CMS. According to CMS, to qualify for \nMedicare home health benefits, a Medicare beneficiary must meet one of \nthe following requirements: They must be confined to home, they must be \nunder a doctor's care, they must need skilled nursing on a periodic \nbasis, and they must have a continuing need for occupational therapy. \nThese are truly some of the most vulnerable Americans. Yet in order to \nfinance this new entitlement, this bill takes money out of that much \nneeded program, and it places the cuts on the backs of these Americans, \nour most vulnerable Americans. Yet these cuts risk leaving them without \ncare.\n  What kind of conditions do people who utilize home health agencies \nsuffer from? I will turn to my own State to answer that question. In \nNebraska, one of our agencies is in rural Cherry County. Cherry County \nis a very large county in western Nebraska--in fact, larger than some \nStates. Who gets served in Cherry County? A gentleman with class III \ncongestive heart failure. He is awaiting a heart transplant. A \ngentleman who lost a leg from complications from diabetes, they get \nhome health care services. These folks are not striving to bilk the \nsystem. The payments that allow us to provide this much needed service \nto them are not excess payments. These are just average folks who are \nstriving to do their best to recover from their condition and manage \nthe best they can.\n  Keeping these folks out of the emergency room or the nursing home is \na benefit to everybody. I don't see how anybody could argue this \ndoesn't save tax dollars. In fact, there are statistics that support \nthat statement. According to the National Association of Home Health \nCare and Hospice, an average per-visit Medicare charge for home health \nis $132. Let me compare that charge of $132 to 1 day at a hospital. \nThat would cost 43 times as much, literally--$5,765 per day.\n  According to a study of Avalere Health:\n\n       Early use of home health care services following a hospital \n     stay by patients with at least one chronic disease saved \n     Medicare $1.71 billion in the 2-year period of 2005 to 2006.\n\n\n[[Page S12398]]\n\n\n  Doesn't it seem like an enormous step backwards when we talk about \nreform, when really what we are doing is cutting a program that serves \npeople so much in need and yet saves money in the Medicare Program? \nHome health agencies in Nebraska have been very successful in doing \nexactly what we want--keeping people at home and out of the hospitals \nand nursing homes. Of special interest are patients with congestive \nheart failure. One Nebraska woman turned to home health after facing a \nbig stack of hospital bills for rehab. Since then, she has been able to \nremain at home safely at a fraction of the cost. This home health \nagency can see a person for 60 days at a cost of about $2,500. One \nhospital admission, by comparison, would cost Medicare conservatively \n$20,000 to treat a patient with chronic heart failure. Again, home \nhealth care costs a fraction of hospital care, about 10 times less.\n  There are so many stories from patients who are alive today who love \nhome health care. This bill threatens them. Somewhere in the next \nhours, I am going to send to every Member of the Senate, all of my \ncolleagues, a State-by-State analysis of what these cuts will do in \ntheir States because they need to know the impact. This bill threatens \nto take that all away. You can't cut $42 billion and just describe it \nas excess payments. You can't cut 42 billion and say: That is just \nfixing those who are bilking the system. When you cut $42 billion out \nof a program like home health care, it has real consequences.\n  Earlier this week, I did a video conference with Medicare providers \nin Nebraska. These Nebraska home health providers reported this \nlegislation will cost them $120 million. What does that mean, $120 \nmillion? It may not sound like much around here, where we talk about \ntrillion-dollar programs, but $120 million to the people of Nebraska in \nhome health care, 68 percent of home health agencies in Nebraska will \nbe in the red by 2016, 68 percent. In rural areas, as high as 80 \npercent will have negative margins. You lose those services in rural \nareas. They are lost. There is nothing that will step in for those \npeople.\n  Home health providers already have to watch their bottom line, and \nthey are already making very hard, painful decisions. During this video \nconference, a nurse in rural Nebraska explained the reality to me this \nway:\n\n       I can give you a human story that just happened yesterday \n     in our agency. We had a referral from a patient that lives 90 \n     miles away. The drive time is three hours. To do the \n     administration takes 1\\1/2\\ to 2 hours. Then you come back to \n     the office and you do at least another hour of paperwork. It \n     would take one person's entire day to serve one patient. \n     Regretfully, we had to say no. We just could not see her. \n     There is no other agency close enough to help this woman.\n\n  Can you imagine? We have a person who desperately needed these \nservices, and we are debating whether we should cut $412 billion out of \nthis program that will impact a State such as mine to the tune of $120 \nmillion? These agencies and the services they provide absolutely are \nreliant on Medicare.\n  According to the National Association of Home Care and Hospice:\n\n       Medicare is the largest single payer of home health care \n     services.\n\n  When we cut the payments in a program like this, we cut access to \ncare. These access concerns are rooted in real life experiences. \nBetween 1998 and 2000, Medicare home health spending fell from $14 \nbillion to $9.2 billion or negative 34 percent, as a result of \ncongressional action between 1998 and 2000. Those actions triggered the \nclosure of 40 percent of home health agencies and reduced access for \n1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries. Access becomes a real issue. If \nthere is no home health agency, homebound patients end up with more \nexpensive care at hospitals and nursing homes. That costs Medicare \nmoney. But, you see, we are also cutting hospitals and nursing homes in \nthis bill.\n  If there is no home health provider near an area, not only are \nMedicare beneficiaries hurt but all citizens who need care. Any \nanalysis is going to come to the same conclusion.\n  I will quote from one:\n\n       Studies from MedPAC and the Government Accountability \n     Office also suggest that access is a growing problem for \n     patients who require intensive services. In June 2003, MedPAC \n     issued a report indicating that skilled nursing facilities \n     care is now substituting for home health care for some \n     patients, most likely at a much higher cost for Medicare.\n\n  I don't think these are transformational reforms. These cuts are not \ntransformational reform. They are just plain cuts, to start a new \nentitlement that will hurt real people, senior citizens who need our \nhelp. That is why I am offering this motion to recommit this \nlegislation back to the Finance Committee to strike these ill-advised \nhome health care cuts. I will follow up. I will make sure every Member \nsees the impact of these cuts in their State so they can make an \nassessment if these cuts should be put in place and cause the kind of \ndamage I have described this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield Senator Klobuchar 10 minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a true health \ncare reform. The way I look at this in my State, it is a matter of \naffordability and cost. We have one of the highest percentages of \npeople covered in the country in Minnesota. The issue is, it is \nbecoming more and more expensive for the people to afford health care. \nI always try to remember three simple numbers of all the ones we will \nhear in the next few weeks. Those are the numbers 6, 12, and 24. Ten \nyears ago it cost $6,000 for an average family to pay for health care a \nyear. Now it is $12,000, with a lot of people paying a lot more. Ten \nyears from now, if we don't do anything, it will be somewhere between \n$24,000 and $36,000 a year, something regular people just can't afford. \nIt is not going in the right direction.\n  If we don't act, costs will continue to skyrocket. The country spent \n$2.4 trillion on health care last year alone. That is $1 out of every \n$6 spent in the economy. By 2018, national health care spending is \nexpected to reach $4.4 trillion, over 20 percent of our entire economy. \nDespite spending 1\\1/2\\ times more per person on health care than any \nother country, many of our people don't even have health care coverage. \nMany of them are losing their coverage because of preexisting \nconditions or because it simply is costing too much. These costs are \nbreaking the backs of our families and businesses. We can see here, \nsingle coverage, 1999, $2,196. Now at 2008, the last figures we have \navailable, $4,704, a doubling. Family cost, 1999, $5,791--that is the \naverage family's premium--now they are paying $12,680.\n  Look what is happening to small businesses. A study by the Council of \nEconomic Advisers found that small businesses pay up to 18 percent more \nthan large businesses to provide health care coverage. In a recent \nnational survey, nearly three-quarters of small businesses that did not \noffer benefits cited high premiums as the reason.\n\n  Look at it this way: Inflation usually raises the cost of most goods \nand services between 2 to 3 percent per year. Health care premium costs \nhave been going up close to 8 percent a year. That is an increase \nAmericans can't afford. Wages have not kept pace with the increase in \npremiums.\n  Look at this. Between 1999 and 2007, the average American worker saw \nhis wages increase 29 percent. Obviously, the last few years it has not \nbeen that rosy. How much did his insurance premiums go up? One hundred \ntwenty percent during the same time period. In other words, the health \ncare premiums are taking out a bigger and bigger chunk of the average \nworker's paycheck. These costs are breaking the backs of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  My colleague was talking about Medicare. The truth is, Medicare is \nprojected to go into deficit by 2017, if we don't do anything about it.\n  Recent Congressional Budget Office estimates show that the majority \nof the projected $344 billion increase in Federal revenues are \nscheduled to automatically go to cover rising health care costs. \nMedicare--something that people who are 55 want to get when they are \n65; people who are 65 want to keep until they live to the ripe old age \nof 95--if we don't do anything about it, is going in the red by 2017.\n  How do we do this? How do we get to the place where we want to go? We\n\n[[Page S12399]]\n\nmust get our money's worth from our health care dollars. The problem \nnow is, we are paying too much and we are not getting a good return on \nwhat we pay. The solution must be to get the best value for our health \ncare dollars; otherwise costs are going to continue to wreak havoc on \nthe backs of government, businesses, and individual families.\n  Medicare is 57 percent of all Federal health spending. If we want to \nsustain Medicare, which we all do, to provide that kind of high-quality \nhealth care our seniors deserve, we must do something to address the \nfiscal challenges.\n  The root of the problem is that most health care is purchased on a \nfee-for-service basis, so more tests, more surgery means more money. \nQuantity, not quality pays. According to researchers at Dartmouth \nMedical School, nearly $700 billion per year is wasted on unnecessary \nor ineffective care.\n  My favorite example is what Geisinger Clinic did in Pennsylvania. \nThey were not happy with their diabetes treatment, so they decided we \nare going to have the routine patients see nurses. The more difficult \ncases will see doctors. Then those endocrinologists will review the \nrecords of the nurses and make sure this patient is progressing as we \nwant. Guess what. Patient quality goes way up because they see nurses \nand they see them more regularly. Results go way up because \nendocrinologists are spending time on the most difficult cases and \nreviewing records of the other. Costs go down $200 per month per \npatient. Guess what. They get paid less--way, way, way less for that \nkind of good quality care.\n  This system is messed up, and we need to change it so we are \nrewarding based on results. We put the patient in the driver's seat so \nthat when that patient gets better results, then we reward with \npayments. In Minnesota, we have several great examples of this \ncoordinated outcome system.\n  At a place such as the Mayo Clinic, Park Nicollet, St. Mary's in \nDuluth, the priority is value not volume. As this chart shows, if the \nspending per patient with chronic diseases everywhere in the country \nmirrored the efficient level of spending in the Mayo Clinic's home \nregion of Rochester, MN--this is Mayo Clinic quality health care.\n\n  For the last 4 years of chronically ill patients' lives, if we used \nthat same system all over the country, how much would we save, if we \nused this system in Texas, if we used this system in Florida? We would \nsave $50 billion every 5 years for the taxpayers of this country and \nget higher quality care.\n  This is not like a hotel right now in this country where if you pay \nmore money, you get a better room with a better view. No. The opposite \nis true. In this country, the States where you pay more money, you get \nless quality care. That is what we need to change to bring all of the \nStates up to that high-quality care, efficient care, that costs less \nbut is a better value. That is what we need to do.\n  How do we do it? Well, linking rewards to the outcomes for an entire \npayment area creates the incentive for physicians and hospitals to work \ntogether to improve quality and efficiency; using bundling, to bill, so \nyou look at the whole outcome of everyone working together, so you rely \non nurses when you want to rely on nurses, so you rely on doctors when \nyou want to rely on doctors; by reducing hospital readmissions. Who \nwants to go back in the hospital over and over again just because there \nare a bunch of infections hanging around? In fact, right now, if you go \nback to the hospital, the hospital gets rewarded for that. So we want \nto put in place protocols that make hospitals safer places to treat \npatients. In 1 year, hospital readmissions cost Medicare $17.4 billion, \nand a 2007 report by MedPAC found that Medicare paid an average of \n$7,200 per readmission that was likely preventable. We need to have \nintegrated care, where you have a primary care provider, working with a \nteam, instead of having 15 specialists running around the field, \nrunning over each other. You need a quarterback, well, let's just say \nlike Brett Favre and the Minnesota Vikings. You have one quarterback \nwho is your primary care doctor, who is in charge, with a team of \ndoctors who look at all the medical records. That is integrated care. \nThat is what we should be rewarding. That is what this bill does.\n  Looking at some of the other inefficiencies, the Presiding Officer \nhas been a leader on Medicare fraud. Think about the money we can save. \nMedicare fraud alone costs taxpayers more than $60 billion every year. \nInstead of that money going to our seniors, do you know where that \nmoney is going? It is going to con men, people who are leeching off the \nsystem, people who are making up that they are providing services when \nthey are not. The Presiding Officer and I have a bill we are working \ntogether on to bring that down so that money can actually go to our \nseniors instead of going out to a bunch of people who are ripping off \nthe system, ripping off our seniors.\n  If you look at how you save money, if you look at how you reduce \ncosts in Medicare, well, you reduce costs in Medicare by making changes \nto this system and making this work. We must look to the future. That \nis why health care reform this year is so crucial. This bill is not \nabout today or even next year; it is about 5 years from now, it is \nabout 10 years from now, and beyond. We cannot afford for the people of \nthis country to hold off any longer. We can bring these costs down. We \ncan bring the quality up. And we can reward the people of this country \nfor the money they are putting into health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, who brought out a lot of important issues as far as the \nrising costs of health insurance, and I certainly knew that as a small \nbusinessman. There is only one problem: The bill we are going to vote \non does not solve those problems. In fact, as CBO basically tells us, \ninsurance will continue to increase at the same rate it does now, and \nfor those with individual insurance policies, it is very likely to go \nup.\n  Mr. President, we are here on a Friday evening being told we are \ngoing to work through the weekend, maybe next weekend, all the way up \nto Christmas Eve, with the intent to rush through a bill that many have \ncalled--and I agree--one of the worst pieces of legislation and one of \nthe biggest threats to health care we have ever seen here in this \ncountry. Apparently, the majority wants to rush this through and \nhopefully intimidate the minority into allowing it to go through by \nkeeping us here on weekends over the holidays. But I am proud \nRepublicans are standing together against this bill and standing with \nthe American people to stop the Democratic government takeover of \nhealth care in America and to stop them from paying for it by cutting \nnearly $500 billion from Medicare and raising taxes on millions of \nAmericans.\n  I heard from one of our constituents, who was talking about Medicare \nand the cuts in Medicare, explaining very simply that Medicare is \nsomething he had paid for his entire 40 years of working out of his \npayroll taxes, and now he could not believe we were considering taking \nany money out of Medicare in order to pay for a new government program.\n  Americans work and pay for Medicare so that when they retire they \nwill have benefits that give them the coverage they need. I think the \nmajority must think Americans are not paying attention or maybe even \nthey are not real smart, that you can take $500 billion out of a \nprogram that is already bankrupt and expect the benefits to stay the \nsame, when already we know we are not paying doctors enough to see our \nseniors and more and more physicians are not even willing to see \nMedicare patients.\n  If there really is waste and fraud in Medicare--and we know there is \nsome--we should find it and put that money back into the Medicare \nsystem so we can keep our promises to seniors.\n  Every Democrat in the Senate has already voted for a government \ntakeover of health care, to cut Medicare to pay for it, and to raise \ntaxes. Some of them said they were just moving the debate forward. But \nI ask you, what debate? Will there be any serious consideration to take \nthis government-run plan out of this bill? There will not be.\n  We have already seen there is no serious consideration to stop taking \nmoney out of Medicare to pay for it. In fact, we have had a lot of \ndebate about\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nwhat this is going to do: to cut from Medicare, what it is going to \neventually do to benefits, cut Medicare Advantage. Now we are talking \nabout cutting home health, which is so important, particularly in rural \ncommunities and for the more elderly constituents we serve.\n  There is no way you could take this money out of Medicare without \nhurting the programs. Instead, as we look ahead at more people retiring \nthan ever in history and Medicare being bankrupt, we need to be looking \nat ways that we can shore up this program so it will be there for \ngenerations to come.\n  Every Republican voted no. Every Republican in this Senate has stood \nwith the American people and said no to a health care bill that takes \nover the most personal and private part of our lives. I am proud of our \nparty and our leadership.\n  Americans have been asking to see the differences between the \nRepublican and the Democratic Parties. I think now more than ever on \nthis issue they are going to see the Democrats standing with \ngovernment-controlled health care, cuts in Medicare, increased taxes \nand on the other side Republicans who are going to stay here through \nChristmas and New Year's or whatever it takes to stop this bill and to \nsit down and really reform this system in a way that will lower costs \nand improve care to all Americans.\n  We need to continue to talk about these bigger issues, particularly \nhow it affects Medicare, and we will be doing that over the weekend. \nBut I think we owe it to the American people to begin to open this bill \nand explain what is in it. I can almost guarantee you, there is not one \nMember of the Senate who has read it yet. We are going to try to fit \nthis in Santa's sleigh this year so it will be delivered to every \nAmerican.\n  I have the first part here--1,000 pages, small print, front and \nback--and have started going through it, putting tabs on different \npages, so we can talk about the different things because sometimes they \nsound so extraordinary, people do not really believe they are in there. \nI am not sure we will ever get through the whole thing, but I just want \nto take a couple parts tonight and just start talking about what is \nreally in this bill.\n\n  On page 17, in section 2713 that is titled ``Coverage Of Preventive \nHealth Services,'' which is really our jargon for rationing, it says:\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage shall provide \n     coverage for . . .\n       evidence-based items or services that have in effect a \n     rating of ``A'' or ``B'' in the current recommendations of \n     the United States Preventive Services Task Force.\n\n  We heard from this task force a few weeks ago. This may sound \nharmless enough, as you look at it, but let's see what the really \nmeans: ``evidence-based . . . `A' or `B'.'' What is not A or B? Well, \njust 2 weeks ago, we found out something that was not A or B. \nMammograms are a C rating. And the task force came out and said it \nshould not be covered on anyone under 50 years old. That is in the \nbill, that it would not cover mammograms for folks under 50 years old \nbecause it is not A or B. Because of the outcry, we had an amendment \nfrom the other side to give themselves a little bit of cover on that \none medical procedure, mammograms. We passed it with some fanfare \nyesterday. But the fact is, there are going to be many C ratings that \nare not covered.\n  What are we going to do here in Congress over the next several years \nwhen we find constituents are not covered for things they need in \nretirement from Medicare? Are we going to pass bills to try to cover \nthose individual things? What we should really do is throw out the bill \nthat is causing the problem. We should not be rationing care to our \nseniors.\n  Let's look at another page. And I know this is not as interesting as \ntalking about theoretical stuff. But on page 33, section 2719 is called \nthe ``Appeals Process'':\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage shall implement \n     an effective appeals process . . .\n       [to] provide notice to enrollees, in a culturally and \n     linguistically appropriate manner. . . .\n\n  Now, what do we think that means? Well, in fact, in 2001--this term \nhas been used before--the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported that the Department had spent $10 million to figure out what \nthat phrase means. And we still do not know. It says: ``Health care \nservices that are respectful of and responsive to cultural and \nlinguistic needs.'' But what this really means to us, according to the \n2000 census, is there are at least 20 languages spoken by at least \n200,000 Americans in this country, and what we are putting out there is \na liability for every insurance company that does not have every aspect \nof their plan in those 20 languages. It may sound like a simple thing, \nbut every page of this bill, almost--as you read it, you realize it is \nincreasing the complexity and the cost of the system here in America.\n  I will just cover one more of these because I hear my colleagues in \nthe background urging me to finish. But I do think we owe it to the \nAmerican people to begin to talk about what is really in this bill.\n  On page 39, it says, under a funding category:\n\n       Out of all funds in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, there are appropriated to the Secretary \n     $250,000,000 to be available for expenditure for grants under \n     paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B).\n\n  Those subparagraphs are to track the trends in premium increases of \nhealth insurance once this bill goes into effect. Mr. President, $250 \nmillion to do what the Congressional Budget Office has already told us \nare going to be increases. But this kind of spending and this type of \nbureaucracy and complexity we are creating is not going to make health \ncare more accessible and more affordable for Americans. It is creating \na complex bureaucracy with tens of thousands of workers and bureaucrats \nto tell doctors what to do and hospitals what to do and for us, how to \nmanage our health care.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has already released a report finding \nthat those purchasing insurance through the health insurance exchanges \nthat are in this bill could pay up to 16 percent more for health care \nthan we do today. Yet we are moving ahead with the bill.\n  I will continue throughout this weekend, and every time I get a \nchance to speak, to talk about more of these things that are in this \nbill. But, folks, this is not a bill we should deliver to the American \npeople for Christmas this year. This is a bill that we should throw out \nso we can start over and have a step-by-step approach to make health \ninsurance more affordable and available to every American.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we are going to go back and forth \nhere.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. There is no ``forth.''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sorry?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. There is no ``forth,'' Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, we are going to go back and forth. Here is Senator \nKaufman.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We could go back and back, sir--I do not care--and then \nforth and forth.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Back and forth, and forth and forth, and to and fro, and \nthis and that it works fine for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaufman are printed in Today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the motion \nof my good friend from Nebraska, my colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nJohanns to--the official words say: to commit the bill back to the \nSenate Finance Committee with instructions to strike the cuts to the \nMedicare home health care benefit.\n  What the distinguished Senator is trying to do is bring some common \nsense to the cuts to a very vital source of health care, not only to \nrural areas but all over this country, and that is home health care. \nThe bill we are considering, the bill sometimes called the\n\n[[Page S12401]]\n\n``behind closed doors'' bill, would cut home health care by $42 \nbillion.\n  The Senator from Nebraska says that is a head-scratcher, and it \ncertainly is. It is more than a head scratcher; it is a Lizzie Borden \namputation in regard to a vital program.\n  Home health care is critical for our seniors. Obviously, that is the \ntruth. As the cochair of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus, I \ncertainly understand that. So does the Senator from Nebraska. He was \nsaying yesterday how many times he visits his rural hospitals, rural \nclinics, rural hospices, and you do that a lot if you are from Nebraska \nor Iowa or Texas or Kansas.\n  At any rate, in my home State of Kansas and other rural areas, many \nseniors live alone or out in the country miles away from a local \nhospital or a doctor's office. Even if they have a very good doctor, \nthey can't get there because of their health condition. So home health \ncare allows those seniors the freedom and the independence to stay in \ntheir home in the comfort of knowing somebody is there assisting their \nhealth care needs. More importantly, home health care is the cost-\neffective care, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, that \nkeeps the senior out of a nursing home or hospital and--guess what--\nsaves the government money. Over the long term, if you cut home health \ncare, you are going to increase the cost in regard to nursing homes, no \nquestion about it.\n  In my State I have had the pleasure of being able to see firsthand, \nas has the Senator from Nebraska, the great work our Kansas Home Health \nCare Association members do every day. Last year I was invited into the \nhome of a lovely couple in Concordia, KS, America, not too far from \nNebraska, and despite having multiple health issues, Duane and Phyllis \nwere able to stay in their home with their little dog Josie, all thanks \nto the services provided by a home health care aide and a home nurse.\n  What is going to happen to seniors such as Duane and Phyllis if we \nslash $42 billion from home health care payments? Forty-two billion \ndollars is one of the largest Medicare cuts in the whole bill next to \nMedicare Advantage and the hospitals. The Senator from Nebraska had \nthat chart showing serious cuts to all of our providers. Don't forget \nthat this cut comes on the heels of several years of additional cuts to \nhome health care--around $35 billion all told--that already have a \nlarge percentage of Kansas home health care agencies operating at very \nslim or negative Medicare margins. I know the same is true in Iowa, and \nthe same is true in Texas, in Montana, in Nebraska, and all over the \ncountry.\n  I keep hearing my colleagues, however, on the other side of the aisle \ninsisting that their $\\1/2\\ trillion cut to all Medicare--here is the \nquote--``won't affect the benefits guaranteed to seniors.'' Please stop \nthat. Please stop that. That is the most disingenuous smokescreen in \nthis whole debate. It may be true that this bill does not explicitly \ncut benefits. My friends across the aisle, however, cannot deny that \ntheir cuts in reimbursements to providers will affect those benefits, \nbecause when you cut the reimbursements to providers, guess who pays \nthe price. The patients--Duane and Phyllis and their little dog Josie. \nI tell you what. You come to their house and you make that argument \nthat if you close down or make cuts to home health care, Duane is not \ngoing to like it, Phyllis is not going to like it, and Josie will bite \nyou on your leg.\n  As I said, many of my Kansas home health care agencies are already \noperating at negative margins. Their projected share of these cuts, as \nprovided by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, is almost $240 \nmillion. To the Senator from Montana, the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, my dear friend, that is $60 million in Montana; and \nNevada, where the distinguished majority leader lives, the chart that \nhas been provided to me by the Senator, $263 million.\n  We have Senator Cornyn sitting right behind me here. Senator Cornyn, \nyou are in the $6.8 billion category for Texas. I might ask the \nSenator, What is going to happen if you get cut $6.8 billion in regard \nto home health care service?\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a response, $6.8 billion \nwould cut not just into the muscle but into the bone and deny a lot of \nelderly people, particularly in rural areas, access to care entirely.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Nebraska has \nalready pointed out what happens in Nebraska, and I know what will \nhappen in Kansas. Nearly two-thirds of Kansas home health care agencies \nwill have negative margins within only 5 years, probably 2 or 3, if \nthese cuts are allowed to occur.\n  How are these agencies supposed to stay in business with these kinds \nof cuts? The home health care benefit will be worthless to a Kansas \nMedicare patient whose home health care agencies will go out of \nbusiness. So, yes, in fact, this bill will effectively cut benefits. \nAgain, get rid of the smokescreen.\n  This doesn't apply just to the home health care benefit. The same can \nbe said for the effect of the cuts, as demonstrated by the Senator from \nNebraska, for reimbursements to hospitals. This bill is going to cost \nthe Kansas Hospital Association $1.5 billion. They have some outside \nexperts who came in. I asked them: What is going to be the effect of \nthe cuts? They already have cuts. They only get reimbursed 70 percent \nnow, and $1.5 billion on top of that. We ought to have a chart--and I \nam sure we will have a chart--that would show Iowa or Nebraska or any \nState here, Texas especially, because of the number of folks there. So \nhospitals, hospices, skilled nursing facilities, and all of the rest.\n  I want every senior to know that while maybe it is technically \naccurate, again, for my friends across the aisle to claim this bill \ndoesn't cut Medicare benefits, there is no way--no way--you can slash \n$\\1/2\\ trillion from payments to providers without affecting their \nability to keep their door open, especially in rural and small town \nAmerica. Seniors should know they will be left with a worthless \nbenefit. To paraphrase my friend Senator Alexander from Tennessee, it \nwould be like having a bus ticket without a bus.\n  Thank you, Senator Johanns. Thank you for the work you are doing. \nThank you for this motion. I hope we are successful. I hope people will \nwake up and understand the severity of what these cuts will do. I urge \nevery Member of this Senate to support Senator Johanns when we come to \na vote on this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have heard a lot here today about how \nthis is going to hurt seniors and so on and so forth, words such as \n``smokescreen.'' The fact is there is no smokescreen here whatsoever. \nThis is a very well thought out, considered policy that I think strikes \na very good balance between getting care to especially seniors at home, \nwhich is so important on the one hand, and making sure there is not \nwaste on the other hand. That is our responsibility here, to make sure \nthe program works and works well.\n  I have sort of a special interest in this. My mother was in the \nhospital. It happened about 2 weeks ago. She fortunately is doing much \nbetter. She is out of the hospital. She has spent some time with a home \nhealth caregiver with whom I was very, very impressed. This home health \nperson is doing a great job with my mother. I have seen other instances \ntoo, but personally I was very happy to see my mother getting very good \ncare from a home health care nurse.\n  I think it is also important to remind my colleagues that this \namendment is generally a retread on the McCain amendment we debated \nover the last few days. That is, once again, the opponents of this bill \nare endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on the brink of going \nbankrupt and seniors facing higher costs.\n  Let me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick with \nthe status quo. The status quo, meaning no bill, which the other side \nis advocating, means Medicare will go broke in 8 years. That is the \nstatus quo. In our legislation, that will be postponed for at least 5 \nmore years. The status quo, as in no bill, which the other side is \nadvocating, means seniors will continue to pay higher and higher \npremiums and cost sharing due to wasteful overpayments to health care \nproviders.\n  There is so much waste in our system. We all know there is a lot of\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\nwaste. I am quite surprised not all of our colleagues want to cut out \nthe waste. In effect, they want to keep the waste that, unfortunately, \nis in our system.\n  The status quo also means each year billions of Medicare dollars will \ncontinue to be wasted on lining the pockets of private insurance \ncompanies. That might be a bit of a strong statement, but the fact is, \nsome chief executives of private insurance companies are paid tens of \nmillions of dollars to manage Medicare Programs, especially Medicare \nAdvantage, and the status quo means that will continue.\n  The status quo also means seniors will continue struggling to pay for \nprescription drugs. The stakes for seniors in the Medicare Program have \nnever been higher.\n  We have a choice. It is a very simple choice: either endorse the \nstatus quo or strengthen Medicare.\n  Let's talk a little bit about home health care. Regarding Medicare \nchanges for home health providers, let me describe what is in the \nSenate bill. I don't think our colleagues know specifically what is in \nthe Senate bill. That may be a strong statement to make. But if they \nknew what was in the bill, I think some of the statements made tonight \nmight be a little bit different.\n  As most of my colleagues would agree, home health care is an \nextremely important benefit in the Medicare Program. We are all very \nstrong advocates of home health care. Across the country, there are \nmore than 9,800 home health agencies providing care to seniors in their \nhomes. This helps seniors get better and helps them to avoid expensive \nrehospitalizations.\n  We are all champions of home health care. We would like people not to \nbe institutionalized. It is much more appropriate to have care in the \nhome, and home health care agencies provide that.\n  In Montana, home health care providers go the extra mile--literally--\nto provide care to patients across vast distances. In some cases, in \nrural areas they have to drive 100 miles just to see one patient. They \nare dedicated people. They go great distances and travel a long way to \nsee very few patients.\n  Home health providers make a real difference in improving seniors' \nhealth, and we should support their efforts. We all very much support \ntheir efforts.\n  While I have great respect for the services of home health providers, \nwe also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare Program. \nUnfortunately, there is almost always waste somewhere. It is a matter \nof judgment as to how much is waste and how much is not.\n  We must make sure Medicare is paying appropriately; that is, that \nMedicare is not overpaying for Medicare services. We must take action \nto root out fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program generally and where \nit may occur in the home health industry as well.\n  I think the policies in the Senate bill achieve both goals. First, \nthe Senate bill would ``rebase'' home health payments to ensure \npayments reflect actual costs of providing care. These changes are \nbased on recommendations by MedPAC, which is the independent advisory \ncommission that advises Congress on Medicare reimbursement. It is a \nnonpartisan group. MedPAC advises that we rebase. What do we mean by \n``rebase''?\n  When the current home health payments were set, seniors received an \naverage of 31 visits per episode. Today, they receive 22 visits; that \nis, they get paid about the same for doing less. We are trying to make \nsure the payment reflects the actual services provided. The Senate bill \ndirects CMS to rebase payments to reflect this change. It is common \nsense. MedPAC recommended it and thinks it has to keep up with the \ntimes. Times have changed over the years, and the payment system should \nreflect that change.\n  There is something else I think is pretty important, and most of my \ncolleagues would agree, the Senate bill roots out fraud that, \nunfortunately, exists in home health care as well as in other areas of \nMedicare spending. It tries to root out the fraud in Medicare payments \nfor outlier cases.\n  Medicare provides an extra payment today for providers--home health \nfolks--who treat sicker people, otherwise known as outlier patients--\nreally sick, outliers. Unfortunately, the GAO found that some providers \nwere gaming the system and getting much more outlier payments than they \ndeserve.\n  For example, the GAO found that in one Florida county alone, home \nhealth providers were receiving 60 percent of all total outlier \npayments. That is nationwide. One county was getting 60 percent, even \nthough they had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population. I \ndon't want to just single out Florida. Other counties in the southern \npart of the country clearly have a grossly disproportionate amount of \nhigh outlier payments.\n  The Senate addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amount any \nindividual provider can receive in outlier payments.\n  Another change is the bill makes ``market basket'' changes in 2011 \nand 2012. That was recommended by MedPAC. Why is that important? MedPAC \nis actually much tougher. They wanted to start in 2010. We said we will \nhold off a bit. We wanted to be fair to the home health providers. In \naddition, the bill establishes a productivity adjustment for home \nhealth providers beginning not right away, not next year or the \nfollowing year but in 2015.\n  These changes ask home health providers--like all other providers--to \noffer more efficient and higher quality care over time. We are being \nfair about it. Very importantly, in making these changes we worked \nclosely with the home health industry to ensure these changes were \nreasonable and fair.\n  What do we do with respect to the agencies to make sure we are fair? \nOn the rebasing policy, MedPAC recommended that we fully implement \nthese changes in 2011. To ensure that providers can adapt to the new \npayment rates, we in the Senate decided we would phase in these changes \nover 4 years. The home health providers support this phase in. They \nthink it is a good idea.\n  On the outlier policy and the fraud changes, these policies were \nactually suggested to us by--guess who--the home health industry. They \ncame to us and suggested we make some changes in outliers because too \nmany agencies are gaming the system. They asked us to make some outlier \nchanges and stop that gaming, to make changes to stop the fraud. They \ncame to us and gave us some ideas. Obviously, the home health industry \nfully supports the changes they recommended to us. They are in this \nbill.\n\n  On the market basket and productivity changes, the Senate bill holds \noff on applying these reductions while the rebasing policy is taking \neffect.\n  This bill gives home health agencies extra time--much more time than \nis recommended by the very aggressive proposed changes by MedPAC, the \nHouse bill, and the administration. We say those are too aggressive. We \nin the Senate decided to give agencies extra time to adapt to the \npayment changes in the bill rather than having all these implemented at \nthe same time as MedPAC and the House and the administration all \nrecommended.\n  Finally, with respect to rural home health providers, we are all very \nsensitive to the special needs of rural America. What did we do about \nthat? From 2010 to 2015, rural providers will receive a 3-percent extra \npayment each year. This payment will ensure that rural providers are \nprotected as we reform the home health system.\n  In total, the home health changes in the Senate bill, I believe, \nstrike a fair balance between ensuring seniors have access to home \ncare, while also rooting out inappropriate payments from the system.\n  I hear some of my good friends say: Gee, these changes are going to \nhurt seniors. They are not going to hurt them. In fact, most of the \nchanges are suggested by the home health care industry. I think all of \nus want to root out fraud and waste. Also, it is claimed that Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be harmed by this bill. This is a scare tactic.\n  Let me say what the American Association of Retired Persons says \nabout these claims that these changes in Medicare reimbursement are \ngoing to harm seniors.\n  AARP says:\n\n       Opponents of the health reform won't rest. [They are] using \n     myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly \n     suggesting that Medicare will be harmed. After a lifetime of \n     hard work, don't seniors deserve better?\n\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\n\n  That is AARP. I don't suggest tonight that any of our colleagues are \nusing myths and misinformation to distort the truth. The point is, AARP \nclaims that is not true. They support the bill strongly.\n  I will remind my colleagues of some of the positive changes in the \nlegislation. This legislation improves the solvency of the Medicare \nProgram by 5 years. It puts $30 billion back into the pockets of \nseniors in the form of lower Medicare premiums. It makes prescription \ndrugs more affordable, which is an added benefit in this bill that \nwould not be available if the legislation is not passed. The bill \nguarantees that seniors can continue to see a doctor of their choosing. \nThe bill provides free wellness and prevention benefits. Those are new \nbenefits. They don't currently exist. It will also include fair and \nappropriate changes for home health that protect access to care.\n  I don't question the motives of my colleagues. They believe they are \nstanding up for seniors in opposing the home health changes. But in \ntruth they will harm them because they are hurting the Medicare \nProgram. I don't think we want to hurt the Medicare Program. We are \ntrying to help the Medicare Program by making these changes.\n  There is one other point I want to make. This is kind of interesting. \nI thought when I saw it--if I still have it--it is kind of interesting. \nThe growth rate in home health care spending will continue to be very \nhigh after this legislation passes. Currently, the growth rate of the \nhome health care industry is almost 11 percent per year. After the \nlegislation, it will be almost an 8-percent annual growth in the home \nhealth care industry. That is much faster than the national health \nexpenditures.\n  I think most things in life are a judgment call. I think one fairly \ndecides that the changes in this bill are good for seniors and home \nhealth care providers because they are sensitive to the needs of the \nindustry, sensitive to patients, frankly, but also responsible to the \nAmerican taxpayers by making sure we are rooting out waste.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think as the American people are \nlistening to the debate we are having on health care reform, they are \nbeing asked to accept some pretty implausible claims. One claim is that \nwe can take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and it would not have any \nimpact on the delivery of services to Medicare beneficiaries--$\\1/2\\ \ntrillion.\n  I think the biggest mistake about the way this bill is paid for, with \nthe huge tax increases and huge cuts in Medicare, is the proposal to \ntake $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare, including $40 billion out of home \nhealth care, in order to pay for a brandnew entitlement program, when \nwe already know Medicare itself is on a fiscally unsustainable path.\n  I want to talk primarily about another aspect of these cuts, and that \nis the 11 million seniors, including 532,000 Texans, who will lose \nbenefits under their Medicare Advantage Program because these are not \ninconsequential cuts in their benefits. They are serious. I want to \ntalk about some real human beings, some real Texans, who are going to \nbe affected in a negative way by these cuts.\n  First of all, I think it is absolutely critical for the American \npeople to understand that Medicare itself does not provide complete \ncoverage to seniors. That is why so many seniors end up buying \nsupplemental insurance coverage--Medigap coverage, as it is sometimes \ncalled--in order to get their bills paid for. Medicare only pays, on \naverage, about 80 percent to providers of what private health insurance \ndoes. That is the reason, without additional compensation, many doctors \nwill not see a new Medicare patient. They simply cannot do it and keep \ntheir doors open to their other patients.\n  The truth is, Medicare Advantage was created to fix some of the flaws \nwith Medicare fee for service to give seniors more affordable and \nbetter coordinated health care. None of us are standing up saying the \nproposed bill is all bad because some of the positive developments in \nthe bill call for greater coordination of health care.\n  On balance, it makes things worse than it does better because of \nthese cuts in things such as Medicare Advantage.\n  The President of the United States has said providing Americans with \na choice of quality, affordable health care was a guiding principle for \nhim. I agree with that statement of principle. Medicare Advantage was \ncreated for that very purpose because, as I said, Medicare itself does \nnot always work well for patients.\n  Where I live in Austin, TX, which is Travis County, the last time I \nsaw a report, only 17 percent of physicians will see a new Medicare \npatient because Medicare reimbursement rates are so low. Those problems \nare avoided in large part by Medicare Advantage because it pays \nphysicians and providers better than Medicare fee for service.\n  According to the American Medical Association's 2008 national health \ninsurance report card, Medicare--not private health insurance--but \nMedicare had the highest percentage and the largest number of denied \nmedical claims. In fact, Medicare denied 10 times more medical claims \nthan private health insurers. That is another reason why seniors \ndeserve a choice between Medicare and private plans that will offer \nthem better benefits.\n  As I mentioned, today, 11 million Americans made that choice of \nbetter benefits and better care coordination through the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. The proposed bill, the Reid bill, will take away \nthose choices and the benefits of those 11 million seniors by cutting \nabout $120 billion from the program.\n  Many of our friends across the aisle will say we can cut $120 billion \nout of Medicare Advantage, and it will have no impact on delivery of \nservices. But the Director of the Congressional Budget Office disagrees \nwith them, who says their additional benefits will be cut roughly in \nhalf.\n  We need to set the record straight on these so-called overpayments \nallegedly going to insurance company profits. It is simply a false \nstatement. It is not true. Our colleagues know the so-called \noverpayments to Medicare Advantage plans do not go into those plans. \nThey go to seniors in the form of additional benefits. That is because, \nunder Federal law, 75 percent of additional payments to Medicare \nAdvantage plans are used to provide seniors with additional benefits--\nbenefits which they would not get under Medicare fee for service, \nbenefits such as chronic care management, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and \nthe like. The other 25 percent of any extra payments is returned to the \nFederal Government.\n  Let's be clear. Cuts to Medicare Advantage would be taking away \nseniors' health care benefits for those 11 million seniors. As I \nmentioned, \\1/2\\ million Texans are on Medicare Advantage, and the Reid \nbill would cut their benefits by well over half. You do not have to \ntake my word for it. Listen to what the CBO Director, Dr. Elmendorf, \nsaid when Senator Crapo asked him during a Finance Committee hearing. \nHe said:\n\n       So approximately half of the additional benefit would be \n     lost to those current Medicare Advantage policy holders?\n\n  Director Elmendorf:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current \n     law, yes.\n\n  Nearly one out of every four seniors in Texas would lose about $122 a \nmonth in health care benefits to create a new $2.5 trillion entitlement \nthat their grandchildren will ultimately have to end up paying for. And \n$122 a month may not sound like a lot for people inside the beltway, \nbut a couple from my hometown of San Antonio recently wrote to me:\n\n       Please vote to leave our Medicare Advantage plans alone. We \n     can't afford anything else as our portfolio was wiped out in \n     the stock market collapse last year. My wife and I have had \n     to go back to work, and we are in our seventies.\n\n  Yet this bill would impose another $122-per-month cut in their \nbenefits.\n  Another constituent of mine from Conroe, TX, wrote:\n\n       Please do what you can to protect the Medicare Advantage \n     plans. I'm on one and it has been beneficial to me. It has \n     saved me an enormous amount of money and given me the \n     benefits I've needed.\n\n  Some groups that support these cuts to Medicare Advantage have a \nconflict of interest, to say the least, because the benefits under \ntraditional fee for service, as I mentioned, for Medicare is about 80 \npercent of what private insurance will pay. In order to get coverage, \nin order to pay the bills, many seniors have had to buy additional \ninsurance\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\ncoverage. For 11 million seniors, Medicare Advantage provides those \nbenefits.\n  For many seniors, former employers sometimes provide wraparound \nplans. For retired military, TRICARE provides a wraparound plan. For \nmany low-income seniors, Medicaid helps with cost sharing and premiums. \nFor many other seniors, they purchase a standalone Medigap policy.\n  We heard from our friends across the aisle about AARP's endorsement \nof the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill. If it sounds odd that a seniors' \nadvocacy group would support taking nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion from an \nalready near bankrupt program, it should.\n  The fact is, as the Washington Post noted on October 27:\n\n     . . . But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have been \n     [AARP's] substantial earnings from insurance royalty and the \n     potential benefits that could come its way from many of the \n     reform proposals . . . Democratic proposals to slash \n     reimbursements for another program, called Medicare \n     Advantage, are widely expected to drive up demand for private \n     Medigap policies, like the ones offered by AARP, according to \n     health care experts, legislative aides, and documents.\n\n  So AARP, the so-called seniors' advocacy group, is advocating for a \ncut in benefits to 11 million beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage. The \nsuggestion is one reason they would do so is because they will profit \nfrom this bill because these seniors will, if they can afford it, have \nto go out and buy Medigap coverage from, lo and behold, entities such \nas AARP.\n  The fact is, Medicare Advantage allows private plans to innovate \nbetter and provides better coordinated care for seniors. Groups such as \nthe Kelsey-Seybold Clinic in Houston, TX, which is basically not seeing \nMedicare fee-for-service patients but is seeing Medicare Advantage \npatients because they can afford to coordinate care, the kinds of \nthings we know they ought to be doing to provide better care, but they \ncannot afford to do it on the fee-for-service Medicare.\n  We have had the Medicare Program around for more than 40 years. The \nfact is, government bureaucrats are still trying to get the complex \nreimbursement formulas right. We know, as the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee has said, that under the fee-for-service program, \nwhich is part of what needs to be reformed in this health care bill, \nMedicare pays for volume and not value.\n\n  Some of the positive things which I have complimented the bill on is, \nit includes some small steps to change our current pay-for-volume \nprogram to a pay-for-value approach through various delivery system \nreform demonstration programs.\n  The irony is, Medicare did not think of these delivery system \nreforms; rather, Washington is finally catching up on what private \nsector innovators have been doing for years. We heard the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota talk about the Mayo Clinic. The Mayo Clinic has \nbeen doing that. I mentioned Kelsey-Seybold in Texas. But private \nsector innovators have been doing this through the Medicare Advantage \nProgram already.\n  The delivery system reforms in the Reid bill would allow Medicare to \nexperiment with different approaches to changing physician incentives, \nsuch as accountable care organizations or physician quality reporting \ninitiatives.\n  Will they work? I happen to think they will. We do know private \nsector innovators have already figured out how to change physician \nincentives in the sorts of ways we ought to be doing more of and not \npunishing by cutting Medicare Advantage.\n  One Medicare Advantage plan, HealthSpring, serves 20,000 seniors in \nmy State. They have been a leader for changing incentives for \nphysicians to focus on quality rather than quantity. I met with their \nleadership and heard how they have done it. What they told me is they \nhave a collaborative partnership with their physicians. They call it \nPartnership for Quality. Physicians are accountable for both cost and \nquality based on an evidence-based set of quality measures.\n  The results are a win-win: better quality care leading to healthier \nseniors and physicians who succeed in meeting evidence-based quality \nstandards and ultimately lower health care costs, which I thought was \nsupposed to be one of the goals of health care reform.\n  Participating physicians were paid financial incentives for meeting \ntheir goal, but as a result of coordination of care and evidence-based \nquality standards, they actually ended up charging less and patients \nexperienced better results too. Members needed fewer hospitalizations \nand emergency room visits. Preventive measures increased mammograms by \n80 percent, diabetic foot exams by 360 percent, and flu vaccinations by \n246 percent.\n  I have heard about HealthSpring's success from a couple in Farmers \nBranch, TX, who recently wrote to me. They said:\n\n       We had a Medicare supplemental policy for several years \n     until they priced themselves out of the market. We are now \n     with a Medicare Advantage plan called HealthSpring. We have \n     been very happy with this plan and the way they are saving us \n     money. Please do not change or eliminate this program.\n\n  Let me tell you about one other Texas company called WellMed. While \nthe Reid bill would finally give Medicare the ability to experiment \nwith medical homes and care coordination, a San Antonio-based company, \na Medicare Advantage company called WellMed, has been using a medical \nhome model to coordinate patient care and emphasize prevention for \nnearly 20 years.\n  To quote from an article last month in ``Inside San Antonio:''\n\n       The health care delivery model at WellMed puts the patient \n     at the center of a team directed by a primary care physician. \n     The team may include a nurse, health coach, hospitalist, \n     social service worker and physician assistant.\n       According to WellMed CEO Dr. George Rapier, ``We really do \n     have to bring back the old-time primary care doctor who cared \n     for you, who was concerned about you, who was part of your \n     family, and you were part of their family. It's a primary \n     care physician who knows all about you. So if you need a \n     specialist, they know the best specialist to send you to. If \n     you need to go in the hospital, they make sure you get the \n     appropriate care in the hospital. They are your coordinator \n     of care. And that's really the concept of a medical home.''\n\n  There is no question in my mind that the model has been saving lives \nin my State. Here is a story about one Texan whose life was saved by \nphysicians caring for him at WellMed:\n\n       For years, Crohn's disease weakened--\n\n  We will call him Ed--\n\n       Ed's immune system and left him susceptible to infections. \n     One morning in 2001, he lacked energy to even get out of bed. \n     His breathing became labored. He developed a cough that \n     sounded ``wet.''\n       His worried wife called his primary care physician at \n     WellMed, Dr. Marlene Sanchez, who wanted Ed hospitalized \n     immediately so she could order a nuclear scan of his lungs. \n     He protested.\n       ``She told me that if he refused to go, I should call 911 \n     and have the paramedics come get him,'' [his wife] Annette \n     recalled. ``He heard Dr. Sanchez talking to me, the urgency \n     in her voice, and that convinced him to go.''\n       The scan confirmed Dr. Sanchez's suspicions: A potentially \n     fatal blood clot had traveled from Ed's leg to his lungs. He \n     was successfully treated and recovered. [Ed and his wife] \n     recently celebrated Ed's 74th birthday.\n       Annette credits Dr. Sanchez for saving Ed's life and for \n     acting as a catalyst that keeps him thriving in their golden \n     years.\n       ``We have seen an abundance of doctors, from the cancer \n     doctors to the dermatologist, gastroenterologist, the blood \n     doctor, the heart specialist--Ed has gone through it all . . \n     . and they've all been coordinated by his primary care \n     doctor. I've been to other doctors outside WellMed and you \n     don't get the feeling that they are communicating like \n     this.''\n\n  Well, many Texas seniors currently enjoy these extra benefits under \nMedicare Advantage, such as--another benefit--the Silver Sneakers \nprogram, the Nation's leading exercise program for older Americans. \nThis past year, one of the Silver Sneakers members personally visited \nmy office to deliver testimonials from other Silver Sneakers members. \nOne Texan said:\n\n       At my age I need a program to strengthen me all over but \n     primarily to help me with my balance and coordination. I need \n     these skills to keep me from falling and breaking my bones.\n\n  Another participant in the Silver Sneakers program said:\n\n       I am 66, have been in the Silver Sneakers program a year. \n     Prior to that I led a sedentary life, which included many \n     health problems. I had hypertension, high cholesterol, \n     chronic bladder condition, and mild depression. Since coming \n     to classes and utilizing the weights and cardio machines, my \n     life has improved immensely. My blood pressure has dropped, \n     my cholesterol has been\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\n     lowered, my chronic bladder condition has improved and I just \n     feel better all around. I am no longer depressed because I \n     look better and look forward to going to class and visiting \n     with my friends.\n\n  These cuts in Medicare Advantage are going to have a direct impact on \nthe benefits my constituents in Texas are benefiting from--the 532,000 \nTexans who are currently on Medicare Advantage--and what they are \nasking me--which I can't answer--is why in the world would we want to \ncut Medicare Advantage, which actually works, as opposed to Medicare \nfee for service, which does not work well? Why would we take a fiscally \nunsustainable program, such as Medicare, which is going insolvent in \n2017, and use that to create a $2.5 trillion new entitlement program?\n  My constituents, the seniors who have paid into Medicare all these \nyears, are saying: It is not fair to take the money we have paid into \nMedicare and use it to create yet another entitlement program and not \nto fix Medicare itself. So I believe we need to fix Medicare's nearly \n$38 trillion in unfunded liabilities. We need to fix the improper \npayment rate of roughly 1 out of every 10 Medicare dollars which \nresults in somewhere on the order of a minimum of $60 billion of \nfraudulent payments each year. We need to put it on a fiscally \nsustainable path, rather than taking $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare for \nanother ill-conceived Washington health care takeover.\n  I don't believe my constituents believe you can take $\\1/2\\ trillion \nout of these programs, just as they do not believe you can take more \nthan $100 billion out of Medicare Advantage, and it will have no impact \non their benefits. They don't buy it. They don't believe it, and I \ndon't either.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is late in the evening. I was going \nto address three different issues tonight, but out of respect for \nSenator Baucus, the chairman of my committee, I am going to address \njust one of these issues and I will come back tomorrow morning, on \nSaturday, and speak on the rest of the issues.\n  The one issue I am going to address this evening is my support of the \nSenator from Nebraska and his motion to commit with instructions on the \nhome health care aspect of this 2,074-page bill. That is Senator \nJohanns' motion. We are now considering a bill that cuts $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from a Medicare Program to fund yet another unsustainable \nhealth care entitlement program. Around $42 billion comes from cuts to \nhome health care providers--hence the purpose of Senator Johanns' \namendment that that not happen.\n  You have heard from Members on this side of the grave consequences of \nthese cuts. Several Senators have already addressed these. These severe \ncuts pose a legitimate threat to beneficiaries' access to home health \nservices. In my State of Iowa alone, there are around 160 home health \nagencies that provide valuable services to Medicare beneficiaries \nacross the State. Thanks to these home health care providers, seniors \nin Iowa are able to live at home instead of institutional settings, \nsuch as nursing homes. These seniors place great value on being able to \nstay in their homes. I would have to say that in all the years I have \nbeen involved in senior issues, whether it has been chairman of the \nAging Committee, or chairman and now ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, I haven't run into one single senior citizen in my State who \nsaid to me: I am just dying to get into a nursing home. They do not \nwant to go there.\n  So that is the purpose of home health agencies, to save money, but it \nis to retain the quality of life, and maintain the quality of life for \nthese citizens. I rarely hear Iowans say anything about living in a \nnursing home, except not to go there.\n  Since living at home has been found to be a more cost-effective \nalternative than institutional care, this results in Medicare spending \nless. These cuts that are in this 2,074-page Reid bill will make it \neven harder for Iowa home health care providers to care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. A good part of the Medicare home health cuts come from \npermanent productivity adjustments.\n  Let's look at the possibility--or I would say I have concluded the \nimpossibility--of bringing greater productivity to nursing home care. \nYou have heard this week about how Medicare's chief actuary found \nsavings from these productivity adjustments to be very unrealistic. And \njust so you know that the letter I refer to from the chief actuary is \nreal, observe this chart. You also heard this week how these permanent \ncuts would make it harder for providers to remain in the black. You \nalso heard these providers might end their participation in Medicare \nand possibly then jeopardize access to care for beneficiaries, and \nprobably then more people ending up in the more expensive environment \nof a nursing home.\n  The threat to access to home health care from these permanent \nproductivity cuts isn't theoretical. It is real. Like many other \nMedicare providers, home health agencies provide labor-intensive \nservices. It is because of these labor-intensive services that I raise \nthe question and the possibility--and I say it ends up being an \nimpossibility--for them to be more productive. There are few gadgets in \nhome health that will increase productivity. And whatever available \ngadgets there are, they are unaffordable for many Iowa home health \nagencies because they are small operations with limited financial \nresources.\n  Home health care is about doctors, it is about nurses, and home \nhealth aides, and it is about all of these providing care to the most \nneedy. So it is incorrect, in my judgment, to assume these providers \nwill achieve the levels of productivity like the rest of the economy.\n  The HHS chief actuary's findings clearly apply to home health in my \nState of Iowa, as they do nationally. Just to remind you: ``The \nestimated savings may be unrealistic;'' and ``possibly jeopardizing \naccess to care for beneficiaries for our seniors.'' More people in \nnursing homes.\n  Because of these cuts, the percent of Iowa home health agencies that \nhave negative Medicare margins will increase to 75 percent. So over 120 \nof the 160 home health providers will have negative Medicare margins \nbecause of this 2,074-page Reid bill. Iowa providers are not alone. \nFrom \\1/2\\ to 90 percent of home health agencies in States across the \ncountry would have negative Medicare margins.\n  I ask a unanimous consent to have printed in the Record three \nletters, which I wish to put in at various places in my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1, 2, and 3.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have here a letter dated September 23 \nof this year from Val Halamadaris, the president of the National \nAssociation for Home Health and Hospice. This organization represents \nhome health agencies across the country.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Halamadaris wrote this letter in response to the \n$43 billion in home health cuts in the Finance Committee package, which \npresumes to be the same number that is used in the Reid bill. In this \nletter, he stated:\n\n       It is crucial to the survival of the home health services \n     delivery system that you work to reduce the $43 billion in \n     cuts currently contained in the Senate Finance Committee's \n     health reform package. Our analysis indicates that by 2016, \n     the proposed cuts in home health care services payment rates \n     will lead to nearly 70 percent of providers nationwide at \n     risk of closing because their costs will exceed Medicare \n     payments. If that occurs, President Obama's promise that \n     Medicare beneficiaries will not be adversely affected by \n     health care reform will be broken.\n\n  I have yet to hear from a home health care provider in Iowa that \nthese permanent cuts will make it easier for them to care for their \nMedicare beneficiaries. Instead, I hear these cuts would reduce access \nto home health services.\n  The second letter I asked to have inserted in the Record is from the \nIowa Alliance in Home Care, and they wrote:\n\n       Ensuring that Medicare home health payments are not reduced \n     further is essential to avoid the resulting limited or no \n     access to home health services for many Iowans who prefer to \n     receive services in their home.\n\n  Not only is the chief actuary saying it, as the chart reflects, but \npeople who are connected with the business of home health care are \nsaying it: These permanent cuts will in fact jeopardize access to home \nhealth services in Iowa. So if the home health cuts in the Reid bill \nare allowed to go into effect, then\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\nIowa's seniors, who prefer to live full lives from their homes, will be \nforced to live in the more expensive settings of facilities such as \nnursing homes.\n  I believe many Members on both sides of the aisle share my concern \nabout home health care cuts.\n  I have here a third letter, this one dated from July 27, 2007, and it \nis written to Senator Baucus and me.\n  Mr. President, I use this letter, even though it is 2 years old, \nbecause we were getting entreaties from 61 of our colleagues--of which \n52 now still serve in the Senate--about a legislative proposal to cut \nMedicare home health payments in that year--2007--by $9.7 billion and \nhospice payments by more than $1.1 billion. They urged me and Senator \nBaucus, at that time, to ensure that home health and hospice providers \nreceive full market basket inflation adjustments. They also urged us to \noppose any cuts in payment rates through administrative actions.\n\n  In the letter, these Members stated that home health and hospice care \n``have been demonstrated to be cost-effective alternatives to \ninstitutional care in both Medicare and Medicaid programs.'' They \nstated that ``reducing Medicare home health and hospice payments would \nplace the quality of home health care and hospice and the home care \ndelivery system at significant risk.''\n  Of these 61 Senators who signed this letter 2 years ago, 52 are \ncurrently here debating this bill in the Senate. Of those 52 Senators, \n37 are from his side of the aisle who are now proposing $43 billion in \ncuts instead of $9.7 billion in home payment cuts and $1.1 billion in \nhospice payments cuts. I would think they would find these kinds of \ncuts three or four times--four times what we were talking about 2 years \nago to be very unrealistic, and to keep home health as a viable \norganization going.\n  We also must look beyond health care when we look at the impact of \nthese permanent cuts. I have also heard from providers in Iowa that \npermanent cuts such as these will make it even harder for them to keep \ntheir doors open. So around 3,500 Iowans who work at home health \nagencies are at risk of losing their jobs at a time when we have 10 \npercent unemployment, at a time when more of this country is concerned \nthat Congress ought to be working on creating jobs, jobs, jobs as \nopposed to the health care issue and in some cases cutting jobs out. \nThe Labor Department reported today that unemployment is 10 percent. \nNow is not the time to consider bills that increase unemployment rates.\n  About an hour ago, the Senator from Nebraska offered this motion I am \nspeaking in favor of now, to send this bill to the Finance Committee \nwith instructions to report a bill without these very enormous home \nhealth cuts that are in it. We should take this opportunity to fix the \nbill and then come back to the full Senate with a better bill. That is \nwhy I support the motion of the Senator from Nebraska to commit, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                      for Home Care & Hospice,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2009.\n     Re Medicare Home Health Services.\n\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to thank you for your \n     continued support of home care patients nationwide and to \n     enlist your help to ensure that access to home health \n     services remains a reality for more than 3 million senior and \n     disabled individuals that benefit from these important \n     services.\n       It is crucial to the survival of the home health services \n     delivery system that you work to reduce the $43 billion in \n     cuts currently contained in the Senate Finance Committee's \n     health reform package. Our analysis indicates that by 2016, \n     the proposed cuts in home health services payment rates will \n     lead to nearly 70% of providers nationwide at risk of closing \n     because their costs will exceed Medicare payments. If that \n     occurs, President Obama's promise that Medicare beneficiaries \n     will not be adversely affected by health care reform efforts \n     will be broken.\n       Invariably, providers of services facing rate cuts always \n     cry out that care will be lost. However, history tells us \n     that our warning should be heeded. The Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 was expected to cut home health services spending by \n     $16.1 billion in five years. Instead, the rate changes cut \n     over $70 billion, leading to the loss of care to nearly 1.5 \n     million Medicare beneficiaries. That change also led to \n     higher outlays under state Medicaid programs, as well as \n     greater use of nursing homes, hospitals, and other \n     institutional settings. Still today, about $17 billion is \n     spent on home health services, as compared with about $19 \n     billion in home health outlays in 1997.\n       Several factors need to be understood about the current \n     Finance Committee proposal. First, the proposal is not \n     consistent with MedPAC advice. The proposal reduces rates to \n     a point where Medicare margins will average zero. MedPAC, in \n     its deliberations, clearly recognized the need for some level \n     of margin in order to stay in business. In fact, we \n     understand that MedPAC's executive director, Mark Miller, \n     informed House Ways and Means members that MedPAC did not \n     recommend a zero margin.\n       Second, there is a serious misunderstanding of Medicare \n     margins. MedPAC estimates margins for 2009 will be 12.2%. \n     However, this estimation does not include the impact of \n     nearly 7% in rate reductions planned by way of regulation by \n     2011. Further, it does not include nearly 1,700 important \n     providers of home health services, hospital-based agencies. \n     Also, it does not reveal that the ``average'' is made up of a \n     very wide range of individual agency margins with over 30% \n     below zero already. Finally, reliance on Medicare margins \n     does not convey that the total margin of agencies is \n     estimated at 2% with Medicaid and Medicare Advantage losses \n     driving the overall margin down.\n       Third, unlike other health care providers such as \n     hospitals, the expansion of health insurance will not bring \n     additional business of any material level. Home health \n     patients average nearly 80 years of age and are already \n     insured by Medicare or Medicaid. This means that the Medicare \n     cuts to home health agencies are not offset by new revenues \n     from newly insured patients. Instead, the proposed cuts of \n     over 13.5% of spending on home health services will be as \n     real as can be.\n       Fourth, the home health services community has put forward \n     a credible and substantive alternative set of proposals for \n     reforming the Medicare payment system. While the Chairman's \n     Mark incorporates many of these proposals, the level of cuts \n     is unsustainable. In fact, the level of cuts exceeds the $34 \n     billion President Obama's budget recommended by nearly $10 \n     billion. Still, the industry's proposal itself meets or \n     exceeds the Obama budget target.\n       Fifth, the home health services cuts are far \n     disproportionate to other provider sectors. The Chairman's \n     Mark seeks 9.4% of all the Medicare cuts from home health \n     care while home health makes up only 3% of the Medicare \n     program currently. That disproportionate impact is further \n     magnified by the fact that, unlike most other health care \n     providers and insurers, expanding health insurance will have \n     no meaningful increase in home health care business.\n       This is a historic time in this country, an opportunity to \n     secure health care for all as a fundamental right. However, \n     these reforms should not be done at the expense of our most \n     vulnerable senior citizens, the homebound and infirm. Your \n     leadership on this matter is greatly appreciated. Please let \n     us know what we can do to help you succeed.\n       You have my great respect and admiration, now and always.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Val J. Halamandaris,\n                                                        President.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                   Iowa Alliance in Home Care,\n\n                                 Des Moines, IA, December 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee On Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Grassley: I'm contacting you today to urge your \n     assistance concerning an issue of great significance to \n     Iowa's dedicated home care nurses and other providers of \n     valuable and needed in-home health care services to Iowans. \n     The Iowa Alliance in Home Care respectfully requests your \n     support to have the Senate Finance committee report back to \n     the Senate, in response to a motion with instructions, a \n     modified H.R. 3590 bill that does not include cuts in \n     Medicare payments to home health agencies totaling $42.1 \n     billion.\n       Your urgent action is critically important to ensure that \n     access to quality health care services delivered in the home \n     setting is not compromised. Proposed cuts in Medicare home \n     health reimbursement would be devastating as most of Iowa's \n     home care providers (i.e. public health departments, small \n     businesses) rely largely or exclusively on Medicare and \n     Medicaid payment to justify their operations which includes \n     employment for thousands of Iowans. Insufficient Medicaid \n     home health reimbursement, recently worsened by Governor \n     Culver's ATB state budget cuts, has been reduced by an \n     additional 5% effective 12/1/2009. In short, ensuring that \n     Medicare home health payments are not reduced further is \n     essential to avoid the resulting limited or no access to home \n     health services access for many Iowans who prefer to receive \n     services in their own home.\n       Senator, thank you for your past home health care support. \n     We would greatly appreciate your immediate attention to this \n     most critical of needs for our Iowa home health care \n     community.\n           Regards,\n                                                     Mark Wheeler,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Max Baucus, Chairman,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: Home \n     health and hospice have become increasingly important parts \n     of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled and \n     often technically complex services that our nation's home \n     health and hospice agencies provide have enabled millions of \n     our most frail and vulnerable seniors and disabled citizens \n     avoid hospitals and nursing homes. By preventing such \n     institutional care, home health and hospice services save \n     Medicare millions of dollars each year. Most importantly, \n     they enable individuals to stay just where they want to be--\n     in the comfort and security of their own homes. We therefore \n     urge you to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to \n     have access to important home health and hospice services by \n     supporting full market basket inflation adjustments, as \n     provided under current law, and opposing any cuts in payment \n     rates through administrative actions.\n       The Administration's FY 2008 budget includes a legislative \n     proposal to cut Medicare home health payments by $9.7 billion \n     and hospice payments by more than $1.1 billion over five \n     years. It also includes additional administrative cuts in \n     payment rates. The Medicare home health benefit has already \n     taken a larger hit in spending reductions over the past ten \n     years than any other Medicare benefit. In fact, home health \n     as a share of Medicare spending has dropped from 8.7 percent \n     in 1997 to 3.2 percent today, and is projected to decline to \n     2.6 percent of Medicare spending by 2015. This downward \n     spiral in home health spending began with provisions in the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which resulted in a 50 \n     percent cut in Medicare home health spending by 2001--far \n     more than the Congress intended or the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) projected.\n       We believe that further reductions in home health and \n     hospice payments would be counterproductive to controlling \n     overall health care costs. Home health and hospice care have \n     been demonstrated to be a cost-effective alternative to \n     institutional care in both the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs. In fact, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n     (MedPAC) has noted the results of a 2002 RAND study which \n     showed ``in terms of Part A costs, episodes in an inpatient \n     rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility are much \n     more costly for Medicare than episodes of care among patients \n     going home.'' (MedPAC's June 2005 Report to Congress).\n       Further reducing Medicare home health expenditures would \n     also be in direct conflict with the Administration's desire \n     to prioritize health care in the home as a cost-effective \n     alternative to institutional care. During the World Health \n     Congress in February of 2005, Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services Michael Leavitt said: ``Providing the care that lets \n     people live at home if they want is less expensive than \n     providing nursing home care. It frees up resources that can \n     help other people. And obviously, many people are happier \n     living at home.''\n       Reducing Medicare home health and hospice payments would \n     place the quality of home health care and hospice and the \n     home care delivery system at significant risk. Several \n     factors have contributed to the increased cost of providing \n     care in the home over the past few years, including:\n       The cost of travel by clinicians to patients' homes;\n       The use of technology, like telehealth monitors, which is \n     not covered by Medicare;\n       The need to pay significantly higher salaries for nurses, \n     therapists, and home health aides to attract these \n     individuals from the scarce supply of clinicians nationwide.\n       Many home health providers currently do not have a \n     sufficient number of clinical staff to accept patient \n     referrals from physicians and hospitals. As a consequence, \n     hospital discharge planners have reported that they are \n     finding it more difficult to refer patients for home health \n     care. Additional cuts to the home health benefit could leave \n     home health providers no alternative but to reduce the number \n     of visits and/or patient admissions, which would ultimately \n     affect access to care and clinical outcomes. In addition to \n     these costs, hospices are also experiencing rising costs for \n     pain management pharmaceuticals, and they are also finding \n     that patients with shorter lengths of stay are requiring more \n     intensive services.\n       In order to ensure that home health care and hospice remain \n     a viable option for Medicare patients, we urge you to support \n     full market basket updates for home health and hospice, as \n     provided under current law, and to oppose any cuts in payment \n     rates through administrative action. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Susan M. Collins; Russ Feingold; Christopher S. Bond; \n           Jack Reed; Patrick J.

The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, he is a man \nof great character and experience in these matters.\n  I have a letter from a constituent who writes to urge a vote against \nthis health care bill. This is from Mr. Bill Eberle in Huntsville, AL. \nHe says:\n\n       The worst part of this bill is that much of the cost will \n     be paid for by cuts to Medicare.\n\n  I think the Senator has indicated he believes that is accurate.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I am 68 years old and I have paid into Medicare for 40 \n     years, believing it would cover much of my health care costs \n     when I became 65. Now I am being told that the Government has \n     found people who need the coverage more than I do and they \n     will cut the care for which I have paid for 40 years in order \n     to cover people who have paid nothing into the program. It is \n     not the Government's money. The money belongs to those of us \n     who paid into it for so many years and are watching as it is \n     being taken away from us.\n\n  My question to my colleague is, since the Senator has been so \nintimately involved with Medicare over the years, is it not true that \nevery working American has money taken out of their paycheck to fund \ntheir Medicare and that they believe and we have a compact with them \nthat when they reach 65, they will have the benefit of that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. When they reach age 65, they will have that benefit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, 65. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. To the tune of 2.9 percent of payroll. That is how much \na self-employed person would pay. And an employee would pay 1.45 \npercent and the employer would pay 1.45 percent. Then, you know this \n2074-page bill adds half a percentage point to those, so you are going \nto get it to a point where it is almost 2 percent for the employer, 2 \npercent for the employee, and it would be almost 4 percent for a self-\nemployed person paying into this that is now going to be raided to \nfinance a brandnew entitlement program.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My constituent, then, is fundamentally correct in his \nconcern?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I sense a great deal of resentment coming through in \nthat letter, from the words of that letter from that person, that what \nhe has paid into, for the probably 45 years of working before he \nretired--that now, with Medicare already being in jeopardy, based on \nthe trustees' report which says that by 2017 there is not going to be \nany money in the trust fund, and then having $464 billion taken out of \nthat trust fund to help finance a new entitlement program at a time \nwhen the present entitlement programs are in a great deal of financial \njeopardy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think you stated that so well. Just to reemphasize, \nthis gentleman, Mr. Eberle, who paid into Medicare for 40 years, until \nhe got to be 65, he got not a dime of Medicare benefit, did he?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No. The only way he would have gotten benefits is if he \nhad become disabled before age 65.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He pays into it all these years and just now gets to \ndraw it, and people start taking it out.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership on this issue. I think he \nand I come out of the soil of our States, out of the real world. My \nimpression is that nothing comes from nothing. Would you agree? \nSomebody has to pay?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say it this way. We are in a town where we are \ndealing with a lot of Washington nonsense, and I hope, from the rural \nareas of Alabama, like the State of Iowa, you bring a lot of common \nsense to this town where there is not a lot of it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I would say the matter is a very \nserious one we are dealing with. Today, I had the opportunity to talk \nto a very experienced person involved in health care issues for many \nyears. I expressed my bafflement about some of the disagreements we \nhave, about huge issues.\n\n[[Page S12408]]\n\nOne of my staffers wrote down what he said. He said: ``In all my years \nI have never seen such transparent dishonesty in the Congress.''\n  He said ``it is the biggest fraud that has been perpetrated in the \nhistory of our country,'' in his opinion.\n  Here we have a situation. I want to say I am going to pursue this in \na little more detail. I am not going to go into great length tonight. \nBut we have an amendment--Senator Bennet offered an amendment yesterday \nthat said we wouldn't cut guaranteed benefits for Medicare. But the way \nthis deal is being done is they are cutting payments to providers of \nMedicare.\n  We are already reaching, as Senator Grassley said, a national crisis \nbecause by 2017 we will not be able to have a surplus in Medicare, we \nare going into default in Medicare. Where are we going to get the \nmoney?\n  Could we have efficiencies? Could we save some money in Medicare? \nCould we do some things to keep the program afloat? Perhaps. But if we \ndo so, should not we use it, should not we use any efficiencies in \nsavings that we could scrape together without damaging the commitment \nwe have to our seniors--should not we use those savings to save \nMedicare that is going into default? I suggest that is a moral and \nlegal commitment.\n  Mr. Eberle has written to me. He has paid for 40 years. He has not \nbeen able to draw anything out of it for the 40 years he has paid into \nit. Now he gets ready to draw, and we are telling him we are going to \ncut $465 billion out of the Medicare payment. This is not a little \nbitty matter.\n  We seem to have amazing--we seem to have this dispute. One group, \nfrom the other side, says: Don't worry, we are not taking $465 billion \nfrom Medicare, and we wouldn't cut Medicare, and we don't believe in \ncutting Medicare, and we don't want to hurt Medicare in any way. Our \nside over here is saying: But you are. According to the numbers that \nare pretty plain in this legislation, hospitals will have a $135 \nbillion reduction; hospices, you have $8 billion for life-ending care \nthat has been so helpful to so many families; nursing homes have a $15 \nbillion reduction; Medicare Advantage, $120 billion; home health \nagencies that Senator Grassley talked about, a $42 billion reduction. \nAre we imagining this? Have we somehow formulated this? It all totals \nup to about $465 billion.\n  This matter, I suggest, is not going away. Either we have reality \nhere or not. I believe the facts will show that we are raiding \nMedicare, we are weakening that program when it is already known to all \nof us in this body that Medicare is not actuarially sound.\n  I remember when President Bush determined, in a failed effort, to try \nto alter Social Security in a way that he believed would put it on a \nmore sound footing. He got no help at all. We had many of our Senators \non both sides of the aisle saying: If you really want to do something, \nas bad as Social Security is, Medicare is in a much worse financial \nfix. Why aren't you fixing it?\n  I remember a number of years ago, 10 or more, when Senator Judd \nGregg, then chairman of the Budget Committee, tried to come up with \nsome legislation to contain a little of the growth in Medicare. Over 5 \nyears, he had a plan that would contain the growth by $10 billion. Not \na single Democrat voted for the Gregg proposal. Now they accuse the \nRepublicans of trying to damage Medicare when, in fact, every penny of \nthe $10 billion to be saved was going to be utilized to strengthen \nMedicare and try to keep it from going into default.\n  Now we are talking about taking $465 billion out of Medicare and \nstarting a new entitlement program, a new entitlement program at the \ntime that this Nation has just passed or just incurred the largest \nsingle deficit in the history of the American Republic, $1.4 trillion. \nNext year, we will be over $1 trillion, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office--not me.\n  Is this smart? To have a program that people have depended on, that \nwe have a moral compact to support--to support our seniors who paid \ninto this plan for 40 years, now taking money out of that to create a \nnew program? It is, in fact, in quite a number of areas, going to cost \nfar more than is being suggested by the people who are promoting the \nlegislation. We are going to dig into this and try to analyze it with \nmore clarity, but the truth is, the numbers just do not add up. They \nwill not work. We just ought not to be establishing a new entitlement \nprogram of massive proportions in a way where we really have little \nconcept of how it is going to play out at a time of the largest \ndeficits this Nation has ever had, deficits that, according to our own \nCongressional Budget Office, will double the national debt in 5 years \nand triple it to $17 trillion in 10 years.\n  It is an unsustainable course, and one of the first things we have to \ndo is watch how we spend our money. I talked to an individual today. He \nsaid: It is like your house is in serious need of repair. You really \ndon't have the money to fix it. You finally decide you have to borrow \nmoney to fix the house, and instead you borrow money and add a wing \nonto the house.\n  We need to fix the house we have. We need to make sure we honor our \ncommitment to Medicare recipients. They have already paid. That is the \nimportant point to remember. They have already paid their working life \nunder a compact and a commitment that money would be in a fund that \nwould be available. We ought not to be taking it away.\n  I urge colleagues to think about this. This is perhaps the most \nsignificant fatal flaw in the legislation. It just doesn't add up. \nThere are others, but this one, to me, is the most dramatic, the most \npernicious, the one that is most unwise. We simply need to slow down, \nask ourselves how we can make our health care system better, how we can \ndo it without breaking the bank. Aren't there some things we can do to \nimprove health care without a huge cost? Yes, there are. Let's start \nwith every single one of those we can agree on. If we do that, I think \nwe could make a lot of progress.\n  Who knows, if this economy turns around--and we all hope it will--we \nwould be in a better footing to consider a new benefit in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to remember the life of \na dear friend, MG Charles Beach Jr., of Beattyville, KY. General Beach \npassed away this past Veterans Day, at the age of 90. He was a genuine \nservant to his country, his hometown, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nWhile General Beach will be greatly missed, the contributions that he \nhas made to Kentucky, and the sacrifices that he has made for this \nNation, will surely live on as his legacy.\n  Charles Beach knew from a young age that he wanted to serve his \ncountry, and in 1940, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute \nin Lexington, VA. Shortly after graduation, he completed his special \ntraining and began his active service. While in Italy in 1944, Charles \nbecame severely wounded during battle. He spent the next 8 months \nrecovering in a military hospital and was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Charles Beach joined the Army Reserves after he was released from \nactive duty. After a short time in the Reserves, Beach was \nrecommissioned into the U.S. Army, this time with the rank of major. In \n1976, he was promoted to major general after becoming the 18th \nCommander of the 100th Division, where he commanded the Kentucky Army \nReserve Training Division.\n  General Beach's contributions extended beyond his military service; \nhe was an active member of his beloved hometown of Beattyville. The \ngeneral served his community through many organizations including, as \nchairman of People Exchange Bank and Insurance, president of the \nBeattyville/Lee County Chamber of Commerce, president of September \nPlace Retirement Village, and cofounder of a scholarship program to aid \neastern Kentucky students wanting to pursue careers in medicine.\n\n[[Page S12409]]\n\nThis scholarship has increased the number of doctors in eastern \nKentucky.\n  For his service to the community, General Beach received several \nawards, including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Volunteer of the \nYear and the Community Bankers of Kentucky Outstanding Community Banker \nof the Year awards. The Beattyville/Lee County Chamber of Commerce \nrecognized General Beach for his 58 consecutive years as president. \nAnd, Beattyville Mayor Joseph Kash described Beach as ``a true \ngentleman and a hero of this community. It is appropriate that his \npassing was on Veterans Day. He was a true patriot.''\n  The positive impact that General Beach has made on Kentucky and this \nNation has certainly not ended with his passing. His legacy will \ncontinue to live on through the individuals and the communities he so \nlovingly helped lead. Known nationally for his leadership and service \nto our country, I know all Kentuckians join me in grieving the loss of \nCharles Beach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12409-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     corporal anthony carrasco, jr.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

When not serving his country, he worked \nfor the Forest Service on the Carson back home in Questa, NM. \nThroughout his life, he also worked as a firefighter, an ambulance \ndriver and a policeman.\n  Specialist Gallegos gravitated toward work that allowed him to help \nhis fellow citizens.

GARETH PARRY\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the service of a great \nFederal employee.\n  Human ingenuity is boundless. This is especially true in America, \nwhich has always been driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and a belief \nthat nothing is impossible.\n  From Whitney's cotton gin to the first elevator, from the electric \ntelegraph to the refrigerated rail car, our forbearers used their \ningenuity to help build a nation. Such invention and perseverance \nclosed the western frontier in the nineteenth century. In the century \nthat followed, Americans continued to be pioneers on that frontier \nwhich has no end--the frontier of science.\n  Sixty-seven years ago this week, a team of American physicists led by \nEnrico Fermi conducted a critical experiment. On a cold winter's \nafternoon, they huddled under the stands of the old football stadium at \nthe University of Chicago. Using graphite blocks, wooden rods, and \nuranium pellets, they initiated the first-ever controlled nuclear \nreaction.\n  That experiment, called ``Chicago Pile One,'' marked the beginning of \nthe nuclear age.\n  Today all Americans know that the discovery of nuclear power was a \nmixed blessing. With it came the potential for a new form of energy to \npower our homes and businesses. For the first time, our naval ships \ncould remain at sea--and on guard--for extended periods without \nrefueling.\n  But with nuclear energy came nuclear weapons. These led to the \ndangerous prospect of the mass destruction of hundreds of cities within \nminutes. They brought us a generation of ``duck and cover'' and \nbackyard fallout shelters.\n  Thankfully--though our nation and others continue to possess these \nweapons in our time--the Cold War is over. No longer are we minutes \nfrom ``mutually assured destruction'' the way we once were.\n  Today, peaceful nuclear energy provides a fifth of our electricity, \nand there are 104 civilian reactors in operation across the country.\n  Developing and enforcing the regulations that keep these reactors \nsafe are the men and women of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  This week I wish to recognize the contribution of an outstanding \npublic servant, Dr. Gareth Parry. Gareth has had a distinguished career \nat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission advancing our nuclear safety.\n  He is also a 2004 recipient of the distinguished Arthur S. Flemming \nAward for public service.\n  Gareth, who immigrated to this country from the United Kingdom, has \nover thirty years of experience in developing models for probabilistic \nrisk analysis--or PRA. He retired this September after a long and \ndistinguished career.\n  As senior adviser on PRA for the Commission's Office of Nuclear \nReactor Regulation, Gareth became one of the leading experts on \nanalyzing common cause failure and human reliability. His work led to \nthe development of PRA standards and the use of PRA to support risk-\ninformed decision-making with regard to nuclear safety.\n  Gareth, as a scientist and a public servant, worked hard to ensure \nthe safety of America's civilian nuclear facilities.\n  The kind of work he performed is highly mathematical and complex, and \nit may not sound glamorous to the average American, but it is critical \nand contributes enormously to the security and economic well-being of \nour Nation.\n  Sixty-seven years ago, Fermi and his team first harnessed the power \nof the atom. Today, the men and women of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission ensure that our modern nuclear reactors continue to do so \nsafely.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the service of Dr. \nGareth Parry and all who have worked--and continue to work--at the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12409-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12409-S12410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPIRATION OF START\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, tonight, the Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty will expire, and with it the primary framework for the reduction \nof nuclear weapons for the last 20 years. Today, I would like to speak \na few minutes about the critical importance of an offensive strategic \narms reduction, and why we must establish a follow-on treaty to START.\n  In September, President Obama proposed a resolution to the United \nNations Security Council to eliminate nuclear weapons, ban production \nof the fissile material, outlaw nuclear tests,\n\n[[Page S12410]]\n\nand safeguard existing weapons stockpiles. World leaders approved the \nresolution, joining with the President's previous statements that \n``America seeks a world with no nuclear weapons.'' This is not a vision \nof unilateral disarmament, but a vision for multilateral action. It is \na vision of working step by step with every nation to draw down nuclear \narsenals together. It is a critically important goal, and one of the \nbest ways to ensure a safer future and a safer world.\n  In the past few years, we have seen a rise in clandestine nuclear \nprograms developed by rogue states, including those which have \nsuccessfully acquired a nuclear arsenal. This growing threat--primarily \nfrom North Korea and Iran--underscores the value of international \nstrategic arms treaties. These are global challenges which require \nglobal solutions and a multilateral approach. The best way to combat \nproliferation is unity of the international community, and I am pleased \nthat one of the greatest successes of President Obama's policy of \nengagement with Iran has been a growing convergence of views \nidentifying Iran's nuclear program as a threat not just to one region \nbut to the world.\n  While multilateralism is the best way to effectively reduce the \nthreat posed by nuclear weapons, we must look to successful bilateral \nagreements as a model, including START. This historic agreement laid \nthe groundwork for a common understanding between the United States and \nRussia regarding nuclear weapons, and truly symbolized the end of the \nCold War. It allowed us to talk about previously taboo subjects, such \nas the Triad and intrusive verification, and develop a shared language \nof expertise and evaluation that reduced our nuclear arsenals. More \nimportantly, it provided a process of arbitration that avoids \nconfrontation, establishes legal mechanisms to forever avoid a nuclear \nwar.\n  The stability START provided allowed both the United States and \nRussia to reduce our nuclear stockpiles and engage in negotiations \nabout curbing proliferation worldwide. It also built great confidence \nin the other as a partner. Since its inception, START has served as an \nenabler of global non-proliferation efforts. Now this critical treaty \nis set to expire, and it is time to move to establish a follow-on which \nreflects the requirements of the 21st century, and allows the United \nStates and Russia to continue this valuable partnership in \nnonproliferation together.\n  This is why I am a cosponsor of legislation which provides a legal \nbasis for extending the START verification regime, and I strongly \nsupport the work of the Obama administration--under the leadership of \nAssistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance Rose \nGottemoeller--to negotiate the follow-on treaty. We owe it to Americans \nto place consideration of the new treaty at the top of the agenda when \nit is submitted, so the United States can continue to pave the way \ntoward a safer and more secure world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12410-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12410-S12411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just over 6 months ago, this Congress \nwas abuzz with concern about piracy off Somalia's coast. Following the \nattack on a U.S.-flagged ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, and capture of \nCPT Richard Phillips, no less than five congressional committees held \nhearings on this topic. There was intense discussion about the steps \nthat should be taken by our ships and our Navy to help prevent these \nattacks. And the State Department subsequently announced several steps \nit would take to combat piracy, including working with the \nInternational Contact Group on Piracy to expand the multinational naval \noperation to patrol the waters off Somalia's coast. The United States, \nChina, India, Russia, the European Union and many other countries have \ndeployed naval forces to the region that are working together to combat \npiracy--a remarkable show of international cooperation.\n  Those naval efforts have had some success. But while piracy attacks \ndeclined considerably over the summer months with the monsoon season, \nattacks appear to be on the rise again. The International Maritime \nBureau reports that 38 ships have been attacked and 10 hijacked in the \npast 2 months. This includes the Maersk Alabama, which was attacked \nagain on November 18. It also includes a supertanker carrying $20 \nmillion in crude oil that was seized this week en route from Saudi \nArabia to New Orleans. The UN Secretary General warned in July that \n``as a result of the military presence in the region, pirates have \nemployed more daring operational tactics, operating further seawards, \ntoward the Seychelles, and using more sophisticated weaponry.'' The \nrecent attacks bear out the Secretary General's concern. Even more \ndisconcerting, Jeffrey Gettleman of the New York Times reported this \nweek that more Somalis and new Somali subclans are being drawn into the \npiracy business, attracted by the vast ransom payments.\n  I said back in the spring that while naval action was needed to \nconfront these pirates, we would likely see more episodes of piracy if \nwe did not also address the conditions on land that contribute to this \nproblem. The recent events have proven this to be true. Both Director \nof National Intelligence Blair and Defense Intelligence Agency Director \nArmy LTG Michael Maples, in their testimony before Congress earlier \nthis year, cited lawlessness and economic problems on land in Somalia \nas the cause of rising piracy at sea. In the absence of local law \nenforcement capacity and amidst a dire economic situation, piracy is an \nattractive choice for many young people in northwest Somalia. The \nrenewed piracy attacks show that this remains the case, regardless of \nthe increased pressure from naval forces and maritime vessels adopting \nnew defensive precautions.\n  Now, let me be clear: when I say we should address the conditions on \nland, I do not mean that we should carry out some kind of military \naction against those villages where the pirates are known to live, as \nsome have suggested. In fact, such operations would do little to change \nthose conditions and they would likely make matters worse by inciting \nlocal resentment. Nor am I in any way excusing the behavior of the \ncriminals behind these attacks--nothing can justify their actions. What \nI am saying is that what is needed is a serious international \ncommitment to help establish stability, functional governance, capable \nlaw enforcement, and economic opportunity in Somalia. As leading \nSomalia expert Dr. Ken Menkhaus has said, it will be impossible to end \nthe piracy when ``the risks are so low, rewards so high and \nalternatives so bleak in desolate Somalia.'' Changing that equation \nrequires real change on land.\n  In particular, we know that most of the pirates come from communities \nin northern Somalia. Yet, despite this, we have done little to directly \nengage the regions of Puntland and Somaliland, and their regional \ngovernments. I am not arguing that we should recognize their \nindependence, but I believe it is in our national interest to engage \nthese regions--diplomatically and economically--and to promote \ngovernance and stability there. It is in our interest from the \nstandpoint of not just counterpiracy, but also counterterrorism. The \nterrorist threat in northern Somalia is, or should be, more apparent \nnow than ever. Last October, terrorists attacked in Somaliland and \nPuntland. And last month, a well-known judge and legislator in Puntland \nwere assassinated. We need to help both of these regions to maintain \nand shore up their relative stability. And in the case of Somaliland, \nthere is a unique tradition of democratic rule that we ought to \nencourage, although I am disappointed that Somaliland's elections have \nbeen repeatedly postponed.\n  At the same time, more engagement with northern Somalia does not mean \nwe should neglect the rest of the country. The raging conflict and \nresulting humanitarian crisis in central and southern Somalia is worse \nthan ever. Just yesterday, a suicide bomber attacked a graduation \nceremony in Mogadishu, killing at least 10 people, including 3 \nMinisters of the Transitional Federal Government. This demonstrates the \nfragility of the TFG, which continues to face a strengthened al Shebaab \nand allied militias. Over the weekend, al Shebaab, a group with links \nto al-Qaida, seized another major town in southern Somalia. In addition \nto these security challenges, the TFG has struggled to broaden its \ngrassroots appeal or demonstrate its ability to make a difference in \npeople's lives. The result is that the TFG is reportedly\n\n[[Page S12411]]\n\nbeing seen by some Somalis as a proxy of the West and little different \nthan its predecessors. This is extremely worrisome, especially if we \nbelieve that this government offers the best chance for establishing \nstability and inclusive governance in Somalia.\n  Even more than the threat of piracy, the terrorist threat shows why \nwe need to be paying more attention to Somalia. Al-Qaida and its \naffiliates continue to exploit Somalia's instability, which has real \nramifications for our national security. Last month, the Justice \nDepartment announced that terrorism charges were being brought in the \nDistrict of Minnesota against eight defendants for recruiting and \nraising funds for Somali-Americans to fight on behalf of al Shebaab. \nFourteen people have now been charged in this investigation, reportedly \nthe largest group of American citizens suspected of joining an \nextremist movement with links to al-Qaida. We should not equate these \nindividuals with al-Qaida suspects, but we should be mindful of what \nDirector of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael Leiter \ntestified to in September--that ``the potential for al-Qaida operatives \nin Somalia to commission Americans to return to the United States and \nlaunch attacks against the Homeland remains of significant concern.'' \nOur close partners in the region--Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda--are also \njustifiably concerned about al Shebaab's threat to attack them.\n  Recent history has shown that there are no easy answers to Somalia's \ntroubles. Moreover, it has shown that we can complicate and even \naggravate dynamics in Somalia, and many Somalis continue to view the \nUnited States with a high level of suspicion and resentment. We need to \nbe conscious of this. But that does not mean we should just disengage \nand let matters in Somalia play out, as some commentators suggest. \nRather, what I believe the recent history of the United States \ninvolvement in Somalia should teach us is that we cannot afford a half-\nhearted or fragmented policy toward Somalia where we are not clearly \ncommunicating to Somalis our intentions and our commitment. We need a \ncomprehensive strategy toward Somalia that includes serious, high-level \ndiplomatic support for a sustainable and inclusive peace. I have been \ncalling for such a strategy for nearly a decade now and I still do not \nbelieve we have one. With piracy resurging and the terrorist threat \nmore real than ever, I hope that will finally change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12411-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING TOM GRAFF\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Tom Graff, a pioneer of the environmental movement. Mr. \nGraff passed away on November 12, 2009, after a long battle with \ncancer. He was 65.\n  Born in Honduras in January 1944, Tom Graff was the son of German \nJewish refugees. He spent his childhood in Syracuse, NY, attending \nPhillips Exeter Academy. He later graduated from Harvard University, \nHarvard Law School, and the London College of Economics. After \ngraduation, Tom clerked for Federal judge Carl McGowen in Washington, \nDC, and was a legislative assistant to New York Mayor John Lindsay. In \n1970, he moved to California to work for Howard, Prim, Smith, Rice & \nDowns, a law firm based in San Francisco.\n  In 1971, Tom founded the California office of the Environmental \nDefense Fund. From then until 2008 when he retired, Tom served as \nEnvironmental Defense Fund's regional director. For more than 37 years, \nTom worked tirelessly and passionately as an advocate for the \nenvironment. He established a new form of environmental activism based \non the idea that economics could, and probably should, play a \nsignificant role in environmental policymaking. Tom believed that \npaying attention to how economic incentives influenced business and \npersonal behavior was critical to bringing about environmental \nimprovements.\n  Although he was involved with a number of environmental issues, it \nwas Tom's significant contributions to water policy that left an \nindelible mark in California. From the American River to Mono Lake to \nthe Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Tom strove to ensure that water was \ndistributed appropriately, and that the environment got its fair share. \nWorking together with Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and \nCongressman George Miller of Martinez, Tom was a guiding force behind \nthe Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1991, a milestone in the \nenvironmental movement to protect the delta. He helped craft the \nhistoric proposal to use water markets and public subsidies that \nultimately resolved the controversy around Mono Lake. He also did \nbattle with the East Bay Municipal Utility District when it sought a \nsecond source of water from the American River, known for its abundant \nfall salmon run. Concerned for the health of the river, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund filed suit against EBMUD. Seventeen years \nlater, a landmark decision designated a baseline environmental flow \nneed for the American River that stands to this day as a benchmark in \nriver policy.\n  Throughout his career, Tom's commitment to conservation and the \nbenefits it brought was evident in the work he did every day. His \nlifetime of contributions and his stewardship of the environment will \nnot soon be forgotten.\n  Tom is survived by his wife Sharona Barzilay; his three children \nSamantha, Benjamin, and Rebecca; and two grandsons Avi and Rafael. I \nextend my deepest sympathies to his family.\n  Tom was a true pioneer and advocate for a healthy and sustainable \nenvironment, working tirelessly to provide new approaches for managing \nnatural resources. His efforts will continue to shape California's \nwater policies for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12411-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12411-S12412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MITCH DEMIENTIEFF\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last April I spoke about the \nloss of Buddy Brown, a leader of the Athabascan people of interior \nAlaska, who served as president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, Inc. \nBuddy died at the age of 39.\n  Today it is my sad duty to report the passing of another Athabascan \nleader and former president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, Mitch \nDemientieff of Nenana. Mitch died unexpectedly on Tuesday, December 1, \nat the age of 57. Like Buddy, he left us too soon. He accomplished so \nmuch in a short time and was taken from us when he had so much more to \ngive.\n  Mitch was first elected president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference in \n1973 at the age of 20. He was elected to serve in that role again in \n1987. Today, the Tanana Chiefs Conference is an economic powerhouse in \ninterior Alaska employing hundreds of people and administering a wide \nrange of Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service programs on \nbehalf of some 10,000 Native people in a territory that extends over \n235,000 square miles. TCC is looked upon as a national pioneer in \nIndian self determination and that is in large measure due to the \nleadership initiatives of Mitch Demientieff. Under Mitch's leadership, \nTCC created a regionwide health care delivery system which is today \nanchored by the Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center in Fairbanks.\n  Mitch had the good fortune of serving as president of TCC in the run-\nup to passage of the Indian Self Determination and Educational \nAssistance Act of 1975. He positioned TCC as an early adapter of this \npowerful tool through which Native people rely upon their tribes, \nrather than the Federal Government, to deliver Federal Indian programs \nand services. TCC has used these authorities wisely to improve the \nquality of services to the people of interior Alaska and provide life \nchanging career opportunities to Native people from Fairbanks and \ncommunities throughout its region. It also began to administer housing, \nlands management, tribal government assistance, public safety, \neducation and employment and natural resources programs.\n  One of the characteristics that distinguish Alaska's Native people is \nthe continued reliance on traditional ways of living in our villages. \nSubsistence, the use of the Earth's resources for cultural and \nemotional sustenance, as well as food, is the way of life in interior \nAlaska.\n  Mitch Demientieff, even while running a multi-million dollar tribal \nenterprise, never forgot that subsistence\n\n[[Page S12412]]\n\nis fundamental to the survival of his Native people. Whatever else \nmight have competed for his attention subsistence came first.\n  In 1995, when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt assumed responsibility \nfor implementing the subsistence protections of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, he turned to Mitch as his man on the \nground. Mitch chaired the Federal Subsistence Board from 1995 until \n2006 protecting the subsistence interests of rural Alaskans throughout \nthe State.\n  Nor did Mitch ignore the needs of his own Native village of Nenana, \nwhich sits about 60 miles south of Fairbanks. Mitch chaired both the \nNenana tribe and the village Native Corporation.\n  I extend my condolences to Kathleen and the entire Demientieff \nfamily, a grand Alaskan family with a tradition of leadership, and all \nof our Native people on the loss of this Chief whose contributions were \ngreatly respected throughout Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12412-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12412-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12412-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs by unanimous consent, and referred as \nindicated:\n\n       S. 2129.

2836. A bill to improve the Operating Fund for public housing of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Asset Management\n\n[[Page S12415]]\n\nImprovement Act of 2009, which I introduced with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Olympia Snowe. This bill will help our public housing \nagencies deliver services to the families they serve more efficiently \nand effectively.\n  Due to a 2005 rule published by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, all public housing agencies are required to convert to \nasset management. Much of the guidance issued by HUD is inflexible and \napplies a one size fits all approach to managing housing units. HUD has \ntreated managing every public housing program the same, when in fact, \nthe multiple programs serve very different populations and operate in \nextremely different ways. Additionally, the regulations imposed by HUD \nhave caused PHAs to lose operating funds and left many short-staffed. \nFinally, the asset management rules issued by HUD are incomplete and \nunclear, leaving PHAs uncertain of funding levels for each year. While \nCongress has attempted to address some of these issues through HUD \nAppropriations legislation, permanent fixes are necessary to ensure \nbetter guidance to PHAs.\n  The legislation that we introduced today will ease administrative \nburdens on many public housing agencies, particularly the small \nagencies, and ensure that they have the proper funding, guidance and \nsupport to implement the rule of asset management. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to move this important piece of legislation \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12415-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 370--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF PAULA F.

Res. 341\n\n       Whereas the people and Government of Yemen currently face \n     tremendous security challenges, including the presence of a \n     substantial number of al Qaeda militants, a rebellion in the \n     northern part of the country, unrest in southern regions, and \n     piracy in the Gulf of Aden;\n       Whereas these security challenges are compounded by a lack \n     of governance throughout portions of the country;\n       Whereas this lack of governance creates a de facto safe \n     haven for al Qaeda and militant forces in regions of Yemen;\n       Whereas Yemen also faces significant development \n     challenges, reflected in its ranking of 140 out of 182 \n     countries in the United Nations Development Program's 2009 \n     Human Development Index;\n       Whereas Yemen is also confronted with limited and rapidly \n     depleting natural resources, including oil, which accounts \n     for over 75 percent of government revenue, and water, \\1/3\\ \n     of which goes to the cultivation of qat, a narcotic to which \n     a vast number of Yemenis are addicted;\n       Whereas government subsidies are contributing to the \n     depletion of Yemen's scarce resources;\n       Whereas the people of Yemen suffer from a lack of certain \n     government services, including a robust education and skills \n     training system;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 International \n     Religious Freedom Report notes that nearly all of the once-\n     sizeable Jewish population in Yemen has emigrated, and, based \n     on fears for the Jewish community's safety in the country, \n     the United States Government has initiated a special process \n     to refer Yemeni Jews for refugee resettlement in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas women in Yemen have faced entrenched \n     discrimination, obstacles in accessing basic education, and \n     gender-based violence in their homes, communities, and \n     workplaces while little is done to enforce or bolster the \n     equality of women;\n       Whereas these challenges pose a threat not only to the \n     Republic of Yemen, but to the region and to the national \n     security of the United States;\n       Whereas, to the extent that Yemen serves as a base for \n     terrorist operations and recruitment, these threats must be \n     given sufficient consideration in the global strategy of the \n     United States to combat terrorism;\n       Whereas this threat has materialized in the past, including \n     the March 18 and September 17, 2008, attacks on the United \n     States Embassy in Sana'a and the October 12, 2000, attack on \n     the U.S.S. Cole while it was anchored in the Port of Aden, as \n     well as numerous other terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the population of Yemen has suffered greatly from \n     conflict and underdevelopment in Yemen;\n       Whereas up to 150,000 civilians have fled their homes in \n     northern Yemen since 2004 in response to conflict between \n     Government of Yemen forces and al-Houthi rebel forces; and\n       Whereas the people and Government of the United States \n     support peace in Yemen and improved security, economic \n     development, and basic human rights for the people of Yemen: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the innocent civilians in Yemen, especially \n     displaced persons, who have suffered from instability, \n     terrorist operations, and chronic underdevelopment in Yemen;\n       (2) recognizes the serious threat instability and terrorism \n     in Yemen pose to the security of the United States, the \n     region, and the population in Yemen;\n       (3) calls on the President to give sufficient weight to the \n     situation in Yemen in efforts to prevent terrorist attacks on \n     the United States, United States allies, and Yemeni \n     civilians;\n       (4) calls on the President to promote economic and \n     political reforms necessary to advance economic development \n     and good governance in Yemen;\n\n[[Page S12460]]\n\n       (5) applauds steps that have been taken by the President \n     and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to \n     assist displaced persons in Yemen;\n       (6) urges the Government of Yemen and rebel forces to \n     immediately halt hostilities, allow medical and humanitarian \n     aid to reach civilians displaced by conflict, and create an \n     environment that will enable a return to normal life for \n     those displaced by the conflict; and\n       (7) calls on the President and international community to \n     use all appropriate measures to assist the people of Yemen to \n     prevent Yemen from becoming a failed state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/04/senate-section/article/S12460-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR PAULA F. HAWKINS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 370, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 370) relative to the death of Paula \n     F. Hawkins, former United States Senator for the State of \n     Florida.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise to express my sorrow at the \npassing of former U.S. Senator Paula Hawkins and to pay tribute to her \nlong life and groundbreaking career of public service.\n  A resident of central Florida, Paula Hawkins began her political \ncareer in 1972 when she was elected to Florida's Public Services \nCommission where she served for two consecutive terms and worked to \nbecome a vibrant voice for consumers.\n  Paula Hawkins aspired to continue her public service by running for \nhigher office, first for the U.S. Senate in 1974, and then for \nLieutenant Governor in 1978. Though both times she lost the race, she \nnever gave up and never lost the desire to continue working for \nFloridians.\n  Paula made history in 1980 when she became the first woman from \nFlorida to be elected to the U.S. Senate and the first woman from \nFlorida to be elected to Federal office.\n  During her tenure in the Senate, Senator Hawkins became an outspoken \nchampion for America's victimized children and brought a special focus \nto the problem of child abduction. Driven by the disappearance of 6-\nyear-old Florida resident Adam Walsh, Senator Hawkins ushered passage \nof landmark legislation focusing on the issue of missing children. Her \nwork would ultimately help to establish the National Center for Missing \n& Exploited Children. She also supported a special unit at the Federal \nBureau of Investigation that would focus solely on profiling serial \nkillers.\n  Though I am saddened by her passing, I am honored today to serve in \nthe same class as Senator Hawkins--a seat she held before being \nsucceeded by former Senator Bob Graham, and my predecessor, Senator Mel \nMartinez.\n  The citizens of our United States owe a debt of gratitude to this \ngreat Floridian and we shall not soon forget the work of Senator \nHawkins.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 370) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 370\n\n       Whereas Paula F. Hawkins was a staunch consumer advocate \n     and served the citizens of the State of Florida on its Public \n     Service Commission for seven years, serving as its Chairman \n     for three years;\n       Whereas Paula F. Hawkins was instrumental in passing the \n     Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984 and worked to help \n     establish the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children;\n       Whereas Paula F. Hawkins served the people of Florida with \n     distinction for 6 years in the United States Senate;\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable Paula F. Hawkins, former member of the United \n     States Senate.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable Paula F.
