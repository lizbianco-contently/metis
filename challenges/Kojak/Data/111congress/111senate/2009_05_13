Senators with good intentions can disagree on issues. They \ncan disagree with our Nation's leaders. But we should all be able to \nagree that the President and his Cabinet deserve a complete lineup when \nthat team takes the field on the most important issues we face. The \nAmerican people deserve the leaders they asked for in November when \nthey demanded we clean up the mess the last administration left behind.\n  One of those key players is a man by the name of David Hayes, the man \nPresident Obama has nominated to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. \nMr. Hayes served successfully in this same position during the Clinton \nadministration and understands better than probably anyone else what it \ntakes to effectively run a department of about 70,000 people; that is, \nthe Department of Interior. As Deputy Secretary of Interior, Hayes \nwould work closely with our former colleague, Secretary Ken Salazar, on \nimportant decisions about many issues.\n  No two States understand the importance of the Secretary of Interior \nmore than Alaska and Nevada. Eighty-seven percent of the State of \nNevada is owned by the Federal Government. Alaska is second. Other \nStates have large amounts of land controlled by the Federal Government \nand the Secretary of Interior, and consequently his deputy would have \nsome say over it. Secretary Salazar must make important decisions about \ndeveloping renewable energy resources that will create jobs, protecting \nour wildlife, preserving our public lands for future generations, and \nkeeping our water clean and accessible. David Hayes will play a central \nrole in correcting the mistakes of the past and making important \ndecisions for the future.\n  The past 8 years of the Interior Department were marked by \nmismanagement and scandal. Secretary Salazar's Department has inherited \nthe unenviable task of getting the American people to once again trust \nan agency that manages one-fifth of the Nation's landmass and 1.7 \nbillion acres off our coasts.\n  The Department is also moving us forward in critical ways. Secretary \nSalazar has made it clear that he will\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\ntake dramatic strides to move our country toward energy independence. \nWith David Hayes' help, he will ensure that our country is harnessing \nthe wind, the Sun, and the geothermal potential that will set us free \nfrom our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. Secretary Salazar \ndeserves the opportunity to have the best and most knowledgable people \naround him to make this energy revolution happen.\n  On Secretary Salazar's list, the first is David Hayes. He is a \ngraduate of Notre Dame University, Stanford Law School. He is \nexperienced, pragmatic, and creative. For 30 years, he has worked in \nnatural resources and environmental law. He has written dozens of \narticles and book chapters about water supply issues, clean energy, and \nland conservation, among other important topics. He has a long and \nimpressive track record of negotiating the kinds of difficult issues \nthe Department of Interior deals with every day. But he can't get this \nwork done until this body confirms him.\n  In a repeat of a scene we have unfortunately become far too familiar \nwith lately, Republicans are standing in the way. I know those holding \nup Mr. Hayes' nomination feel passionately about their priorities, but \nI also know that Secretary Salazar and Mr. Hayes believe just as \nstrongly about finding common ground that serves all of our interests.\n  The real issue is the fact that in the last minutes of the Bush \nadministration, the waning minutes, Secretary Kempthorne issued 77 oil \nand gas leases. These leases are next door to national parks. It was a \nconcern of the National Park Service when it was done. The \nenvironmental community is up in arms. The people of Utah don't like \nit. No one else would. We have one national park in Nevada, Great Basin \nNational Park. I know how the people of Nevada would feel if they had \nstarted bringing in oil rigs next to Great Basin National Bark. They \nwouldn't like it. Ken Salazar, when he became Secretary of the \nInterior, withdrew those regulations. He didn't terminate them, he \nwithdrew them for further study, further review. We have here an issue \nof the people of the State of Utah versus oil companies. For far too \nlong, the oil companies have always won. Let's make it so that the \npeople win for a change.\n  Every State has unique challenges. Mr. Hayes is prepared to travel \nacross the West to confront them head-on, not so he can tell States \nwhat to do but, rather, so he can work with them to address each issue \nthoughtfully and respectfully. Working together toward such solutions \nis the answer. Robbing a Cabinet Secretary of his right-hand man is \nnot.\n  Secretary Salazar knows the Senate, and his door is open to every \nMember of this body. Could you find a nicer person in the world than \nKen Salazar? I don't think so. Mr. Hayes has his backing and his \nbackground. Mr. Hayes will continue doing what Secretary Salazar \ndirects him to do. Now is the time to move forward, not to drag our \nfeet or posture or to try to score political points. Ask anyone who \nknows him. They will tell you that among the many skills he has is the \nability to work cooperatively and in a bipartisan fashion on the most \ncomplex issues. I wish our Republican colleagues would show the same \nspirit on at least confirming such a clearly qualified candidate for \nsuch a political job. No one questions his qualifications. He is a man \nof high moral standards. He has an excellent academic background. No \none questions his capabilities. The real issue is these oil and gas \nleases. He is a good and honest man. He is bright, successful, and a \nproven leader. Our country is fortunate that he has one again answered \nthe call to serve.\n  I understand at their meeting yesterday there was a plea: We have to \nstop Democrats from confirming this man. I say to my friends: David \nHayes will be confirmed. If I have to wait until Al Franken comes, he \nis going to be confirmed. We are going to confirm David Hayes. Everyone \nshould understand that. If we happen to lose this today, I will just \nmove to reconsider until we have the votes. Ken Salazar is going to \nhave David Hayes working with him. Everyone should understand that. \nSecretary Salazar has bent over backward to answer the questions of \nSenators who are questioning these oil and gas leases and a few other \nthings. Salazar is a man who is known for his ability to compromise. He \nis a consensus builder. I hope people will allow this nomination to go \nforward. If there were some question about Mr. Hayes having written a \nlaw review article where he is calling for something that is outlandish \nor if he had done something in the past that was out of line--I have \nnever heard a single word about his qualifications. He is a man who is \nqualified for this job. The President has nominated him.\n  In fairness, I ask unanimous consent that my time be charged against \nthe majority time, whatever time I used.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, the trustees of \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds released their annual \nreport. After reviewing its findings, it is clear that the future of \nSocial Security and Medicare can be summed up in one word: \nunsustainable.\n  Even before the report was issued, we knew these programs could not \nremain solvent for long under current conditions. Last year's report \npredicted that Social Security would start paying out more than it \ntakes in by 2017, and that it would be bankrupt about two decades after \nthat. Last year's report also predicted that Medicare would start \npaying out more than it takes in within a year and that the trust fund \nfor this vital program would go bankrupt about a decade after that.\n  The report that was released yesterday presents a far graver \nscenario.\n  As a result of the current recession, Social Security will start \npaying out more than it takes in by 2016, and it will go bankrupt 4 \nyears earlier than previously expected. The situation for Medicare is \neven more serious. Medicare is already paying out more than it takes \nin, and it will be bankrupt in just 8 years, 2 years earlier than \nexpected, according to yesterday's report.\n  It would be irresponsible for Congress to wait any longer before \naddressing this problem. Some say we haven't reached a point of crisis \nyet, so we can continue to kick the problem down the road until these \nprograms actually go bankrupt. They seem to think that if the house is \non fire, it is OK to wait until the whole place burns down before you \ncall the fire department.\n  Most Americans disagree. Most people think that if a program they \ndepend on is falling apart, or is about to fall apart, then their \nelected representatives in Washington have an obligation to tell them \nabout it, and to do something. The time to act is now, before these \nprograms go bankrupt--not after.\n  The warning signs about Social Security and Medicare have been around \nus for years, and the problems with these programs are also at the core \nof the current record levels of government spending and debt. At the \nmoment, programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well \nas the interest we pay on the national debt, consume nearly seven out \nof every 10 dollars the Federal Government spends--Medicare, Social \nSecurity, Medicaid, and the national debt. Soon we will have little \nmoney left for anything else, including vital priorities such as \ndefense, health care, transportation, and programs that fuel job \ncreation.\n\n  Reform has been put off for too long. Take Medicare reforms, for \nexample. By law, the President is required to submit legislation to \nlower Medicare spending levels if the cashflow of this program falls \nbelow a certain level. So last year, when Medicare cashflow fell below \nthat level, the President submitted legislation to lower spending. \nUnfortunately, this legislation did not move forward in Congress.\n  Real leadership on entitlement reform will require action from both \nparties. And yesterday's report is the wake-up call. Reform is no \nlonger just a good idea--it is absolutely necessary. It is the only way \nto restore these programs to fiscal health, and to get at\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nthe root of our larger fiscal problems. Unless we act now, these \nprograms will no longer be sustainable, and spending and debt will \ncontinue to spiral out of control.\n  The good news is that a solution actually exists. As I have said many \ntimes before, the best way to address this crisis is the Conrad-Gregg \nproposal, which would provide an expedited pathway for fixing the long-\nterm challenges of entitlement spending and our unprecedented national \ndebt--challenges that the Democratic budget and their economic policies \nof the past few months completely ignore.\n  There has never been a better time to adopt this sensible bipartisan \nproposal. This week we learned that the deficit for the current fiscal \nyear will be nearly $90 billion higher than previously estimated--\nbringing the deficit for this year to $1.8 trillion. This is nearly \nfour times--four times--higher than the record set last year. It also \nmeans that this year's deficit is higher than those of the past 5 years \ncombined.\n  The danger of all this debt is simple: higher inflation that \nthreatens to derail an economic recovery, and trillions in debt that \nour children and grandchildren will have to repay to countries such as \nChina and nations in the Middle East.\n  Secretary Geithner said yesterday that when it comes to reforming \nSocial Security, the administration will build a bipartisan consensus \nto ensure Social Security remains solvent. I welcome the statement, and \nI urge the administration to support the Conrad-Gregg proposal which is \nthe best way and, I would argue, the only way to address entitlement \nspending and our unprecedented national debt. After yesterday's report, \nit is clear we cannot wait any longer to address this crisis.\n  Americans have relied on programs such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity for decades. It would be dishonest and unfair not to tell them \nthe truth about these programs--that they are near collapse and that \nurgent reform is needed to bring them back to sustainability. More than \n800,000 Kentuckians receive Social Security benefits, and nearly that \nmany are enrolled in Medicare. They deserve our honesty. And they \ndeserve action from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. We need to \nmake sure programs such as Social Security and Medicare remain viable \nfor them and for their children and their grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5399-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HAYES TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David J. \nHayes, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders of their designees.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hayes \nnomination. I am here with the Senator from Alaska, and I wish to be \ntold after I have consumed 15 minutes so the Senator from Alaska and I \ncan coordinate our presentations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the statement \nof the majority leader with respect to David Hayes, and I agree with \nmuch of what he had to say. I feel compelled to correct some of the \nthings he had to say because they are some of the same things the \nDepartment of the Interior has been saying that I find are, in fact, \nnot factual.\n  I agree with him that the President should be entitled to appoint \nwhomever it is he wants. And I agree with him that David Hayes is \nqualified for this position. I also believe, however, that Members of \nthis body, who have the responsibility of the confirmation vote, are \nentitled to clear answers to their questions before the confirmation \nshould proceed.\n  It is my opinion we have been asking for clear answers to those \nquestions--to legitimate questions--and those answers have not been \nforthcoming. Therefore, I am not willing to proceed with the \nconfirmation vote until we get those answers.\n  This is not to say I am opposed to David Hayes and will do everything \nto see to it he is not confirmed. Indeed, I want to do everything I can \nto see that he is confirmed as rapidly as possible. But ``as rapidly as \npossible'' does not mean I must give up my rights to receive clear \nanswers to legitimate questions.\n  Let me go to some of the items the majority leader covered in his \nstatement because they are the same items the Secretary of the Interior \nhas used, and that others have used in press releases, that I believe \nneed to be set straight. They are simply not factually true.\n  Let's start with the question of leases. Numbers. How many leases \nwere put up and sold by the BLM in the last month of the Bush \nadministration in the State of Utah? The answer to that question is \n128. Not 77; 128. All of those 128 leases were subject to exactly the \nsame kind of procedure. All of them went through the same kind of \nreview. All of them were handled by the same team of experts: career \npeople within the Department. And all of them ultimately were sold.\n  The majority leader said this happened in the midnight hours of the \nBush administration, as if this whole thing were cobbled together in \nthe last minute. In fact, much of the activity dealing with the sale of \nthese leases occurred over a 7-year period. Why? Because all of the \nparties involved wanted to make sure they complied with all of the \nrules. If it had been handled in a ``rush it through,'' ``get it done \nduring our political circumstance'' sort of manner, they could have \nbeen granted in 2004 or 2007; it did not have to wait until the last \nmonths of 2008. The reason it waited until the last months of 2008 was \nbecause the plans were so meticulously reviewed to make sure they \ncomplied with every rule that it took that long. So let's get rid of \nthe idea that this was a political decision on the part of the Bush \nadministration. The record is very clear it was not.\n  All right. After the Obama administration took over, out of the 128 \nleases that were granted, suddenly 77 were withdrawn by the Secretary \nof the Interior. Why? If there was a flaw in the way these leases were \nhandled, the entire 128 should have been withdrawn because they were \nall handled in exactly the same manner. The 77 were withdrawn because \nan environmental group filed a lawsuit. The environmental group decided \nwhich leases should be challenged, not the Department of the Interior. \nIt was not a review by any career officer in the Department of the \nInterior that said these leases were flawed. It was a political \ndecision by an environmental group that said we are going to file a \nlawsuit; and in response to that lawsuit, the Secretary of the Interior \nsaid: I am going to pull these 77 leases, and then gave the same \njustification for his actions that the majority leader has given here \non the floor today; that is, they are right next door to the national \nparks and no one wants an oil rig next to a national park.\n\n  No. 1, most of the leases are natural gas; there are not oil rigs \ninvolved at all. And, No. 2, they are not right next door to the \nnational parks. Some of them are as far as 60 miles away.\n  Let's look at a map I have in the Chamber and see where these leases \nare. On this map, shown in yellow are the national parks. This one is \nArches National Park, and this one is Canyonlands National Park. Shown \nin green is existing oil and gas leases that were in place long before \nthe December lease sale. Shown in red are the leases that were granted \nin the so-called midnight hours of the Bush administration.\n  A quick glance at the map makes it very clear that the challenged \nleases\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nalleged to be ``right next door to a national park'' are surrounded by \nexisting leases that are closer to the national park than the leases \nthat are being challenged.\n  The facts simply are not there to support the position the Secretary \nof the Interior has taken and the majority leader has repeated here \ntoday. The majority leader has depended upon the Secretary for his \nfacts. The majority leader made a mistake in depending on the Secretary \nbecause the Secretary is wrong. That is one of the things that has \ncaused me to raise this issue.\n  What is the real motivation behind this? Because to say the \nmotivation is ``they are too close to the national parks'' simply does \nnot apply.\n  There are some leases shown in red on the map that do not have any \nexisting leases between them and the national park. But they do have a \nhighway. If you are concerned about the national park experience being \ndegraded by having leases where there may be some natural gas activity \ngoing on--that this activity will somehow that will destroy your \nexperience in the national park--how about a highway destroying the \nexperience of a national park? They are separated from the national \npark by a highway.\n  Let's look at another map, this one having to do with the Dinosaur \nNational Monument. This is the one where some leases are 60 miles away. \nYet the Secretary of the Interior would have you believe they are right \nnext door, that they abut the existing boundaries of a national park.\n  Look at the green on the map which does, in fact, abut the boundaries \nof the Dinosaur National Monument. No one has ever complained about \nthat. This was a purely political decision based on the lawsuit filed \nby an environmental group rather than by any kind of review.\n  I have asked the Department of the Interior: Justify your actions. \nAppoint a team that will give us the information we need and will tell \nus why these 77 leases are different than the rest of the 128 leases.\n  This is the reaction, this is the response I have received from the \nDepartment of Interior to my questions.\n  The first response that came from David Hayes was a supplemental \nanswer to one of my questions regarding the review Secretary Salazar \nhad committed to undertake. The next day, David Hayes followed up with \na letter that came on Department of the Interior letterhead, and he \nsigned it: David Hayes, Deputy Secretary Designee. This is as official \na statement as we are going to get, and this is what he says in his \nresponse: ``If confirmed, David Hayes will have overall responsibility \nfor undertaking the review of the 77 parcels that were withdrawn from \nthe Utah lease sale. Pending Mr. Hayes' confirmation''--not dependent \nupon, but pending Mr. Hayes' confirmation--``the review team will \nconsist of the Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and \nBudget, the Acting Directors of the BLM and the National Park Service, \nand their designees. The Acting Solicitor, Art Gary, will provide legal \nsupport to the extent needed.''\n  In the document where this team was named and laid out, the \ncommitment was made that there would be preliminary work done on the \nreport by the first of May and that the entire matter would be resolved \nby the 29th of May. And when the first of May came along, and we \nexpected some kind of preliminary report from the Department, Secretary \nSalazar said: ``We have done nothing, and we can do nothing until David \nHayes is confirmed''--directly contradicting the statement we have in \nwriting over the signature of David Hayes. I think we are entitled to \nraise a question about this kind of procedure.\n  The majority leader talked about the real issue in this matter. The \nreal issue in this matter is the credibility of the Department of the \nInterior. If we are going to deal with the Department in the coming 4 \nor 8 years--whatever the electorate decides--we need to have some \nconfidence that when the Department sends us a document and makes a \npromise, and names the specific people who will be involved in \nfulfilling that promise, that will happen. One final comment. The \nmajority leader and the Secretary have said this happened without \nconsulting the National Park Service. On that I have two points. No. 1, \nit is a matter of law that the BLM is not required to consult with the \nNational Park Service on lease sales. They could have done this whole \nthing without talking to anybody at the National Park Service and been \ncompletely proper in terms of the law. They went beyond the \nrequirements of the law and consulted with the Park Service to make \nsure there was no interference with national parks.\n\n  Here is what Mike Snyder, the National Park Service Regional Director \nfor the Intermountain Region, had to say about that kind of cooperation \nand coordination:\n\n       I would like to personally extend my appreciation to the \n     BLM field office managers who worked with the Park Service on \n     the parcel-by-parcel review of these oil and gas lease \n     parcels. They did an outstanding job working in collaboration \n     with us.\n\n  Secondly--Mr. Snyder said:\n\n       Working with Selma Sierra, the BLM Utah State Director, has \n     resulted in the kind of resource protection that Americans \n     want and deserve for their national parks.\n\n  The BLM didn't consult with the national parks? The BLM did not \ndiscuss this with the national parks, when the National Park Service \nmakes a statement of this kind for the record?\n  I repeat: The problem has to do with the credibility of the \nDepartment of the Interior. They have made a series of statements that \nare not true. They say these leases are too close to the national \nparks. Sixty miles away is not too close. They say there was no \nconsultation with the National Park Service. The National Park Service \nis on record as saying it is done. They made a promise on official \nletterhead from the Department of the Interior that a team would be \nappointed and a date would be met and the team was not appointed and \nthe date was not met.\n  I am perfectly willing to vote for the confirmation of David Hayes as \nsoon as the Department of the Interior lives up to the promises they \nhave made and acknowledges that the statements they made about these \nleases are factually incorrect. It is not a matter of interpretation. \nIt is not a matter of opinion. The maps are here. The documents are \nhere. The statements are here. Let's have an honest discussion of it, \nand when that discussion is taken care of and a commitment made by Mr. \nHayes on Department of the Interior letterhead is met, I will be happy \nto remove my hold and vote for his confirmation and urge all my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle to do the same. That is the issue \nwith which we are faced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to follow \nmy colleague from Utah, as he has so clearly laid out the grounds upon \nwhich he has placed a hold on the Department of the Interior nominee, \nDavid Hayes. I wish to make a comment at the outset: I don't think that \neither the Senator from Utah, and certainly not myself, in also placing \na hold--this is not a situation where there is disagreement about Mr. \nHayes' qualifications. This is not a personal matter or anybody out to \nget Mr. Hayes, if you will. This is about what is happening within the \nDepartment, as my colleague from Utah has mentioned, about the \ncredibility within the Department of the Interior at this moment in \ntime. The actions taken by Senator Bennett in placing a hold and \nsubsequently my actions in also placing a hold on Mr. Hayes and his \nnomination are strictly in keeping with the practice of being able to \nask a potential nominee--whether it is within the Department of the \nInterior or any other position within the administration--questions and \nexpecting to receive a response from that individual.\n  So I, too, rise to oppose the cloture motion for the nomination of \nDavid Hayes to be the Deputy Interior Secretary. From my perspective, \nthis vote is over a very simple issue and it can be distilled quite \neasily and that is: Will this administration answer legitimate \nquestions from Republican Senators? Before I give the background of my \nsituation, I also wish to say I do regret being on the floor at this \nmoment and having to make this statement. I believe this whole process \nwe have gone through has been unnecessary, and at any point leading up \nto this, the Department of the Interior could very easily have cleared \nthe way for this nominee without having to force a cloture vote. I will \nexplain why.\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\n  It was 2 weeks ago that I added my name to the procedural hold placed \nby the junior Senator from Utah on this nominee, and I did so very \nreluctantly. I did not do it to be obstructive, to be an obstructionist \nin any way but, rather, to constructively obtain an understanding of \nthe actions by the Department of the Interior that seemed to be, at \nleast in my opinion, dramatically at odds with statements made by \nSecretary Salazar and President Obama regarding domestic energy \nproduction. I will make a statement for the record that neither I nor \nSenator Bennett have asked the Department of the Interior to adopt or \nto repeal any specific rule or policy or take or repeal any specific \nadministrative action.\n  The Senator from Utah has laid out, very clearly, his concerns, and I \nwill only summarize for those who are listening to what we are talking \nabout that the Interior Department, very shortly after the beginning of \nthis administration, canceled the 77 oil and gas leases in Utah and \ngave factually incorrect justifications for its actions. All the \nSenator from Utah is asking for is a review of this very same issue.\n  Following the decision on the Utah leases, the administration \nannounced a 180-day delay of the 5-year Outer Continental Shelf leasing \nplan. There was also a delay of the scheduled round of oil shale \nresearch, demonstration, and development leases. There was also a \nfinding for justification of listing the yellow-billed loon, whose \nrange extends through major oil and gas regions in my State in Alaska. \nThere was also the determination that the Bush administration's \nmountaintop coal mining rule is considered legally defective. Finally, \nthere was the unilateral reversal of the previous administration's \nEndangered Species Act consultation rules, and this was done without \npublic hearing and without public comment.\n  It was this last issue--this issue that relates to the Endangered \nSpecies Act--that, in my opinion, was the straw that broke the camel's \nback. When the Bush administration listed the polar bear as a \nthreatened species due to loss of sea ice, the world changed insofar as \nthere had to be clear guidelines for keeping normal activities out of \nthe purview of a huge and impossible regulatory scheme. We have \ncautioned against an overbroad interpretation of the polar bear rule, \nand Interior, to their credit, has taken the correct path on some of \nthe most important rulemakings. I truly do appreciate that, and I have \nhad an opportunity to convey my appreciation to Secretary Salazar. We \nare thankful for that. However, my larger concern remains that \nconsultations could still be required for a host of energy projects, \nand in any event, that the Endangered Species Act's citizen suit \nprovisions are still going to give rise to a multitude of lawsuits on \nwhen and where consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service is \nmandated.\n  All this combined--all these various actions within the Department of \nthe Interior within a very short time period--caused great concern \nabout the direction of our Nation's energy policy.\n  I have been very pleased about some of the comments I have heard from \nthe President and from Secretary Salazar. They, themselves, have very \nclearly stated we do need oil and gas, and we should be producing more \nof it domestically. But what has been happening is the statements that \nhave been made and the rulemaking and the policy directives have been \nat odds with one another. I will give a couple quotes from both the \nSecretary and the President.\n  Secretary Salazar has said: There is no--he was talking about \nrenewable energies, but he goes on to state:\n  There is no question that the Nation will need to continue to produce \noil and gas as a bridge to this energy future.\n  I absolutely agree with the Secretary.\n  The President a couple of weeks ago said:\n\n       As I've often said, in the short term, as we transition to \n     renewable energy, we can and should increase our domestic \n     production of oil and natural gas. We're not going to \n     transform our economy overnight. We still need more oil, we \n     still need more gas. If we've got some here in the United \n     States that we can use, we should find it and do so in an \n     environmentally sustainable way . . .\n\n  That is the end of the President's quote. I couldn't agree with him \nmore.\n  But there is an inconsistency, as I have said, in the statements that \nhave been coming from the administration and the actions as evidenced \nthrough the rulemaking or the policy directives.\n  I still have questions about whether this administration does indeed \nwant to include increased domestic conventional energy production as \none of the legs of our comprehensive energy policy or if the \nadministration is going to say one thing and do another. If this \nPresident and his Interior Department want to scale back production, \nthat is their prerogative, and we can certainly talk about that, but \nthat is something I need to know, both as the ranking member on the \nEnergy Committee and as a Senator coming from the State that has the \ngreatest onshore and offshore oil and gas prospects left in North \nAmerica. This is important that we know and understand where this \nadministration is coming from.\n  I sent a letter to the Secretary when I placed a hold on Mr. Hayes, \nand I outlined my concerns. All my questions in that letter focused on \nhow Interior will implement the policies it has announced and how it \nwill defend against things such as the third-party lawsuits to which we \nbelieve they have made themselves pretty vulnerable. The White House \nand the Interior Department have communicated with me and my staff \nsince I wrote that letter. Initially, we were told DOI doesn't want to \nanswer the questions because they are too hard, there are too many of \nthem, and they are too mean. Since that time, my staff has received a \ndraft of a letter. I received it last night about 7 o'clock. I \nappreciated their response, but in many ways it avoids many of the \nspecific questions. I think there is an opportunity for us to go \nthrough my series of questions, have that discussion in a meaningful \nway, and get the clarity I am seeking which, as a Senator, I believe I \nam entitled to.\n  I will ask: If we can presume the Interior Department has been making \nits decisions and policies based on rational and well-thought-out facts \nand science, how hard can it be to question the decisions and the \npolicies behind it?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record the \nletter I sent to Secretary Salazar. I think my colleagues will see \nthere are indeed some very hard questions contained in my letter, but \nat this level of Government, I would suggest there aren't very many \neasy questions left.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kenneth L. Salazar,\n     Secretary, Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Salazar: I appreciate the comments that you \n     and other members of the Department of the Interior have made \n     on the importance of domestic energy production. As you are \n     aware, however, this past Thursday, April 30th, at a business \n     meeting held by Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, I expressed my strong concern over the widening \n     disparity between those statements and the Interior \n     Department's actions. At that meeting I announced my \n     procedural hold on the nomination of David Hayes for Deputy \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       I trust my announcement was not a surprise. On Friday April \n     24th, Will Shaffroth, your Principal Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks met with my staff \n     regarding potential repeal of regulations for consultations \n     under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). My staff noted that \n     these regulations were adopted in full compliance with the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, including public hearings and \n     extensive public comment. Staff strongly urged Mr. Shaffroth \n     that if you were determined to repeal the regulations, you \n     also comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, \n     you and Secretary Locke chose to repeal the regulations \n     without public hearings or public comment. Last week, prior \n     to my announcement, my staff talked to yours and informed \n     them what would happen at the hearing.\n       It is my sincere hope and expectation that we can advance \n     our respective understandings of the issues set out in this \n     letter as quickly and honestly as possible. My intention is \n     not to make your job more difficult. My intention is, \n     however, to get clear answers and commitments with regard to \n     what I and the American people should expect from our \n     Interior Department when it comes to the pressing and fragile \n     issues surrounding the stewardship of energy and natural \n     resources on federal public lands under your jurisdiction and \n     mine.\n       In my official statement on April 30, I expressed my \n     cumulative frustration with, among other things, the \n     cancelation of the 77 oil and gas leases in Utah; the 180-day \n     delay of the 5-year outer Continental Shelf leasing plan; the \n     delay of the new round of oil shale research, demonstration, \n     and development\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\n     leases: the finding for justification of listing the \n     yellow billed loon only one day after Tom Strickland's \n     confirmation hearing; the determination that the Bush \n     Administration's mountaintop coal mining rule is ``legally \n     defective''; and, finally, the reversal of the previous \n     administration's Endangered Species Act consultation \n     rules.\n       In reality, my decision to place the hold on Mr. Hayes is a \n     reflection of concerns that extend beyond these publicly-\n     stated issues and include my dissatisfaction with the \n     questions for the record which I submitted to Mr. Hayes, as \n     well as Mr. Strickland and Ms. Hilary Tompkins, the designate \n     for Solicitor General. I have attached several examples of \n     what I consider to be vague, equivocal, and ultimately \n     meaningless responses to substantive questions which deserved \n     and frankly require significantly more thought, effort, and \n     specificity.\n       Finally, I am troubled by Interior's lack of a swift and \n     assertive response to the DC Circuit Court's decision on \n     April 17th to vacate your department's outer Continental \n     Shelf Leasing Program. This decision alone could, depending \n     on its interpretation, have sweeping impacts upon the Obama \n     Administration's stated policy of including increased oil and \n     gas production as a meaningful part of the nation's \n     comprehensive energy policy.\n       The compounding nature of these acts and omissions \n     demonstrates a consistent pattern of steps that are nearly \n     certain to make domestic energy production more difficult, \n     more time-consuming, and more expensive. This is \n     fundamentally inconsistent with the repeated promises of the \n     President and yourself to actively advance increased \n     production of conventional energy sources. You are aware of \n     my full support for and strong record of aggressively \n     pursuing the technologies and infrastructure necessary to \n     dramatically increase America's renewable energy capacity, \n     but I am concerned that elements within the Administration \n     are meanwhile acting upon a misguided belief that quietly but \n     systematically and rapidly scaling back--or shutting down--\n     domestic oil, gas, and coal production will somehow force a \n     faster and smoother transition to a clean and secure energy \n     future. It will not, and I trust you agree that the ultimate \n     consequences of such a policy would be devastating to our \n     Nation's economy and security, as well as the world's \n     environment.\n       Given this fact pattern. I worry about what might be next. \n     So, I am left with no option other than exercising my \n     procedural remedies in order to obtain what I hope and \n     presume will be authoritative, binding, and realistic \n     responses to my concerns. To supplement the issues stated \n     above and the attached questions for the record, the latter \n     of which I would like to resubmit, please provide responses \n     to the following items in substantive detail. Though the \n     questions are detailed, I trust that all are issues that you \n     and your staff have already thought about extensively, before \n     you made the policy decisions referred to above.\n\n\n   Endangered Species Act Modifications and Climate Change Generally\n\n       Interior's basis for listing the polar bear as a threatened \n     species was based in significant part upon 7 of 10 climate \n     models showing a 97 percent loss in September sea ice by the \n     end of the 21st century, presenting threatened destruction, \n     modification, or curtailment of polar bear habitat. The \n     previous Administration's change to the subsequent \n     consultation rule attempted to ensure that a causal \n     connection between harm to listed species or their \n     habitats not be drawn from greenhouse gas emissions from a \n     specific facility, resource development project, or \n     government action. The rationale for this was that such \n     connections are manifested through global processes and \n     cannot be reliably predicted or measured at the scale of a \n     listed species' current range; or, would result at most in \n     an extremely small, insignificant impact on a listed \n     species or critical habitat; or, are such that the \n     potential risk of harm to a listed species is remote. \n     Reversal of this rulemaking as regards consultation \n     procedures, both formal and informal, risks resetting the \n     required consultations to an all-encompassing level which \n     I do not believe is sustainable, and prompts the following \n     questions:\n       1. Since the Supreme Court has afforded Interior \n     considerable discretion in enforcing what it termed a \n     Congressional purpose and intent in ESA to provide \n     ``comprehensive protection'' to species, including protection \n     from significant habitat modification or degradation, please \n     describe in substantive detail how the Interior Department \n     will apply its discretion in deciding whether to require FWS \n     consultation and concurrence specifically for each of the \n     following federal actions, some of which will result, \n     directly and indirectly, in the emission of various amounts \n     of greenhouse gases upon completion, and most of which will \n     require major levels of operation of heavy equipment; \n     transportation of persons and goods; and large amounts of \n     concrete, steel, aggregate, and other products produced \n     through highly carbon-intensive processes:\n       I. Clean Air Act permits for any or all of the 28 coal-\n     fired power plants now under construction, as listed by the \n     Department of Energy's tally.\n       II. Corps of Engineers permit for development and \n     construction of a pipeline to convey water from Dixie Valley \n     to Churchill County, Nevada.\n       III. Department of Transportation permitting for a high-\n     speed rail construction between Las Vegas, Nevada and \n     Southern California.\n       IV. Federal funding of ``Pavement rehabilitation'' at \n     Denver International Airport.\n       V. Federal funding to Caterpillar, Inc. for high-speed \n     diesel fuel combustion technology.\n       VI. Department of Transportation funding of the Milwaukee \n     Avenue Reconstruction project in Chicago, Illinois.\n       VII. Department of Transportation funding of the New Jersey \n     Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor.\n       VIII. NEPA documentation on grazing permit renewals.\n       IX. Hazardous fuels reduction projects on federal lands \n     (resulting in changes in vegetation patterns.)\n       2. In the event that the Interior Department does not \n     exercise its authority to mandate FWS consultations for the \n     federal actions necessary for the projects stated under (1), \n     does Interior anticipate multiple invocations of the citizen \n     suit provisions under ESA Sec. 9(g) to compel consultations?\n       a. If so, to what extent is Interior prepared, equipped, \n     and funded to defend against the multitude of citizen suits \n     likely to be filed?\n       3. Does the reversal of the ESA consultation rule provide, \n     in essence, for mandatory second-guessing on an \n     intradepartmental level, suggesting that any biologists on \n     staff at BLM, MMS, and other agencies are somehow less \n     qualified (or unqualified) to evaluate potential impacts from \n     and mitigation techniques for the activities which they \n     specifically oversee than are FWS biologists?\n       a. If the non-FWS biologists are qualified, why is it \n     necessary to compel mandatory FWS consultation?\n       b. If they are not qualified, what is the justification for \n     their continued employment?\n       4. In science-based decisionmaking, what will be, in \n     substantive detail, the procedural process for moving forward \n     for those occasions when scientific consensus does not exist \n     at the departmental level?\n       5. How will Interior deal with a lack of broad scientific \n     consensus outside of the Administration; i.e. new and \n     independent scientific reports in direct conflict with \n     Interior's scientists?\n       6. Given the reversal of the ESA rule, regarding \n     development of the outer Continental Shelf, does the \n     Department intend to formally consult on the polar bear and \n     listed corals for every scheduled lease sale, exploration \n     plan, and other federal action necessary to advance offshore \n     development?\n       a. If so, what are the minimum and maximum amounts of time \n     that this might take?\n       b. Are you able to show the proximate causal connection \n     between the direct and local effects of oil and gas activity \n     and the species in question?\n       c. Will the consultation requirement be based, in any \n     scenario, on indirect global effects of these activities?\n       7. Is Interior presently conceptualizing, planning, or \n     formalizing any further modifications to or reversals of any \n     of the Bush Administration's ESA rules?\n\n\n          Climate Change and Science-Based Decisions Generally\n\n       8. In the science-based decisions which FWS must make, will \n     scientists and only scientists select from the multiple \n     climate change output models available with an ability to do \n     so independent of political and professional influence and \n     incentives?\n       a. Will Interior commit to a stated policy that such \n     scientists must refrain from basing any part of the selection \n     of climate models upon the model's congruence with the \n     Department's desired administrative outcome?\n       9. In the world of academic research, the difference \n     between a 4% and 7% probability of error can mean the \n     difference of a scientific paper being published or not. But \n     in the world of government science, as with the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, anything above a \n     probability of 66% is ``likely''. Does Interior agree that \n     regulatory decisions affecting real lives and livelihoods \n     ought to be held to and based on a standard commensurate or \n     approximate to those of academic research, or is a 66% \n     likelihood ``close enough for government work''?\n       10. Regardless of the scientific standards, will Interior \n     commit to affording full transparency into, and disclosure \n     of, the uncertainty behind all ``science-based'' decisions?\n       11. What is Interior presently doing to standardize how it \n     interprets uncertainty in scientific analyses?\n       12. Will regulatory decisions, regardless of their economic \n     implications, move forward so long as one of the many climate \n     models suggests an impact has a 66% probability?\n       13. How will Interior balance contradictory evidence of \n     competing climate models and will Interior establish a priori \n     as its preferred model?\n       14. How will Interior avoid post-hoc decisions on which \n     model to choose based on an individual scientist's preferred \n     outcome?\n\n\n OCS Leasing as relates to the 5-Year Plan and 4/17 DC Circuit opinion\n\n       15. Please describe in substantive detail the particular \n     process and timing it will take to remedy the issues cited by \n     the DC Circuit with regard to the 5-year plan?\n       16. Please describe in substantive detail the factors and \n     the criteria Interior will be using to evaluate that it has \n     reached the ``. . . proper balance between the potential for \n     environmental damage, the potential for the discovery of oil \n     and gas, and the potential for adverse impact on the coastal \n     zone''?\n       17. As Interior conducts a more complete comparative \n     analysis of the environmental\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\n     sensitivity of different areas of the outer Continental \n     Shelf, attempting to identify those areas whose environment \n     and marine productivity are most and least sensitive to OCS \n     activity, will you commit to specifically taking into account \n     all existing statutes and regulations that provide for \n     coastal and ocean protection and restoration, and will you \n     presume all of those inherent associated mitigations in your \n     assessment of potential impacts and sensitivities?\n       18. What specific and detailed factors will the Interior \n     Department be weighing in assessing and reconsidering the \n     Leasing Program's relative assessment of the environmental \n     sensitivity and marine productivity of the various planning \n     areas?\n       19. Presuming the eventual advancement of the exploration \n     and development of the Chukchi Sea planning area 193, what \n     specific factors will Interior require and/or take into \n     account in evaluating exploration plans for approval? Please \n     make this list of factors as comprehensive and exhaustive as \n     possible.\n       20. Since the petitioners in the DC Circuit case were \n     focused on the Alaskan areas of the OCS leasing program, will \n     Interior reconsider the entire program or instead make \n     modifications only on those more controversial areas?\n       21. At which individual stage of the Leasing Program, in \n     which Interior is required to conduct additional and more \n     detailed assessments of the Program's potential effect on the \n     proposed leasing areas, does Interior anticipate legal \n     ``ripeness'' for the Center for Biological Diversity to \n     survive threshold challenges to the justiciability of their \n     remaining claims?\n       22. How will you ensure a timely turnaround on these issues \n     given the lack of extensive baseline data for many of the \n     areas?\n\n\n               Gulf of Mexico Leasing and Royalty Relief\n\n       23. Is it within any official or unofficial policy of \n     Interior to support efforts to require companies that paid a \n     premium to acquire 1998 and 1999 leases in the U.S. Gulf of \n     Mexico to now be required by legislation to agree to include \n     price thresholds in the leases they continue to hold as a \n     condition of acquiring additional leases?\n       24. With such major projects as Shenzi and Tahiti now \n     coming on line, does Interior agree with the oil and gas \n     industry's assessment that the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf \n     Deep Water Royalty Relief Act provided an effective mix of \n     incentives to encourage the industry to invest billions of \n     dollars for the benefit of the American consumer? If so, does \n     Interior foresee any potential negative impact upon \n     exploration, development, and production of oil and gas as a \n     result of legislatively changing the terms of the deal struck \n     in 1995?\n       25. In opposing various bills before the Congress last \n     year, the oil and gas industry took the position that the \n     legislation would, if enacted, constitute a breach of \n     contract and an unconstitutional taking of property without \n     compensation under the Fifth Amendment. Does Interior hold a \n     similar view of the contract and constitutional law \n     implications of such a material change in government terms?\n       26. In the 110th Congress, Ambassadors from five allied \n     Nations (Norway, Spain, France, Canada, and Australia) \n     expressed their official opinions in writing about the \n     potential\n\n      negative impact of any legislation to modify the lease \n     terms--including contravention of treaty obligations and \n     violation of numerous international trade agreements. Do \n     you believe the Ambassadors had a reasonable basis for \n     these concerns?\n       a. If Interior considers the concerns of the Ambassadors \n     anything short of reasonable, does Interior anticipate a \n     situation where litigation or legislation may lead to either \n     strained foreign relations or reciprocal treatment of U.S. \n     investments in the corresponding nations?\n       b. If Interior considers the concerns of the Ambassadors to \n     be valid, is it Interior's position that their added \n     complications warrant separate and distinct treatment than \n     domestic companies with similar interests in the Gulf?\n       27. If Congress were to enact legislation comparable to the \n     excise tax proposal put forward last year by the Senate \n     Finance Committee, would you be concerned about the \n     likelihood of litigation and the diversion of the \n     Department's resources with respect to that litigation?\n       28. Now that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit has denied rehearing in the Kerr-McGee litigation, \n     would you consider it reasonable for Members of Congress to \n     oppose any legislation that would now seek royalties from \n     1996-2000 leaseholders on the basis of a price threshold?\n\n\n                          MTR Coal Mining Rule\n\n       29. On December 3, 2008 the Office of Surface Mining \n     Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) issued a final rule \n     clarifying the treatment of excess spoil disposal from coal \n     mining operations after 7 years, 43,000 comments, and 4 \n     public hearings. The rule requires mine operators to avoid \n     disturbing streams to the greatest extent possible and \n     clarifies when mine operators must maintain an undisturbed \n     buffer between a mine and adjacent streams, thereby \n     clarifying a long-standing dispute over how the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 should be applied. \n     Just last week Interior reversed its position on this issue \n     asking the Department of Justice to file a plea with the U.S. \n     District Court requesting that the rule be vacated as \n     ``legally defective.'' Please describe, in substantive \n     detail, the criteria for avoiding the apparent \n     insufficiencies in future rulemakings on this particular \n     issue.\n       a. In reshaping a legally sufficient rule, what specific \n     steps will Interior take to ensure it observes the proper \n     administrative rulemaking process including issuing a draft \n     rule and opening it up for a comment period?\n       b. What specific safeguards does Interior intend to put in \n     place to ensure that this change does not halt or delay coal \n     mining operations, jeopardize jobs, and reduce domestic \n     energy production?\n\n\n                             General Policy\n\n       30. If, at the close of the current four-year Presidential \n     term, America's overall oil production has decreased in terms \n     of pure volume, will Interior consider this fact a success or \n     a failure?\n       31. If, at the close of the current four-year Presidential \n     term, America's overall oil production has decreased as a \n     percentage relative to foreign imports. (e.g. 25% of domestic \n     consumption as opposed to 35% of domestic consumption) will \n     Interior consider this fact a success or a failure?\n       Again, thank you for your time, patience, and prompt \n     attention to these issues and questions. It is my hope that \n     the stated energy intentions of this Administration will \n     begin to track more closely with its day-to-day actions. In \n     the meantime, your careful consideration of this letter ought \n     to help inform the Interior Department's still-forming \n     policy. Your leadership will be critical, and it will be \n     appreciated well into the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lisa Murkowski,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. As I indicated in my initial comments, I am not trying \nto be an obstructionist. In response to DOI's complaints, I have \noffered to sit down with them, in good faith, and go through the \nquestions one by one. The standard I would use would be if any Member \nof this body were to be Secretary of Interior, which of the questions \nwould they have insisted that their staff extensively analyze prior to \ntaking the actions the Department has taken? I do believe my questions \nwill be answered, but it is clear that in the short term, these \nquestions are being answered because of this cloture motion. That \ntroubles me because I believe the Senate, in its role to advise and \nconsent on Presidential nominees, is entitled to answers from the \nadministration about what its policy is as we move forward.\n  It should not matter whether these questions come from Republicans or \nDemocrats. It is reasonable to expect that any one of us in this body \ncan get honest answers about how this administration is going to pursue \nand implement an energy policy.\n  I hoped we would have an opportunity to sit down and go over the \nquestions, but, instead, this morning we are going to see a vote on the \nfloor.\n  My hold on David Hayes didn't come attached with demands to change a \nrule, make a rule, or approve a plan or policy. I just want some \nanswers as to what the administration's policies are going to be. My \ncommitment is to get those answers.\n  Regardless of what happens with this vote today, I am certainly going \nto pursue actively the development of all forms of energy in this \ncountry because we are going to need all of them in high volumes. I do \nlook forward to working in good faith with the Interior Department, \nwhatever its makeup, because we have a lot of work to do. We know that. \nWe need to commit to that level of activity.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, David Hayes is a superbly qualified \nindividual who has been nominated by the President to be the Deputy \nSecretary of the Interior. We know for a fact that he is superbly \nqualified because the Senate has already confirmed him for that exact \noffice once before. That was 9 years ago. He served in that office with \ngreat distinction during the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. Hayes also served as counselor to Secretary Babbitt for several \nyears before being appointed Deputy Secretary. In those roles, he \nhandled many of the most challenging issues facing the Department of \nthe Interior, ranging from the acquisition of the Headwaters redwood \nforest in California, the restoration of the California Bay-Delta \necosystem, the negotiation of habitat conservation plans under the \nEndangered\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nSpecies Act, Indian water rights settlements, and energy development on \nthe public lands.\n  In addition, Mr. Hayes has had a distinguished legal career, focusing \nprimarily on environmental and natural resource matters. He has served \nas a senior fellow for the World Wildlife Fund, a consulting professor \nat Stanford University's Environmental Institute, chairman of the board \nof the Environmental Law Institute, and chairman of the board of \nvisitors for the Stanford Law School.\n  Those of us who know Mr. Hayes and had the opportunity to work with \nhim when he was the Deputy Secretary before know him as a man of great \nknowledge, ability, and integrity, and as someone who strives hard to \nfind constructive, progressive, and consensus solutions to difficult \nenvironmental challenges.\n  But the debate this morning is not really about Mr. Hayes or his \nqualifications for the office to which the President has nominated him. \nIt is about certain actions that have been taken by the Bush \nadministration during its final weeks in office and whether the Obama \nadministration will be allowed to reconsider those actions.\n  During its final weeks, the previous administration took a number of \ncontroversial actions on endangered species, land withdrawals, \nmountaintop mining, and oil-and-gas development. It is no secret that \nin its rush to lock in these actions before it left office, the \nprevious administration didn't give adequate consideration to \nenvironmental concerns and legal requirements. Several of these actions \nhave already been overturned by the courts.\n  Secretary Salazar has inherited this legacy. He is doing his best to \naddress the situation in a fair and balanced way but one that reflects \nthe new administration's commitment to openness and to transparency and \nto strict adherence to the law.\n  Among other things, this has meant having to withdraw 77 oil and gas \nleases issued by the Bush administration in Utah that a Federal court \nhas enjoined because it appears that the previous administration failed \nto comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  It has also meant having to try to salvage the current 5-year plan \nfor oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf after an \nappeals court found that the previous administration had failed to \nfollow legal requirements when it adopted that plan.\n  I can understand why some Senators might be concerned about the new \nadministration reviewing the policy decisions of the previous \nadministration. But what I cannot understand is why they would want to \nobstruct the nomination of David Hayes.\n  No one can seriously question Secretary Salazar's commitment to the \nresponsible use and development of our natural resources or his \ncommitment to protecting the public interest, basing his decisions on \nsound science and complying with the law. But more than 100 days into \nhis tenure, Secretary Salazar remains only one of the two Presidential \nappointees in the Interior Department who has been confirmed by this \nSenate. We need to send him help. We need to confirm David Hayes.\n  The Constitution entrusts this body with the power to advise and \nconsent to the President's nominations. As former majority leader Mike \nMansfield, said:\n\n       Our responsibility is . . . to evaluate the qualifications \n     of the nominee and to record our pleasure or displeasure, to \n     give our advice and consent or our advice and dissent.\n\n  I believe David Hayes is extremely well qualified to be Deputy \nSecretary again. Any fair evaluation of his qualifications on the \nmerits warrants our advice and consent. If Senators wish to dissent, \nthen they should do so, but they should go ahead and invoke cloture so \nwe can vote on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I share the deep concerns about the \ndecision of the Secretary of the Interior not to go forward with \ncancelling certain oil and gas leases. I am afraid this represents yet \nanother action that irrationally reduces America's production thus \nforcing the country to send wealth abroad to purchase oil from foreign \nnations to the detriment of our economy.\n  While I had no particular objection to the nominee, I do believe that \nSenator Bennett and others deserve a complete hearing on their concerns \nand this is why I choose to oppose cloture at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof David Hayes to be Deputy Secretary for the Department of the \nInterior. I think extraordinarily highly of him.\n  At a time when western water issues are at a crisis point, we need \nsomeone with experience and knowledge at the Department of the \nInterior. Many of our great rivers and estuaries are locked in \nconflict, and I can think of no one better than David Hayes to work to \nresolve these issues.\n  He is smart, he is well respected, he gets into the details, and he \ncan close a deal.\n  David Hayes has been nominated for the No. 2 position at the \nDepartment of the Interior. This is an important job. As Deputy \nSecretary, he would work closely with Secretary Salazar and have \nmanagement responsibilities over the entire Department, as well as \npolicy responsibilities over the entire Department.\n  He would have statutory responsibility as the chief operating officer \nto help lead a department of 67,000 employees and an annual budget of \napproximately $16 billion, including annual and permanent funding.\n  The Deputy Secretary is the day-to-day administrative manager of the \nDepartment and an integral part of the policy decisions.\n  His prior experience in the Clinton administration in the job means \nhe can hit the ground running.\n  We need him to be confirmed so we can move on issues like climate \nchange, public lands management, and resolve some of the longstanding \nwater conflicts, including the Bay-Delta in my home State.\n  I believe he has the confidence of Secretary Salazar, and he has my \nconfidence, and I think very highly of him.\n  He has been able to take critical land and water issues and work out \nagreements. His great strength is his ability to negotiate.\n  When it comes to western water, energy, Indian affairs, and many of \nthe other issues that face Interior, having someone who can consult \nwith the key parties and earn their support on a way to move forward is \nessential.\n  David Hayes also was key to resolving a decades-old conflict about \nthe Colorado River.\n  The Quantification Settlement Agreement enabled California to reduce \nits overdependence on the Colorado River to its 4.4 million acre-foot \napportionment over a 15-year grace period and assures California up to \n75 years of stability in its Colorado River water supplies.\n  Without the agreement, California risked being suddenly cut off from \nthe excess of almost 5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water it had \nbeen taking, instead of having 15 years to get there.\n  David Hayes was instrumental in working out the Headwaters Agreement, \nwhich converted 75,000 acres of the largest private old-growth redwood \ngrove to the public lands, protected forever.\n  David Hayes worked very hard to bring the parties together and \nnegotiate a path forward for the timber company on its remaining lands \nand to preserve the old-growth redwoods--a large, virtually untouched \ntract land with 1,000- and 2,000-year-old trees.\n  David Hayes also worked on the historic Cal-Fed agreement, which \naffected the urban environmental and agricultural needs of the entire \nCalifornia Bay Delta region. We are again in crisis, and we need him \nback to help resolve it.\n  All of these were difficult and sophisticated agreements which needed \nthe determined and steady hand that David Hayes provided. Time and \nagain he was able to bring people together behind a broadly agreeable \nplan.\n  David Hayes has been well respected since his days at Stanford Law \nSchool in the late seventies, where he was recognized for his \noutstanding editorial contributions to the Stanford Law Review.\n  He has a long and distinguished career in private practice, which has \nalways focused on environmental, energy, and natural resources matters\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nand the interconnectedness between the three.\n  From 1997 to 1999, David Hayes served as the counselor to the \nSecretary of the Interior, and from 1999 to 2001, he served in the very \nposition that we are considering him for here today.\n  So there is no doubt that he is extremely well qualified to fill this \nposition.\n  David Hayes is well positioned to negotiate the many complex issues \nthat face the Department of the Interior today, including the proposed \nremoval of dams on the Klamath River, the development of renewable \nenergy and conservation of the deserts, and the management and \nconservation of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta for \nhabitat restoration and water supply goals.\n  I know that there are some who believe that one cannot understand the \nWest without being from the West. I can only say that there is no one \nwhom I know of who is a candidate for this office who brings more \nexperience in western issues than David Hayes. He is really \nunparalleled in the arena of Federal officials.\n  I believe he would be a real asset to the administration, and I hope \nyou will join me in supporting him. I urge my colleagues to vote to \nconfirm David Hayes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nconfirming David Hayes to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Mr. \nHayes is supremely qualified--he has in fact held this exact position \nbefore, in the Clinton administration. He has an impressive track \nrecord of handling controversial issues and doing so by building \nconsensus among diverse constituencies.\n  He has successfully used this approach with some of the most pressing \nissues facing our western states. He worked closely with Senator Jon \nKyl and a range of water and environmental interests to negotiate the \nframework for the Arizona Water Settlements Act--a historic settlement \nof water rights disputes involving municipal, agricultural and tribal \nwater users in the State of Arizona. There are pressing water rights \nissues in the West and across the Nation that need resolution today.\n  In addition, he worked with Senator Dianne Feinstein to negotiate the \nacquisition and protection of the old-growth redwood Headwaters Forest \nin northern California, along with an accompanying habitat conservation \nagreement that continues to protect endangered salmon and bird \npopulations on 200,000 acres of adjacent, privately held forest lands \nin northern California. There are pressing needs to resolve forest \nmanagement issues today--to protect old-growth habitat while restoring \nforest health and creating jobs in our forests.\n  We need Mr. Hayes on the job.\n  Over the last 4 months, Secretary Salazar has faced a difficult task \nof cleaning up the mess the previous administration left at the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  The American people remember the Department of the Interior under the \nBush administration as a Department where ``anything goes.'' It is the \nDepartment the American people associate with Jack Abramoff. It is the \nDepartment where agency employees were serving the oil companies \ninstead of the public. And it is the Department where the former \nassistant secretary in charge of fish and wildlife tampered with the \nscience behind Endangered Species Act decisions.\n  Again and again, the courts have thrown out the decisions of the Bush \nadministration Interior Deparment because they didn't pass the smell \ntest.\n  Last month, for example, a Federal court vacated the entire 5-year \nplan for oil and gas leasing because the Bush administration didn't do \nthe environmental review properly. So Secretary Salazar and the Obama \nInterior Department have had to go back to the court and ask for \npermission to fix it, so that current oil and gas activities aren't \ndisrupted by the bad judgment of the previous administration.\n  Before that, a court in Utah froze last-minute leases that the Bush \nadministration had granted near Arches and Canyonlands National Parks \nbecause the Park Service hadn't been consulted. So Secretary Salazar \nand the Obama Interior Department have had to go back and review the \nleases, one by one, to see if any of them are appropriate for \ndevelopment.\n  It is not a matter of politics in the decisions the Interior \nDepartment is making, it is a matter of fixing broken processes and \nrestoring the trust of the American people in the Department that \nmanages one-fifth of the Nation's landmass and 1.7 billion acres off \nthe coasts.\n  And Secretary Salazar is taking the decisions one by one.\n  Where Interior is finding good decisions from the Bush \nadministration, they are keeping them in place. Where they are broken, \nthey are fixing them. And when they can't be fixed, they are going back \nto the drawing board.\n  Not everyone in this--chamber will agree with every decision that the \nInterior Department will make. But wouldn't it be a breath of fresh air \nto see Interior following the rules; fixing problems; making decisions \nbased on the public interest, the best scientific data available, and \nthe rule of law.\n  David Hayes has served his country under the Clinton administration \nas Deputy Sacretary of the Interior, and served well. He earned a \nreputation as a problem solver--as someone who will listen and find \ncommon ground.\n  He will help our Nation tackle the complex natural resource \nchallenges we face. There is much work to be done--on water rights, on \nforest health, on a number of critical issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Mr. Hayes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nlong list of nominees for the Obama administration who are being held \nup by the Republican Party of the Senate. The Republican Party has been \ncharacterized now as a ``party of no.'' It is a phrase we have been \nhearing a lot. Consistently, when President Obama has reached out in a \nbipartisan fashion to ask the Republicans to join him in changing the \nculture in Washington, in addressing the major issues of our day, in \nworking with him to find compromise legislation, the answer has almost \nexclusively been ``no, not interested.''\n  Why? Because despite our best efforts to work together, we have been \nmet at every turn by a Republican negative response. Now the party of \nno--the Republicans in the Senate--has decided to filibuster the \nnomination of David Hayes to be the No. 2 person in the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  You must think that is a pretty controversial position, right? \nSenators on the Republican side, who have made long speeches against \nfilibustering nominees, are breaking their word and now initiating \nthese filibusters. This must be some red-hot controversial position \nthat this man is clearly unqualified to fill. That is not the case.\n  The Deputy Secretary of the Interior manages the day-to-day operation \nof the Department of the Interior and works closely with the Secretary \non key policy decisions.\n  David Hayes's previous 2-year tenure in the same position as Deputy \nSecretary of the Interior and his career of experience give him the \nknowledge and ability to immediately hit the ground running in this \ndemanding position.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, a former Member of this \nbody, personally reached out to the Republican side of the aisle, \ntelling them he needs to have David Hayes confirmed to make headway on \nthe administration's and the Nation's priorities, including renewable \nenergy production on Federal lands, the effects of climate change on \nthe natural landscape, and reengagement in the resolution of \nchallenging water issues.\n  David Hayes has a long track record of negotiating solutions to \ndifficult natural resource issues and working cooperatively with \nMembers of Congress.\n  When he was Deputy Secretary under the Clinton administration, he \nworked closely with the Republican whip, Senator John Kyl of Arizona, \non a range of water and environmental interests to negotiate the \nframework for the Arizona Water Settlements Act.\n  He worked with Senator Feinstein, on the Democratic side, to \nnegotiate\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nthe acquisition and protection of old-growth redwood Headwaters Forest \nin northern California.\n  He partnered with Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana to secure Land \nand Water Conservation Fund monies to preserve bayou lands in \nLouisiana.\n  This man has experience. He has worked with both sides of the aisle. \nHe has 30 years of experience in natural resources and environmental \nlaw, with special expertise in resolving complicated issues. \nApparently, 30 years of experience, having held the same job, and \nhaving worked with both sides of the aisle is not good enough for the \nparty of no.\n  On May 6, Senator Murkowski sent a letter to Secretary Salazar \nraising concerns about the decisions the administration has made in the \nlast few months. The three issues are revisions that the administration \nhas proposed to the Endangered Species Act, regulations relating to \nfuture leases in offshore drilling, and the administration's withdrawal \nof 77 oil and gas leases in Utah.\n  Senator Bennett, who is on the Senate floor, continues to object to \nthe administration's withdrawal of 77 oil and gas leases. These leases \nwere withdrawn as a result of a court-ordered injunction, and they are \ncurrently under review by the Department.\n  They are blaming David Hayes for this? Blame the court for this. Give \nthis man a chance to serve our country.\n  Well, he is not the only nominee held up by the party of no in the \nSenate. This year, 17 nominees have had to wait and wait and wait for a \nrollcall vote to be confirmed. In most years, these nominees would have \nbeen approved by unanimous consent. Not this year.\n  Apparently, the Republicans in the Senate don't believe that \nPresident Obama has a mandate to lead this country. They are \nchallenging his assemblage of a team of people to make this Federal \nGovernment run more efficiently and effectively. This year, the \nRepublican minority demanded rollcall vote after rollcall vote on what \nwere routine appointments by the Obama administration. They would \nthreaten filibusters, force 2 and 3 days of delay, require a 60-vote \nmargin, and then what happened?\n  Here is one of the controversial nominees. Listen to his vote. Gil \nKerlikowske, nominated to be Director of National Drug Control Policy, \nwas held up, debated, and threatened. His confirmation vote was 91 to \n1. Thomas Strickland, nominated to be Assistant Secretary for Fish and \nWildlife, Department of the Interior, was confirmed 89 to 2. Kathleen \nSebelius, nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, was \nconfirmed 65 to 31. Christopher Hill, Ambassador to Iraq, confirmed 73 \nto 23; Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, confirmed 82 to 4; Lanny \nBreuer, Assistant Attorney General, confirmed 88 to 0; Christine Anne \nVarney, Assistant Attorney General, confirmed 87 to 1; David Kris, \nAssistant Attorney General, confirmed 97 to 0.\n\n  They made us wait for days and weeks and months to bring these names \nup before the Senate because of the controversy, and listen to the \nvotes: 97 to 0, 87 to 1, 88 to 0. This isn't about the nominee. This \nisn't about controversy. This is about slowing down the assembly of \nPresident Obama's team to bring real change to Washington. That is what \nthis resistance to David Hayes is about as well.\n  This list goes on. I won't read them all. I will put them in the \nRecord. But to put this in historical context, at the start of 2001, \nwhen the Senate was controlled by the President's party until May 24, \nthere wasn't a single filibuster of a nomination. The Democratic \nminority didn't filibuster a single Bush nominee at the start of 2001. \nThis time, we have had to file cloture six times because of threatened \nfilibusters. The following nominees were at least initially \nfilibustered and required a cloture motion: David Ogden, Austan \nGoolsbee, Cecilia Rouse, and Hilda Solis, for the sole and exclusive \npurpose of slowing down the assembly of President Obama's \nadministration so there could be an effective and efficient handing \nover of power.\n  These Senate Republicans are still negotiating the last election. \nThey want another chance at it. Well, the American people had their \nday. On November 4 of last year, they elected a new President and asked \nhim to do his best to lead our Nation in troubled times. Sadly, the \nRepublican Party that lost that election will not face the reality that \nthis President needs a team of skilled professionals to stand by him \nand deal with the real challenges we face in this country. They are \nslowing down and stopping nominations of well-qualified people who, \nwhen they are ultimately called to the floor for a vote, get \noverwhelming rollcall support.\n  We have surpassed the number of cloture motions filed on nominations \nduring President Bush's entire first term--four. When President Reagan \nwas elected, in a landslide, a Democratically controlled Senate worked \nwith him to confirm his nominees. So far, the Senate has confirmed 104 \nObama nominations. At the same point in 1981, with President Reagan and \na Democratic Congress, it confirmed 125 Reagan nominations. The largest \ngap between nominations and confirmations during this point in the \nReagan administration was 71. The largest gap between nominations and \nconfirmations during the Obama administration is 124, a number reached \nlast week.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican delay is not likely to end soon. There \nare currently 18 nominees sitting on the Executive Calendar. By our \ncount, there are almost 12 holds on the Republican side of the aisle. A \ncouple of them are worth noting. Senator John Kerry's brother, Cam \nKerry, a well-qualified man, has been nominated to be general counsel \nof the Department of Commerce, but the Republicans have refused to move \nhis nomination, with no stated reason, no objection to this good man. \nRegina McCarthy, to be Assistant Administrator of the EPA for Air and \nRadiation, has been held up because two Senators want her to repudiate \nthe administration's position on climate change.\n  Once again, they want to renegotiate the November 4 election. Many of \nthe holdups are the result of Republicans asking for policy changes to \nreinstate George W. Bush policies. Didn't we have an election to decide \nthat?\n  The nomination of David Hayes is an example. The holds have nothing \nto do with him. The Republicans holding up his nomination simply want \nto reinstate George W. Bush-era policies. They long for those good old \ndays under President George W. Bush. They are going to resist change, \nresist this President, and hold up as many people as they can that he \nneeds to be a success.\n  Well, elections have consequences. Americans voted for change. But \nthe party of no is holding up the President's agents of change. I urge \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle to change their approach \nand to work with us to confirm a well-qualified man and much-needed \nperson, David Hayes, and the rest of the Obama administration's \nnominations.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet of Colorado). There is 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I am sorry, I withdraw that. I see Senator Bennett is on his feet.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the assistant Democratic leader if he would \nrespond to a single question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me do this: I want to yield 1 of our 4 minutes to the \nSenator from Utah, and then I will respond.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my colleague.\n  I have listened with interest to the comments of my friend from \nIllinois--and we use that term loosely around here, but he really is my \nfriend--and I would simply like to add this one historical postscript: \nTwo of the Deputy Secretaries for Interior were held up by Democratic \nholds in the Bush administration, one for 6 months and one for 8 \nmonths, both on issues I consider to be less significant than the issue \nI have discussed here today. Senators have a right to get answers to \ntheir questions\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\nbefore they make their confirmation votes, as demonstrated by the \nDemocratic Senators who held up these two Deputy Secretaries. My hold \nof this Deputy Secretary for Interior is nowhere near the amount of \ntime Democrats used when they were holding them up. I would like that \nhistoric footnote added to the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge what my colleague said, and \nI don't dispute it. I don't recall those particular deputies or their \nnames, but I certainly don't question the facts he has given.\n  How can you look at David Hayes for this spot, after 30 years of \nexperience, after having held the job before, after actively working \nwith Republicans and Democrats to resolve contentious issues, and say \nthis man is not qualified for the job? I don't get it. I am waiting for \nthe smoking gun to come out. What is this explosive issue that the \nRepublicans know that would hold up this nomination, and they can't \ncome up with it?\n  Unfortunately, it is part of a pattern. This isn't just about David \nHayes, it is about another 18 names sitting on our calendar here--18 \nnames of individuals who are willing to give up their private careers, \nwilling to come to work here in Washington, sometimes for a cut in pay, \nunder difficult circumstances, to serve this new administration and try \nto change this country. They make the commitment, they get the decision \nby the family, they come forward, they go through the nomination \nprocess, they fill out reams of paper, they sit through the committees \nand finally get approved by the committees, they get on the calendar, \nand what happens, usually? Not in this case because Senator Bennett has \nbeen very public about his opposition. Usually it is an anonymous hold \nby some Republican Senator, fearful of using his name publicly, who \nwill hold up the nomination indefinitely. These poor people languish on \nthis calendar. I commend Senator Bennett for standing up and stating \nhis opposition. Although I don't agree with it, at least he has had the \ncourage to come forward. That is not the case on many of these.\n  This is the pattern that is emerging: Slow things down, force us to a \nvote, and when the vote finally comes, it is an overwhelming vote in \nfavor of the nominee. The sole purpose is to try to stop the new Obama \nadministration from putting in place the team they need to bring real \nchange to America. President Obama said repeatedly during his campaign \nthat real change is hard to come by, that it takes time and there will \nbe people who will fight it every step of the way. We are seeing one of \nthose battles on the floor of the Senate today when it comes to David \nHayes.\n  For goodness' sake, give President Obama and Secretary Salazar the \npeople they need to be successful in the Department of the Interior. I \nurge my colleagues to support the cloture motion and to move this \nnomination forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nconfirming David Hayes to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Mr. \nHayes is supremely qualified. He has, in fact, held this exact position \nbefore in the Clinton administration. He has an impressive track record \nof handling controversial issues and doing so by building consensus \namong diverse constituencies. He has successfully used this approach a \nnumber of times working in our Western States. He worked closely with \nthe Senator from Arizona on a range of water and environmental \ninterests and negotiated the framework for the Arizona Water \nSettlements Act, a historic settlement of water rights disputes \ninvolving municipal, agricultural, and tribal water users in the State \nof Arizona. And that is no small matter. You know, they say in the West \nthat whiskey is for talking, but water, that is for fighting. That is \nhow important it is, that is how difficult it is, and it took a good \nman like this to bring diverse interests together to solve those \nproblems and move forward.\n  In addition, Mr. Hayes worked with Senator Feinstein to negotiate the \nacquisition and protection of old-growth redwood Headwaters Forest.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we have a strong, affirmative vote to fill \nout the Department of the Interior and put it to work on the issues \nfacing our Nation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     David J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of David J. Hayes, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nthe Interior shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 57, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 189 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Mikulski\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n39. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having not voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the David Hayes \nnomination be considered entered by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the \nvote today on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of David \nHayes to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior because I was attending a \nfuneral. If I were able to attend today's session, I would have \nsupported cloture on the Hayes nomination.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to expand on my vote in favor of Mr. \nDavid Hayes to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. It is my \nunderstanding that Senator Bennett has requested answers to a series of \nsubstantive questions regarding the Department of the Interior's \ndecision to withdraw 77 parcels in Utah from an oil and gas lease sale. \nI strongly believe that it is the prerogative of any Member of the \nSenate to have his or her questions answered in detail, especially \nconcerning an issue relevant to their home State. I further understand \nthat the Secretary of the Interior has indicated\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nthat there will be a thorough review of the administrative record \nconcerning the 77 lease parcels and the Department will provide a \nreport with recommendations by May 29, 2009. I believe that this is a \nreasonable path forward on the issues at this time. With that said, if \nSenator Bennett's questions are not sufficiently addressed by that \ndate, I reserve my right to object to future executive nominations to \nthe Department of the Interior. I look forward to successful resolution \nof Senator Bennett's concerns.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement by Senator Landrieu of 4 minutes, the Senate resume \nlegislative session and resume consideration of H.R. 627.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would amend that unanimous consent \nrequest. I wish to amend that to allow 5 minutes for the Senator from \nLouisiana, and 5 minutes for Senator Crapo, and then the Senate resume \nlegislative session and resume consideration of H.R. 627; and at that \npoint, Senator Menendez be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes in \nreference to the vote we just had. I cast my vote for the nominee, \nbased on not only his experience with the Department, but based on my \nconfidence in the Secretary that the President has appointed to help \nlead this country to a position of energy security, a position we do \nnot enjoy at this very moment.\n  Despite the work that has been done here and on the other side of the \nCapitol in the last couple of years, despite the rhetoric of several \ndecades, we do not enjoy energy security. We have environmental issues, \nbut we have security issues.\n  I wanted to express this, because there was obviously some hesitancy \nabout this nominee based on an issue, I believe, involving domestic oil \nand gas production. That is what this vote was about, not about this \npersonal nominee.\n  This was a vote to express concern, which I share to some degree, \nthat this administration has not positioned itself appropriately and \naggressively enough in the area of domestic energy production, of \ntraditional as well as alternative and new sources.\n  Here I want to express that while I voted yes on this nominee, that I \nplan, and Members on the Republican and Democratic side plan, to be \nmore vocal in expressing our concern to this administration that the \ntax proposals on the oil and gas industry are not going to create jobs. \nWe are going to lose jobs, 1.8 million.\n  While we move to alternative fuels, we are turning our back on \ntraditional natural gas, which is plentiful, which makes money for lots \nof people, which secures America, strengthens our industry and creates \njobs.\n  So this was a vote to indicate an unsettling on this floor, both from \nthe Republican side and among some Democrats, that this issue needs to \nbe addressed more directly and more aggressively.\n  I have all the confidence, as I close, in Secretary Salazar. He \nserved right here with us a few years ago. I know he seeks a balance. \nSo I trust that we will start seeing some aggressive comments coming \nout from the administration as we push forward to keep leasing up in \nthe gulf off the coast of Alaska, opening up Virginia, other parts of \nthe Continental Shelf, as well as the plentiful gas in your own State, \nand in places such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, where our industries are \ndesperate for this cheap, clean energy source.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish first to indicate to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana that I agree with her comments. I think the last time I \ngot up to speak on this energy issue she was here on the floor as well. \nI share her sentiments about the need for us to continue to focus on \ndeveloping a rational national energy policy for our Nation.\n  On July 30 last year, I stood before this body to talk about the No. \n1 issue in the country to the people at that time: energy. Gasoline \nprices were over $4 a gallon and surging, and Americans were wondering \nwhat their leaders in Washington, DC, were going to do to help. I place \ntremendous faith in the opinions and ideas of Idahoans. So in early \nJuly I asked my constituents to write to me and tell me what they \nthought we ought to do and to describe to me what the impact of our \nfailure to have a reasonable national energy policy was having on their \nlives. Then I made a promise that I would submit their stories to the \nCongressional Record, a process I vowed to continue until all of their \nstories had been submitted. In total, I received over 1,200 responses \nfrom my State, 600 almost overnight. It has taken me nearly 10 months \nto get all of these stories entered into the Congressional Record due \nto the requirements of the Congressional Record limitations as to how \nmuch can be submitted each day.\n  Today I submit the last of those stories, and I want to share with \nyou what we have learned. I received touching stories from Idahoans \nabout how they have been negatively impacted by higher energy prices, \nand the stories indicate that high energy prices had impacted every \naspect of their lives. Idahoans had to cut back on family time. Many \nwere unable to visit elderly relatives and had to cut back on family \nactivities together outside of the home such as sports or music \nlessons. But those were just some of the less serious challenges Idaho \nfamilies faced. Many had to cut back on their home repairs, their air \nconditioning, and their contributions to their retirements plans. Many \nhad to make a decision between whether to eat food or to pay for the \ngasoline they needed to get to their work and keep their job or to \npurchase needed medications.\n  I can remember one story of a young mother telling me how she and her \nhusband had started eating much less so that their children could have \nenough to eat, and they could still have enough gasoline each week to \nget to work and keep their jobs.\n  Many of their stories were heart wrenching. Many talked about losing \ntheir jobs and being forced to relocate or to make decisions between, \nas I indicated, purchasing gas or eating their next meal. Many reduced \ntheir expenses, cut their luxuries and found ways to economize. But the \ndramatic increase we experienced last year brought Idaho families, as \nmany in other States, to their knees asking for help.\n  They offered explanations about what has happened and offered links \nto various publications and videos they found helpful. They attached \nphotos of their circumstances. They sent legislative resolutions from \nnational, State and local entities to remind us that other legislators \naround the country were interested in finding solutions to this issue \nas well. Many of them have spent a lot of time and energy on this \nsubject, researching energy options and sharing their opinions on what \nthey have learned. They offered solutions. My constituents suggested we \nneed more conservation, that we need more domestic drilling. They \nwanted more public transportation and more nuclear power options. They \npushed for additional renewable and alternative energy sources and \nresearch.\n  In short, they came through with the kind of common sense that people \nall across this country have been sharing with this Congress on the \nneed for energy solutions. They want us to be less dependent on \npetroleum, and they want us to be less dependent on foreign sources of \nthis petroleum. They want us to have a broad, diverse energy base of \nrenewable and alternative fuels, including strong support for nuclear \npower. But above all, they were angry at Congress for not dealing with \nthe issue of high energy prices. They couldn't believe the country had \nbeen through an energy crisis before but that Congress still has not \nmanaged the issue and come up with a solution. Idahoans expressed \nfrustration with partisan politics and the inability to move past the \nage-old arguments and reach consensus on a comprehensive energy policy. \nMany said they were grateful I had asked for their thoughts.\n  I come before the Senate to echo my constituents' comments and \nconcerns about our energy policy and to offer solutions. As I stand \nbefore the Senate, we are no closer to a comprehensive energy policy \nthan we were last July. Yet\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\neconomic indicators point to a rally in crude oil prices. Oil is now \nabove $58 a barrel and gas prices are the highest they have been in 6 \nmonths. We don't need a repeat of last summer. We need to work together \nto craft a comprehensive energy policy that promotes domestic security \nand creates American jobs while providing energy at the lowest cost \npossible to consumers.\n  The key to the energy future is to take a balanced approach that \nincludes domestic production, conservation, renewables, nuclear, and \nalternative fuel development.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by repeating my constituents' \ndesire for the kind of bipartisanship that can transform this country's \nenergy policy. I welcome the opportunity to work with all my colleagues \non this issue. I encourage us not to a get into another energy crisis \nsuch as we faced last summer, with Congress having failed to take the \nimportant steps it can to help America become energy independent and a \nstrong supplier of its own energy resources.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5409-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we see gathering clouds in this economic \nstorm and those clouds are credit card debt. At the very same time that \nit is becoming harder to get new credit, Americans have almost a \ntrillion dollars of credit card debt outstanding. Defaults are rising \nand delinquencies are at a 6-year high. It is clear this isn't only a \nquestion of consumers overspending. Credit card companies are trying to \nboost their profit with deceptive practices and making the situation \nworse. People are seeing so much of their paychecks eaten up by late \nfees, over-the-limit fees, and interest payments that today companies \ncan unilaterally increase at any time. Credit card companies are \npushing cards on college students who can't afford them and teenagers \nare winding up with a lifetime of debt.\n  Companies are raising interest rates on consumers and customers who \nhave a perfect record with their credit card but miss a payment with \nsome other creditor. Maybe worst of all, if you have a credit card, \nchances are there is a line in the fine print that says the company can \nchange the rules at any time. Considering some of the changes companies \nhave made already, who knows what they could do tomorrow.\n  I have heard from thousands of people in New Jersey who feel their \ncredit card contracts are booby-trapped, that their credit card \nagreements conceal all kinds of trapdoors behind a layer of fine print. \nTake one false step and your credit rating plummets and your interest \nrate shoots through the roof.\n  These are the same kinds of stories we started hearing as the \nforeclosure crisis began. Right now there is nothing stopping credit \ncard companies from doing this to consumers--no law, no level playing \nfield, no protection for the average American, no way to get the kind \nof fair treatment we expect as a matter of common sense.\n  When some people see that their interest rate has shot through the \nroof for no apparent reason, they call and plead with their companies \nfor help, but their fate lies solely in the hands of the credit card \ncompanies. If the companies don't want to help, they are out of luck \nand stuck with an even bigger mountain of debt. Meanwhile, credit card \ncompanies are still making multibillion-dollar profits. This isn't just \nimpacting the lives of individual Americans and families trying to make \nends meet; it has major ramifications for the entire economy.\n  One of our major economic challenges right now is getting credit \nflowing again but not at the high price credit card companies are \nimposing. The economy is never going to get running at full speed again \nif consumers can't get their bearings because they have fallen behind \non a payment treadmill that credit card companies keep speeding up. If \nthere is any time to end deceptive practices and level the playing \nfield, it is now.\n  Credit card reform is something I have been calling for since I set \nfoot in the Senate. In 2006, one of the first pieces of legislation I \nintroduced was an effort to reform credit card practices. Even then it \nwas clear credit card debt was a looming problem that had the potential \nto wreak havoc on American families unless we achieved commonsense \nreforms. If there is one thing we have learned from this economic \ncrisis, it is that we can't wait for a dangerous situation to reach \nfull-blown crisis proportions before we act.\n\n  This Congress, as I have done for several Congresses, I introduced \nthe Credit Card Reform Act to tackle essentially the same issues this \ncurrent bill deals with, including banning retroactive rate increases, \nprotecting young consumers from being sucked into the cycle of debt, \nreasonably tying fees to costs, and prohibiting unilateral changes to \nagreements.\n  We have $1 trillion collective debt in credit cards. That is how big \nthis issue is. I am proud to see Chairman Dodd's credit card reform \nbill includes many of the provisions I included in my bill and have \nchampioned for years. His leadership is what has brought us to the \nfloor today. I included in my bill many of those provisions, and we \nhave championed them together.\n  Though in some cases I would like to see different provisions that I \nthink would make for stronger legislation, I still look forward to \nworking with the chairman on one or two of those. But this bill \nrepresents one of the strongest, most comprehensive efforts yet to end \nsome of the most egregious practices of credit card issuers, while \nmaking sure that Americans young and old don't fall so easily into \nfinancial traps.\n  The principle behind this bill is simple: Companies should be clear \nabout the rules upfront, and they should not change them in the middle \nof the game. The bill says, similar to a provision I have been pushing, \nif companies want to change the terms of credit card agreements, they \nhave to give reasonable notice before they do so. It will end an \nindustry practice known as universal default on existing credit \nbalances so companies don't raise interest rates on customers' \noutstanding debt when they have a perfect record with that credit card \nbut maybe miss a payment by a few days with some other creditor.\n  I called for this in my bill, and I am proud to see Chairman Dodd has \nit in his. I am also proud he included a provision I called for in my \nbill to make sure that when fees are imposed, they are reasonably tied \nto the original violation or omission that triggered the fee, not just \nthe companies' desire to increase profits.\n  This bill will discourage the bait-and-switch tactics behind the \npreapproved offers that almost every American consumer has seen come \ninto their mailbox, an idea I also put forward strongly in my own bill. \nWhen you get a card offer, the offer should be real. The terms should \nnot be so good to be true that it fades away once you apply for the \ncard. This legislation will provide recourse for consumers, if a card \nissuer tries a sleight of hand and changes the terms in the fine print.\n  One of the things I have been focused on--and I am glad to see it in \nthis\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nbill--will protect young consumers from credit card solicitations they \ndidn't ask for. I am convinced, having seen my own children, when they \nwere in college and studying but not working, get an incredible number \nof preapproved credit cards, I could stack them this high, or my State \ndirector's 2-year-old who got a preapproved credit card, if you have a \nSocial Security number and a pulse that, in fact, you can get a credit \ncard.\n  I am proud this bill includes a provision that says people under 21 \ncan proactively opt in to receive credit offers, but they will no \nlonger will be lured into deals unless the decision is their own. It \nwould also ensure that when college students do opt in and apply for a \ncredit card, they prove that they or a cosigner can actually make the \npayments on that debt before they get that card. That is something I \neven think should be considered more broadly, ability to pay as a \nfundamental essence.\n  This way we don't get people on the march of bad debt, bad credit, \nand all the consequences that flow therefrom. For far too many people, \ncredit card debt is already a personal financial crisis. If we don't \nact soon, it could grow to become a national financial crisis. Already \nthere is a trillion dollars in collective debt. We cannot allow \npredatory and deceptive practices in the industry to continue as we did \nin the subprime mortgage market. We cannot allow the credit card \nproblem to become the next foreclosure crisis.\n  When it comes down to it, this legislation is about trust. At a time \nwe have seen financial institutions fail, either fail to be profitable \nor just fail to be honest, it is clear that restoring trust by ending \ndeceptive practices is good for everyone. People are not demanding too \nmuch, just rules that are fair, understandable, and don't change in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  It is time we give individual consumers the tools to level the \nplaying field when it comes to dealing with credit card companies. This \nlegislation is about creating a trustworthy financial system, restoring \nsome commonsense rules of the road, and stabilizing our economy by \nmaking it possible for consumers to get their footing.\n  At the end of the day, that is in the interest of all Americans. Now \nit is time to act because, similar to the debt on our credit cards, if \nwe keep putting this problem off month after month, it is only going to \nget worse.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman to pass this bill, making \nit as strong as possible and making sure it becomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I commend my chairman, the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, for his work on the legislation before us \ntoday. This has been a complex issue. The chairman has worked very hard \nto bring people together on all sides. I commend also the senior \nSenator from Alabama for his vital engagement on these reforms that \ntouch the wallet or the pocketbook of virtually every American. America \nneeds credit card reform.\n  Take the case of Maggie Bagon, a 59-year-old social worker from \nSalem, OR. As reported in the Oregonian, Maggie used her card \nconservatively. She paid her bills on time. So she was incensed when \nher credit card company charged her a late fee.\n  So she called up the bank. They told her the terms of her contract \npermitted them to sit on her payment for 10 days before they posted it \nto her account, and that made it feasible--in fact, lawful--for them to \ncharge her a late fee when she paid her bill early.\n  That type of practice is a scam. Maggie and thousands of Oregonians, \nperhaps millions of Americans, have been charged late fees for paying \ntheir credit cards early. That kind of deception and trickery has to \nend.\n  Late fees for early payments is not the only type of scam we have had \nin this industry. How about interest charges on balances that have been \npaid off? Well, you have paid it off, and you are very happy about \nthat. You are now free of interest? No, you are not--not under the \nrules of the fine print in many credit card agreements.\n  How about fees for going over the limit when you do not know you are \nover the limit? Well, it used to be you were simply turned down and \nthat was fine because that was the deal you had and you understood the \ndeal. But now suddenly you get your credit card statement, and you find \nout you were charged a $30 fee when you bought a newspaper with a \ncredit card or you were charged a $30 fee when you bought a $5 meal \nwith your credit card because the bank was not going to tell you about \nthe fee because they wanted to collect those fees for going over the \nlimit.\n  Well, this act will fix that problem, that type of scam on the \nAmerican worker. In fact, credit card companies have even charged fees \nfor making your payments at all. Some charge fees for paying with a \ncheck. Some charge fees for paying over the Internet. Some charge fees \nfor paying by telephone. That is simply crazy, and this act will \naddress these types of tricks and traps that have become key and \ncentral to the industry.\n  As a member of the Oregon House of Representatives and as speaker, I \nworked with my colleagues to reform lending practices in our home \nState. We tried to address credit card practices to establish fair \nrules of the road, and our legal counsel said: No, you can't do that \nhere at the State level. You have to do that at the Federal level. It \nis federally preempted. So we were not able to help people such as \nMaggie, the citizens of our State, have fair practices. Only the \nFederal Government, under Federal law, can make these changes.\n  But if we all have reserved to ourselves the power to set fair \npractices, then we have a moral obligation to set those fair practices. \nWe have an obligation on behalf of the millions of American citizens \nsuch as Maggie. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  It is strong, commonsense legislation which targets the most abusive \npractices. In particular, I am proud it prohibits ``universal default'' \non existing balances--that bait-and-switch tactic when, under the deal \nyou have signed up for, you are charged 7 percent, but after you make \nthose charges, your interest rate is suddenly switched to 29 percent.\n  I am proud this bill requires that payments beyond the minimum \nmonthly payment be applied to the balances with the highest rate of \ninterest.\n  I am proud this bill limits the aggressive solicitation of young \npersons; that it prohibits fees based on the method of payment, be it \ntelephone, mail, Internet or otherwise; that it prohibits over-the-\nlimit fees unless a person opts in to that feature--it is a fair deal, \nyou choose it--and that it prohibits late fees if the card issuer \ndelayed posting the payment.\n  These long-overdue, commonsense reforms are important steps to bring \ntransparency and fairness to credit card contracts. These reforms will \nhelp Maggie and millions such as her from Connecticut to Oregon and \neverywhere in between.\n  Friends, this legislation is also good for our banking system. There \nis one clear lesson we have learned this year; that is, fair lending \nresults in families who are on a solid foundation, strong consumers, \nand it avoids the sort of securitization that results in poison pills \nbeing based on fraudulent, deceptive practices, poison pills that \ninfect our banks and financial institutions around the world.\n  Even the banks are aware this system is flawed, and some have tried \nto offer better, safer cards. But they found it hard to differentiate \nthemselves. Why is that? Well, here is why. It is pretty \nstraightforward. Consumers do not have the time or patience to read the \ndozens of pages of fine print that come in a credit card contract and \nthen to compare its terms--and be able to evaluate its terms--to the \ndozens of pages that come with another credit card.\n  But even if a person dedicated a week of their life to comparing two \ncredit card contracts, it would not matter because, at the end of the \ncontract, it says: These terms can be changed at the discretion of the \ncredit card company at any time. And they are changed frequently. \nTherefore, the contract does not give you the ability to compare and \ncontrast. Therefore, we have a dysfunctional market because consumers \nare not able to choose better cards with better practices.\n  We need to create a functional market where there is competition--\ncompetition not based on how many tricks\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nand traps you can insert into the fine print but competition based on \nvalue, based on good interest rates, based on fair fees, and based on \ngood, old-fashioned consumer service.\n  Friends and colleagues, this legislation is fundamentally about \nfairness. It is long overdue. Our citizens deserve fair contracts on \ncredit. It makes our families stronger. It makes our national financial \nsystem stronger.\n  I certainly commend Senator Dodd for his 20 years of labor, day in \nand day out, to reform these practices. I commend President Obama for \nhis leadership on this very important issue.\n  Friends, it is time to adopt these reforms. President Obama is \nwaiting. Maggie Bagon of Salem, OR, is waiting, along with millions of \nother Americans, for simple fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before my colleague from Oregon leaves the \nfloor, I wish to thank Senator Merkley, who is a former speaker of the \nhouse in his home State. He is a new Member of this body and a welcome \naddition to it. While he and my colleague from Colorado, Senator \nBennet, and Senator Warner from Virginia are new Members of the Senate \nand new members of the Banking Committee, I wish my colleagues to know \nwhat incredibly valuable additions they have been to the committee and \nto this body.\n  In the few short months they have been here, I have gotten to know \nall three of them very well. We have had a lot of--almost, I think, \nclose to 20--hearings in the Banking Committee since January 20 on a \nvariety of issues. We had a housing bill up last week, which took a \ngood part of the week, with some 20 amendments. Now we have this \nlegislation. There is a lot of work in front of us.\n  I wish to express to the people of Oregon how grateful we are to them \nthey have sent Jeff Merkley to the Senate. He is making a wonderful \ncontribution, and it has been in a matter of days. Certainly, on this \nissue, he has brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the \nsubject matter of consumer issues. Certainly, his additions and \nthoughts on the credit card legislation have been invaluable, as have \nbeen those by Bob Menendez, who was here a minute ago, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, who is a more senior Member of the Senate but a former \nMember of the House. Also, his concerns about young people and the \nproliferation of credit cards arriving at their homes unsolicited, and \nin some cases being preapproved, has been a source of great concern for \nme over many years. To have the addition of Bob Menendez expressing his \ninterests on those subject matters has brought us to the point where we \nnow finally have provisions in this bill that do protect young people \nand their families.\n\n  I pointed out yesterday that 20 percent of college students have in \nexcess of $7,000 in credit card debt, and the average college graduate \ntoday is leaving college with more than $4,000 in credit card debt. In \nfact, one of the major reasons why students drop out is because of \ncredit card debt.\n  Again, we understand the value of a credit card. But the responsible \nuse of it by the consumer and also the responsible proliferation of \nthese cards by the issuers need to be in balance. It is not. This bill \nchanges that, and we think for the better, which will provide the use \nof credit cards but in far more responsible ways than certainly \npresently is the case.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Merkley, Senator Menendez, Senator \nBennet, and Senator Warner, who have been involved in this debate over \nthe last number of weeks and months. I am confident and hopeful in the \nnext 2 days or so we will be able to finish the bill and work out with \nthe House the differences we have, which are not many, and send this \nlegislation to the President.\n  The President, by the way, is the first American President who has \nspoken up so forcefully, on numerous occasions now over the last \nseveral weeks, on this issue. To have an American President talk about \nthe importance of reform of the credit card industry has made an \ninvaluable contribution to public awareness about this issue--not that \nthe public needed to be made aware of it. The public has been living \nwith it. They have been far more knowledgeable about this, with 70 \nmillion accounts over the previous 11 months having their interest rate \ngo up. That is one out of four American families.\n  As you have heard in anecdote after anecdote, fees have been raised, \npenalties have been imposed, charges have been added on, with no cause, \nno justification whatsoever. It is the only contract I know of where \none party can change the terms at will. If you buy a home, if you buy a \ncar, if you buy an appliance, there is a contract. The seller cannot \nchange the terms midway in that contract. On credit cards they can, and \nthey say it bluntly: For any reason, at any time, we will change the \ncontract. Of course, that is terribly unfair to American consumers, at \na time they are paying an awful price economically, as well as with \njobs being lost and homes falling into foreclosure.\n  I am hopeful this bipartisan bill Senator Shelby and I have put \ntogether will enjoy broad bipartisan support. I cannot think of a more \nsignificant message we can send to the American public about this \ninstitution caring about what they are going through today. We have \nspent a lot of time over the last number of months dealing with \nfinancial institutions: stabilizing them, TARP money, automobile \nassistance. Americans are wondering if we are ever going to do anything \nabout what they are going through. Certainly, I understand--I think \nmost of my colleagues do--that stabilizing our financial institutions \nultimately will get credit moving and be a great help to businesses and \nconsumers. But it is an indirect assistance. This is direct assistance.\n  This is an opportunity to say, it is not going to happen any longer. \nWe are putting a stop to it. The people are going to get the kind of \nhelp they deserve. People need credit cards. They are essential for \nthem in the conduct of their everyday lives. But they need to have the \nassurance that the terms are not going to change, the rights do not \nchange, the credit limits do not change on the basis of the issuer \ndeciding that on their own. This bill addresses all of those issues in \na very comprehensive and thoughtful manner.\n  I am grateful, again, to the members of the Banking Committee, as \nwell as to Senator Shelby, of course, and others who have helped put \nthis legislation together.\n  The majority leader has been a champion in this area, and he is the \none who has allowed us to be on this floor and to engage in this \ndebate. Having leadership that insists upon this kind of debate \noccurring is welcomed in this country, and I thank Senator Reid, as \nwell, for those efforts.\n  With that, Madam President, unless others wish to be heard, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I wish to make some remarks with respect \nto this pending legislation. First, I wish to commend Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby for developing this bipartisan legislation. It will \nbring more fairness to the credit card market and provide more \npredictability to the many Americans who use credit cards, which is \npractically all Americans today.\n  Families are being squeezed on every side. The unemployment rate \ncontinues to rise. The situation, we hope, is beginning to stabilize \nacross the country. However, in my State of Rhode Island, there is \nstill a significant 10.5-percent unemployment rate. That is \nunacceptable. Individuals are still working, but they are receiving \npressure to take pay cuts. Home values have fallen precipitously. As a \nresult, people can no longer call upon their biggest investment and \ntheir biggest source of wealth: their home. All of this is adding to \nthe dilemma that is facing working families across this country.\n  At a time of declining home prices, rising unemployment, and the \npressures of daily life, individuals are faced with higher and higher \ncredit card interest rates, which makes it even more difficult to make \nends meet. People\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nwho have never missed a payment are facing double-digit interest rate \nincreases because card issuers are currently permitted to increase \nrates at any time for any reason.\n  Our small business owners are struggling. The Federal Reserve April \n2009 survey of senior loan officers shows that banks continue to \ntighten standards for credit for small business lending and to decrease \nexisting credit lines. With few viable alternatives, many small \nbusiness owners must use their personal credit cards just to keep the \nlights on in their company and to stay afloat, and they also are \nsubject to these arbitrary increases of their interest rates.\n  The Dodd-Shelby substitute restores balance to a market that has \nlacked adequate consumer protections for far too long. This legislation \ncodifies the rules the Federal Reserve recently issued by prohibiting \ndouble-cycle billing, retroactive interest rate increases on credit \ncard holders in good standing, and other questionable practices. It \nwill institute commonsense rules that will make a meaningful difference \nfor consumers, and this is a very important and very positive first \nstep. These Federal Reserve rules have done that.\n  But this bill goes further. It requires that penalty fees be \nreasonable and proportional to the cost of the violation. It requires \nthat any interest rate increases on new purchases be reviewed every 6 \nmonths so that consumers can return to a previous rate if conditions \nchange. It also protects consumers who have temporarily fallen on hard \ntimes by requiring 60 days before penalty interest rates can be \nimposed.\n  It shields young people from taking on more debt than they can handle \nby limiting prescreened offers to young consumers. It also gives \nconsumers more access to the information they need to make wise \nfinancial decisions, such as requiring full disclosure about due dates, \npenalties, and changes in terms.\n  I am pleased that much of the bill will take effect just 9 months \nfrom enactment. This is an aggressive but achievable effective date--\nsomething I pushed for, along with my colleagues, particularly Senators \nDodd and Shelby. When the Federal Reserve first announced that its \nrules would not be implemented until July 2010, I wrote to Chairman \nBernanke urging him to reconsider the effective date in light of the \neconomic crisis.\n  This legislation is careful to try to make changes in a way that \npreserves consumer access to credit. Implementation is staggered in \nrecognition that some of these changes are very narrow in scope and \nothers are more far-reaching. For instance, an important provision \nrequiring a 45-day notice before any interest rate increase will take \neffect in 3 months. Other changes, which may require more time to be \nimplemented appropriately, will be instituted on a different timeline. \nThis is a sensible and rational way to quickly address issues that are \nclear cut. It will also place more difficult issues on a timeline that \nwill provide relief but give an opportunity to effectively implement \nthese changes.\n  I am, however, disappointed that the ban on retroactive interest rate \nincreases will not take effect until 15 months after the bill is \nenacted. I think we should do that much more quickly. I point out that \n15 months is even later than the date included in the Federal Reserve's \noriginal rules, although we are improving upon their original approach. \nThis bill goes further than the Federal Reserve's rules, and in that \nsense I think it is important and timely and effective.\n  This bill will stop the exploitation of credit cardholders, there is \nno doubt. But we must acknowledge that when card issuers return to \ncareful underwriting standards because they can no longer change \ninterest rates at will, credit may become tighter. As a result, for \nsome consumers, a credit card will be harder to come by. We have to \nrecognize that. That is something which I think should be explicit \nrather than implicit.\n  One more point. Our first priority is protecting consumers, but what \nshould not get lost in the debate is that robust consumer protections \nbenefit the whole economy. We are now seeing what happens when some \nfinancial institutions are able to pursue profits without reasonable \nsafeguards for borrowers, without prudent underwriting, without \neffective due diligence. The short-run gain quickly turns into long-run \npain for the economy. That is precisely what has happened over the last \nseveral months. Not only did consumers suffer, but also the \ninstitutions that originally underwrote these products suffered.\n  All of this having been said, the legislation before us is timely. It \nwill provide long-overdue protections to Americans--individuals, \nhouseholds, families, and businesses. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                               U.S. Debt\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak about the dire situation \nof our fiscal house and the Federal Government, which has been \nconfirmed and reinforced by the recent trustees' report on Social \nSecurity.\n  We are in big trouble as a nation because of the amount of debt we \nare running up. This President has proposed a budget that doubles the \ndebt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years. He proposed a budget that \nruns, on the average, a trillion dollars of deficit every year for the \nnext 10 years--4 to 5 percent of GDP in deficit. In fact, this year the \ndeficit will be almost $2 trillion and it will be almost 13 percent of \nGDP--staggering numbers, numbers we have never seen as a nation except \nduring World War II when we were fighting for survival. These numbers \nadd up to debt that is unsustainable and cannot possibly be repaid by \nour children and therefore will create an atmosphere for our children \nand our children's children where our Nation will not be as prosperous \nor as strong as it was when our Nation was passed on to our \nstewardship.\n  These problems are only massively compounded by the report that came \nout yesterday from the Social Security trustees because they pointed \nout that the Medicare trust fund is going into a negative cash flow \nsituation and the Social Security trust fund will soon go into a \nnegative cash flow situation. What does that mean? Well, in the last 15 \nor 20 years, we have basically been financing our Government by \nborrowing from the piggy bank of Social Security and using that money \nto operate the day-to-day costs of the Federal Government. What the \ntrustees are telling us is that the piggy bank is broken. It has been \nsmashed. It no longer has any money in it. It is not going to take in \nmoney that exceeds the amount of money it has to pay out. In fact, we \nare going to have to borrow money now in order to pay Social Security \nbenefits beginning in 2016 and Medicare benefits right now, this year.\n  This chart reflects the seriousness of the situation. If you take \njust these basic mandatory programs--Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--the cost is escalating on a steep upward slope. By around the \nyear 2025 or 2030, these three programs alone will absorb all of the \nmoney the Federal Government has traditionally spent on all of the \nprograms of the Federal Government--20 percent of GDP--and then they go \nup. It is projected that toward the middle of this century, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid will literally bankrupt our Nation by \nthemselves. That says nothing about the basic underlying budget, which \nis expanding so dramatically under this Presidency.\n  The debt of this country under President Obama's proposal and budget, \nbecause of spending in these three accounts and because of the new \nspending the President proposed in all sorts of other accounts--massive \nexpansions in the size of Government, where the debt of the Federal \nGovernment just goes up and up, to the point where it will represent, \nat the end of President Obama's budget, 80 percent of the gross \nnational product. Today, the Federal debt is about 40 percent of the \ngross national product, down here, but after the spending spree of \nPresident Obama and the Democratic Congress, it will be 80 percent of \nthe gross national product.\n  We will be in a position where we cannot get out of the hole. \nUsually, when you dig a hole that is too deep--and we are deep in the \nhole already, by the way--you stop digging. That is the old adage. If \nyou are digging a hole and you are underground, you stop digging. We \nare not going to stop digging as a\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\ngovernment. What the President and the Democrats are suggesting is that \nwe bring a backhoe into the hole and dig twice as fast, so that we go \neven further down into the negative, into debt. That is not \nsustainable. It is not survivable for our kids because they are going \nto end up with costs and deficits that far exceed their ability to be \nable to manage.\n  The Medicare system alone has an unfunded liability of $37.8 \ntrillion. When you throw in the Social Security system on top of that, \nyou are talking about unfunded liabilities of over $42 trillion. What \nare the implications of that? If you took all the taxes paid in the \nUnited States since we were formed as a nation, since we began our \nGovernment and started to collect taxes, we have paid less in taxes \nthan we have in obligations on those two accounts. If you took the net \nworth of every American--all of our homes, cars, and stock--and you \nadded it all up, we have a debt on the books for the purpose of paying \nfor the programs that we know already exist under Medicare and Social \nSecurity--we have a debt that exceeds the net worth of the entire \ncountry. That is the definition of bankruptcy, by the way--when your \ndebt dramatically exceeds your assets.\n  In fact, by the 10th year of this budget, as proposed by President \nObama and passed by the Democratic Senate--without any Republican votes \nbecause it is such an irresponsible budget--the interest on the Federal \ndebt alone will be $850 billion. To try to put that into context, the \ninterest on the debt will actually exceed what we spend on national \ndefense. It will exceed by a factor of 4 or 5 what we spend on \neducation and on transportation. So we will be putting more money into \npaying interest.\n\n  By the way, to whom do we pay this interest? We pay it to the \nChinese, to the Japanese, to Southeast Asian countries, and, obviously, \nto the Arab and oil-producing countries. We will be paying more \ninterest to those nations--more American hard-earned dollars will go to \nthose nations to pay interest on our debt--than we will have available, \nwhat we will be able to spend on our own national defense.\n  Does that make sense? No, it doesn't make any sense at all. Plus, it \nis not supportable.\n  There are only two things that can happen to our Nation. When you run \nup the debt in the manner in which this deficit is proposed and in the \nmanner these deficits will do under the budget passed here, when you \nlook at the debt and the serious financial situations of Social \nSecurity and Medicare, there are basically only two things--unless we \ntake action on controlling spending now--that can occur. One is that \nyou devalue the dollar and inflate the currency. That is sort of a \ncombined thing. You basically take the value of the American currency \nand inflate it. That is the cruelest tax of all. That says to people \nwho have savings that they will find they are worth less the next day \nbecause of inflation. It says to the people who want to buy things that \nthey can buy less because of inflation. Inflation is a massive tax on \nworking Americans. That is one way you get out of debt, you inflate it. \nThe practical effect of that is that people won't want to buy your \ndebt. If they know inflation is coming, they won't buy your debt. Why \ngive you $1 billion to buy a billion dollars of American debt knowing \nthat you are going to pay them back in inflated dollars? If they are \ngoing to give you a billion dollars, or lend it to you, they are going \nto require much higher interest rates than we presently have to pay \nbecause they are going to have to anticipate inflation and the fact \nthat the value of the dollar will be reduced and that the value of the \ndebt they just bought will be worth less. So inflation has a lot of \nvery bad ramifications.\n  But how else do you get out from underneath the debt? The other way \nis to massively increase taxes on all Americans. This euphemism that we \nare just going to tax the rich--you cannot do it by just taxing the \nrich even if taxing the rich is something you want to do.\n  On the other side of the aisle, they claim they are going to raise \nthe rate on high-income Americans from 35 percent up to an effective \nrate of about 41 or 42 percent, as proposed by the President. These \nhigh-income Americans, making more than $250,000, are the majority of \nthe job producers in America. Most of the jobs in America are produced \nby small businesses today, and almost all of those small businesses \nwould be hit with this additional tax rate. So what happens to the \nsmall business, that mom-and-pop activity in New Hampshire, which is \nsuddenly starting to grow? Maybe they have 10 employees and they want \nto add 12 or 15 more, but they cannot do it because they have to take \ntheir money and put it toward paying taxes. They are not going to be \nable to put it toward adding more jobs, which would be much more \nbeneficial to us than having the money come to Washington and having \nthe people in Washington decide how to efficiently spend it. It is \nspent much more efficiently by small business.\n  It is not like they are undertaxed. A 35-percent tax rate on a small \nbusiness means they are taxed more than any other people in the \nindustrialized world for small business activity. Most corporate taxes \nand business taxes in the world average out around 20, 19, 15 percent. \nIn the United States it is 35 percent, if you are an individual or a \nsubchapter S corporation. Now they are talking about taking it up to 41 \npercent under the proposal from the other side of the aisle.\n  That is their plan for taxes. This is tax the rich. Even though for \nthe most part this is small business and it will cost us jobs--fine, \nlet's accept the tax-the-rich argument. How much money do they get from \nthat? Not very much, compared to what they are talking about spending. \nThey, the other side of the aisle, are proposing increasing spending by \nover $1 trillion on the discretionary side--that is education and \nthings like that--and over $1 trillion on the entitlement side. The \nrevenues from this tax increase are about one-fifth of that spending \nincrease, maximum one-fifth--and that presumes that wealthy people are \nnot going to be smart enough to go out and figure out ways to avoid \ntaxes, which is what people do who have accountants when their tax \nrates go up. They figure out a way to invest so they do not have to pay \ntheir taxes at such a high level, legally, by investing in things that \nare tax avoidance vehicles.\n  It is not a very efficient way to manage the economy. We would rather \nhave people invest in a way to get the maximum return because that \ncreates the most productivity in society, which promotes the most jobs, \nbut what happens is people invest not to create jobs and create return, \nthey go out and invest to avoid taxes, which is a very inefficient way \nto spend dollars. But let's accept the theory this is all acceptable, \nthat we should go out and tax the rich because it is a good political \nstatement and makes a nice TV ad and that will address the problem.\n  It does not. We still have a debt curve that goes up essentially on \nthe same pathway because this pathway of debt assumes--this debt \nassumes this tax increase on the wealthy.\n  What is the other option besides inflating the economy? It is to tax \neveryone at very dramatic rates. What is the practical effect of that? \nIf we tax all working Americans in order to pay off this debt--and \nremember what this debt is being used for. It is being used to expand \nthe size of the Government. The President has been very forthright \nabout this. He says: I believe, by dramatically growing the size of the \nGovernment--I heard this today on NPR, which I found was very \nappropriate since they happen to be a Government-funded agency--by \ndramatically expanding the size of the Government, you can create \nprosperity.\n  That is the argument of the President. That is the argument of the \nNPR's commentator today. I am thinking to myself--explain this to me.\n  Take the debt of the United States up to 80 percent of GDP, run \ndeficits of $1 trillion a year for the next 10 years, and we are going \nto create prosperity? We are not going to create prosperity. We are \ngoing to create a momentary blip in the activity of the Government in \nthe private sector--not momentary, a permanent blip. And we are going \nto significantly increase the size of the Government and maybe we will \ncreate some Government jobs, but in the end what we get is a massive \nexpansion in debt, a massive expansion in deficit, and a commensurate \nexpansion either in inflation or in taxes, which have a huge dampening \neffect on prosperity.\n  We don't create prosperity by increasing inflation. We don't create\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nprosperity by creating a nonproductive workplace where capital is being \ninvested, not for the purposes of efficiency but for the purposes of \navoiding taxes. Basically, what we are absolutely guaranteeing when we \nare running up this type of debt is that we are not going to get \nprosperity. We are going to get a weaker economy, a less prosperous \ncountry, and a country that is not as strong.\n  These numbers that came out yesterday from the Social Security \ntrustees only highlight, in a most devastating way, how significant our \nproblem is. If we fail to take it on, if we fail to address this issue, \nif we continue on this path of just spending money as if there is no \ntomorrow, there will be no tomorrow for our children because the \nburdens will be so high and so extreme from all the costs of \nGovernment, and especially from the burdens of these entitlement \nprograms.\n  What is the answer? To begin with, yes we are in a tough fiscal time \nright now, and we have to spend money that we do not want to spend in \norder to try to get things going. But let's acknowledge the fact that \nthis recession is not going to go on forever. Hopefully, there are some \nlights at the end of the tunnel and some glimmers that things are \nturning around, and we all hope that is going to occur and it appears \nit may. The Federal Reserve Chairman thinks it will.\n  As we move out of this recession, we should not continue to spend as \nif we are in a recession. Rather, we should draw back on the spending \nwe put into the system. We should start to take some of that spending \nback. All of the spending programs that came in the stimulus should \nhave been sunsetted so these programs end after the recession is over, \n1\\1/2\\ years from now, or maybe 1 year from now.\n  But that is not the plan. The plan is to build all of this spending \ninto the baseline and have this spending go on for as far as the eye \ncan see, and that is why the President's budget expects to have a $1 \ntrillion deficit as far as the eye can see, or at least as far as the \nbudget window--10 years.\n  Then after retrenching on the spending that is being proposed just in \nthe short term, saying: Let's stop this spending when we get out of the \nrecession, let's start curtailing this spending, let's go back to the \nformer spending patterns of the Government--which were not very good to \nbegin with but at least a lot better than what is being proposed now. \nLet's put someplace some strict fiscal discipline. Let's freeze \ndiscretionary spending for 1 or 2 years after we move past this \nrecession--in other words, in the year 2010, 2012, 2013.\n  Let's also, at the same time, look at these entitlement accounts and \nsee how we can put them on a more sustainable path. That means making \nsome courageous decisions around here. We proposed--myself and Senator \nConrad--a way to accomplish that because we know the political system \ndoes not inherently allow people, members of the Government who have to \nrun for reelection, to make the tough decisions on these programs that \naffect everyone. We know that.\n  We know it is very hard for somebody to stand up at a town meeting \nand say we are going to raise the age of retirement in Social Security; \nwe are going to change the ways we calculate COLAs on Social Security. \nNo, that is not the way these things are discussed around here. That is \nnot possible in a political climate. We accept that.\n  Why not set up a procedure which drives a good policy, which we can \nvote on and everybody can sort of hold hands and go at the issue \ntogether? That is what Senator Conrad and I have suggested. It is \ncalled the Conrad-Gregg Commission, except in New Hampshire where we \ncall it the Gregg-Conrad Commission.\n  Actually, what it does is set up a process where a group of people \nwho are very knowledgable--with a majority, by the way, from the \nmajority party--sit down and figure out the best ways to try to bend \nthis curve a little bit. Hopefully, more than this. See, this is the \ncurrent baseline, the blue one. Hopefully, we can get it back to the \ncurrent baseline and get under control the rate of growth of these \nentitlements so they do become, at least if not immediately affordable, \nover a long period more affordable.\n  We do this on a fast track. We do it without amendments. We require \nan up-or-down vote and require supermajorities so everybody is \nprotected, everybody knows it is fair. It gets to the underlying issue \nwhich is how to control the rate of growth of spending.\n  I recognize I have been sort of a Sisyphus, pushing a rock up a hill \nin this position, and I have not gotten to the top of the hill yet. But \nI am not alone on this concern. The chairmen of the Budget Committee in \nboth the House and Senate have both said that these outyear debt \npatterns of their budgets are unsustainable. Those were not my words.\n\n  The Director of OMB, the President's Office of Management and Budget, \nhas said these outyear numbers are unsustainable. The Secretary of \nTreasury has said these outyear numbers are unsustainable. We cannot \nhave a debt-to-GDP ratio of 85 percent. We can't have deficits of 4 to \n5 percent annually. We cannot do it and have a sustainable Government. \nWe end up turning into a banana republic if we continue on this path \nwhere we basically self-implode through inflation or excessive taxing.\n  The international community is starting to comment on this. The head \nof the Chinese Federal Reserve--a different title but the same \nposition--has raised his concerns about it, as has the premier of \nChina. After all, they are our biggest lender.\n  If the person who lent you the money for your credit card comes to \nyou and says: I am a little concerned about the amount of credit you \nare running up. I am a little concerned about it. You ought to listen \nto that person because that is the person who is going to lend you the \nnext dollar.\n  Regrettably, we are in that situation whether we like it or not. This \nis a real discussion about the real problems we confront as a country, \nand the trustees report should be listened to. There was one specific \nsuggestion in the trustees report that we in the Congress were supposed \nto do. The trustees report says when it is projected that the Medicare \ntrust fund will have to be supported with more than 45 percent of the \ngeneral funds of the Government--in other words, the Medicare trust \nfund is supposed to be self-insured. It never has been, but it is \nsupposed to be. It is not supposed to be general funds, which is \ngeneral taxation, to pay for it. So 5 years or so ago we put in that \nlanguage that said if over 45 percent of the support funds comes from \nthe general fund so it is no longer an insurance event, so people who \nare paying into their HI insurance are no longer supporting anything \nmore than 55 percent of the cost of the fund--at that point the \ntrustees notify Congress and the President that this is going to occur \nwithin the next 7 years, and we are supposed to, by our own statute, \nreceive from the President directions as to how to bring spending or \nthe cost of the trust fund down so that the general fund will not be \ninvaded by more than 45 percent.\n  President Bush took this to heart. He sent up two proposals to \naccomplish that, both of which were fairly reasonable. The first one \nwas, the people who take part in the Part D drug program should have to \npay a percentage of their premium for that program if they are rich, if \nthey are well off. In other words, people working in a restaurant in \nEpping, NH, today are fully subsidizing the Part D premium of, for \nexample, Warren Buffett. That makes no sense, does it? So if you have a \nfair amount of income, you should pay a larger--some percentage at \nleast of your Part D premium. President Bush suggested that.\n  Another approach, he said, was there are a lot of savings occurring \nin the health care industry today based mostly on technology advances. \nWe would like to share the rewards of those savings with the people who \nare getting them. Today, 100 percent of the savings goes to the health \ncare industry. President Bush suggested that we take half of those \nsavings and put them back into the Medicare trust fund. Those are very \nreasonable proposals, both of those. They were both rejected by the \nDemocratic Congress, a Congress controlled by the Democrats. Both were \nrejected by the Democratic Congress.\n  Now it is President Obama's turn to send us some ideas for how we \nkeep the cost to the general fund of the trust fund of Medicare below \n45 percent. But what has happened? Total silence. Total silence. \nNothing has been sent. No proposal has been sent. No endorsement of any \nproposal has been sent.\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\n  Interestingly enough, and to his credit, President Obama suggests in \nhis budget the same proposal on Part D that President Bush proposed, \nwhich was that wealthy people should pay some percentage of the cost of \ntheir premium. So one might think they would send that proposal as a \nfree-standing initiative, at least that one, as a way to address some \nof the costs which are being generated and being borne by the general \nfund. But we have not heard that.\n  It is ironic, of course, that President Obama has that proposal in \nhis budget and is not willing to send it. It may be that because \nCongress, under the Democratic leadership, rejected this idea 2 years \nago, that they believe it will be rejected again. But let's at least \ntake a run at it because it is a good idea, and it is very appropriate. \nIt should be done along with some other ideas because we have this \nresponsibility, under our own rules.\n  There are rules. We set them up. We said if the general fund is going \nto be invaded by more than 45 percent we have to come up with some way \nto correct that. So we ought to at least live by that. There are some \nideas as to where we should go from here, rather than allowing this \ndebt to become so excessive that, for example, it got so high that we \nbecome so irresponsible as a nation in the area of debt that we \ncouldn't even get in the European Union. That is an irony, isn't it?\n  When this debt gets up over 60 percent of GDP, which it may well, \nprobably in the next 2 years, at that point the United States would no \nlonger qualify for entry into the European Union.\n  Because those industrialized States said: That level of debt is \nirresponsible. A government that has that level of debt is so \nirresponsible that we do not want you in the European Union.\n  In other words, Latvia or Lithuania could get into the European \nUnion, but the United States could not. Not that we are going to apply. \nBut that is a pretty good place to look for a standard, is it not? They \nare industrialized nations.\n  So we need to take some action. We need to listen closely and read \nclosely the trustee's report, because it is telling us we are in deep \ntrouble.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5415-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I fully support the bill offered by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd. It would \ncreate a long overdue reform of the credit card industry whose \npractices have been increasingly predatory and abusive. I have heard \nfrom many hundreds of Iowans who have been victimized by credit card \ncompanies. These are good people who, in the current economic downturn, \nhave had no choice but to resort to their credit cards in order to put \nfood on the table or to make a car payment or even help pay for college \ntuition. As a result, they have found themselves on the receiving end \nof a whole array of unfair and often outright abusive practices; things \nsuch as double billing, unwanted fees, and arbitrary interest rate \nincreases. I applaud the Dodd-Shelby legislation for cracking down on \nsome of these abuses. I think the legislation is a good first step.\n  However, this bill still allows credit card companies to charge \nexcessive and, for millions of Americans, ruinous interest rates. \nCurrently one-third of all credit cardholders in the United States are \nbeing forced to pay interest rates above 20 percent, sometimes as high \nas 41 percent. These interest rates are grossly excessive. It is time \nto set a reasonable limit on what credit card companies can charge.\n  In times past, an interest rate of 20 percent, 30 percent, or 40 \npercent would have been condemned by religious leaders of all faiths as \nbeing the sin of usury. People daring to charge these interest rates \nwould have been prosecuted for loan sharking. But today the credit card \nindustry tells us that charging people these grossly excessive interest \nrates is both fair and necessary. I totally disagree. It is not fair, \nand it is not necessary. What is more, many Iowans have pointed out to \nme the very financial institutions that are victimizing and squeezing \nordinary hard-working Americans have already received billions of \ndollars from the taxpayers. Now these institutions are lending money \nthat came from taxpayers to people at interest rates as high as 41 \npercent. Someone tell me, what is the logic of that? No wonder people \nare upset all over this country. We take their hard-earned tax dollars, \ngive it to the big institutions. They have a credit card and in hard \ntimes they have to use that credit card for some necessities. Now they \nare being charged 20, 25, 30 percent interest. It is a sweet deal for \nthe financial institution. It is nothing more than an old-fashioned \nrip-off of consumers.\n  For these reasons, I have joined with Senators Sanders, Whitehouse, \nLeahy, Durbin, and Levin to offer an amendment to cap credit card \ninterest rates at 15 percent. Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. No \ncredit card could charge more than 15 percent interest rates. Why did \nwe pick 15 percent as an appropriate top rate? Thanks to a law passed \nby this Congress 30 years ago--I was here at the time--we put a cap of \n15 percent on the maximum interest charges a credit union could charge \ntheir customers. That was 30 years ago. We left a safety valve for \nspecial circumstances. This rate cap of 15 percent has protected \nmillions of consumers at credit unions. I belong to a credit union \nright here in the Senate. I have always belonged to a credit union. I \nbelonged to one in the House when I was there, and before that, in the \nNavy, I belonged to the Navy Federal Credit Union. These credit unions \nhave performed a viable, good service for millions of Americans without \nharming the safety or soundness of the institutions and without \nnegatively impacting access to credit for credit union members. I have \nbeen a member of a credit union all my adult life. I have never once \nseen them constrict the amount of credit involved to borrowers. If you \nneed a car, you have been able to get consumer loans from credit \nunions.\n  I would also point out, not one single credit union--not one--had to \nline up with the big banks begging for a bailout. Not one credit union. \nYet they are capped at 15-percent interest rates. Interesting, isn't \nit?\n  Credit unions have remained strong and stable despite the meltdown in \nmuch of our financial system.\n  Chris Coliver, a regulatory analyst for the California Credit Union \nLeague, was recently asked about the effect of the interest rate cap on \nhis institutions--the 15-percent cap. He answered:\n\n       It hasn't been an issue. Credit unions are still able to \n     thrive.\n\n  Of course, there may be some special circumstances under which an \ninterest rate above 15 percent is temporarily necessary. Currently, \ncredit unions are allowed to charge higher interest rates if their \nregulator--which is the National Credit Union Administration--\ndetermines this is necessary to maintain the safety and soundness of \nthe institutions. At the present time, the NCUA, the National Credit \nUnion Administration, allows credit unions to charge interest rates as \nhigh as--get this--as high as 18 percent, though most credit unions \ncontinue to have a top rate that is actually much lower than that, and \nsome of them lower than 15 percent, some as low as 12 percent, 11 \npercent. Well, our amendment includes a similar, reasonable exception. \nIt would allow credit card companies to charge interest rates higher \nthan 15 percent in circumstances where Federal regulators determine \nthat higher rates are necessary to protect the safety and soundness of \nfinancial institutions.\n  It seems as if this is deja vu all over again for me. I have been \nadvocating\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nfor a 15-percent cap since I was an attorney for the Iowa Consumer \nLeague in 1973, fresh out of law school. I was a lawyer for the Iowa \nConsumer League, and we were trying to get the Iowa Legislature at that \ntime to put a cap of 15 percent on credit cards. So this issue has been \naround for a long time. As a legal aid lawyer at that time, I saw \nfirsthand the devastation and hardship caused to Iowa families by \nexcessive interest rates charged by credit card companies and others. \nAgain, many of these Iowans turned to their credit cards in a time of \ncrisis--a medical emergency, for example--but because of the \nprohibitive interest rates, they found themselves falling further and \nfurther behind in their payments. Some were forced into bankruptcy.\n  Well, it is no different today. As I said, I have received many \nhundreds of letters and e-mails from Iowans who have been victimized by \ncredit card companies' abusive practices. For example, Madam President, \nlet me share an all-too-common story from one of my Iowa constituents, \nand I will read it verbatim as she wrote it:\n\n       I am a single mom with a pretty good job, [for] which I am \n     very thankful. I have 3 credit cards. Recently, I received \n     notices from 2 of them that they were raising my interest \n     rate due to the ``economic conditions.'' I don't mean a \n     little, I mean a LOT.\n\n  She capitalized ``LOT.''\n\n       Capital One--\n\n  We all know who Capital One is, and their credit cards--\n\n     Capital One sent me a notice that they were raising my rate \n     from 13.9 percent to 23.99 percent. I had the option of \n     cancelling my card and paying off the existing balance at my \n     current rate of 13.9 percent, which I did. The other one is \n     Washington Mutual. They were recently purchased by JP Morgan \n     Chase. I received a notice from them a couple of weeks ago \n     that my rate was going from--\n\n  Get this--\n\n     10.4 percent to 23.99 percent.\n\n  Now, you wonder: Here is JPMorgan Chase, operating through Washington \nMutual, increasing their interest rate to 23.99 percent. Capital One \nincreasing their interest rate to 23.99 percent. Why weren't they off \njust 1 percent? Why are they both exactly the same? Well, it looks as \nif they are all ganging up to charge the same high interest rate.\n  Anyway, let me continue to read from her letter. The rate was going \nfrom 10.4 percent to 23.99 percent.\n\n       I have never missed a payment or been late on either one of \n     these. Tonight I called JP Morgan Chase and they told me I \n     missed the deadline to say I wanted to decline the changes in \n     my cardholder agreement. I said I wanted to close my account \n     and pay off the existing balance at the 10.4 percent. They \n     refused! . . . I could see it if I had missed any payments or \n     even paid a day late, but I have NOT. This is just WRONG.\n\n  End of her letter.\n  Imagine that. She actually had the wherewithal to pay it off at 10.4 \npercent, and JPMorgan said: No. You missed the deadline.\n  We all get this mail. We all get this junk mail and all that stuff \nfrom credit card companies. I just throw them away. Well, maybe there \nis some notice in there that, oh, if it is not a bill, maybe they have \nsent you a notice that maybe you have to do something. Who reads all \nthat junk mail? Nine times out of ten, it is some kind of promotion \nthey are promoting: You can get a free airline pass or you can get a \ncut rate on going to Cancun or something like that. You get all that \njunk. Then they slip in there another little letter that says: Oh, by \nthe way, if you do not cancel your previous agreement, we are going to \ndo this, this, and this. Good luck in finding that out.\n  This constituent who wrote me would clearly benefit from the \nprovisions in the Dodd-Shelby bill that would prohibit retroactive rate \nincreases on existing balances in accounts with no late payments. But \nthe larger issue remains: Why should any bank be allowed to charge an \ninterest rate of 24 percent under any circumstances--under any \ncircumstances? Why should banks be allowed to charge other customers \ninterest rates as high as 41 percent--41 percent?\n  As I said, I support the underlying bill, but the bill will continue \nto let them charge those kinds of interest rates. The bill does clean \nup some of the other stuff, and that is why I am supporting it. But \nthis does not get really to the nub of the problem; that is, we are \nallowing usurious interest rates to be charged for credit cards. We \nknow why they are charging these interest rates. They can get by with \nit. It is legal. Well, the credit unions can survive and provide credit \nand issue credit cards to their holders and survive on 15 percent. Are \nyou telling me these big companies cannot? Of course they can. But \nguess what. They probably would not be able to pay their executives $50 \nmillion a year in salaries and bonuses or--$50 million; I am being a \npiker--try $200 million or $300 million a year. That is what they are \npaid. So to keep up this lavish lifestyle for their executives, for \ntheir corporate offices, they charge 20, 30, 40 percent.\n  Well, as I said, take a lesson from the credit unions. Take a lesson. \nThat is what we have to put a limit on. That is why I cannot emphasize \nenough that unless and until we cap interest rates, we are still going \nto have these problems because people will get credit cards, they will \nget into dire straits. This is their only way of paying a bill--to use \ntheir credit card--and something else happens, and all of a sudden they \nare racked up with these high interest rates.\n  The other thing credit card companies are doing is they are charging \nthese high interest rates in order to be able to give credit cards to \njust about anyone. People get credit cards sent to them without any \nkind of credit checks, whether they are really creditworthy. They get \nall these kinds of credit cards out there. People who are like my \nconstituent, who are responsible and who pay their bills on time and \nwho have credit cards which they do pay on time and never get behind, \nare penalized because credit card companies are so lax and so loose \nwith whom they give these credit cards to. So we all pay for it. Well, \nthe credit card companies ought to be a little bit more circumspect \nabout whom they give their credit cards to. Again, they should take a \nlesson from the credit unions.\n  So, Madam President, as I said, I support the underlying bill. But we \nmust seize this opportunity to address the single most widespread and \ndestructive abuse in this industry; that is, grossly excessively high \ninterest rates. That is why I support this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the Sanders-Harkin-Leahy-Whitehouse-Durbin-Levin \namendment on this bill.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1084\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1084, the Gillibrand amendment, be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1104 to Amendment No. 1084\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I call up the second-degree amendment I \nhave at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1104 to amendment No. 1084.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Comptroller General to conduct a study on the \n  relationship between fluency in the English language and financial \n                               literacy)\n\n       Beginning on page 1, line 2, strike all through page 2, \n     line 9, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. GAO STUDY AND REPORT ON FLUENCY IN THE ENGLISH \n                   LANGUAGE AND FINANCIAL LITERACY.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study examining--\n       (1) the relationship between fluency in the English \n     language and financial literacy; and\n       (2) the extent, if any, to which individuals whose native \n     language is a language other than English are impeded in \n     their conduct of their financial affairs.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n     submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial \n     Services of the House of Representatives that contains a \n     detailed summary of the findings and conclusions of the study \n     required under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, briefly, I have high regard for Senator \nGillibrand and the intent of the amendment. I also understand the \npractical application of what could happen. I know in my home State of \nGeorgia, in one school system in Gwinnett County, there are 178 \ndifferent languages spoken. The application of this amendment would \ncause, for example, in Gwinnett County, 178 different credit reports in \n178 different languages to meet the intent of the law.\n  I respect and understand the difficulty that fluency can make in \nsomeone's ability to read and do their financial affairs. However, \nbefore we were to require of all the credit reporting agencies that \nthey publish all credit reports and make them available in every \nlanguage that could be spoken in the United States, we should conduct a \nstudy through GAO to ensure that we understand the relationship between \nfluency and financial affairs on the part of an individual and we \nunderstand exactly what the consequences of this amendment would be. \nThis gives us 1 year to study and make a final decision based on facts \nrather than forcing an automatic imposition of credit reports being \npublished in a variety of different languages, which could be well in \nexcess of 100.\n  I, respectfully, appreciate the consideration of the Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Lincoln pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1030 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, as you may have observed in our time \ntogether in the Senate, I do not come to the floor of the Senate to \nspeak very often. I try to reserve my comments for matters of \nparticular importance and urgency, matters where I think we can make a \nreal difference and where the debate will matter. We are debating one \nsuch issue today, when it comes to the important need, the critical \nneed to rein in the abusive practices of credit card companies that are \nharming thousands of middle-class families across my State and millions \nof middle-class families across America.\n  Just this last weekend I received more than 500 letters and e-mails \nfrom my constituents, middle-class people across Indiana who are \noutraged because they rightly believe they have been abused by the \npredatory practices of credit card companies. These are decent hard-\nworking people who ask nothing more than for a fair shake in life and, \ntoo often, they are not getting it because of the these abusive \npractices.\n  I wish to take the opportunity to share with you a couple of these \nstories. Many of them are heartfelt. I will give an example. This one \nis from a single mother. She writes me:\n\n       Dear Senator Bayh, I am a single mother of a teenage boy, \n     and I work 50 hours per week--\n\n  She is not some deadbeat, she is a hard-working, middle American--\n\n     at a job I've had for 14 years. My ex-husband quit his job \n     out of the blue a couple of years ago and did not pay any \n     child support for over a year.\n       Unfortunately, I had to turn to using my credit cards for \n     things like groceries, gas and other bills just to keep up. \n     If you are even 1 or 2 days late in paying your bill, these \n     credit card companies increase your percentage rate to \n     astronomically high amounts. Because I was struggling and a \n     few days--not months, just a few days--late on some of my \n     credit card payments, the percentage rates on my credit cards \n     are now between 28 and 32 percent. I will never pay off these \n     bills with interest rates like this!\n       So many people out there, including myself, are at the \n     mercy of these unscrupulous credit card companies that can do \n     whatever they please. There needs to be laws regulating how \n     much these companies can charge. Americans are mired in \n     credit cards debt that will never be paid off, no matter how \n     hard they work and no matter how hard they try if the current \n     practices do not change.\n       My economic situation will be so much better if it were not \n     for my credit card bills. I owe probably $15,000 now on all \n     of my credit card bills combined, but it will take me a \n     lifetime to pay those off because of the practices to which I \n     have been subjected. Please fight for hard working people \n     everywhere who just want a chance to get out from under their \n     debt and better their financial circumstances.\n\n  I also heard from a woman in Carmel, IN, just north of Indianapolis, \na few weeks ago. She had an $8,000 balance on a closed--a closed credit \ncard account. She was not buying anything. She had always paid her bill \non time. And out of the blue one day--she had done nothing wrong--her \ncredit card company doubled her minimum payment. She is a woman of \nmodest means and she could not make the higher payment. She called the \nbank and they would not work with her, even though she had never missed \na payment or been late, not once.\n  Soon the credit company started adding late fees and compounding her \ninterest. Over the course of 2 years, her balance tripled from $8,000 \nto $24,000, without making a single purchase. She had bought nothing. \nShe had done nothing wrong. And she is getting gouged like this. This \nis the kind of thing that has to stop.\n  I heard from another constituent from Middlebury, IN, another basic \nmiddle-class middle American, who received an offer from her credit \ncard company to consolidate her balance on all of her credit cards at 4 \npercent.\n  Well, that sounded like a pretty good rate, so she accepted the \noffer. She never missed a payment. She had paid off half her debt, when \nsuddenly they raised the monthly minimum payment by 60 percent. So she \nis paying on time, she is paying down her debt, and her monthly minimum \nrate goes up by 60 percent without cause or any notice.\n  She called customer service to complain. They said they would lower \nher monthly minimum payment if she would agree to have her interest \nrate doubled. This woman from Middlebury is a mother. She is trying to \nkeep her head above water, and her credit card company is making life \nmore difficult with practices like that.\n  Those are the kinds of things we have to stop. And those are the \nkinds of things I hope we will stop yet this week here in the Senate.\n  Here is what she wrote:\n\n       I don't know that our government can do a thing about this, \n     but I just wanted to be heard.\n\n  Well, here is the place where her voice can be heard. Here is the \nplace where thousands of middle-class families like hers can come for \nsome relief. Here is the place where over 500 people who wrote about \nthe abuses to which they have been subjected can come for some relief.\n  This recession has caused millions of middle-class families to resort \nto using their credit cards a little bit more, not because they wanted \nto but because they had to try to make ends meet. They are working \nhard, trying to get out from under this situation, and it does not make \nlife any easier when they are running uphill because of these abusive \npractices.\n  You know, bills are sent out so late. They arrive in our mailbox and \nyou have got 24 or 48 hours to pay the thing off or you are subjected \nto a late fee. That is not right. Then they start charging interest on \nthe late fee. Interest rates can literally, because of the fine print \nin these bills--you know, back in the day, you applied for a credit \ncard, it was about a one-page thing. Now it is 20 or 30 pages of fine \nprint. And buried in there in the fine print are the provisions where \ncompanies can raise your interest rates any amount, anytime, for any \nreason, or for no reason whatsoever. Those are the kinds of things that \nneed to be stopped.\n  Then, finally, when you are making your payments, they take the \npayment\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nyou make, and rather than applying it to the most expensive part of \nyour debt with the highest interest rate, they apply it to the lowest \ninterest rate. Why? Because it is more profitable for them, even though \nit would be better to do it the other way around for you. Those are the \nkinds of things we have to correct.\n  You know me pretty well, Mr. President. I am a free enterprise \nperson. I believe in the right of companies to make a profit, and \ncredit card companies are no exception. But they ought to make it the \nlegitimate, old-fashioned way, not on the backs of consumers through \nabusive practices. That is what we are talking about here.\n  This also goes to something else I am concerned about, and that is \nthe deepening skepticism and cynicism about government in general, and \nabout Washington, DC, in particular. They think we are all under the \nthumb of a bunch of special interests. Everybody sold out and nobody \ncares about the average person or the middle-class family anymore. This \ngives us an opportunity to show, to demonstrate that that is not true, \nto stand up for millions of ordinary people, to do what is right, to \nsay that the free market should be allowed to operate, but you should \nnot scam people, you should not bury fees in fine print, you should not \ndo a bait and switch.\n  That is not the way you make a decent profit. That is something that \nought to be against the rules. That is what this legislation would \nprovide for. For the sake of middle-class families across States such \nas Indiana and New Mexico and elsewhere across America, for the sake of \nfolks who are working hard trying to get out from under the \nconsequences of this recession, for the sake of trying to restore some \nfaith and trust in our system of self-government, it is important that \nwe pass this credit card bill, to restrain these abusive practices, to \nstand up for middle-class families, to do right by our citizens, and to \nlet people know that when their voices are heard, we will answer.\n  That is why I have risen today on this bill. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with us in acting. I hope we will have an opportunity to do that \nbefore the week is out.\n  I thank you for your leadership, as well as my colleagues.\n  Seeing none of our colleagues present, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Guantanamo\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the last several weeks there has been \na hue and cry from the other side of the aisle, a steady procession of \nRepublican Senators, concerning the President's intention to close the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay. I would like to remind colleagues \nthis is a problem President Obama inherited from the previous \nadministration, and it is worth a few moments to review the history.\n  After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the \nBush administration decided to set aside treaties that had served us in \npast conflicts. They sent detainees to the Guantanamo facility and \nclaimed the right to seize anyone, including American citizens in the \nUnited States, and to hold them indefinitely without legal rights.\n  GEN Colin Powell, then the Secretary of State to President George W. \nBush, objected. He said the administration's policy:\n\n       Will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice . . \n     . and undermine the protections of the law of war for our own \n     troops . . . It will undermine public support among critical \n     allies, making military cooperation more difficult to \n     sustain.\n\n  GEN Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then \nSecretary of State to George W. Bush. Secretary Powell's words were \nprophetic. Guantanamo became an international embarrassment for the \nUnited States and, sadly, tragically, a recruiting tool for terrorists \nsuch as al-Qaida. The Supreme Court repeatedly held that the \nadministration's detention policies were illegal. As Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor famously wrote for the majority in the Hamdi difficult \ndecision:\n\n       A state of war is not a blank check for the President.\n\n  Today, nearly 8 years after the 9/11 attacks, none of the terrorists \nwho planned those attacks has been brought to justice.\n  After he left the Bush administration, Colin Powell spoke out \npublicly again. He said:\n\n       Guantanamo has become a major, major problem . . . in the \n     way the world perceives America. . . . We don't need it and \n     it is causing us far more damage than any good we get for it.\n\n  That is not a quote from the ACLU. That came from GEN Colin Powell, \nformer chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of \nState. A lot of others agree. Four other former Secretaries of State, \nRepublican and Democratic, have weighed in: Henry Kissinger, Madeleine \nAlbright, James Baker, and Warren Christopher have all called for \nGuantanamo to be closed. As Secretary Baker explained:\n\n       We all agreed one of the best things that could happen \n     would be to close Guantanamo, which is a very serious blot on \n     our reputation.\n\n  Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora testified in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, saying:\n\n       There are serving U.S. flag-rank officers who maintain that \n     the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat \n     deaths in Iraq--as judged by their effectiveness in \n     recruiting insurgent fighters into combat--are respectively \n     the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n  This was not some leftwing columnist. This is the former Navy general \ncounsel, Alberto Mora.\n  Retired Air Force MAJ Matthew Alexander led the interrogation team \nthat tracked down Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in \nIraq. He used legal and traditional interrogation tactics which he \nbelieves are more effective than torture. Here is what Major Alexander \nsaid:\n\n       I listened time and time again to foreign fighters, and \n     Sunni Iraqis, state that the number one reason they decided \n     to pick up arms and join Al Qaeda was the abuses at Abu \n     Ghraib and the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo \n     Bay. . . . It's no exaggeration to say that at least half of \n     our losses and casualties in that country have come at the \n     hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our \n     program of detainee abuse.\n\n  Let me remind those listening again, the source of this quote is not \nsome liberal-leaning columnist, angry at policies of the United States. \nIt is MAJ Matthew Alexander from the Air Force, a man who dedicated a \nlarge part of his life to serving our country and risking his life in \nits defense.\n  I visited Guantanamo in 2006. I left with a feeling of pride and \nadmiration for the soldiers and sailors serving there. They are great \nAmericans doing a tough job in a very bleak climate. But they are being \nasked to carry a heavy burden created by the previous administration's \npolicies, which have turned Guantanamo, sadly, into a recruiting poster \nfor al-Qaida.\n  By 2006, even former President George W. Bush said he wanted to close \nGuantanamo Bay. He acknowledged the problem. He didn't do anything to \nsolve it.\n  As an aside, it is interesting to note that there were no complaints \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle when President Bush said he \nwanted to close Guantanamo. The Republican leader of the Senate did not \ncome down to the floor to object when his President made the \nsuggestion. He started making a regular trip to the floor to object \nwhen the suggestion was made by President Obama.\n  President Obama has shown courage in taking on this difficult \nchallenge. Within 48 hours of his inauguration, President Obama issued \nexecutive orders prohibiting torture, stating that Guantanamo will be \nclosed within 1 year and setting up a review process for all detainees \nwho are currently held at Guantanamo.\n  Here is what President Obama said:\n\n       The United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle \n     against violence and terrorism and we are going to do so \n     vigilantly, we are going to do so effectively, and we are \n     going to do so in a manner that is consistent with our values \n     and our ideals.\n\n  At the signing of the Executive orders, the President was joined by \n16 retired admirals and generals. These distinguished Americans issued \na statement saying:\n\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\n\n       President Obama's actions today will restore the moral \n     authority and strengthen the national security of the United \n     States. . . . President Obama has rejected the false choice \n     between national security and our ideals. Our Nation will be \n     stronger and safer for it.\n\n  In response to the Executive orders, Republican Senators John McCain \nand Lindsey Graham said:\n\n       We support President Obama's decision to close the prison \n     at Guantanamo, reaffirm America's adherence to the Geneva \n     Conventions, and begin a process that will, we hope, lead to \n     the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees.\n\n  Keep in mind, I have just read a quote from Senator John McCain, a \nman who, of course, was President Obama's opponent in the last \nelection, but a man who had a personal life experience of over 5 years \nof captivity during the Vietnam war, and a colleague of mine who has \nshown extraordinary courage and political courage and leadership in \nleading the effort to say, once and for all, that we were going to \nprohibit torture as part of America's policy.\n  It was Senator McCain, along with his colleague Senator Graham, who \nsaid these supportive things after President Obama's announcement. It \nwas a strong bipartisan statement, a strong day for our country.\n  But now things have changed, and I do not know why. The Republicans \nare on the attack. They claim that the President does not have a plan \nto close Guantanamo, and yet at the same time they are arguing that the \nPresident does have a plan, which is to release terrorists into the \nUnited States. Imagine that. These claims are not only contradictory, \nthey are preposterous.\n  The truth is, the President is taking the time to carefully plan for \nthe closure of Guantanamo, and he is going to do it in a way that is \nconsistent with America's security.\n  Here is how the Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair \nexplained it:\n\n       [Guantanamo] is a rallying cry for terrorist recruitment \n     and harmful to our national security, so closing it is \n     important for our national security. The guiding principles \n     for closing the center should be protecting our national \n     security, respecting the Geneva Conventions and the rule of \n     law, and respecting the existing institutions of justice in \n     this country. Closing this center and satisfying these \n     principles will take time, and is the work of many \n     departments and agencies.\n\n  In recent weeks, Republicans have regularly come to the floor of the \nSenate and the House to make dozens of statements criticizing President \nObama on Guantanamo. The distinguished minority leader, Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky, alone, has spoken on this issue on 9 separate \noccasions over the last 11 days the Senate has been in session. It is \ninteresting that the Republicans are spending so much time focused on \nthe fate of Guantanamo while President Obama and others in Congress are \nfocused on getting our economy back on track after 8 years of failed \neconomic policies.\n  What is the explanation? According to a recent story in Politico:\n\n       Congressional Republicans have stoked parochial fears of \n     releasing Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland, and GOP \n     aides privately acknowledge that this issue is one of the few \n     on which they believe they have a real edge on the Obama \n     administration.\n\n  Somehow arguing on the floor of the Senate that President Barack \nObama cannot wait to close Guantanamo and turn terrorists loose in the \nUnited States--incredible.\n  The Hill newspaper reported:\n\n       As polls show most Americans approve of the job Obama is \n     doing on issues like the economy, the wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and others, Republicans are desperate to find an \n     issue on which they can come out ahead.\n\n  In other words, the Republicans are trying to turn Guantanamo into a \npolitical issue. Richard Clarke was President George W. Bush's first \ncounterterrorism chief. Listen to what he said last week:\n\n       Recent Republican attacks on Guantanamo are more desperate \n     attempts from a demoralized party to politicize national \n     security and the safety of the American people.\n\n  Let's examine two of the specific claims from the other side of the \naisle. They argue that transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. \nprisons will put Americans at risk.\n  Well, earlier today my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse--I serve on the \nJudiciary Committee with him--had a very interesting hearing, which I \nam sure will be noted by many people when they follow the news, where \nhe talked about the detention and interrogation policies and brought \nsome critical witnesses to testify who had dissented from President \nBush's policies during the course of his administration.\n  During his hearing in the Judiciary Committee today, one of the \nwitnesses was Phillip Zelikow. Phillip Zelikow was the Executive \nDirector of the 9/11 Commission, which has received high marks from \nvirtually everyone for the professional job they did under the \nleadership of Governor Kean of New Jersey and former Congressman \nHamilton of Indiana. Mr. Zelikow also served as counselor to Secretary \nof State Condoleezza Rice. He comes to this issue with ample \nexperience.\n  Mr. Zelikow was intimately involved with these issues during the Bush \nadministration, and he strongly supports closing Guantanamo. He told me \nin the hearing it will be safe to transfer Guantanamo detainees to U.S. \nprisons and facilities, and some of the most dangerous terrorists are \nalready incarcerated in the United States.\n  Here are a few examples: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombings--he is being safely and securely held in an \nAmerican detention facility; 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui; \nRichard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber; and numerous al-Qaida \nterrorists responsible for bombing United States Embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania.\n  If we can safely hold these individuals, I believe we can safely hold \nany Guantanamo detainees who need to be held. I should note no prisoner \nhas ever escaped from a Federal supermaximum security facility in the \nUnited States.\n  Republicans also claim the administration wants to release terrorists \ninto our communities. What an incredible charge, and patently false. \nPresident Obama has made clear that Guantanamo will be closed in a \nmanner consistent with our national security.\n  Even the Bush administration acknowledged that there are people being \nheld at Guantanamo who were wrongly detained and who are not \nterrorists. Let me give you one example.\n  There is an attorney in Chicago who is a friend of mine who \nvolunteered to represent one of the detainees at Guantanamo. At his own \nexpense, he flies down to Guantanamo and meets with this man \nperiodically. He tells me that the man is now 26 years old. He is \noriginally from Gaza. He has been held now for 7 years--7 years--\nbecause at the time we were offering rewards to people in various parts \nof the world who would turn in suspects. So the money was offered. This \nman was turned in, eventually sent to Guantanamo.\n  The attorney tells me he was sent to Guantanamo at the age of 19. He \nis now 26. Fifteen months ago, our Government sent a message to this \nattorney saying: We have reviewed this case in detail--after 6 years--\nreviewed this case in detail. We have no charges against this man being \nheld in detention.\n  This man is being held in Guantanamo, which is a very bleak setting \nif you have been there, and he has now been held an additional 15 \nmonths with no pending charges. Our Government did not believe he is a \ndangerous individual. What they were trying to do is to find a place \nwhere he can go and, for 15 months, he has been sitting in detention in \nGuantanamo.\n  Is that consistent with justice in America? Is that the kind of image \nwe want? Of course we want to be safe. But the rule of law suggests \nthat if the man has done nothing wrong, he should not be punished for \nit and continue to be in this secure setting in Guantanamo, separated \nfrom his family now for 7 years, with no charges brought against him.\n  Even the Bush administration, which started this Guantanamo \ndetention, realized after some time that literally hundreds of people \nwho were detained there were not in any way, shape, or form a threat to \nthe United States and they were released--many of them back to their \nhome countries.\n\n  Back in 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described the \ndetainees at Guantanamo as ``the hardest of the hard core'' and ``among \nthe most dangerous, best trained, vicious killers on the face of the \nEarth.'' Those are the words of Secretary Rumsfeld. However, since that \nstatement by Secretary\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nRumsfeld, two out of three of the detainees in Guantanamo have been \nreleased. They have also cleared dozens of additional detainees for \nrelease but cannot return them to their home countries, much like the \none I described, because of the risk they may be tortured if they \nreturn.\n  We need our allies to accept some of these detainees, but they have \nmade it clear they will not do so unless the United States admits a \nsmall number of detainees who do not present any threat to our country.\n  As Senator Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee, has pointed out, it is illegal under U.S. law to resettle \nterrorists in the United States--one of the charges being made on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Unlike the previous administration, \nPresident Obama does not believe that he can set aside any laws enacted \nby Congress. No one can be admitted to this country to live freely \nuntil they have been through a thorough background and security check \nand cleared of wrongdoing.\n  President Obama inherited the Guantanamo mess from the previous \nadministration. Solving this problem is not easy. There will be \ndifficult choices, and it will take time. But the President has shown \nhe is willing to step up and lead and make hard decisions that are in \nthe best interests of the security of the United States.\n  I applaud the President for engaging in a careful and deliberative \nprocess to close Guantanamo. As Colin Powell, James Baker, John McCain, \nand many military officials have said, closing Guantanamo will make us \na safer nation.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to take another look at this issue \nand understand that this important national security issue is best \nsolved in a bipartisan way, and that we should continue the work of \nclosing Guantanamo, suggested by President George W. Bush, by doing it \nin a fashion that is consistent with America's values.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Isakson \nsecond-degree amendment No. 1104 be agreed to and the Gillibrand \namendment No. 1084, as amended, be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table; that the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Sanders amendment No. 1062 and there be 4 minutes \nof debate prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that an \nallocation Budget Act point of order be considered made against the \nSanders amendment and that Senator Sanders be recognized to waive the \nrelevant point of order, with the Senate then voting to waive the point \nof order; that upon disposition of the Sanders amendment, the Senate \nresume the Gregg amendment and there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to the amendment; that upon disposition of the Gregg \namendment, there be 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation \nto the Vitter amendment No. 1066--I am wondering if there is any, if \nSenator Vitter requests any time to speak on this; we will make sure \nSenator Vitter has 5 minutes if he wants to speak on the amendment--\nthat no intervening amendments be in order during the pendency of this \nagreement; and that all time be equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1104 and 1084\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 1104 \nis agreed to.\n  Amendment No. 1084, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Nominee\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I address this Chamber today, \npoliticians and pundits across the country are bracing for the spirited \ntug-of-war which precedes the confirmation of any new Supreme Court \nJustice. A list of names has appeared, seemingly out of thin air, and \nthe media is already beginning its speculative debate on who this \nperson will be.\n  Many seem eager to attack or defend potential nominees based on \nideological grounds or even specific issues. I see little value in this \noverblown rhetoric and idle speculation. We must be careful in our \napproach to such an important task. I call upon the White House to give \nus a nominee who will provide diversity to the Court and ensure that \neach ruling is informed by real-life experience as well as sound legal \nreasoning. The greatest jurors in our history have been drawn from the \nFederal bench, private life, academia, and even elected office. It is \nthese exceptional, independent leaders to whom our President must now \nturn.\n  Some will warn that any Obama nominee will be prone to political bias \nand judicial activism. We must be wary as we evaluate such claims. \nCertainly, it is right to oppose any jurist who would attempt to \nlegislate from the bench. The Supreme Court must be bound by law and \nthe weight of precedent. Justices must respect our Constitution and \nremain unbiased on all matters.\n  But too often, we mistake insensitivity for impartiality. We cannot \nafford to choose a clear record at the expense of clear judgment. \nDecisions such as Brown v. the Board of Education display compassion, \nnot activism. Roe v. Wade stood on principle, not on ideology. Some \ncall it activism; I call it courage. Our judicial history is full of \nthese independent decisions, and we should demand such strength and \nintegrity from every jurist we place on the bench. After all, without \nany kind of courage, the Supreme Court itself would hardly exist as we \nknow it. Marbury v. Madison was a landmark ruling that forever altered \nthe role of the Court. It established judicial review and laid the \ngroundwork for almost every decision in the last two centuries.\n  We must oppose jurists who would overreach, but we would be well \nserved to find a candidate with the integrity to draw on his or her \nGod-given sense of empathy and personal life experiences.\n  Above all, we must ensure that he or she will bring diversity to the \nSupreme Court. I encourage the President to give serious consideration \nto naming a woman of color to the High Court. Diversity of race and \ngender, diversity of background, diversity of thought, and diversity of \njudicial philosophy--all of these qualities would bring new views and \nexperience to the Supreme Court and would encourage healthy debate \namong its members, bringing new perspective to each ruling.\n  Any experienced attorney--and there are many of us in this Chamber--\nknows that finding legal truth is not easy. Few issues are black and \nwhite. Judges must sift through shades of gray to make informed \ndecisions. Legal truth arises from this dialog, from the collision of \ndifferent perspectives and opinions. In shaping the Supreme Court, we \nseek to build debate, not consensus.\n  Justice David Souter, throughout his 18-year tenure on the Supreme \nCourt, has consistently given a thoughtful voice to the principles of \nfairness, equality, and the importance of precedent. He has always been \na consistent advocate for ``a philosophy of all philosophies'' which \nvalues fresh ideas, unique perspectives, and inclusive debate. As this \nbrilliant jurist moves into retirement, we must embrace his independent \nlegacy by confirming someone who will bring diversity, empathy, and a \npowerful intellect to the bench. In short, we must ensure that he or \nshe is worthy to be placed among the highest legal minds in the United \nStates of America.\n  As a former attorney general of Illinois, I can speak to the awesome \nimpact the Supreme Court has on ordinary citizens. It is a testament to \nthe enduring strength of our democracy that nine individuals, appointed \nand confirmed by representatives of the people, stand squarely at the \ncrossroads of justice. They are entrusted to navigate difficult legal \nground in order to distinguish right from wrong and to guard the \nsanctity of the Constitution. When any five of these individuals\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\ncome together to hand out a ruling, it becomes the law of the land. \nThere is no implicit threat of violence to back up these decisions--\nmerely the quiet force of a written opinion. That is the wonder of this \nthing called a democracy and the power of this Court.\n  This is a rare and remarkable opportunity for this body to have a \nvoice in shaping the highest court in the Nation--a court whose actions \nwill continue to reverberate across the legal landscape for future \ngenerations of Americans. With the full weight of this serious task \nresting on our shoulders, I ask my fellow Senators to ignore the \nmedia's idle speculation. Now is the time to exercise our \nconstitutional powers of advise and consent. The urgent needs of the \nAmerican people demand that we think outside of the box. We must \nconfirm an individual whose unique perspective can bring fresh \ndiversity into the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me in communicating to President Obama that we \nwill settle for nothing less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I will try to explain it in layman's terms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Sanders amendment move from first \nplace to second place and that the amendment offered by Senator Vitter, \nfrom Louisiana, be offered first, under the same conditions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1066\n\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the \nVitter amendment. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It simply \nempowers the FDIC to come up with appropriate regulations to ensure \nthat credit cards are only issued to folks who are in the country \nlegally, to ensure that we don't empower and facilitate illegal aliens \nand terrorists and keep them from getting credit cards, which can then \nbe used improperly. The 9/11 terrorists all did this successfully and \nall used credit cards in planning and plotting and hatching their \nscheme. It is also a boon to business for many banks that go after the \nillegal alien market with credit cards. That is unacceptable, and my \namendment would stop that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague wants to proceed a little \nlonger, this is a very important amendment. If he wants to spend \nanother minute or so talking about it, that is fine because I will need \nprobably more than a minute to respond. Would he like additional time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Not at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nwill explain why. The basic identity verification recordkeeping \nrequirement in this amendment is already included in section 326 of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act. It is redundant and not necessary on this amendment.\n  This bill is designed specifically to deal with credit card reform. A \nmatter such as this obviously belongs in a more appropriate place. \nAlso, the amendment would require card issuers to verify an applicant's \nidentity by obtaining a Social Security card, photo ID, driver's \nlicense, and a card issued by a State in compliance with the REAL ID \nAct.\n  There are legitimate issues about terrorism and illegal immigrants in \nthe country, but it seems to me when you already have provisions in the \nlaw that are specifically designed to protect the issues being raised \nby my friend--to add redundancy to a credit card bill, when we are \ntrying to make sure people can have credit, and make sure it is \nprovided in a way that is not abusive, with interest rate hikes, \npenalties, fees, and the like.\n  I say, with respect, to my friend that, presently, applications for \ncredit cards are currently taken by mail, by telephone, and on the \nInternet. This would force all applicants to physically go to the bank \nand present the required documents, which would cause a huge \ninconvenience to customers. I don't think that is in our best interest \nat this time. We are not trying to make it more difficult for people to \nhave access to credit cards. We want adequate information so decisions \ncan be made about their ability to repay, but we don't want to burden \nthem with unfair fines, penalties, fees, and high interest rates. This \nidea runs contrary to what we are trying to achieve with this bill.\n  I say, respectfully, that I oppose this amendment and ask my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have a few points, Mr. President. This amendment will \nabsolutely not require every applicant for a credit card to physically \ngo to the bank. That is absolutely, categorically not true.\n  Secondly, present law doesn't solve this problem. It is universally \nrecognized that illegal aliens, including terrorists, in this country, \ncan get a credit card. Present law isn't solving that problem.\n  I will submit for the Record this article from the Wall Street \nJournal which talks about this. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 13, 2007]\n\n             Bank of America Casts Wider Net for Hispanics\n\n                (By Miriam Jordan and Valerie Bauerlein)\n\n       Los Angeles.--In the latest sign of the U.S. banking \n     industry's aggressive pursuit of the Hispanic market, Bank of \n     America Corp. has quietly begun offering credit cards to \n     customers without Social Security numbers--typically illegal \n     immigrants.\n       In recent years, banks across the country have begun \n     offering checking accounts and, in some cases, mortgages to \n     the nation's fast-growing ranks of undocumented immigrants, \n     most of whom are Hispanic. But these immigrants generally \n     haven't been able to get major credit cards, making it hard \n     for them to develop a credit history and expand their \n     purchasing power.\n       The new Bank of America program is open to people who lack \n     both a Social Security number and a credit history, as long \n     as they have held a checking account with the bank for three \n     months without an overdraft. Most adults in the U.S. who \n     don't have a Social Security number are undocumented \n     immigrants.\n       The Charlotte, N.C., banking giant tested the program last \n     year at five branches in Los Angeles, and last week expanded \n     it to 51 branches in Los Angeles County, home to the largest \n     concentration of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The bank \n     hopes to roll out the program nationally later this year.\n       ``We are willing to grant credit to someone with little or \n     no credit history,'' says Lance Weaver, Bank of America's \n     head of international card services, whose team designed the \n     program based in part on the bank's experience in markets \n     like Spain, which lack conventional credit bureaus to rate a \n     client's credit-worthiness.\n       The credit cards involved aren't cheap. They come with a \n     high interest rate and an upfront fee. And the idea of \n     catering to illegal immigrants is controversial.\n       Bank of America defends the program, saying it complies \n     with U.S. banking and antiterrorism laws. Company executives \n     say that the initiative isn't about politics, but rather \n     about meeting the needs of an untapped group of potential \n     customers.\n       ``These people are coming here for quality of life, and \n     they deserve somebody to give them a chance to achieve that \n     quality of life,'' says Brian Tuite, the bank's director of \n     Latin America card operations and one of the architects of \n     the program.\n       Critics say Bank of America is knowingly making a product \n     available to people who are violating U.S. immigration law. \n     'They are clearly crossing the line; they are actually aiding \n     and abetting people who broke the law,'' says Ira Mehlman, a \n     spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, \n     a group that advocates a crackdown on illegal immigration.\n       Typical of the new card's customers is Antonio Sanchez, a \n     Mexican immigrant whose only major asset is a white 1996 Ford \n     Thunderbird, which he drives to the two restaurants where he \n     works each day on opposite sides of Los Angeles. Mr. Sanchez, \n     who says he sneaked across the border a decade ago, has been \n     a customer of Bank of America's East Hollywood branch for \n     nine years. He has no borrowing history and no Social \n     Security number.\n\n\n                            Paying Balances\n\n       To obtain a Bank of America Visa card with a $500 line of \n     credit, Mr. Sanchez had to put down $99. If he stays within \n     his $500 limit and pays his balances in a timely fashion, he\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n     will receive his $99 security payment back in three to six \n     months, and his credit limit might be increased.\n       * * *\n       David Robertson, publisher of the report, says a rate of \n     21.24% is ``unquestionably high.'' ``If that's the rate \n     you're offered, its a pretty safe bet you're in a high-risk \n     group,'' he said.\n       To assess an applicant, the bank employs ``judgmental \n     lending,'' a concept pioneered by MBNA Corp., the credit-card \n     company that Bank of America acquired in January 2006. In \n     essence, the bank bases its evaluation of a potential \n     client's credit-worthiness on a subjective review by its \n     employees, rather than on standardized financial data \n     crunched by a computer.\n       Unorthodox initiatives like the new credit-card program may \n     be crucial to Bank of America's long-term success. In the \n     past the bank, which operates in 31 states and the District \n     of Columbia, grew mostly by buying up other banks. Now, \n     however, it is bumping up against a regulatory cap that bars \n     any U.S. bank from an acquisition that would give it more \n     than 10% of the nation's total bank deposits. That means Bank \n     of America's only way to grow domestically is to sell more \n     products to existing customers and to attract new ones.\n\n\n                            Opening Accounts\n\n       Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank after \n     Citigroup Inc. in terms of market capitalization, estimates \n     that there are 28 million Hispanics in its operating area and \n     that most of them, regardless of their immigration status, \n     don't have a bank. It hopes the allure of a credit card will \n     persuade hundreds of thousands more Latinos to open accounts.\n       ``If we don't disproportionately grow in the Hispanic \n     [market] . . . we aren't going to grow'' as a bank, says Liam \n     McGee, Bank of America's consumer and small-business banking \n     chief.\n       Illegal immigrants have typically relied on loan sharks and \n     neighborhood finance shops for credit. But that has begun to \n     change. A few years ago, a handful of community banks in the \n     U.S. began offering mortgages to illegal immigrants, as long \n     as they could prove they had stable employment and paid U.S. \n     taxes with an individual tax identification number, or ITIN.\n       In December 2005, Wells Fargo & Co. began extending \n     mortgages to consumers with an ITIN. The bank is currently \n     evaluating a pilot program in Los Angeles and Orange counties \n     before deciding whether to expand it.\n       Department of Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said \n     banking products aimed at illegal immigrants ``reinforce the \n     need for a temporary worker program'' that the Bush \n     administration has been promoting. That program would screen, \n     tax and otherwise regulate immigrant workers and, the \n     administration contends, would squeeze out illegal workers \n     who now use forged or stolen documents to get jobs, driver's \n     licenses and occasionally credit.\n       Anti-money-laundering regulations passed in the wake of the \n     Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks put more pressure on banks to \n     verify customers' identity and watch for suspicious \n     transactions, but they don't require banks to ascertain \n     whether account holders are in the U.S. legally. Most banks \n     require a Social Security number or ITIN to open an account, \n     but regulations also allow them to accept other government-\n     issued forms of identification in some instances, including \n     passport numbers, alien identification numbers or any \n     government-issued document with photo showing nationality or \n     place of residence.\n       A handful of retailers, such as Los Angeles's closely held \n     La Curacao department store chain, have boosted their \n     business by cultivating illegal immigrants with store credit \n     cards. ``Once you capture them, they become very loyal,'' \n     says Ron Azarkman, chief executive of La Curacao, which has \n     developed its own in-house credit-ratings system. ``This is a \n     promising market, as long as it is carefully managed,'' he \n     says, adding that the average APR charged by his company is \n     22.9%.\n\n\n                             Word of Mouth\n\n       Bank of America hasn't launched an ad campaign for the new \n     card. For the time being, it is counting on word of mouth \n     that starts with its employees at each banking center. Many \n     of the Spanish-speaking account holders who come to teller \n     Luz Quintanilla's window at Bank of America's East Hollywood \n     branch, already have a Social Security number and regular \n     credit card with the bank. But she suggests in Spanish that \n     ``maybe you have family or friends who don't have a Social \n     Security number, but wish to build their credit.''\n       In selling the card, a major challenge is to persuade \n     immigrants who are sometimes wary of plastic that holding a \n     credit card is an important step on the way to obtaining \n     loans for big-ticket items, such as a car or even a home. \n     Pictures of a check book, credit card, car and house in \n     ascending order illustrate this concept one pamphlet in \n     Spanish and English titled ``How to Build Your Credit, Step \n     by Step.''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if this bill is about ending the problems \nthe credit card companies create, or take advantage of, certainly their \ngoing after illegal aliens as a niche market and a profit center is an \noffensive problem we need to address, particularly in a post-9/11 \nworld.\n  Fourth, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \nletter from the Eagle Forum declaring that this will be a scored vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 12, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the thousands of Eagle Forum \n     members nationwide, I urge your strong support of Senator \n     David Vitter's amendment to H.R. 627, the Credit Cardholder's \n     Bill of Rights.\n       Sen. Vitter's amendment would grant rule-making authority \n     to the Federal Reserve to set forth a minimum standard for \n     credit card issuers to establish a consumer's identity in \n     order to prevent and deter illegal immigrants and terrorists \n     from obtaining credit cards.\n       The regulations would simply require financial institutions \n     to do the following:\n       Verify the identity of any person seeking a credit card \n     account through one of four acceptable forms of \n     identification, including a social security card, a driver's \n     license issued by a state in compliance with the Real ID Act, \n     a passport, or a photo ID card issued by the Dept. of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Maintain records of the information used to verify the \n     customer's identity.\n       Consult lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist \n     organizations provided by the appropriate government agency.\n       Current loopholes in federal law are often abused by \n     financial institutions. In February 2007, the Wall Street \n     Journal reported that Bank of America Corp, in an effort to \n     expand their Hispanic consumer base, had quietly begun \n     offering credit cards to customers without Social Security \n     numbers, typically, illegal aliens. In order to get around \n     the verification requirements, Bank of America rewarded the \n     unidentifiable consumer with a credit card as long as they \n     had held a checking account with any bank for three months \n     without an overdraft violation. This program quickly spread \n     as common practice to 51 Bank of America branches throughout \n     the Los Angeles, CA area.\n       Not only will this amendment help to close dangerous \n     loopholes, but by requiring the use of the four most secure \n     types of personal identification, all Americans will be \n     protected, as these types of ID are harder to forge or \n     duplicate. This simple requirement will ensure that all \n     future credit card accounts are opened solely by legal \n     residents in the United States, and it will help curb the \n     tide of taxpayer-draining illegal immigration by removing the \n     magnet of easily obtainable credit.\n       Congressional leaders simply cannot allow banks to continue \n     the very practices that so greatly contributed to the U.S. \n     credit markets' current state. With the shrinking \n     availability of credit today, the very least congressional \n     leaders can do is ensure that American citizens are being \n     placed before illegals, criminals, and terrorists.\n       I ask that you join us in supporting Sen. Vitter's \n     amendment by voting yes when it is brought to a vote, and by \n     opposing any efforts to kill it. Eagle Forum will score this \n     vote, which will be included on our scorecard for the 1st \n     session of the 111th Congress.\n           Faithfully,\n                                                 Phyllis Schlafly,\n                                              President & Founder.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is not my opinion that this would require \npeople to show up physically. This is the opinion of the Treasury \nDepartment. We asked them to comment on this, and they told us that. \nThe elderly, the handicapped, and those in rural areas are going to be \nadversely affected if this were to be adopted. It is duplicative, \nredundant, and unnecessary. It adds tremendous burdens on certain \nsegments of this country. Credit cards are valuable instruments during \ndifficult economic times.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. VITTER. The amendment is only 2\\1/2\\ pages long. What language \nrequires an applicant to physically show up before a bank or a credit \ncard issuer?\n  Mr. DODD. It is not the length of the amendment. Sometimes one or two \nwords can have huge implications. We asked Treasury how they would \ninterpret this, and they claim this would require the physical presence \nof an applicant. That is one of their concerns.\n  As long as that is a concern and it raises that possibility, adopting \nthis, which could result in that, it seems to me would be an \nirresponsible action for this body to take.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is 2\\1/2\\ pages long, and \nthere is no language in it that requires their physical presence. I \nknow this administration is opposed to the amendment, but this is \nsimply a smokescreen. I invite Members to actually read the amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Vitter \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from \nMaryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider that vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1062\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a 302(f) point of \norder is considered made against Sanders amendment No. 1062.\n  There are 4 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation \nthereto.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 1062 and send to the desk the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This amendment is being cosponsored by Senators Harkin, \nDurbin, Levin, Leahy, and Senator Whitehouse. It is not being supported \nby the American Bankers Association and the other financial \ninstitutions that have spent $5 billion in the last 10 years to push \ntheir interests against the needs of the American people.\n  This amendment is, in fact, very simple. It says now is the time to \nend usury in the United States of America. Now is the time to protect \nthe American people against 25, 30 percent or more interest rates on \ntheir credit cards.\n  It says now, when the American taxpayer is spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars bailing out Wall Street, they should not be lending \nthe American people their own money at usurious rates.\n  When banks are charging 30 percent interest rates, they are not \nmaking credit available; they are engaged in loansharking. That is what \nthey are engaged in, and we should be very clear about that. Now is the \ntime to eliminate that behavior.\n  We picked a number, a maximum of 15 percent plus 3 percent, under \nextraordinary circumstances, not because it came out of the top of my \nhead but because credit unions in this country have been operating \nunder that law for 30 years. And you know what. It has worked well.\n  It was not the credit unions coming in here for billions of dollars \nin bailouts; they are doing very well. This law has worked for credit \nunions; it should work for large financial institutions. Let's stand up \nfor the American people. Let's put a cap on interest rates, 15 percent \nplus 3.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, once again supported \nby Senators Harkin, Durbin, Levin, Leahy, and Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1085\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a \nvote in relation to the Gregg amendment No. 1085.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is appropriate to this bill \nbecause, after all, we are talking about credit in this bill, and the \ncredit of the United States is obviously a severe issue for all of us, \nand we need to address it.\n  This amendment simply gives the American people a better opportunity \nto learn what is happening to their Government and how much debt is \nbeing run up on them and their children. It is an issue of transparency \nand\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nopenness in our Government. The debt is the threat, and it is one of \nthose occasional, brilliant ideas that come along every so often, so \neverybody should vote for it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are very few Members for whom I have \nmore affection or respect than Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. But I think \nthis amendment, first of all, has no place on this bill. It is \nunnecessary and raises some very serious, legitimate issues. Let me \npoint them out.\n  First of all, it is going to be costly to do this: every agency to \nreport what the national debt is. The number is absolutely worthless by \nthe time you publish it because the national debt rises, of course, \nevery nanosecond. So to have that idea what it is also gives you a \nfalse illusion of actually where we are.\n  The level of public cynicism about this issue is getting almost \ninsurmountable. It seems to me we need to be far more realistic. There \nare other costs, as well, in addition to the debt that people care \nabout. Why not have a tuition cost clock? Why not have a health care \ncost clock? These matters go up all the time as well. It seems to me \nthat by adding something such as this, we are just adding to that \nillusion, adding to that cynicism at a time when there are plenty of \nplaces where you can get this information--certainly the Congressional \nBudget Office as well.\n  So while this amendment has been adopted in the past because it seems \nrelatively harmless, the fact is, I think it is an idea that can \nactually raise costs and create false illusions. Certainly consumers \nought to have some idea about some of these other costs, which I would \nobject to. If you had a health care cost clock, a tuition cost clock, \nan energy cost clock, it could contribute to those problems. So I urge \nthat the amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to waive section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 59, the nays are \n35. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments, if I can, \nregarding previous debates.\n  Our colleague from Vermont offered an amendment to deal with caps on \ninterest rates and that failed on a point of order. I know there are \nothers who have various ideas about this issue. It is a legitimate \nissue, and I want my colleagues to know this. It is a complicated \nissue, because dealing with credit cards, dealing with payday lenders, \ndealing with all sorts of different entities, the matter of what is an \nexcessive interest rate is one that many Americans care deeply about \nand one where they wish to see some restraint.\n  It is legitimate to point out that there are interest rates being \nimposed today that you would have gone to jail for imposing not many \nyears ago. In fact, it would make a loan shark blush, some of these \ninterest rates that are being charged. So what I intend to do at some \npoint, because I realize when you look at the votes, there were only \nabout 30 votes dealing with the point of order dealing with the motion \nof the Senator from Vermont. But I think a lot of my colleagues do not \nfeel his desire was illegitimate; they were concerned about whether the \nrate was too low or how it would apply.\n  So I am going to propose--I hope along with my friend and colleague \nfrom Alabama--to ask either the Federal Reserve, or whatever else is \nthe appropriate place, to come back and give us a comprehensive review \nof what national rates there ought to be.\n  This idea that you can end up charging in effect 200, 300, or 400 \npercent interest rates, which is what has happened in some cases, is \noffensive, to put it mildly. It ought to be wrong and illegal, and \npeople ought not to be able to get away with it.\n  I think it is difficult for my colleagues to determine what is that \nlevel and what institutions, and under what financial circumstances, do \nyou apply it to. I realize a payday lender lends money for a week or \ntwo, not annually. So the interest rate will be different than on a \ncredit card, on a home mortgage, or what it is apt to be with a credit \nunion. With various institutions, under various circumstances, rates \ncan differ.\n  It is confusing, except that most constituents and millions of \nAmericans would like to see some restraint. I don't know how you can \npossibly explain why some institutions can get away with rates that are \nliterally triple digits in some cases. I don't think we are going to \nresolve that matter on this bill. But we ought to have some clear idea \nof how to put some restraints on national usury laws. I am not a Bible \nscholar, but for those who are, I am sure they can recite chapter and \nverse in the Old and New Testaments when it comes to the usurious rates \nthat were being charged by money changers and the like.\n  At the appropriate time, I will propose an amendment that will allow \nus to get back to people in a short period with some analysis of how to \nimpose some meaningful restraints on what is charged to consumers for \nthe privilege of borrowing money when they need it, as so many do, to \npay tuition, pay mortgages, keep the business operating and deal with \nthe health care crisis, or just to survive week to week. People have \nbeen taken advantage of under circumstances that are deplorable, in my \nview, when the rates are particularly beyond excessive.\n  I think one should not read the outcome of the Sanders vote as a \nrejection of the idea that applying some standards of fairness is \nunacceptable to this body. I believe a lot of Members voted against \nwaiving the budget point of order not because they disagreed with what \nhe is trying to do. I would not want that vote to reflect that. I \nsupport Senator Sanders, as I did on the budget debate, not because I \nnecessarily agreed with the number he had in mind, but because it is an \nimportant debate and he should have had the right to be able to proceed \nwith his amendment. I wanted to make that point overall. I think it \nwould be a false impression to walk away and say\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\nthe Senate rejected any idea of considering some sort of a national \nusury rate because they rejected the waiver of the point of order that \nSenator Sanders offered.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana, who I think wants to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1079\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments about \nan amendment that I ask be called up, amendment No. 1079.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Cardin, and Mrs. Shaheen, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1079 to amendment No. 1058.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To end abuse, promote disclosure, and provide protections to \n              small businesses that rely on credit cards)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. EXTENDING TILA CREDIT CARD PROTECTIONS TO SMALL \n                   BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) Definition of Consumer.--Section 103(h) of the Truth in \n     Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602(h)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(h)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of any provision of this title relating \n     to a credit card account under an open end credit plan, the \n     term `consumer' includes any business concern having 50 or \n     fewer employees, whether or not the credit account is in the \n     name of the business entity or an individual, or whether or \n     not a subject credit transaction is for business or personal \n     purposes.''.\n       (b) Amendment to Exemptions.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 104 of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1603) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting after ``agricultural \n     purposes'' the following: ``(other than a credit transaction \n     under an open end credit plan in which the consumer is a \n     small business having 50 or fewer employees)''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (4), by striking ``$25,000'' and inserting \n     ``$50,000''.\n       (2) Business credit card provision.--Section 135 of the \n     Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1645) is amended by inserting \n     after ``does not apply'' the following: ``with respect to any \n     provision of this title relating to a credit card account \n     under an open end credit plan in which the consumer is a \n     small business having 50 or fewer employees or''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call this amendment up for discussion \npurposes. I am open to some modification. I want to explain, basically, \nthis amendment. I have spoken with the chairman of the committee that \nhas proposed the underlying bill. He sees merit in this proposal, and I \nam grateful for that. I want to talk about what the issue is, \ngenerally, and then as we proceed to a final vote, I may be open to \nsome modification of this amendment.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and my ranking member, Senator Snowe from Maine, who \nserved for many years as chair of this important committee. We have \ncommitted to try to be the very best advocates we can for small \nbusinesses in America. There are close to 30 million small businesses \nthat are actually feeling the brunt of this recession--in some ways \nmore than anybody, as the Chair knows. In Illinois, I am sure the \noccupant of the chair hears on a regular basis from small mom-and-pop \noperators who have been in business for decades, to the more \nestablished but relatively small businesses, restaurants, shoe repair \nshops, hardware stores--people who have said to me--and I am sure he \nhears this--``Senator, we have never experienced this kind of \ndifficulty getting access to credit.'' They are angry, and they should \nbe. They are frustrated, because while they understand shared \nsacrifice, like many hard-working Americans do, they are having trouble \nunderstanding how we continue to send billions and billions of dollars \nto the big banks, the Wall Street companies, to the international \ncompanies, and they are having trouble seeing any of that actually hit \nMain Street, where they are, where they have been, and where they want \nto stay.\n  The small businesses are right around the corner and, in some \ninstances, on the same block as the constituents whom we represent--of \ncourse, we represent them as well. It came to the attention of this \nChair and our ranking member that this bill, which has a lot of merit--\nthis amendment to consumer protection language is very important, but \nit has a limit that we are not comfortable with. That limit is that \nthis credit card protection extends only to a natural person, what is \ndefined in the law as a natural person. So it is a personal credit card \nthat you would get that would get this benefit. I think, as chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, representing a broad coalition, that this \nsame benefit should extend at least to small businesses as well, to \nbusinesses that are literally trying to keep their access to capital--\nnot just to keep themselves in business, to keep their communities \nstrong, but to lead our Nation's recovery. The President himself has \nsaid he expects that in our recovery--and he is correct--job creation \nis not going to come from the big businesses, the multinational \ncompanies; they are going to be contracting for some time, I suspect. \nWhat big business has to do to survive--I have some general \nunderstanding of that, but the big risks are going to be taken by the \nsmall entrepreneurs who, despite the gloom and doom, have decided their \nideas are worth pursuing, and they are going to build this recovery one \njob at a time.\n  I don't know why we would even be considering only limiting this help \nand support to private individuals and leaving small business out. I \ndon't think that is the intention of the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, as he has indicated to me. So that is basically what our \namendment would do. It would simply include small businesses that have \n$25,000 on their credit card, where they are trying to stay in \nbusiness, keep their lights on, keep that capital flowing, as other \nsources dry up, as we have heard, and extend the same protections to \nthem.\n  I am open to some slight modifications because I understand there may \nbe some objections. I am not clear about where those objections would \ncome from. So right now, let me say again that I offered this in a \nbipartisan amendment from Senator Snowe and myself. I am happy also \nthat we are joined by Senators Shaheen, Cardin, and others, who have \nindicated they may want to cosponsor this amendment.\n  I have a long list of organizations that have endorsed this concept. \nI will read them into the Record. The Consumer Action Group; Consumer \nFederation of America; Food Marketing Institute; National Association \nof College Stores; National Association of the Self Employed; National \nAssociation of Theater Owners; American Beverage Licensees; American \nSociety of Travel Agents; National Small Business Association, which \nbrought this issue to my attention; Petroleum Marketers Association; \nService Employees International; U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; \nU.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce; National Consumer Law Center on \nBehalf of Low-Income Clients; National Community Reinvestment \nCoalition. I understand that also the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, the largest organization of independent \nbusinesses in the country, is poised to endorse this as well.\n  So we have a very credible group of organizations that think these \nprotections for credit cardholders should not go to persons but to \nbusinesses that arguably need as much, if not more, protection as they \nattempt to create jobs and keep their businesses open, which is a help \nto all. So that is the nature of this amendment.\n  I understand that it is important to bring this debate to a close \nand, hopefully, we can get there. I do know there are probably 30 other \namendments pending and this, of course, is one. I am sure we can find a \ntime that is appropriate for this vote.\n  I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senate that one of the \nreasons this issue is becoming so important to small businesses is, if \nyou think about it, only 15 years ago, most people who started their \nown business would either take out a home equity loan or they might \nborrow money from a rich uncle or aunt or they would dip into their \nsavings, and this was sort of the traditional way. If they had some \nstatus or credit in the community, they could go to their local bank \nand they might get a loan for their business.\n  Those times have changed dramatically. I don't have the charts here, \nbut if I could show one, it would show that on the latest survey our \ncommittee took, 59 percent of all businesses in\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nAmerica are using credit cards to finance their business or for their \nprimary cash flow tool. Credit cards for businesses are different. We \njust had American Express testify this morning. Of course, if you have \nan American Express business card, their model is different. The good \nnews is that you have unlimited amounts of money that you can borrow. \nThe bad news is that you have to pay it off at the end of the month. So \nit is more of a cash management tool than it is long-term \ncredit. However, they are useful. But there are Visas and Master Charge \nand Discover cards and others that people are now putting $50,000 on \nthe card or $75,000 on the card or $100,000 on the card to finance \ntheir restaurants and their printing shops and their hardware stores.\n\n  This was not true even 25 years ago. This was quite unheard of. So we \nhave to recognize that small businesses today are relying on the good \nwill of these credit card companies. Some of them are more reliable, in \nmy view, than others. But regardless of whether they are doing \nexcellent work or shoddy work--and some of them are doing shoddy work--\nthis Government has an obligation to say let's make sure the basic \nconsumer protections are there. You cannot raise rates without giving \nnotice. You cannot retroactively raise rates. What we are doing for \nconsumers is good. We need to extend it to small business.\n  That is the essence of this amendment. I am proud to be joined by \nMembers from both sides of the aisle. I am going to be talking with the \nchair of the committee. There perhaps could be some modifications where \nwe could agree to this amendment and not have to have a vote, but I \ndon't know. Right now I am intending to have a vote on this amendment.\n  I appreciate the thousands of business owners who are supporting this \namendment through these very reputable organizations that are \nsupporting the extension of these benefits to the small businesses of \nAmerica that absolutely need our action on this, this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1107 to Amendment No. 1058\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 1107 to amendment \n     No. 1058.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To address criminal and fraudulent monetary transfers using \n            stored value cards and other electronic devices)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. STORED VALUE CARDS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 5312(a) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)(K), by inserting ``stored value \n     devices,'' after ``money orders,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3)(B), by striking ``; and'' at the end \n     and inserting ``, and stored value devices and any other \n     similar money transmitting devices;'';\n       (3) in paragraph (3)(C), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and'';\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) as the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide by \n     regulation for purposes of sections 5316 and 5331 of this \n     title, stored value devices, or other similar money \n     transmitting devices (as defined by regulation of the \n     Secretary for such purposes), unless the Secretary, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n     determines that a particular device, based on other \n     applicable laws, is subject to additional security measures \n     that obviate the need for such regulations as it relates to \n     that device.''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(7) `Stored value' means funds or monetary value \n     represented in digital electronics format (whether or not \n     specially encrypted) and stored or capable of storage on \n     electronic media in such a way as to be retrievable and \n     transferable electronically.''.\n       (b) Criminal Penalties.--Title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in section 1956(c)(5)(i), by striking ``and money \n     orders, or'' and inserting ``money orders, stored value \n     devices, and any other similar money transmitting devices, \n     or''; and\n       (2) in section 1960(b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)(C), by inserting ``, including funds \n     on fraudulently issued stored value devices and funds on \n     stored value devices issued anonymously for the purpose of \n     evading monetary reporting requirements,'' after ``funds''; \n     and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or courier'' and \n     inserting ``courier, or issuance, redemption, or sale of \n     stored value devices or other similar instruments''.\n       (c) Money Transmitting Businesses.--Section 5330(d)(1)(A) \n     of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     ``stored value devices,'' after ``travelers checks,''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, stored value cards have been used and are \nbeing used by Mexican drug cartels to smuggle their drug revenues back \nto Mexico. The Department of Justice estimates that up to $24 billion \nin cash is smuggled into Mexico each year from the United States and \nthese stored value cards are one of the means by which the cash is \nsmuggled back into Mexico. Stored value cards can be loaded anonymously \nby individuals who are involved in criminal enterprises, such as drug \ntrafficking. The cards are then physically smuggled across the border \nand can be used to withdraw large quantities of cash from ATMs.\n  Under current law, cash and other monetary instruments that exceed \n$10,000 must be declared at the border. For those of us who have \ntraveled to different countries, we are very familiar with the white \nform you have to fill out in which you have to indicate if you have \ncash that exceeds $10,000.\n  However, there is a loophole in the current law. Stored value cards, \neither individually or collectively in excess of $10,000, do not have \nto be reported because they are not considered to be monetary \ninstruments under the law. The amendment Senator Lieberman and I are \noffering would require such reporting and make it a crime to launder \nmoney using these stored value cards.\n  The Deputy Attorney General of the United States has pointed out that \nlarge quantities of cash are put together and smuggled across the \nborder to the south. He has pointed out that there are various ways \nthis can be accomplished but that stored value cards are one of the \nmeans for smuggling this cash.\n  Mr. President, as you know as a loyal and diligent member of the \nHomeland\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nSecurity Committee, our committee has been investigating the problem of \ndrug trafficking from these Mexican cartels. What we found is the drugs \nare coming north and cash and weapons are going south. By closing the \nloophole on reporting for large quantities of cash that are being \nsmuggled back and forth using these stored value cards, we can help \ngive law enforcement another tool to crack down on the smuggling of \ncash that is often the proceeds of criminal activity, including drug \nsmuggling.\n  This is not just theoretical. It is not only the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral who has pointed out that these cards can be a means of \nsmuggling large quantities of cash but also law enforcement agents \nthroughout the United States have been investigating criminal \nenterprises that are using these cards. Let me give a couple of \nexamples.\n  Law enforcement agents in Dallas have been investigating a Colombian \nnarcotrafficking organization that wanted to launder narcotic proceeds \nvia stored value cards. The organization wanted to obtain 50 stored \nvalue cards that would be used to launder $100,000 in proceeds. These \ntransactions would be structured in different increments per card for \nthe total of $100,000. The cards would then be exported out of the \nUnited States to Colombia. The cards would be cashed out in Colombia \nand the dollar value would be converted to Colombian pesos at the \nofficial exchange rate.\n  In another example, law enforcement undercover operations have \nrevealed at least nine transnational criminal groups engaged in moving \ncriminal proceeds via stored value cards. These operations have \nrevealed the cross-border movement of stored value cards loaded with \nmillions of dollars of illicit proceeds. Numerous collateral \ninvestigations and enforcement actions have been conducted as a result \nof these undercover activities.\n  This is a loophole in our laws we need to plug and the Collins-\nLieberman amendment would do that. It would treat these cards as the \nequivalent of cash because that is what they are. That is what they \nare. It would require that, just as if you crossed the border with \n$10,000 in cash or other monetary instruments you have to declare it, \nso would you have to declare it if you have these stored value cards. \nIn addition, it would make a failure to report the amount of money on \nthese cards, if it is $10,000 or more, as a crime, and it would also \nmake it a crime to launder money using these cards.\n  This is a very concrete, needed action that we could take to help \ncrack down on the smuggling of money that fuels the drug trafficking \nacross the Mexican border. It is a very practical step we can take \nright now to close a loophole in the law and to provide law enforcement \nwith a much-needed tool.\n  I know the managers of the bill are not on the floor at present so I \nwill withhold asking for a vote on this amendment. I do believe we are \nin the process of clearing it on both sides, but I am uncertain whether \nthat has been completed. It may be that the acting manager of the bill \ncan inform me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I appreciate that from the Senator from \nMaine. The manager of the bill, the Senator from Connecticut, will be \nreturning shortly.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the Presiding Officer, be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment, and I thank him very much for his support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, l rise today to congratulate Chairman Dodd \nand Senator Shelby for developing the legislation we have before us. \nPass this bill, and we will be able to go home and tell our \nconstituents with confidence that the Credit CARD Act of 2009 is a \ngroundbreaking consumer protection achievement. I am pleased that, as a \nmember of the Banking Committee, I was able to vote for the bill in \ncommittee and help pave the way for floor consideration this week.\n  In my travels around Colorado, I have been struck by stories of \nunfair, undeserved credit card practices, hitting consumers at exactly \nthe hardest time. Melissa Mosley of Durango, CO, told me about how \ntough economic times forced her to use several credit cards for \npurchasing supplies and day-to-day expenses for her small business. \nAfter a stretch of making minimum payments, Melissa's interest rates \nsuddenly rose, one even reaching 32 percent. The company is refusing to \nnegotiate, making it even more difficult for Melissa and her husband to \nmake ends meet.\n  And in Cedaredge, Joy Beason is a small business owner who runs a \nsmall herbal products business. Last fall, Joy's interest rates tripled \nfrom 7.9 percent to 23 percent without notification of any kind. The \nhigh interest rates prevent her from paying down more of the principal \non the card, leaving her in an endless cycle of debt.\n  And there's Garrett Mumma of Pueblo whose interest rate on his credit \ncard doubled from 7.9 percent to 13.65 percent despite his solid \nhistory of payment. In a letter to me, Garrett wrote, ``I only want \nwhat's fair. I want the credit card companies to honor their original \nagreements and not to gouge the American people when they are already \nsuffering so much from the present economic crisis.''\n  These struggles paint an unacceptable picture. We need to rein in \nabusive practices and create a new set of rules that works for Colorado \nconsumers.\n  According to a Pew Safe Credit Cards Project study, 87 percent of \ncards allowed the issuer to impose automatic penalty interest rate \nincreases on all balances, even if the account is not 30 days or more \npast due. And 93 percent of cards allowed the issuer to raise any \ninterest rate at any time by changing the account agreement.\n  I am voting for this bill because it protects consumers from \nexcessive fees, ever-changing interest rates where you do not even get \nnotice, and complex contracts intended to confuse you until you give up \neven trying to understand.\n  It protects consumers by establishing fair and sensible rules for how \nand when credit card companies can raise interest rates. Card companies \nmust give 45 days' notice before increasing rates, and can no longer do \nso on existing balances.\n  It cracks down on abusive fees. Consumers no longer will have to pay \na fee just to pay a bill. And credit card companies must mail \nstatements 21 days before the bill is due, instead of the current 14 \ndays, so cardholders can avoid hefty late fees. It also stops credit \ncard companies from raising rates on a consumer's existing balance \nbecause of a payment issue with a separate credit card. These reforms \nwill save some families thousands of dollars a year. And all Americans \nwill be able to access better information to make important financial \ndecisions.\n  I also want to take one moment in particular to highlight the \nimportance of a new provision in the bill that connects the dots for \nsome of our younger borrowers. The bill provides for consumer literacy \neducation classes, so that when a young person does not have a parental \ncosigner, and cannot show ability to repay, they can at the very least \napproach the credit card system with some understanding of the \npotential dangers they are facing. I am all for consumer choice, but we \nneed our young people making informed choices before they find \nthemselves in a world of debt.\n  I believe more educated young consumers will stay solvent, stay debt \nfree, learn the value of saving, and make better decisions for their \nfuture.\n  At the same time, this legislation is not doing anything that the \nindustry has not known was coming. It builds on rules that the Bush \nadministration scheduled to go into effect in mid-2010.\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nThe industry will adjust. In a few instances, it may not be seamless. \nBut this is one moment when we all need to band together and remember \nthat Main Street matters.\n  People in Colorado are struggling, they cannot afford a sudden hike \nin their interest rates that they were not informed of and could not do \nanything to avoid. No longer. I stand proudly with Senator Udall, who \nhas worked to protect consumers from credit card company excesses for \nyears, in urging the full Senate to stand together, break through the \npartisan divide and come together and pass the Dodd-Shelby legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before our colleague from Colorado departs \nthe floor, I want to thank him. I mentioned Senator Bennet earlier \ntoday in my comments about some new additional Members: Senator Merkley \nand Senator Warner.\n  I say to the people of Colorado, as I did earlier about our colleague \nfrom Oregon, we are so fortunate to have the Senator in the Chamber at \nthis time. I feel particularly fortunate to have the Senator as a \nmember of the Banking Committee. I served on the committee for some \nyears. I have never been chairman before 2007, the last Congress. I \nhave served under a lot of people on that committee over the years.\n  I hope not just the people of Colorado but the people of the country \nunderstand how fortunate we are indeed to have someone of Michael \nBennet's talents and background to be a member of this committee. He is \na junior member of the committee, but his ideas, his thoughts, his \nquestions, and his participation qualify him as a senior member of that \ncommittee because of the contribution he has already made in little \nmore than 100 days of being on the committee.\n  So I thank him for his involvement on this bill. He is thoughtful. We \nhave some major issues to grapple with in the coming weeks. The \nmodernization of our financial regulatory structure and the \narchitecture of that is going to be one of the largest and most \nimportant debates this committee and maybe this Congress will have \nengaged in in years, considering how important financial services are \nto our economy and the world's financial stability.\n  Michael Bennet brings to that chair he sits in as a junior member of \nthe committee years of valuable experience in helping us decide what \nsteps we should take, the configuration that architecture should be, so \nthat we can move ahead with thoughtfulness and with a certain amount of \ncare and caution as we try to set up a system that will avoid the \npitfalls that created the problems we are in today.\n  So I am particularly grateful to him for his involvement on this \nbill. But I would be remiss if I did not say to my colleague, Michael \nBennet, he has been a significant contributor to the work of this \ncommittee since the moment he arrived. I thank him for that and \nappreciate his continuing involvement. I am grateful to the Senator for \nhis support of this bill. I look forward to working with him for a long \ntime to come on these and other matters before the committee. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  I want to also kind of review the bidding a bit as to where we are \nthis evening. I will begin by thanking the majority leader, Senator \nHarry Reid of Nevada, who has created the possibility for us to bring \nup this important piece of legislation.\n  While my name and that of Senator Shelby are at the top of the page \nas the authors of the substitute, that is an unfair characterization \nbecause so many people have been involved on our committee, and others \nin this Chamber, who care about these issues and have for a long time.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Shelby, with whom I work very closely \non the Banking Committee, and his staff and how well they work with \nmine in helping to shape a bill like this, a substitute like this.\n  We are dealing with some very egregious violations of consumer \nprotection. They did not happen overnight; they have been growing over \nthe years; and they reached a point where I cannot think of anyone who \nhas not been either affected directly themselves or had family members \nor children or their parents or neighbors and friends adversely \naffected by these practices by the issuing community generally.\n  There are some who do a very good job. I probably should say this \nmore frequently. We talk about the credit card issuers, the credit card \ncompanies. The behavior is not only unacceptable, it is not only \nirresponsible, it is offensive. There are other ones that do a good \njob.\n  Like all matters before us, when we talk about an industry, there are \nthose who perform admirably and well and care about the people they \nserve, and there are others who could care less what happens as long as \nthey get money out of the pockets of those to whom they have lent some \nmoney.\n  But we write laws to protect those people against those who would do \nthem harm. So we are trying to shut down a practice that goes on too \noften: when there are 70 million accounts whose rates have gone up in \nan 11-month period; when there are fees and penalties that have brought \nin billions of dollars, exorbitant fees and penalties, way beyond any \nproportionality to the offense committed--of being a day late, an hour \nlate, in some cases, for the first time ever.\n  Samantha and Don Moore from Guilford, CT, were here today to talk \nabout their experience. I have listened to them in the past. It showed \ncourage for them to step up. For 40 years--40 years--Don Moore has been \ndoing business with his credit card company, 40 years. Without any \nviolation, any late fees whatever, one time 3 days late, around the \nChristmas season, the Moores found that their interest rate went from \n12 percent to 27 percent; their credit limit from $32,000 to $4,000.\n  The Moores run a small business in my State. They use their credit \ncard as a way to function in their small business. They pay their \nemployees; they buy inventory. Without any real violation other than to \nbe a few days late for the first time in 40 years, the Moores watched \ntheir rate double, more than double, from 12 percent to 27 percent and \nwatched their credit limit drop from $32,000 to $4,000.\n  That is the kind of behavior that is not the rare exception. \nVirtually every one of my colleagues can tell similar stories about \npeople in their States.\n  I know the Presiding Officer could as well from the State of \nIllinois. May 13, as we gather a day or so away from adopting \nlegislation that will prohibit those practices, that you cannot change \nthese rates arbitrarily. You get notice of 45 days. These introductory \nrates have to be in place for at least 6 months before you can change \nthem. You must notify a person of late penalties or fees 21 days in \nadvance, giving people opportunity to respond; no charging higher \ninterest rates on existing balances the way they do today; no raising \nrates because you may be late on a utility bill or a car payment having \nnothing to do with your credit card; no continuing to charge rates when \nyou have paid off a substantial part of your balance and a small amount \nremains and yet the card applies that interest payment on the entire \namount you owed earlier.\n  For example, you owe $1,000, you pay off $900, the credit card \ncompanies were actually charging interest rates not based on the $100 \nthat remains but on the full $1,000 until all of it is paid off. Those \nare not isolated examples of abuses by credit card companies. They are \nwidespread. There are other such examples that go on that have been \nvery harmful to consumers.\n  In this legislation, we give the consumer the power to decide what \nthe circumstances are as to whether they want a credit limit or whether \nthey want that limit to be exceeded. I remember the days not long ago \nwhen if you exceeded your credit limit, the clerk in that store or that \nwaiter in the restaurant might politely suggest the credit limit has \nbeen exceeded and you might want to return the product. It is more \ndifficult in a restaurant since the bill usually arrives at the end of \nthe meal, but, nonetheless, I am sure many who may be listening can \nrecall similar instances. That is no longer the case because the \nissuing companies have discovered they make a lot more money by \ncharging exorbitant fees and penalties because you might be $10 or $20 \nor $50 over your limit.\n  The point there is a legitimacy in their mind to absolutely load you \nup with penalties and fees. In fact, they welcome the opportunity that \nyou may be a little bit over your credit limit,\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nrather than being responsible and giving you the opportunity to decide \nwhether you want to actually acquire that particular good or purchase. \nToday we have changed that. We let the consumer decide. We begin by \nsaying there will be credit limits. If you want to opt out of that, you \ncan. But it gives you the opportunity to be notified when you are going \nto exceed that limit so you don't find yourself behind the 8 ball and \npaying penalties you would rather not pay and would like to be notified \nwhen that is the case.\n  Imagine this: Here we are a decade into the 21st century. My 7-year-\nold runs a computer at home. My 4-year-old is trying to figure it out. \nCredit card companies want to charge fees if you pay your bills \nelectronically. You can file your income taxes, you can engage in all \nsorts of economic behavior through the Internet today. But credit card \ncompanies want to penalize you if you pay your bills electronically or \nby phone or by some other means other than mail. Again, it is a further \negregious example of an industry that is more interested in trying to \ntrip you up, trying to make it more costly for you to use their cards \nthan they are trying to assist you economically.\n  I could go on for the entire rest of the evening citing story after \nstory in my State, as I am sure every other Member could, examples of \nabusive, outrageous behavior.\n  We have spent a long time over these last number of weeks and months \ntalking about what needs to be done to get banks and other financial \ninstitutions in shape. I don't regret that. That was the right thing to \ndo. But it is long overdue that we also try to do something on behalf \nof the people who utilize these services, whether it is trying to \nmitigate foreclosure of their homes or trying to see to it they don't \nget ripped off by a credit card company. In the next 48 hours, we are \ngoing to do that for the first time in the history of this body.\n  Twenty years ago, I started on this issue. I never got much more than \n30 votes. When the bankruptcy reform bill was up, I tried to deal with \ncredit cards. It got 32 votes. I tried to do some of the things for \nwhich I believe we will have an overwhelming vote in the next day or \nso. I believe our constituents will welcome the fact that the Senate of \nthe United States, along with the other body which has acted on this \nissue already, is responding to their concerns. They are talking about \nit every day. They are wondering whether their interests will be part \nof this debate. This bill may not do everything everyone would like, \nbut I believe it is a major step in the right direction. It addresses \nmany of the major concerns raised over these many weeks and months and \nyears that these matters have been growing in terms of their impact on \npeople and their ability to survive on a daily basis economically.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from the Banking Committee, Democrats \nand Republicans, Senator Shelby, former chairman of the committee. We \ngot it out of committee by one vote. The Presiding Officer is a member \nof the committee. By a vote of 11 to 12 we happen to be here. We would \nhave lost this issue had we lost one other vote. But our colleagues in \nthe committee stood with us and, by the thinnest of margins, we were \ngiven the right to be here tonight to talk about this.\n  The vote of this body will be far greater than a one-vote margin when \nit comes to passing this legislation. We have an American President who \nhas been utilizing the Office of the Presidency to talk about this \nissue. He has had press conferences, met with consumers. He talked \nabout it on his radio broadcast on Saturday. He is creating the kind of \nenvironment where this legislation will become the law of the land.\n  I may not get many more opportunities, with the amendments to be \nconsidered tomorrow, to address the overall consideration of this bill.\n  Let me say that to the card companies as well, I appreciate the fact \nthat they have been at the table as we have worked through this. I have \nnot isolated them. I allowed them to make their cases where we were \ndoing things that may have gone further in terms of serving the needs \nof our consumers and constituents. This is a bipartisan bill. That is \nsomething I try to achieve on every matter I am involved in directly. I \ndon't think you can do much in this Chamber without having to reach out \nto each other and listen. We have done that.\n  To Senator Shelby's great credit, he has joined in this effort so we \nhave the bipartisanship our colleagues seek. I believe we will pass \nthis legislation and provide some relief for the people of our country \nat a time when they need it desperately. There has never been a moment \nin recent past history when constituents and the citizens of this \ncountry needed more help from their Government, whether it is home \nforeclosures, a loss of jobs, tuition, health care problems--all of \nthose issues are affecting millions of people. While this bill will not \nsolve all the problems, for the first time ever it will provide some \nrelief in a very important area--the availability of credit and the use \nof credit cards and the need that people have on a daily basis to have \naccess to that credit to provide for themselves and their families.\n  I see my good friend and colleague from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from Connecticut and \nextend to him appreciation for an outstanding job with this credit card \nbill. He has done outstanding work bringing the parties together, \nputting together a bipartisan effort. I congratulate him on that and \nlook forward to having him move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5429-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5429-S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEASURING PROGRESS IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN\n\n  Tonight I rise to discuss the administration's supplemental funding \nrequest for the ongoing challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The \nadministration is putting in place a new strategy for that region, and \nit comes at a crucial time. U.S. diplomats, military servicemembers, \nhumanitarian groups, and our coalition partners have all worked to \nbattle terrorists and establish more stability in that region since the \nterrorist attacks of 9/11. Yet today, al-Qaida and the Taliban, along \nwith other extremist allies, remain a destabilizing and dangerous \nforce. Across the region, there is too much violence, too much social \nand economic turmoil, and too little opportunity in the lives of the \nAfghan-Pakistani people.\n  The administration's strategy is undergoing modifications as we \nspeak. I support the move this week by Defense Secretary Gates to \nselect a new United States military commander for Afghanistan. In my \nview, it is vitally important we get both the evolving strategy right \nand that we have the right way to assess the strategy going forward.\n  Since early this year, I have pressed the administration and military \nofficials on the issue of developing progress measurements for \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. I have been pleased to hear their support. We \nhave heard the administration is developing standards and measurements \nto evaluate a strategy for the region, at least internally. We need to \ngo further.\n  My purpose is straightforward. It is an outgrowth of bipartisan work \nthat I undertook several years ago during the war in Iraq. I was \ntroubled because many people seemed to be looking at the same set of \nfacts during several sessions of terrible violence, but one group \nconcluded that we were losing while another determined we were winning. \nIn response, I helped draft bipartisan legislation with Senators John \nWarner, Susan Collins, and Senator Carl Levin that Congress approved \nand President Bush signed into law. We established 18 benchmarks or \nmeasurements of economic, military, and diplomatic efforts in Iraq. The \nbenchmarks helped Congress and the American people gain a better \nunderstanding of our successes and our challenges in Iraq. They helped \nplay down a partisan debate over whether we were winning or losing.\n  One important point I would like to make tonight is we didn't dictate \nwhat the benchmarks should be. They were suggested by the \nadministration, military leaders, and the Iraqi Government. We did \nrequire the administration report to Congress, and the reporting \nprovided valuable and objective information to the American people \nabout how things were going in Iraq, from efforts to reduce insurgent \nattacks to the Iraqi Government working out distribution of oil \nroyalties.\n  Just as I didn't support tying the previous administration's hands in \nIraq by\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nsetting arbitrary time lines for troop withdrawal or dictating specific \nmeasures in progress, I don't support that approach with this \nadministration either. Still, I will continue working with this \nadministration to bring specific progress measures or benchmarks out \ninto the public eye.\n  Last week I wrote a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee \nChairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran urging them to include a \nrequirement for progress measurements in the fiscal year 2009 \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I was pleased to learn today that the \ncommittee markup of the supplemental bill we are scheduled to take up \ntomorrow does include the two elements I have sought. I understand that \nthe bill will require the President to submit an initial report to \nCongress this year and subsequent reports to assess whether the \nGovernments of Afghanistan and Pakistan are doing enough toward \ncontinuing the President's new strategy. In short, are they doing their \npart?\n  The bill also outlines general areas to measure the success of that \nstrategy or what I refer to as benchmarks. Timely and regular status \nreports will enable the American people to gain an understanding of \nwhether the strategy is working or should be altered. In fact, it will \nbe transparent.\n  I look forward to the administration defining more clearly the \nprogress measures to evaluate that strategy and to them becoming \npublic. We all want the mission of the United States in Afghanistan and \nPakistan to succeed. The more we know about whether we are achieving \ngoals tied to the mission, the more Congress and the American public \nwill be able to support our military, economic, and diplomatic efforts \ngoing forward. For too long our standards to measure success in Iraq \nwere vaguely defined. That led the to partisan disputes over U.S. \nstrategy and uncertainty in the minds of the American public. The \ncontroversies didn't provide American servicemembers fighting the war \nwith the unity of purpose and support they deserve. Now in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, the American people should receive a clear explanation of \nthe mission, an objective set of measures by which to evaluate it going \nforward, and regular status reports on the mission's progress.\n  As the Federal Government asks for further sacrifice from our \ncitizens and as we are forced to continue putting our men and women in \nuniform in harm's way, Congress must provide all available tools to \nachieve success. We should provide nothing less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5430-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

I rise today to congratulate Martin Sinnott on his \nretirement as president and CEO of Kids Hope United. Throughout his \ncareer, Marty served Illinois' children and families, first at the \nIllinois Department of Children and Family Services, then The Youth \nCampus, and finally Kids Hope United. After 30 years of success in the \nnonprofit social services, Mr. Sinnott is ready for a change of pace.\n  Marty Sinnott is a native Chicagoan. He earned his undergraduate and \ngraduate degrees from the University of Chicago. His first job after \ncollege was with the Illinois Department of Children and Family \nServices. There, he started as a social worker and over the course of \nten years rose to become administrator of resource development and \nutilization.\n  After Marty left DCFS, he continued his work on behalf of needy \nIllinois children as president and CEO of The Youth Campus, a child \nwelfare agency in Chicago. During his tenure at The Youth Campus, he \nincreased the organization's revenues from $1 million to $13 million. \nAnd more importantly, he led the organization's growth so it was \nserving six times as many kids.\n  Since 1999, Marty has been with Kids Hope United, a Chicago-based \nprivate nonprofit child and family services agency. As chairman and \nCEO, Mr. Sinnott led a multistate expansion that tripled revenues and, \nagain, increased the number of children and families the agency \nreached. Kids Hope United now has a 900-person staff, an annual \noperating budget of $55 million, and a scope of services that reaches \nfamilies in Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Florida.\n  I commend Marty Sinnott for his decades of service to the children \nand families of Illinois. Congratulations go out to him and his family \non his retirement from Kids Hope United. We wish you many years of \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5430-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEPARTURE OF GREECE'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, through my duties in the Senate I have an \nopportunity to work with many foreign ambassadors to the United States. \nI rise today to mention the contributions of one ambassador who is \nleaving Washington and returning to Athens, Greece, to serve his \ncountry at the Foreign Ministry: Ambassador Alexandros Mallias.\n  Ambassador Mallias worked hard to represent Greece and its historic \nculture--shared by three million Americans of Greek descent--to the \nUnited States and our Government. While the U.S. and Greece are \nstrategic partners, working in concert on a host of issues from \nAfghanistan to anti-piracy operations, our shared values transcend our \ninterests, and we hold in common a longstanding respect for democracy \nand freedom, whether in Boston or in Athens.\n  During his tenure, Ambassador Mallias was particularly active with \nCongress, and held many presentations and briefings for Senators, \nMembers of Congress and their staffs. I especially appreciate his \nefforts in helping make the recent visit of Greece's Foreign Minister, \nDora Bakoyannis, whom I had the pleasure to host at a Working Coffee of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, so productive. The Ambassador was also \ninvolved with think tanks, advocacy groups, grassroots organizations \nand universities, traveling widely in the U.S. to engage civic leaders, \nGreek Americans, students and other people on important bilateral \nissues. His work with Jewish and African American communities was also \nsignificant, earning him numerous commendations, including a Martin \nLuther King Award.\n  Many of us in Congress will miss his fine work and I wish him the \nvery best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5430-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5430-S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced, with Senators \nEnsign, Inouye, Martinez, Klobuchar, and others, the Travel Promotion \nAct of 2009. We seek with this bill to increase travel to the U.S. and \nrebuild the country's place in the global travel market. After 9/11, \nthe number of overseas travelers to the U.S. decreased dramatically and \nhas still not recovered. In addition, the current U.S. economic \ndownturn has caused many American families to cut back on vacation \nplans and our travel industry is struggling.\n  Travel and tourism are a crucial part of our economy. Travel \nexpenditures in the U.S. are estimated to be $775.9 billion for 2008. \nYet other countries have gained market share to our detriment. Foreign \ntravelers are going elsewhere.\n  The absence of Federal leadership in travel promotion has resulted in \nStates having to step in to fill that void. An example is the effort \nmade by my home State of North Dakota, where tourism is the State's \nsecond largest industry. Research by North Dakota State University \nfound that in 2007 out-of-State visitors spent $3.96 billion in North \nDakota. The investment that North Dakota made to encourage travel and \ntourism has reaped enormous benefits. But we can only imagine how many \ntourists would enjoy each of our States if we did not just leave the \npromotion to the States, but made that investment as a Country.\n  The lack of a coordinated Federal campaign creates a comparative \ndisadvantage with countries that have\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\ncentralize ministries or offices to encourage international travel to \ntheir countries. The example of North Dakota should be a lesson for the \nentire country. The U.S. offers unique and diverse destinations for \ntravelers--a small investment in national coordination has the \npotential to create a significant windfall for our economy.\n  The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 will promote travel to the U.S., \nincluding areas not traditionally visited, highlighting the U.S. as a \npremier travel destination. The bill will improve communication of U.S. \ntravel policies and perceptions of the process--negative perceptions \ncan often deter foreigners from traveling here. Our communities will \nbenefit from growth of this multibillion-dollar industry--with an \nincrease in visitors they will experience an expansion of jobs and \nlocal economies.\n  The bill initiates a nationally coordinated travel promotion campaign \nestablished in a public-private partnership to increase international \ntravel to the United States. It creates a Corporation for Travel \nPromotion, an independent, nonprofit corporation, to run the travel \npromotion campaign. The program will be funded equally by a small fee \npaid by foreign travelers visiting the U.S. and matching contributions \nfrom the travel industry.\n  This is a great country, and we should welcome visitors to our shores \nto meet our people and experience our culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5431-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped following \nthe submissions, those prices are now on the way back up and the \nconcerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the efforts of \nthose who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. Today marks the last of the \nsubmissions, a process that has taken approximately ten months to \ncomplete. But this concern--our national energy policy--is not an issue \nthat will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and \nserious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. These stories not \nonly detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Not too long ago, I was considering purchase of a \n     residential solar array. I have read examples about people in \n     other states (California, Massachusetts, etc.) who had \n     implemented a solar array at home (including an inverter), \n     which enabled them to generate some of their own power/\n     electricity. Most importantly, they are able to sell their \n     excess power via the inverter to the grid when they are not \n     using it. This is an equal rate, meaning that the utility \n     company would buy it at whatever their current rate was at \n     that time of day. Basically, your electricity meter spins \n     backwards according to the amount you contribute to the \n     utility. In this way, people are able to ``bank'' kilowatts \n     into the grid so that the power they used at night was \n     somewhat paid for (depending on the size of their array, rate \n     of usage and amount of sunshine available, obviously).\n       After talking to some people locally, I have heard that \n     Idaho Power does not have anything remotely like this policy \n     in place. In fact, it sounded like they are only required to \n     pay 50% the value of the power your array might generate and \n     feed to the grid via your inverter, and only for a set \n     volume. After reaching a particular level, the utility would \n     be capturing a lot of that resident provider's power for \n     free. This appears to be an unfair practice to me, and really \n     tramples on any incentive for buying and implementing a \n     residential solar array. There is a federal tax credit \n     available, but that just addresses start-up costs, not long-\n     term usage and maintenance.\n       I am no energy expert and do not claim to have validated \n     all of the data I put forth above, but I am very interested \n     in pursuing a solar-energy based solution to cut my long-term \n     energy costs. Given the days of sun per year in southwest \n     Idaho, this seems like a no-brainer.\n       Please tell me about your position on residential solar \n     energy implementation practices here in Idaho, and \n     specifically how you would vote on a bill that would require \n     our local energy provider (read: Idaho Power) to fairly \n     compensate residential energy providers, using the scenario I \n     mentioned above. This will directly impact how I vote in the \n     future.\n     John, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, this information seems to be right on. I \n     hope you will take the time to read it.\n                                                  Mary, Sandpoint.\n\n       Dear Mary,\n       On several occasions in the past few months, I have written \n     about the impact of skyrocketing fuel prices on airline \n     customers--in their daily lives and when they travel (Final \n     Approach May 1 and Final Approach May 28). In the long run, \n     to lower oil prices for all Americans, we need to increase \n     domestic supply, increase exploration, alternative energy \n     sources and conservation. However, one near-term solution to \n     the problem is for government to investigate and rein in oil \n     speculators.\n       What is the Commodities Market?--Commodities are raw \n     materials purchased by manufacturers of finished products \n     such as food manufacturers, oil refiners or builders. \n     Businesses that are highly dependent on oil--refineries, \n     heating oil dealers, airlines and trucking companies among \n     others--lessen their risk of significant price fluctuations \n     by purchasing future delivery contracts at predetermined \n     prices in what is known as the commodities or futures \n     markets. The two largest U.S. commodities markets or futures \n     exchanges are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New \n     York Mercantile Exchange, where people trade standardized \n     futures contracts; that is, a contract to buy specific \n     quantities of a commodity at a specified price with delivery \n     set at a specified time in the future.\n       What is the Problem with Oil?--There is a significant \n     disconnect between the paper market for oil (speculators) and \n     the physical market for oil (consumers). In recent years, \n     speculators have taken advantage of actual consumers of oil \n     by bidding up the price for futures contracts. If a \n     speculator purchases a contract for delivery of oil at a high \n     price six or 12 months in the future but has no intention of \n     actually taking delivery of the oil in that contract, then a \n     physical customer who needs that oil--to deliver home heating \n     oil, to operate trucks or airplanes, or even to process in a \n     refinery--will be forced to pay the higher price in order to \n     obtain the oil that is needed.\n       How Do They Get Away with That?--Increasingly, \n     sophisticated institutional investors have managed to \n     manipulate the rules and regulations governing commodities \n     transactions through a series of exemptions and waivers, \n     including the so-called ``Enron loophole,'' low margin \n     requirements and the dodging of U.S. public disclosure \n     requirements. These complex arrangements have a similar \n     impact: They put people engaged in oil-related businesses at \n     a disadvantage with those who gamble relatively small sums \n     that the price of oil will increase out of proportion to \n     marketplace demands. If that happens, as it has regularly \n     over the past few years, those who need oil for their \n     businesses pay a premium, which is passed on to you--the \n     consumer.\n       What Can Government Do Now?--In the near term, Congress \n     needs to address the impact of unchecked speculation in the \n     commodities market.\n       Commodities trading is overseen by a small, but very \n     powerful government agency known as the Commodities Futures \n     Trading Commission (CFTC). Congress can require the CFTC to \n     implement a host of controls such as imposing limits on the \n     quantity of commodities contracts speculators may purchase, \n     closing the loopholes that allow speculators to trade exempt \n     from any government oversight or regulation, and requiring \n     reporting by those who are engaging in speculation.\n       Experts say that closing regulatory loopholes in the \n     trading of commodity futures will result in a significant \n     reduction in fuel prices.\n       What's Next?--Congress is expected to debate some of these \n     issues in the next few weeks and it is urgent that they hear \n     your voice. To facilitate public participation in the debate \n     over speculators, we have launched a broad-based coalition, \n     S.O.S. NOW, that provides a wide array of information on \n     speculation and its impact on the price we all pay for oil. \n     S.O.S. NOW stands for Stop Oil Speculation Now, and we \n     urge you to go to the Web site www.stopoilspeculationnow.com \n     and send a message to Congress about oil speculation.\n     Air Transport Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5431-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5431-S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to \nworld-renowned cardiologist Kanu Chatterjee as he retires from the \nUniversity of California at San Francisco--UCSF--Medical Center after \n34 years of dedicated service.\n  Dr. Chatterjee was born in what is now Bangladesh and moved with his\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nfamily to Calcutta, where they remained unsettled for many years. His \nfather passed away just before he graduated from R.G. Kar Medical \nCollege in 1956. To support his family, he took the job of medical \nofficer at the IISCO Hospital at Burnpur. In 1963, Dr. Chatterjee left \nIndia for the United Kingdom to further his studies. In 1971, he was \nrecruited to direct the inpatient cardiology service at Cedars-Sinai \nMedical Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Chatterjee joined the UCSF Medical \nCenter staff in 1975 as director of the cardiac care unit and associate \nchief of cardiology, where he became the Ernest Gallo Distinguished \nProfessor of Medicine in the division of cardiology.\n  A beloved physician, teacher, and researcher, Dr. Chatterjee has \nworked tirelessly over the last 30-plus years in the fields of \ndiagnosing and managing coronary artery disease, heart failure, and \npulmonary hypertension. He is also a world-renowned researcher in \nvascular reactivity and heart failure and has pioneered the study of \ndrugs, such as ACE inhibitors and vasodilators, that have become the \nstandard of care for heart failure. With such a long-standing list of \nprofessional accomplishments, it is all the more touching to hear Dr. \nChatterjee's patients speak with genuine gratitude and heartfelt \nemotion about his expertise and compassion.\n  As Dr. Chatterjee prepares to move on to his new half-time position \nat the University of Iowa in Iowa City, I wish him many more years of \ncontinued leadership and success in the field of cardiology.\n  I commend Dr. Chatterjee for his 34 years of dedicated service to the \nUCSF Medical Center community. Along with his friends and admirers \nthroughout the San Francisco Bay area, I thank him for his tireless \nefforts and wish him the best as he embarks on the next phase of his \nremarkable life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5432-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ALEX DEL RIO\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, every day, law enforcement \nofficers across the Nation make tremendous sacrifices to fight crime \nand keep our communities safe. On November 22, 2008, one of those \nofficers tragically lost his life while serving in the line of duty. \nThe officer was 31-year-old Alex Del Rio, a Florida native, a loving \nson, and an outstanding member of the Hollywood, FL, police department.\n  Although Alex's life ended just 2 months short of his 32nd birthday, \nhe lived his life to the fullest. He was born in Miami and attended \nWinston Park Elementary in Miami and McMillian Middle School in \nKendall. At the MAST Academy High School in Miami, Alex was a \ntremendous student, a member of the JROTC Color Guard, and known by his \nfriends as someone who always did the right thing.\n  After joining the Hollywood Police Department in 1996, Alex began his \ncareer as a part-time community service aide and earned a full-time \nposition on the force in 1999. He held positions in patrol, special \noperations motors and special operations for DUI traffic homicide. He \nwas named Hollywood Police Department's ``Officer of the Month'' in \nOctober of 2003 and a finalist for the 2003 ``Officer of the Year.'' \nHis colleagues knew him for his sense of humor, his likability, and his \nlove for the job.\n  Alex's mother Miriam Fernandez has turned her personal tragedy into \nopportunities for others by establishing the Alex Del Rio Foundation. \nThe foundation aims to enrich the lives of children in south Florida by \nproviding scholarships and promoting the ideals Alex embodied.\n  His commitment to serving others has touched not only those in \nHollywood but also those who work in law enforcement in other States. \nOfficer James E. Manley from the town of Lloyd, NY, was so inspired by \nAlex's story that he has decided to ride more than 300 miles to be here \nin Washington in Alex's honor. Officer Manley will join Alex's family \nand others this week in a candlelight vigil and memorial service for \nfallen officers at the National Law Enforcement Memorial. I join them \nin honoring Alex and the many other men and women of our nation's law \nenforcement agencies who have given their lives protecting and serving \nour communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5432-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING JOHN T. NOBLE TRUCKING\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, later this month, we will pause to \ncommemorate those men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice \nto defend our Nation and the freedoms we enjoy. On Memorial Day, \nfamilies of our fallen members of the Armed Forces visit the graves of \ntheir loved ones throughout our Nation, often at veteran's cemeteries, \nto remember our fallen heroes. I rise today with tremendous gratitude \nto recognize the generosity of two Mainers, John and Joyce Noble, and \ntheir business, John T. Noble Trucking, for their dedicated efforts in \nsupporting the creation of the Northern Maine Veteran's Cemetery as a \nplace of rest for thousands of Maine's bravest.\n  John T. Noble Trucking, a thriving business since 1957, is located in \nthe Aroostook county city of Caribou. A multifaceted company, Noble \nTrucking provides its customers with a wide variety of services, \nincluding landscaping services, commercial deliveries of fuel products \nas well as truck maintenance, welding, painting, and body repair.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Noble are well known in the Caribou community for their \nphilanthropic initiatives. The Nobles have donated to countless causes \nwithin their community, and in characteristic Aroostook County fashion, \nhave made many of these donations on the condition of anonymity. \nOrganizations like the Caribou Recreation Department, the Northern \nMaine Fairgrounds, Cary Medical Center, The Christopher Home and the \nCaribou Historical Society are just a few of the many grateful County \ncharities that have benefitted immensely from the Nobles' friendship \nand contributions. Perhaps their most notable work has been their \nadvocacy and determination on behalf of the Northern Maine Veteran's \nCemetery in Caribou.\n  The idea for Maine's northernmost veterans cemetery was first \nproposed in 1998. After serious study that found overwhelming support \namong the community, the initial approval was given by the governor in \nFebruary 1999. In the spring of that year, the Northern Maine Veterans \nCommemorative Cemetery Corporation was formed to oversee all aspects of \nthe cemetery's development.\n  John Noble, an honorably discharged veteran himself and his wife \nJoyce, who also admirably supported her husband's service to our \ncountry with stalwart dedication, certainly felt a particular kinship \nto the development of an appropriate resting place for our national \nheroes. In order to ensure that the dream of so many veterans became a \nreality, John and Joyce Noble stepped forward to offer 33.4 acres of \ntheir own land for use by the Corporation. Their heartfelt contribution \nexpedited the plans for the Northern Maine Veteran's Cemetery and the \nseeds of charitable giving had taken root, facilitating a grassroots \neffort that culminated in what is today a regal and honored resting \nplace for our most deserving men and women who served this country with \nhonor and distinction.\n  The Nobles' ongoing efforts inspired a can-do spirit that sparked a \ndedicated group of volunteers into determined action. With the cemetery \nfacing a delay in state funding, the Nobles offered to help with the \nconstruction and maintenance of the cemetery's lands until the funds \nbecame available. Additionally, the Nobles helped make the cemetery \nmore private and solemn by planting trees around its perimeter. When \nthe cemetery was finally dedicated on June 1, 2003, the Nobles had left \na substantial mark on this sacred place and continue to support it \ntoday.\n  An extraordinarily modest couple, John and Joyce Noble have made \nsignificant contributions to the appearance and well-being of Caribou. \nTheir beautiful gesture of kindness resulted in a respectable final \nresting place for those who gave our Nation the fullest measure of \ncommitment. It is their selfless spirit and magnanimous nature that \nhave made them stand out in the Caribou community for years. I thank \nMr. and Mrs. Noble for their incredible generosity, and wish them and \ntheir company, John T. Noble Trucking, much success for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5432-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5432-S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nMr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 23.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nNation's surveillance and reporting for diseases and conditions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nentitled the Strengthening America's Public Health System Act of 2009.\n  The ongoing swine flu pandemic makes clear the necessity for a robust \npublic health system in the U.S. This legislation is designed to \nstrengthen epidemiology and laboratory capacity in State and local \nhealth departments and, correspondingly, national surveillance and \nreporting of infectious diseases and other conditions of public health \nimportance.\n  Currently, many parts of the local-state-federal disease surveillance \nsystem are fragmented and paper-based, and have not fully benefited \nfrom new technologies that could improve the completeness and \ntimeliness of reporting. A 2007 survey found that 20 states are \nmanually reporting diagnostic findings, albeit with a web interface, \nand 16 are completely paper-based. Only 2 State public health \nlaboratories have bidirectional data flow and can both send and receive \nlaboratory messages, the gold standard for disease reporting. The \npotential for new pathogen discovery, rapid electronic exchange of \npublic health information, national bacterial and viral databases for \nDNA ``fingerprinting'' of infectious disease organisms has not been \nfully realized. My legislation focuses on improving electronic disease \nsurveillance and reporting so that all state and local health \ndepartments and public health laboratories can readily and seamlessly \nreceive, monitor, and report infectious diseases and other urgent \nconditions of public health importance. The bill also authorizes a \nprocess for determining a list of nationally notifiable diseases and \nconditions and, creates a national committee to evaluate best practices \nin public health surveillance.\n  The Strengthening America's Public Health System Act calls for the \nexpansion of resources, renewed focus and mission, and new areas of \nspecial emphasis for several existing programs within the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC. These programs support public \nhealth capacity to identify and monitor the occurrence of infectious \ndiseases and other conditions of public health importance; detect new \nand emerging infectious disease threats, including laboratory capacity \nto detect antimicrobial resistant infections; identify and respond to \ndisease outbreaks; and hire and train necessary professional staff.\n  The outbreak of swine flu that originated in Mexico highlights the \nneed for cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in the surveillance, \nreporting and control of infectious diseases that cross the border. \nClear standards, however, have not yet been established for what \ninformation should be shared and how the sharing should take place. My \nlegislation tasks the CDC to finalize and adopt the ``Guidelines for \nU.S.-Mexico Coordination on Epidemiological Events of Mutual Interest'' \nso that we have a clear mechanism in place for communication with \npublic health officials in Mexico.\n  This important legislation has been endorsed by the: American \nAssociation of Public Health Veterinarians, American Public Health \nAssociation, American Society for Microbiology, Association for \nProfessionals in Infection Control & Epidemiology, Association of \nPublic Health Laboratories, Association of Schools of Public Health, \nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials, Center for \nInfectious Disease Research and Policy, Council of State and \nTerritorial Epidemiologists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, \nNational Association of County and City Health Officials, National \nAlliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, National Association \nof State Public Health Veterinarians, National Public Health \nInformation Coalition, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, \nand Trust for America's Health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening America's \n     Public Health System Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of the programs authorized under this Act is to \n     strengthen public health surveillance systems and disease \n     reporting by--\n       (1) delineating existing grant mechanisms at the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention designed to enhance \n     disease surveillance and reporting by improving and \n     modernizing capacity at the State and local level--\n       (A) to identify and monitor the occurrence of infectious \n     diseases and other conditions of public health importance;\n       (B) to detect new and emerging infectious disease threats; \n     and\n       (C) to identify and respond to disease outbreaks;\n       (2) expanding eligibility for grantees;\n       (3) increasing funding to ensure all States and \n     jurisdictions have appropriate surveillance and reporting \n     capacity and can provide comprehensive electronic reporting, \n     including laboratory reporting;\n       (4) delineating existing applied epidemiology, laboratory \n     science, and informatics fellowship programs designed to \n     reduce documented workforce shortages for these essential \n     public health professionals at the State and local level and \n     increasing funding for these programs;\n       (5) expanding the Epidemic Intelligence Service;\n       (6) delineating a refined process for establishing a list \n     of nationally notifiable diseases and conditions;\n       (7) improving binational surveillance of diseases in the \n     United States and Mexico border region, including developing \n     improved standards and protocols for binational epidemiology, \n     surveillance, laboratory analyses, and control of infectious \n     diseases between the two nations; and\n       (8) establishing a forum to permit review and \n     identification of best surveillance practices with a \n     particular focus on improving coordination of animal-human \n     disease surveillance.\n\n     SEC. 3. STRENGTHENING PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.\n\n       Title XXVIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300hh et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Subtitle C--Strengthening Public Health Surveillance Systems\n\n     ``SEC. 2821.

A bill to create a new incentive fund that will encourage \nStates to adopt the 21st Century Skills Framework; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague \nSenator Snowe of Maine and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, I am \nintroducing legislation to provide incentives for States to adopt the \n21st Century Skills Framework. I take this step because the knowledge \nbase and skills set that most students learn in school should expand to \nprovide students with the skills like critical thinking and problem \nsolving, needed to succeed in modern workplaces and communities. \nIncreasingly, these settings are no longer defined by conventional \nboundaries such as time, distance, language, and culture. Moreover, \nrigorous higher education coursework, career challenges, and a globally \ncompetitive workforce--all demand that America's schools align their \nclassroom environments with real world environments by infusing 21st \ncentury skills into their learning and teaching.\n  What are those skills? The framework describes essential attributes \nof learning that America's children need in order to succeed as \ncitizens and workers in the 21st century. These include mastery in the \ncore subjects of English, reading, mathematics, science, foreign \nlanguages, civics, Government, economics, art, history, and geography. \nThis bill does not ignore core curriculum, but it seeks to add skills \nand new awareness to this basic knowledge. Today's students need \npreparation to put their education in context including a sense of \nglobal awareness; financial, economic, business and entrepreneurial \nliteracy; civic literacy; and health and wellness awareness that \ncomplements the traditional core subjects. Given the fast pace of our \nworkplace and culture, our students need the ability to engage in life-\nlong learning that ensures adaptability in the face of rapidly changing \nwork environments brought on by new scientific, technological, and \nsocial developments. Plus, students need to be able to use information \nand communications technology both to learn core\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nacademic subjects and to gain 21st century content knowledge and \nabilities.\n  The 21st Century Skills Framework also identifies the critical role \nteachers must play in bringing life skills into their classrooms--\nskills that include leadership, ethics, accountability, adaptability, \npersonal productivity, personal responsibility, self-direction, and \nsocial responsibility. West Virginia is working to include this model \nin their classrooms, and I have watched how this model enhances the \nengagement of students.\n  In today's global, knowledge-based economy these 21st Century skills \nform the lifeblood of a productive workforce particularly in \nscientific, engineering, and other advanced technological sectors. If \nthe U.S. is to exercise continued economic leadership internationally \nwe must enable strong partnerships to form among educators, \nadministrators, policy makers, and the business community so that they \nmay work collectively to better prepare our students for the realities \nof the 21st century.\n  This initiative began in 2002 with funding from the U.S. Department \nof Education to support innovative education reforms. The partnership \nwas a collaboration of educators and businesses, particularly high-tech \nbusiness that did surveys and meetings to discuss the real skills that \nstudents need to learn to succeed. It clearly builds on the core \nsubjects, but it adds the skills and awareness that are essential to \nthe workplace.\n  The purpose of the 21st Century Skills Incentive Fund Act is to offer \ncompetitive grants from in the Department of Education for States \nwilling to invest in education reform. To qualify, States need to have \na plan for implementations of the 21st Century Skills Framework. It \nalso calls an assessment of progress towards the four student learning \npriorities and evaluation.\n  Ten States have also already taken steps to implement the 21st \nCentury Skills initiative, including Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, \nMassachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, \nand Wisconsin. Such States that are willing and eager to engage in such \nreforms deserve the chance to compete for incentives.\n  In my own State of West Virginia and in the other committed States, \neducation leaders report enthusiasm for reforms.\n  Although the economic downturn has current challenges for new \ninvestment in education, waiting for a better time to engage in reform \nwould be unwise. Today's sixth grade class, will be entering the work \nforce in 2015, after high school or 2019 after college, they need to be \nprepared. The 21st Century Skills Incentive Act makes attention to this \nimperative a national priority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1030. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the reduction in the credit rate for certain facilities \nproducing electricity from renewable resources; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have come to my colleagues today, \nhaving come down to the floor last week, when I came to the Senate \nfloor to announce a new plan to give working families and businesses \nthe tools they need to succeed during this current economic crisis we \nare in. I come today also to add to my Arkansas plan a package of tax \ncuts and Tax Code simplification measures designed to move Arkansas and \nour State's hard-working families forward. Together, these tax measures \nwill allow working families and small businesses to get ahead and \nemerge from the economic crisis stronger and more competitive.\n  We have a lot of small businesses, hard-working families down in \nArkansas; entrepreneurs who unfortunately feel as though during this \ncrisis they are not getting much out of Washington. We want to change \nthat attitude. We want to make sure they are getting our support and \nthat we as the Government are creating an atmosphere and an environment \nwhere they can be successful.\n  We are also going to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship to \ncreate new jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the \nburden on working families and small businesses by simplifying our Tax \nCode. It is way too complicated these days. We have created too much of \na complicated code that people can't use it for its intended purposes, \nand that is, obviously, to encourage good, healthy businesses to thrive \nand to be competitive.\n  Last week, I introduced a number of legislative measures that will \nallow working families and small businesses to emerge from the economic \ncrisis stronger and more competitive than before. This week, my \nArkansas plan focuses on encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship to \ncreate new jobs here at home and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. \nAll of us want to be able to be more independent. We want to make sure \nwe are creating jobs here, but we also want to know that, globally, we \nare more independent as a country and that we are not seeing that \ndependence on imported oil coming from other places.\n  Yesterday, I introduced the USA Jobs Act of 2009, which offers a new \nresearch and development bonus incentive to companies that both \nresearch and manufacture their products in the United States. Before, \nin the stimulus package, we extended the research and development tax \ncredit to encourage more research and development of new ideas and new \nproducts, new methodologies so we could create jobs from those. We also \nneed to make sure we are not sending those new ideas and that new \nresearch somewhere else on the globe to be able to be produced or \nmanufactured. We want to incentivize that it stays right here at home.\n  Our Nation faces record unemployment, with more than 540,000 \nAmericans put out of work last month alone and 90,000 job losses in \nArkansas. It is more important now than ever before that we encourage \nthe creation and preservation of American jobs. My bill provides a new \njob tax credit for manufacturers that do a substantial portion of their \nresearch and manufacturing right here at home in the United States. \nThis new tax credit will encourage greater domestic production, which \nwould, in turn, lead to the creation of more American jobs.\n  Today, I am focused on a series of alternative energy and \nconservation proposals as well. My first bill provides an even playing \nfield for all renewable energy production. The Federal Tax Code \ncurrently offers an income tax credit for the production of electricity \nproduced from renewable energy resources, but not all resources are \ntreated the same. Under current law, some energy resources receive a \nhigher level credit than others, and as a result, certain new renewable \nenergy technologies have a more difficult time finding the necessary \ninvestment capital they need to start that process of investing in new \ntechnology and getting it to the marketplace in a reasonable way so it \nis cost-effective.\n  These are critical ideas that exist out there. We need to make sure \neverybody is at the table. When we look at renewable energy, we see \nthat there are a multitude of great ideas out there, but getting those \nideas to the table and then out into the marketplace is a critical part \nof that journey. If we don't make sure everyone has that same benefit \nwith their ideas and technologies and being able to get out there, if \nit is not a fair playing field, then we are going to lose multiple \nopportunities.\n  I hope we will look forward and not backward in terms of how we are \nincentivizing this renewable energy. So much of what we see in terms of \ncomplications or challenges small businesses face in finding investment \ncapital is particularly problematic with the pursuit of renewable \nenergy opportunities in my home State of Arkansas, where biomass is a \npredominant renewable resource but only gets half the tax credit that \nmany other resources receive.\n  That is ridiculous. We have a tremendous resource right here and \navailable to us--not just in Arkansas but in many States in our \ncountry. It can play a tremendous role in lifting our dependence on \nforeign oil and finding renewable sources of energy.\n  My proposal would level the playing field for all energy resources by \nincreasing the value of the credit to a full credit level for those \nresources that currently receive only a partial credit. It certainly \nmakes sense not only in the sense that there are certain resources that \nexist today that are moving forward in their technology, but there are \nalso resources down the road. It is amazing to me to see what\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nscientists are doing, even with things like algae, to be able to \nproduce oil, and looking at how we can use our agricultural \nbyproducts--a host of things, any of that woody biomass that we can \nbegin to put to good use in making energy and be less dependent on \nimported oil.\n  Also, I am introducing legislation today that provides long-term \ncertainty for producers and consumers of biofuels. Currently, the U.S. \nTax Code includes credits to encourage the production of biodiesel and \nrenewable diesel, which are proven alternative fuels that will help us \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil. Every barrel of biofuel that we \nproduce is a barrel of imported oil we would not have to import. These \nincentives have been extended on a short-term basis in recent years and \nare scheduled to expire at the end of this year.\n  When we see all of these great ideas and we see people who are \nwilling to invest their capital and their time and energy and resources \ninto moving these industries to the marketplace, and in a reasonable, \ncost-effective way they can then integrate it into the marketplace, it \ntakes resources. But it takes predictability in our Tax Code as well, \nknowing they are going to be able to depend on a certain tax treatment \nover a certain period of time that allows them to access that capital \nin the capital market.\n  If these credits were allowed to expire, these new technologies in \nrenewable fuels would be priced significantly higher than petroleum \ndiesel and, as a result, would not be competitive in the fuels \nmarketplace. Biofuel producers and consumers in our State need the \ncertainty that these economic incentives provide and help to sustain \nthis new market.\n  We cannot move forward in changing our mindset and our marketplace \nfrom an old energy economy to a new one if we don't embrace the idea \nthat we have to produce some predictability for these new emerging \nindustries and fuels in a way they can--particularly in these difficult \neconomic times--access the capital they need to move forward with the \nideas and development and the production of all of these great new \nideas that exist out there.\n  My proposal would provide a 10-year extension of the credits through \n2018 to provide a stable environment for the creation of a strong \ndomestic biofuels industry.\n  I want to highlight a bill I introduced a few weeks ago with Senators \nRoberts, Snowe, Cantwell, and Collins that would allow electricity from \nbiomass produced onsite to qualify for the section 45 renewable \nelectricity production tax credit.\n  According to the American Forest and Paper Association, in 2005, the \nindustry produced 28.5 million megawatt hours of biomass-based \nelectricity, which avoided the use of more than 200 million barrels of \noil. There it is, plain and simple--what we can be doing with an \nindustry that has available to them--the biomass--from byproducts and \nfrom other woody products that are there, which may be discarded or \nunusable--to be able to produce electricity from a renewable source.\n  The use of biomass electricity, whether produced onsite or purchased \nfrom a utility, has the same positive impact of reducing fossil fuel \nconsumption and should be encouraged. That is exactly what we want to \ndo. We want to encourage these types of activities and what we can do \nin terms of creating new and innovative ideas with renewable energy.\n  Later this week I plan to introduce a bill to also encourage \nworkforce training and development. Together, I think these bills will \ncreate jobs at home. They will help strengthen our economy and reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. These are all priorities I think each \none of the Members of this body seek to achieve. I, for one, decided to \nput together a plan that I think is particularly good for my State, \nwith a series of different types of bills that I am introducing--last \nweek, this week, and next week--in a way that I think can be productive \nfor my State. I think most Senators will find that these are tools that \nwill be just as effective for their States as well. I encourage them to \ntake a look at what we are doing.\n  Next week, I will complete the rollout of our Arkansas plan by \nintroducing reform measures to simplify the Tax Code and reduce the \nburden on Americans, and particularly Arkansas's working families and \nbusinesses by working to build a tax structure that is fair and \nequitable for all Americans.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to take a look at these commonsense \nmeasures to see how they will benefit their own constituents. I work \nhard in the Senate to be pragmatic and look for solutions that are good \nfor everybody and, more important, that are focused on the issues that \nare important to us as a country, like getting our economy back on \ntrack, making sure Americans can keep jobs, and for those who have lost \njobs, we can put back to work, with the new ideas that we know \nAmericans are so very capable of.\n  We must make our Nation's working families and our small businesses a \ntop priority. The Arkansas plan does just that. I will continue to \nfight to bring our families the relief they need and our business \nowners the tools they require to invest and grow and be competitive in \nthe global marketplace that we have been begging so longingly for over \nthe years. We need to make sure Government is going to create that \nenvironment where they can do just that--invest, grow, and be \ncompetitive.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1031. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ndirect care registered nurse-to-patient staffing ratio requirements in \nhospitals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we mark the end of National Nurses \nWeek, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated \nprofessionals who serve on the front lines of our health care system. \nNurses are heroes--not just to their patients, but to the families and \nloved ones who rely on their compassion and care.\n  While we celebrate nurses this week, we must also acknowledge that \ntoo many nurses are overworked because of staffing levels that are \nsimply inadequate.\n  Nurses treat patients not just in hospitals or emergency rooms but in \nhomes, schools, community health centers and more. Nurses take on a lot \nof different duties and roles, but they all have at least one thing in \ncommon--they are all on the front lines of providing care to patients.\n  For decades nurses have been telling us that there are not enough of \nthem, especially in hospitals. Study after study has been done--we know \nthere is a nationwide nursing shortage.\n  By 2020, it is estimated that the demand for full time nurses will \nexceed supply by 1 million nurses.\n  This is unacceptable. We must address a problem that affects the \nquality of care that patients receive and drives too many nurses away \nfrom the hospital bedside.\n  That is why I am introducing the National Nursing Reform and Patient \nAdvocacy Act, which will not only help address the nationwide shortage \nof skilled nurses, it will improve the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  The National Nursing Reform and Patient Advocacy Act champions \nnursing rights, nursing ratios, and nursing reform.\n  Specifically, this bill protects the rights of nurses to speak out \nfor their patients and to speak out for themselves, without the fear of \ndiscrimination or retaliation, because if there is a problem in a \nhospital nurses should be able to talk about it.\n  This bill sets minimum nurse to patient ratios, because you cannot \ngive patients high quality care without giving nurses the time to \nprovide it. It offers transparency in the process of establishing \nstaffing plans in hospitals and puts forward the tools to report \ninadequate staffing or care.\n  This bill reforms the role of hospitals not just in retaining nurses \nbut also in training nurses. It creates a Registered Nurse Workforce \nInitiative that invests in the education of nurses and nursing faculty, \nbecause we will need many more nurses to meet the needs of our Nation--\nespecially after we expand access to health care.\n  President Obama has made improving patient safety and quality care \none of the cornerstones of the health care reform effort. You can't \nhave high quality health care without a high quality nurse workforce to \nprovide it.\n  Ten years ago, nurses in California fought and won a major battle for \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\npatients and for themselves--and the results were minimum nurse to \npatient ratios in California hospitals.\n  I am proud to bring this fight to Washington, DC and to pursue \nfederal legislation that would extend these rights, ratios and reforms \nto nurses in hospitals across the country.\n  Reports on California ratios have only begun to show what all of the \nnurses in this room already know--that setting a minimum standard for \nsafe staffing can be the difference between life and death of patients.\n  A 2002 study found that for every patient added to a nurse's workload \nthere is a seven percent increase in the chance of death following \ncommon surgeries.\n  In California, the hospitals that have seen the greatest effect in \nreduced mortality were the ones that started with the worst staffing \nratios.\n  We also know that hospitals are losing good nurses because of these \nstaffing shortages. A poll of nurses nationwide found that almost half \nof the nurses who plan to quit their job say that inadequate staffing \nis the reason they are leaving. The cost of replacing these valuable \nworkers has been estimated at $25,000 to $60,000 per nurse.\n  Too many nurses get burned out by being overloaded with too many \npatients. Too many nurses have given up on serving in hospitals because \nthe hospitals have given up on providing a better environment for both \nnurses and patients.\n  We need to remind hospitals that by investing more in their nursing \nstaff, they will save money by avoiding costly medical mistakes and \nproviding better care for their patients--and most importantly, they \nwill save lives.\n  I strongly believe that health care reform cannot succeed unless we \ninvest in our health care workforce. At 2.9 million strong, nurses are \nthe largest health care workforce in our country, and this investment \nis long overdue.\n  My new legislation builds on the success of California's historic law \nfor registered nurse staffing ratios. Under the California ratios law, \nlives are being saved, nurses' ability to be effective advocates for \ntheir patients is stronger and more registered nurses are entering the \nworkforce and staying at the bedside longer--which is easing the \nState's nursing shortage.\n  Nurses are not just the face of the movement to improve health care \nin our country, they are the face of health care in our country. This \nbill is for them and the patients they so faithfully serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. McCain) (by request):\n  S. 1033. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2010 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe military \npersonnel strengths for fiscal year 2010, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I are today introducing, \nby request, the administration's proposed National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2010.

A bill to enhance the ability of drinking water utilities in \nthe United States to develop and implement climate change adaptation \nprograms and policies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drinking Water Adaptation, \n     Technology, Education, and Research (WATER) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelming \n     that climate change is occurring more rapidly than can be \n     attributed to natural causes, and that significant impacts to \n     the water supply are already occurring;\n       (2) among the first and most critical of those impacts will \n     be change to patterns of precipitation around the world, \n     which will affect water availability for the most basic \n     drinking water and domestic water needs of populations in \n     many areas of the United States;\n       (3) drinking water utilities throughout the United States, \n     as well as those in Europe, Australia, and Asia, are \n     concerned that extended changes in precipitation will lead to \n     extended droughts;\n       (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive and will \n     become more so as climate change forces more utilities to \n     turn to alternative supplies;\n       (5) energy production consumes a significant percentage of \n     the fresh water resources of the United States;\n       (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of the United \n     States has sponsored, through a nonprofit water research \n     foundation, various studies to assess the impacts of climate \n     change on drinking water supplies;\n       (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive \n     program of research into the full range of impacts on \n     drinking water utilities, including impacts on water \n     supplies, facilities, and customers;\n       (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is also \n     coordinating internationally with other drinking water \n     utilities on shared research projects and has hosted \n     international workshops with counterpart European and Asian \n     water research organizations to develop a unified research \n     agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address \n     climate change impacts;\n       (9) research data in existence as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act--\n       (A) summarize the best available scientific evidence on \n     climate change;\n       (B) identify the implications of climate change for the \n     water cycle and the availability and quality of water \n     resources; and\n       (C) provide general guidance on planning and adaptation \n     strategies for water utilities; and\n       (10) given uncertainties about specific climate changes in \n     particular areas, drinking water utilities need to prepare \n     for a wider range of likely possibilities in managing and \n     delivery of water.\n\n     SEC. 3.

which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 148\n\n       Whereas cerebral cavernous malformation (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``CCM''), or cavernous angioma, is a \n     devastating blood vessel disease that has enormous \n     consequences for people affected and their families;\n       Whereas cavernous angiomas are malformations in the brain \n     that cannot be detected easily, except through very specific \n     medical imaging scans;\n       Whereas people with CCM are rarely aware that they have the \n     disease, which makes taking blood thinners or aspirin risky;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, in the general \n     population, 1 in approximately 200 people has CCM;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, more than \\1/2\\ \n     of the people with CCM experience symptoms at some point in \n     their lives;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, there is a \n     hereditary form of CCM, caused by a mutation or deletion on \n     any 1 of 3 genes, that is characterized by multiple cavernous \n     malformations;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, each child born \n     to parents with the hereditary form of CCM has a 50 percent \n     chance of having CCM;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, a specific \n     genetic mutation of CCM called the ``common Hispanic \n     mutation'', which has been traced to the original Spanish \n     settlers of the Americas in the 1590's, has now spread across \n     at least 17 generations of families;\n       Whereas while CCM is more prevalent in certain States, \n     families throughout the United States are at risk;\n       Whereas a person with CCM could go undiagnosed until sudden \n     death, seizure, or stroke;\n       Whereas there is a shortage of physicians who are familiar \n     with CCM, making it difficult for people with CCM to receive \n     timely diagnosis and appropriate care;\n       Whereas the shortage of such physicians has a \n     disproportionate impact on thousands of Hispanics across the \n     United States;\n       Whereas CCM has not been studied sufficiently by the \n     National Institutes of Health and others;\n       Whereas there is a need to expeditiously initiate pilot \n     studies to research the use of medications to treat CCM; and\n       Whereas medications that treat CCM will enable preventive \n     treatment that reduces the risk of hemorrhage in those who \n     have been diagnosed, thereby saving lives and dramatically \n     reducing healthcare costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that there is \n     a critical need to increase research, awareness, and \n     education about cerebral cavernous malformations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5443-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5443-S5444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1092.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 148, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 148) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that there is a critical need to increase research, \n     awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous \n     malformations.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, Joyce Gonzales had been \nsuffering for 15 years when she was diagnosed. A cluster of blood \nvessels in her cervical spinal cord were giving her discomfort and \npain, but for years her doctors could not understand why. When they \nwere finally able to diagnose her, a quick operation relieved her pain \nand gave her her life back.\n  Joyce's second cousin was not so lucky. Her experience with the same \nmysterious illness ended in a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. She was nine \nyears old.\n  Medical science has made great strides in unlocking the mystery of \nillnesses that have plagued humanity for centuries. Scientific \nbreakthroughs have helped control and eliminate diseases that once \nthreatened the life and health of millions. Yet for all our progress, \nwe still face threats that we do not understand and therefore cannot \nstop.\n  One of these threats is cerebral cavernous malformation, also known \nas CCM, or cavernous angiomas. CCMs are caused by abnormal blood \nvessels that form clusters, known as angiomas, in the brain or spinal \ncord. If these lesions bleed or press up against structures in the \ncentral nervous system, they can cause seizures, neurological deficits, \nhemorrhages, or severe headaches. CCM took 15 years of Joyce Gonzales's \nwellbeing, and it took the life of her nine-year-old cousin. With more \nknowledge of this mysterious killer, both tragedies might have been \navoided. With today's resolution, I hope we can move one step towards \nthat knowledge.\n  In the overall population, about 1 in 200 people has a cavernous \nangioma, and about one-third of these affected individuals become \nsymptomatic at some point in their lives. In some Hispanic families, \nhowever, the rate of prevalence is significantly higher. CCM is what is \nknown as an autosomal dominant disease, which means that each child of \nan affected parent has a 50-percent chance of inheriting it.\n  In New Mexico, this genetic mutation has been traced back to the \noriginal Spanish settlers of the 1580s. It has now spread down and \nacross at least 17 generations, resulting in what could be tens of \nthousands of cases of the illness in our State. New Mexico has the \nhighest population density of this illness in the world. The States of \nArizona, Texas, and Colorado may not be far behind.\n  Unfortunately, and in some cases tragically, many of those who suffer \nfrom this disease do not know it. Even worse, New Mexico and the Nation \nface a shortage of physicians who are familiar with the illness. This \nmakes it dangerously difficult to receive a timely diagnosis and \nappropriate care. It puts potentially thousands of individuals at risk \nof a stroke, a seizure, or even sudden death.\n  This dangerous ignorance of a potential killer results in part from a \nlack of research on the disease. NIH funds only eight projects on CCM. \nThis, despite indications from staff at the National Institute of \nNeurological Disorders and Stroke that CCM may be a ``paradigm \nillness,'' meaning research findings on CCM could shed light on other \nillnesses with similar characteristics.\n  To fight this ignorance and save lives, I am introducing this \nresolution today to express the sense of the Senate that there is a \ncritical need to expand education, awareness and research on CCM. I \nthank my colleagues, Senators McCain, Bingaman, Levin, Kerry, and \nVitter for joining me to urge for increased resources.\n  This is only a preliminary step in the fight against this disease, \nbut it is an important one. A Senate resolution would send the message \nthat we take this disease seriously. It would encourage ongoing \nresearch efforts targeted at the disease and increase public knowledge \nthat could lead to accurate diagnoses and saved lives.\n  In the long run, I believe a Center of Excellence is needed to \nadvance research and provide cutting edge treatments for families with \nCCM. This Center would also advance science, health care, and medical \neducation in the Southwest, while providing jobs for New Mexicans who \nwant to serve their fellow citizens. An expansion of the existing DNA/\ntissue and clinical database is also needed. The current database is \nunderfunded, which means that it cannot accept all the samples that are \noffered. I will be working on both of these issues.\n  Before I close, I want to thank three people who have been at the \nforefront of efforts to understand and fight CCM--Joyce Gonzales, Dr. \nLeslie Morrison of the University of New Mexico, and Connie Lee, \npresident of the Angioma Alliance. It is my honor to once again join \nthem in this fight by introducing this resolution in the Senate today.\n  When it comes to diseases like CCM, knowledge can save lives. We can \nraise the public's and the medical community's understanding of this \ndevastating disease with this resolution. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 148) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 148\n\n       Whereas cerebral cavernous malformation (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``CCM''), or cavernous angioma, is a \n     devastating blood vessel disease that has enormous \n     consequences for people affected and their families;\n       Whereas cavernous angiomas are malformations in the brain \n     that cannot be detected easily, except through very specific \n     medical imaging scans;\n       Whereas people with CCM are rarely aware that they have the \n     disease, which makes taking blood thinners or aspirin risky;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, in the general \n     population, 1 in approximately 200 people has CCM;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, more than \\1/2\\ \n     of the people with CCM experience symptoms at some point in \n     their lives;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, there is a \n     hereditary form of CCM, caused by a mutation or deletion on \n     any 1 of 3 genes, that is characterized by multiple cavernous \n     malformations;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, each child born \n     to parents with the hereditary form of CCM has a 50 percent \n     chance of having CCM;\n       Whereas, according to the Angioma Alliance, a specific \n     genetic mutation of CCM called the ``common Hispanic \n     mutation'', which has been traced to the original Spanish \n     settlers of the Americas in the 1590's, has now spread across \n     at least 17 generations of families;\n       Whereas while CCM is more prevalent in certain States, \n     families throughout the United States are at risk;\n       Whereas a person with CCM could go undiagnosed until sudden \n     death, seizure, or stroke;\n       Whereas there is a shortage of physicians who are familiar \n     with CCM, making it difficult for people with CCM to receive \n     timely diagnosis and appropriate care;\n       Whereas the shortage of such physicians has a \n     disproportionate impact on thousands of Hispanics across the \n     United States;\n       Whereas CCM has not been studied sufficiently by the \n     National Institutes of Health and others;\n       Whereas there is a need to expeditiously initiate pilot \n     studies to research the use of medications to treat CCM; and\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n       Whereas medications that treat CCM will enable preventive \n     treatment that reduces the risk of hemorrhage in those who \n     have been diagnosed, thereby saving lives and dramatically \n     reducing healthcare costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that there is \n     a critical need to increase research, awareness, and \n     education about cerebral cavernous malformations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/13/senate-section/article/S5457-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 14, 2009\n\n  Mr. DODD.
