Mr. President, the American people want health care \nreform. There is no question about that. But they have serious concerns \nabout some of the proposals coming out of Washington, concerns that I \nhave outlined on the Senate floor over the past few weeks. And \nAmericans are also increasingly concerned about the way these proposals \nare being sold. Specifically, they are concerned that the same mistakes \nthat were made on the economic stimulus bill are about to be made \nagain--only this time, those mistakes would be all but permanent and \nwould directly affect every single American family.\n  Here is what they are concerned about:\n  Earlier this year, advocates of the stimulus said that the bill had \nto pass right away, with minimal scrutiny and minimal bipartisan \nsupport. They gave the American people less than 24 hours to review one \nof the costliest pieces of legislation in history, and then they hoped \nfor a good result. The reason for the rush is clear. Proponents of the \nstimulus were concerned that public support would start to fade if \npeople got a closer look at the details. So they short-changed the \ndebate and overpromised on results. And now their predictions are \ncoming back to bite them.\n  Here is what they said at the time.\n  They said that if the stimulus passed, unemployment wouldn't rise \nabove 8 percent. Unemployment is now approaching 10 percent. They said \nthe stimulus was necessary to jumpstart the economy. Yet now, with \nabout a half million jobs lost every month, they have started to admit \nthat they simply ``misread'' the economy.\n  These were costly mistakes, and we can't take them back.\n  But we can prevent these same kinds of mistakes on health care. If \nthe stimulus taught us anything it is that Americans should be \nskeptical any time someone in Washington rushes them into a major \npurchase with taxpayer dollars. We would walk away from any car \nsalesman who tried to rush us into buying a car--even if it was a cheap \none.\n  We should be just as skeptical of a lawmaker who tries to do the same \nthing with our tax dollars and trillions in borrowed money. And now \nthat Americans are hearing the same kinds of arguments about health \ncare that we heard about the stimulus, the taxpayer antenna should \nbegin to go up.\n  Now it is time for advocates of a government-run health plan to \nactually take the time to determine what reforms will actually save us \nmoney and increase access to care while preserving the things people \nlike about our system.\n  Taking time may be frustrating to those who want to rush a health \ncare bill through Congress before their constituents have a chance to \nsee what they are buying. But the fact that the public is increasingly \nconcerned about government-run health care isn't reason to rush. It is \nreason to take the time we need to get it right--and to make a serious \neffort to get members of both parties to work out reforms that a \nbipartisan majority can agree to, several of which I have enumerated \nmany times already on the Senate floor.\n  We should reform our medical liability laws to discourage junk \nlawsuits and bring down the cost of care; we should encourage wellness \nand prevention programs that have been successful in cutting costs; we \nshould encourage competition in the private insurance market; and we \nshould address the needs of small businesses without creating new taxes \nthat kill jobs.\n  Advocates of government health care should also be exceedingly \ncautious about the predictions they make this time around. We already \nknow that many of the promises that are being made about a government-\nrun health plan are unrealistic--such as the claim that everyone who \nlikes the insurance they have will be able to keep it and that the cost \nof such health care proposals won't add to the national debt.\n  As Democrats rushed the stimulus funds out the door, they also \npredicted it wouldn't be wasted. Yet every day we hear about another \noutrageous project that it is being used to fund. I have listed some of \nthese projects in previous floor remarks, such as a $3.4 million turtle \ntunnel in Florida. Americans struggling to hold onto their homes and \ntheir jobs want to know why their tax dollars are being spent on such \nwasteful and needless projects.\n  Americans were overpromised on the stimulus. This time they want the \nfacts.\n  Soon, the Government Accountability Office will issue a report that \ngives us an even greater sense of the problems with the stimulus. I am \nconcerned that this report provide an even clearer accounting of the \nmistakes that were made with that bill--and the flawed manner in which \nit was sold to the American people.\n  Americans who are now waking up to headlines about the problems with \nthe stimulus don't want to be told a few months from now that the \npeople who sold them a government-run health care system misread the \nstate of our health care industry, or that the health care plan they \nare proposing was based on faulty assumptions.\n  Americans don't want to wake up a few years from now with their \nfamilies enrolled in a government-run health care system because some \nhere in Washington decided to rush and spend a trillion dollars and let \nthe chips fall where they may.\n  The American people don't want us to rush through a misguided plan \nthat pushes them off of their health insurance and onto a government \nplan that denies, delays, and rations care. On the stimulus, Americans \nsaw what happens when Democrats rush and spend. When it comes to health \ncare, they are demanding we take the time to get it right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7154-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7154-S7155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, the Supreme Court decided \nthe case of Ricci v. DeStefano in which it ruled that the city of New \nHaven, CT, unlawfully discriminated against a number of mostly White \nfirefighters by throwing out a standardized employment promotion test \nbecause some minority firefighters had not performed as well as they \nhad.\n  In this case, the Supreme Court was correct in my view. The \ngovernment should not be allowed to discriminate intentionally on the \nbasis of race on the grounds that a race-neutral, standardized test--\nwhich is administered in a racially neutral fashion--results in some \nraces not performing as well as others.\n  Yet regardless of where one comes out on this question, there are at \nleast two aspects of how all nine Justices handled this very important \ncase that stand in stark contrast to how Judge Sotomayor and her panel \non the Second Circuit handled it--and which call into question Judge \nSotomayor's judgment.\n  First, this case involves complex questions of Federal employment \nlaw; namely, the tension between the law's protection from intentional \ndiscrimination--known as ``disparate treatment'' discrimination--and \nthe law's protection from less overt forms of discrimination, known as \n``disparate impact'' discrimination.\n  It also involves important constitutional questions--such as whether \nthe government, consistent with the 14th amendment's guarantee of equal \nprotection under the law, may intentionally discriminate against some \nof its citizens in the name of avoiding possible discriminatory results \nagainst other of its citizens.\n  Every court involved in this case realized that it involved complex \nquestions that warranted thorough treatment--every court, that is, \nexcept for Judge Sotomayor's panel. The district court, which first \ntook up the case, spent 48 pages wrestling with these issues. The \nSupreme Court devoted 93 pages to analyzing them. By contrast, Judge \nSotomayor's panel dismissed the firefighters' claims in just 6 \nsentences--a treatment that her colleague and fellow Clinton appointee, \nJose Cabranes, called ``remarkable,'' ``perfunctory,'' and not worthy \n``of the weighty issues presented by'' the firefighters' appeal.\n  It would be one thing if the Ricci case presented simple issues that \nwere answered simply by applying clear precedent. But the Supreme Court \ndoesn't take simple cases. And at any rate, no one buys that this case \nwas squarely governed by precedent, not even Judge Sotomayor.\n  We know this because in perfunctorily dismissing the firefighters'\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nclaims, Judge Sotomayor did not even cite a precedent.\n  Moreover, she herself joined an en banc opinion of the Second Circuit \nthat said the issues in the case were ``difficult.'' So, to quote the \nNational Journal's Stuart Taylor, the way Judge Sotomayor handled the \nimportant legal issues involved in this case was ``peculiar'' to say \nthe least. And it makes one wonder why her treatment of these weighty \nissues differed so markedly from the way every other court has treated \nthem and whether her legal judgment was unduly affected by her personal \nor political beliefs.\n  Second, all nine Justices on the Supreme Court said that Judge \nSotomayor got the law wrong. She ruled that the government can \nintentionally discriminate against one group on the basis of race if it \ndislikes the outcome of a race-neutral exam and claims that another \ngroup may sue it. Or, as Judge Cabranes put it, under her approach, \nemployers can ``reject the results of an employment examination \nwhenever those results failed to yield a desired racial outcome, i.e., \nfailed to satisfy a racial quota.''\n  No one on the Supreme Court, not even the dissenters, thought that \nwas a correct reading of the law.\n  Justice Kennedy's majority opinion said that before it can \nintentionally discriminate on the basis of race in an employment \nmatter, the government must have a ``strong basis in evidence'' that it \ncould lose a lawsuit by a disgruntled party claiming a discriminatory \neffect of an employment decision. And even Justice Ginsburg and the \ndissenters said that before it intentionally discriminates, the \ngovernment must have at least ``good cause'' to believe that it could \nlose a lawsuit by the disgruntled party.\n  Not Judge Sotomayor. She evidently believes that statistics alone \nallow the government to intentionally discriminate against one group in \nfavor of another if it claims to fear a lawsuit.\n  Stuart Taylor notes why this is problematic. As he put it, the \nSotomayor approach would, ``risk converting'' Federal \nantidiscrimination ``law into an engine of overt discrimination against \nhigh-scoring groups across the country and allow racial politics and \nracial quotas to masquerade as voluntary compliance with the law.'' \nUnder such a regime, Taylor notes, ``no employer could ever safely \nproceed with promotions based on any test on which minorities fared \nbadly.''\n  It is one thing to get the law wrong, but Judge Sotomayor got the law \nreally wrong in the Ricci case, and the New Haven firefighters suffered \nfor it. To add insult to injury, the perfunctory way in which she \ntreated their case indicates either that she did not really care about \ntheir claims, or that she let her own experiences planning and \noverseeing these types of lawsuits with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense \nand Education Fund affect her judgment in this case.\n  As has been reported, before she was on the bench, Judge Sotomayor \nwas in leadership positions with PRLDEF for over a decade. While there, \nshe monitored the group's lawsuits and was described as an ``ardent \nsupporter'' of its litigation projects, one of the most important of \nwhich was a plan to sue cities based on their use of civil service \nexams. In fact, she has been credited with helping develop the group's \npolicy of challenging these types of standardized tests.\n  Is the way Judge Sotomayor treated the firefighters' claims in the \nRicci case what President Obama means when he says he wants judges who \ncan ``empathize'' with certain groups? Is this why Judge Sotomayor \nherself said she doubted that judges can be impartial, ``even in most \ncases''? It is a troubling philosophy for any judge, let alone one \nnominated to our highest court, to convert ``empathy'' into favoritism \nfor particular groups.\n  The Ricci decision is the tenth of Judge Sotomayor's cases that the \nSupreme Court has reviewed. And it is the ninth time out of ten that \nthe Supreme Court has disagreed with her. In fact, she is 0 for 3 \nduring the Supreme Court's last term.\n  The President says that only 5 percent of cases that Federal judges \ndecide really matter. I do not know if he is right. But I do know that, \nby necessity, the Supreme Court only takes a small number of cases, and \nit only takes cases that matter. And I know that in the Supreme Court, \nJudge Sotomayor's been wrong 90 percent of the time.\n  In the Ricci case, her third and final reversal of this term, Judge \nSotomayor was so wrong in interpreting the law that all nine justices, \nof all ideological stripes, disagreed with her. As we consider her \nnomination to the Supreme Court, my colleagues should ask themselves \nthis important question: is she allowing her personal or political \nagenda to cloud her judgment and favor one group of individuals over \nanother, irrespective of what the law says?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7155-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Republican Senate leader Senator McConnell \nhas just completed his leadership statement. I would like to respond to \ntwo or three of his points.\n  I am not surprised that he opposes Sonya Sotomayor, the President's \nnominee to the Supreme Court. He has stated that earlier, that he does \nnot believe she should take this important position. I disagree. Sonya \nSotomayor comes to us having first been nominated for a Federal \njudgeship under Republican President George H.W. Bush and then was \nnominated for a promotion to the circuit level, the next higher bench, \nby President Clinton. So she has enjoyed bipartisan support in her \njudicial career. In fact, she brings more experience on the bench to \nthe Supreme Court if she wins the nomination, if it is approved by the \nSenate, than any nominee in modern memory. So there is no question she \nwas qualified both under a Republican President and a Democratic \nPresident. Now she brings that accumulated experience in this effort to \nbe part of the Supreme Court.\n  I have met her. She has met personally with over 80 Senators and \ntalked to them, answering every question they had about her background, \nher approach to the law. She is an outstanding candidate.\n  Her life story is one that is inspiring to all. She was raised in \npublic housing in the Bronx, NY. There has been some mention of the \nfact that she was a volunteer attorney for the Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense Fund. It is a fact that she is of Puerto Rican national \ndescent. When she was 9 years old, her father passed away. Her mother, \na very strong-willed and energetic person, raised her and her brother. \nHer brother is a medical doctor. She is an accomplished attorney. She \nwent to Princeton University and graduated with one of the highest \nacademic honors and then went on to Yale Law School, where she also was \nacknowledged as being one of the most outstanding law students in her \nclass.\n  This is a person who comes to this job with a resume that, as a \nlawyer myself, I look at with a great deal of envy. She is an \nextraordinarily gifted person. There could be questions raised about \nany judge's ruling on any case. But the fact is, I believe she has a \nrecord that is unparalleled in terms of judicial experience. So I hope \nthose who listened to Senator McConnell's remarks will also reflect on \nthe fact that Judge Sotomayor is an extraordinarily talented and gifted \nperson. If Senator McConnell is going to oppose her nomination--it \nsounds as if he will--I hope some on his side of the aisle will join us \nin a bipartisan effort to make her part of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7155-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7155-S7156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ECONOMY FIT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator McConnell was also critical of President Obama, \nthe President's attempt to deal with the economy he inherited from the \nprevious President. The economy was in\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nthe worst shape we have seen it since the Great Depression when \nPresident Obama was sworn into office. It was not, as he said, his \nchoice to face that kind of an issue or challenge, but it was the \nreality of what he faced. He did the right thing. He said: I am not \ngoing to stand idly by and observe this economy continue to decline, \nwith more and more people facing unemployment, businesses failing, and \npeople losing their savings. I am going to step up and try to create \njobs, save and create jobs here in America so that we do not see more \npeople in the unemployment lines.\n  I supported that. Luckily, three Republican Senators at the time \njoined us; otherwise, we could not have passed it. So we had a \nbipartisan vote supporting President Obama's recovery and reinvestment \npackage. Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, opposed it. He came \nto the floor today to say that we wasted our money on this stimulus \npackage and that we should be very skeptical of these things. The fact \nis, the Republicans in the Senate had nothing to offer as an \nalternative. Their alternative was to stand idly by and watch the \neconomy continue to descend, continue to deteriorate, and maybe with a \nlittle prayer and hope that it would turn around. That is not good \nenough.\n  President Obama said: Let's first, in this stimulus package, take at \nleast 40 percent of all of the funds I am asking for and give it back \nto Americans in tax breaks for working families. Families need a \nhelping hand, the President said. I voted for that. I think that was \nsensible. The President made that decision. Senator McConnell thinks \nthat is wasteful, to give tax breaks to working families--at least he \nsaid it was wasted. I do not believe it is wasteful. It is a good thing \nto do to try to revitalize the country.\n  The President said: Let's invest in what will pay off for a long time \nto come. Let's put money into infrastructure, let's build that which \nwill serve our economy and serve America, and let's create good-paying \njobs to do it. I thought that was sensible.\n  The President said: Let's look to the next generation of needs in \nAmerica. Let's make sure we are investing in energy projects which will \npay back in years to come and lessen our dependence on foreign energy \nsources--another good investment from where I am sitting.\n  He also said: Give a helping hand to those unemployed, a little extra \nmoney for them each month to get by. It was not a lot, but for many \nfamilies it made a difference.\n  He also said: Give the unemployed a helping hand so they can keep \ntheir health insurance. If you lose a job, you lose your health \ninsurance. Think about that if you are trying to raise a family. The \nPresident said: Let's try to reduce the premiums unemployed people will \npay.\n  Now Senator McConnell comes to the floor and said this was a waste of \ntime and a waste of money for us to make that kind of investment in \nAmerica. I believe the President did the right thing. I would commend \nto Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, the latest Pew Poll, which \nshows that when Americans were asked if America's economy is on the \nright track or wrong track, they have come in with the highest number--\n53 percent on the right track, 39 percent on the wrong track--we have \nseen in months. There is a feeling that we still have a long way to go. \nThere are still too many people unemployed, too many businesses \nfailing. But at least we are on the right track toward recovery. It may \ntake some time. Nobody predicted this would be fast or easy. But the \nPresident showed leadership, inheriting a bad economy and showing \nleadership to deal with it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7156-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7156-S7157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The major thrust of the remarks of the Senate Republican \nleader, day after day, has been in opposition to health care reform. I \nwill tell you that I think the Republican leader is out of step with \nAmerica. America understands we need to do something about our health \ncare system. We are spending twice as much per person for health care \nin America as any nation on Earth--twice as much--and the medical \noutcomes, unfortunately, do not reflect that kind of major investment. \nIn other words, we are wasting money in our current health care system.\n  That has to change. So what we need to do is preserve those things in \nour health care system today that are good and fix the things that are \nbroken, and that is what the President has challenged us to do. This is \nnot something new. This challenge has been waiting for 15 years since \nformer President Clinton tackled it and, unfortunately, could not pass \nit. We have seen our health care costs in America continue to skyrocket \nand our costs for health insurance following in track. Now we have to \ndo something about it.\n  Time and again, the Senator from Kentucky comes to the floor and \nsays: We are rushing into this. I would just say to him that in the \nyear 2008 the Senate Finance Committee, under Chairman Max Baucus, held \n10 hearings on health reform and a day-long bipartisan summit with the \nFinance Committee's ranking member, Republican Chuck Grassley. This \nyear, the Finance Committee has held two reform-related hearings, three \nroundtabless, three walk-throughs with policy options, and a number of \nclosed-door sessions to discuss all of the issues on a bipartisan \nbasis. The HELP Committee, which is another committee of the Senate \nalso considering health care reform, has held 14 bipartisan \nroundtabless, 13 committee hearings, and 20 walk-throughs. Democrats \nare not rushing this through. We have taken this up in an orderly way, \ntrying to analyze one of the most significant challenges ever facing \nCongress.\n  Time and again, Senator McConnell has also come to the floor and \nargued that Americans should be afraid of change, be afraid, be very \nafraid. He argued before be afraid of closing Guantanamo; now he is \nsaying be afraid of health care reform. This is not a fearful nation. \nWe are a nation which accepts challenges and does our best to try to \nfind solutions. We are a good and caring nation of people who want to \nmake certain that, at end of the day, we reduce the cost of health care \nfor everyone, bringing it more in line with efficiency and effective \nmedical care, and we also pick up the 50 million Americans who have no \nhealth insurance and give them protection, bring them under the \numbrella of protection. We should not be afraid of that challenge. Why \nwould we be afraid? We know if we don't tackle it, it will continue to \ncost us more and more money.\n  One of the things the Senator from Kentucky says repeatedly, which is \njust plain wrong, is that under the proposals coming before the Senate, \nthe government can take away health insurance people have today. I am \nsorry the Senator is not on the floor. I am sure some Members of his \nstaff will alert him to the fact. I would like to read from the \nlanguage from the HELP Committee bill which is presently being \nconsidered. This language makes it abundantly clear,--in fact, says \ndirectly--that we can keep our health care plans, that they would not \nbe taken away. That is something most Americans want to have the \nbenefit of. Let me read from the HELP Committee bill that will be \nconsidered by the Senate:\n\n       Nothing in this Act or an amendment made to this Act shall \n     be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage \n     under a group health plan or health insurance coverage in \n     which such individual was enrolled prior to the date of \n     enactment of this title.\n\n  That is what it says. If one likes their health insurance today, \nnothing we do in health care reform will take that way from them. It is \nexpressly stated. Time and again, Senator McConnell comes to the floor \nand says the opposite: Government is going to take away your health \ninsurance. The clear language of the bill says: No, that is not our \nintention. That is not what we are going to do.\n  I am also concerned when I listen to the Senator from Kentucky talk \nabout government-run health care. He says it in negative terms, as if \nthe government's involvement in health insurance and medical care is \ninherently wrong or misguided or ineffective. Here are the realities: \n45 million Americans out of 300 million currently are covered by \nMedicare. Does the Senator from Kentucky want to eliminate Medicare, a \ngovernment-run health care plan? I am waiting for him to say that. He \nhas never said it. Another 60 million Americans are under Medicaid, \nwhich provides health insurance for the poorest\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\namong us and those who are disabled. So 105 million Americans today \nhave either Medicare or Medicaid. That is a third of America being \ncovered by government-run health care. That is a reality. Most \nAmericans understand there are very positive things to be said for \nthose plans. Would we do without Medicare; would we abolish it? I \ncertainly wouldn't be part of that. In over 40 years, Medicare has \nbrought peace of mind, dignity, and great medical care to millions of \nseniors across America. I wouldn't want to see that go away. I think it \nis a program that has served us well.\n  A question was asked recently by CNN: In general, would you favor or \noppose a program that would increase the Federal Government's influence \nover the country's health care system in an attempt to lower costs and \nprovide health care coverage to more Americans? The numbers that came \nback on May 15, by CNN: 69 percent of the American people favor that \nstatement, favor more government involvement in health care to reduce \ncost and expand coverage. Only 29 percent oppose. The position argued \nby the Republican leader does not reflect America's feelings about \nhealth care.\n  If Senator McConnell feels the current health care system is fine and \nwe should not work to change it, he does not, I am afraid, reflect the \nfeelings of most Americans. We can do better. We need to do better on a \nbipartisan basis. We need cooperation on the Republican side of the \naisle in a bipartisan effort to find real solutions, compromise that \nwould not compromise the values of our American health care system but \ngive people a health care program that would not be taken away from \nthem by some health insurance company bureaucrat, something the family \ncan afford, something small businesses can afford.\n  We can do it. We should not be afraid. America has tackled bigger \nchallenges in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7157-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7157-S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING JOHN GRANVILLE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak about the \nvital role our Federal employees play in keeping America safe, \nprosperous, and free.\n  Just days ago, on the Fourth of July, we celebrated the 233rd \nanniversary of our independence. For 233 years, ordinary Americans have \nchosen to give their energy, their time, and their talents in service \nto our government. Many have given their lives.\n  All Federal employees, as I have said previously, are bound together \nby a shared sense of duty and willingness to sacrifice.\n  When the Founders added their signatures to the Declaration of \nIndependence, they did so with faith in their fellow Americans--that \nthe 56 names inked on that parchment were joined in spirit by millions \nof others in their own day and for generations to come.\n  They knew that building a nation requires more than a handful of men.\n  It entails the active participation of citizens from all walks of \nlife.\n  This is why, a decade later, when the Framers assembled in \nPhiladelphia to draft our Constitution, they did so with an expectation \nthat regular citizens would be the form and substance of our \ngovernment.\n  Indeed, they knew firsthand the value of service above self. This \nvirtue would lead countless Americans who had fought for freedom to \nbecome the first generation of Federal employees.\n  The Founders and Framers had good cause to predict such participation \namong citizens beyond their appointed role as electors and jurors. The \nclassical history and writings that influenced them are filled with \npraise for the values of duty and sacrifice that inspire public \nservice.\n  Many educated Americans in 1776 were familiar with the story of \nHoratius the Roman.\n  When the armies of a tyrant approached the walls of Rome, the \ncitizens of its infant republic were called to arms.\n  Horatius ran across the last bridge spanning the Tiber River where he \nalone held off the enemy as his compatriots destroyed the bridge behind \nhim. With this personal act of courage, he prevented the capture of \nRome.\n  Horatius was not a professional soldier. He was neither an elected \nleader nor a man of high birth.\n  But he defended with pride that title of honor greater than any \nother--citizen. He gave his life so that others could remain free.\n  His act is an example of the kind of sacrifices that ordinary \ncitizens are willing to make when they know freedom is in jeopardy.\n  Americans looked to classical figures like Horatius in 1776, when \ntheir own liberty was uncertain.\n  It is this common willingness to risk safety and personal gain that \nsets apart a commonwealth of citizens from a nation of subjects.\n  It is these same qualities that make our Federal employees so worthy \nof praise.\n  On the Fourth of July, I thought about ordinary Americans who choose \nto serve their country in often perilous situations. Many of them risk \nharm while defending the liberty and values that infuse our citizenship \nwith meaning.\n  As I have said before, our Federal employees exemplify the American \nvalue of service above self.\n  Throughout our history, Federal employees have traveled to dangerous \ncorners of the globe, in order to represent the American people abroad, \npromote peaceful international cooperation, and provide aid to those in \nneed.\n  John Granville was one of those who felt called to serve his country, \neven if it meant traveling to places where his own safety was \nuncertain.\n  A native of Orchard Park, NY, near Buffalo, John studied at Fordham \nand Clark Universities before joining the Peace Corps. His service in \nthe Corps took him to Cameroon, in West Africa, from 1997 to 1999.\n  While there, he applied for and received a Fulbright fellowship to \ncontinue living in that country and conduct research on its society and \ndevelopment.\n  John, committed to serving his country and helping others, then \njoined the Foreign Service.\n  He worked for the U.S. Agency\nfor International Development--or USAID--in Kenya before heading to \nSudan in 2005.\n  It was a dangerous assignment. That year, the Sudanese Government \nsigned a cease-fire to end a long civil war in that country's south. \nJohn's assignment was to distribute 75,000 radios to rural villagers.\n  These radios could be powered by the Sun or by handcrank.\n  With democratic elections approaching, these radios would give the \nlocal Sudanese access to uncensored international news broadcasts.\n  As a former member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, I can \nattest to the importance of providing access to free and uncensored \nnews. It is a vital part of developing democratic culture and press \nfreedom. It also promotes hope and understanding, which help deter the \nspread of extremist views.\n  John worked with a dedicated team of USAID officials to distribute \nthese radios and other aid to rural south Sudanese. One of his \ncoworkers later said that John was ``the glue'' that held their group \ntogether and that he kept up their spirits throughout the mission.\n  On New Year's Day, 2008, John was gunned down by four militants who \ntargeted his car for its diplomatic plates. He was only 33 years old.\n  His loved ones back home remembered him as an ``unselfish \nhumanitarian,'' a ``consummate professional,'' and someone who ``worked \nwith energy and imagination.'' John was an active member of the St. \nJohn Vianney Church community, and he was a mentor who inspired others \nto follow in his footsteps by helping those in need.\n  John Granville believed in the importance of service as part of \ncitizenship.\n  He crossed the ocean and stood on the other side, like the Roman \nHoratius at the far end of the bridge, carrying out the people's work \nand risking his own safety in service to his Nation.\n  He had told his mother on several occasions that despite the danger \nof his work, he would not want to be doing anything else.\n  There are thousands of Foreign Service officers, USAID workers, and \njournalists and employees with the Broadcasting Board of Governors all \nover the globe.\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\n  These dedicated men and women leave behind family, friends, and \ncommunities. Their careers often take them through dangerous parts of \nthe world, where the threat from crime, disease, war, and terrorism is \nvery real.\n  All too frequently their sacrifices and achievements go unrecognized. \nOn occasion, they make the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Because we just celebrated the Fourth of July, let me return for a \nmoment to the founding generation.\n  Those first Americans who sacrificed for liberty established more \nthan our Republic. They left us with a democratic legacy that reminds \nus everyday of our rights and our duties as equal citizens.\n  The descendents of those revolutionaries, when they designed and \nornamented this magnificent Capitol, enshrined a powerful message. The \npaintings in the Capitol Rotunda, just steps from here, narrate the \nstory of how America achieved its greatness.\n  They tell not of the force of arms or the achievements of a powerful \nfew. Rather, taken as a whole, these eight paintings celebrate the \nevolution of American citizenship.\n  The turning point in this narrative is highlighted by Trumbull's \niconic portrayal of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.\n  But the last painting in the cycle is the most poignant and recalls \nthe climactic movement in the development of our citizenship.\n  Washington, at his height of popularity, willingly yields his power \nand authority back to the people by resigning his commission.\n  With his sacrifice in that moment, the American people were truly \nfree, and those who laid out this cycle of paintings did so to acclaim \nthis birth of American citizenship.\n  They remind us that our citizenship is a pact between equals, that no \nAmerican should ever rule arbitrarily over another.\n  It is this notion of citizenship that governs the relationship \nbetween the American people and our Federal employees.\n  As a commonwealth of citizens, we entrust our fellow Americans who \nwork in the Federal Government to perform that noble task so yearned \nfor by the 56 men who wrote and signed the Declaration.\n  They secure our unalienable rights by constituting a government \nderiving its ``just powers from the consent of the governed.''\n  Their hard work and their sacrifices protect our lives, preserve our \nliberty, and enable all Americans to pursue happiness.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing the \nimmeasurable sacrifice made by John Granville and all civilian Federal \nemployees who gave their lives in service to our Nation.\n  Their names will forever be inscribed on the eternal Declaration that \ncontinually secures our freedom.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the last few years, I have traveled all \nover this country talking to people about health care. After listening \nto countless Americans--including in two townhall meetings last week--I \nproposed in the past health care reforms that would have ensured health \ncare coverage was more affordable, accessible, portable, and suitable \nfor all American families.\n  Health reforms need to be consistent with our American values of \nfreedom, choice, and limited government. The key to these reforms is to \nput our citizens in charge of their own health coverage. Rather than \nbeing stuck in a job because the job provides health care, or worse, \nlosing health insurance if the economy causes you to lose your job, we \nneed to change our system and allow Americans to obtain coverage \noptions with a tax credit for policies not limited by State boundaries \nor government dictates.\n  Just this past week, I had the great good fortune to visit two of the \nfinest health care institutions in this country. First, I spent time \nwith hundreds of patients, doctors, nurses, and health care leaders at \nthe world-renowned MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. I heard \nfrom patients who had come to this center of excellence from 90 \ncountries and States, including Arizona. Why do patients come to the \nUnited States of America from all over the world? It is because the \nhighest quality health care is in the United States of America. And I \nrepeat, the fundamentals of this discussion and debate sometimes go \nastray from the fact that the highest quality health care in the world \nis available in the United States of America. The key to it and our \nchallenge is to make that health care available and affordable to all \nAmericans. The path we are on will destroy the quality of that coverage \nand will, in fact, make health care the same as it is in other \ncountries. The reason they leave there is to get high-quality health \ncare in the United States of America. It is the best--our system--\nbecause innovation and technology are allowed to flourish.\n  Later in the week, in my home State of Arizona, I visited one of the \npremier children's hospitals in the country. Phoenix Children's \nHospital is a destination medical facility for children all around the \nSouthwest and in the country. At Phoenix Children's Hospital, I also \nmet with patients, physicians, nurses, medical executives, and average \nArizonans. During this visit, not one health care provider in Phoenix \ntold me they wanted more government control over health care. In fact, \nthey told me the opposite. PCH has experience with Medicaid, and time \nafter time I was told of the problems providers face every day with the \ngovernment Medicaid Program. The program is a vital safety net for the \nlow income, but we have to recognize the important lessons we have \nalready learned about government running health care programs.\n  During these events, I was repeatedly told that we need reform. They \nalso told me about the problems they face in the government-controlled \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs, both with massive unfunded liabilities. \nThey want a stable system that keeps costs under control, gets everyone \ncovered, pays fairly, encourages innovation, and maintains America's \nstanding as providing the best health care in the world. But none of \nthem told me we need more government control of health care or \ngovernment-controlled health insurance.\n  I have listened to Americans. But I am worried they are not being \nheard here in Congress by those who control the agenda in the White \nHouse and the Senate. If President Obama and the Democratic leaders \nwere listening, we would not have a bill before us that costs too much, \ntaxes too much, covers too few, and puts government in control at every \nturn.\n  This country has fought for over 200 years for the fundamental values \nthat I fear are being eroded by the other side's appetite for one-size-\nfits-all government control of one of our most cherished economic gems.\n  First, this administration takes over the banking industry. Then they \ntake over the auto industry. Along the way, they tell us $787 billion \nin more and bigger government, along with $1.8 trillion of debt this \nyear alone, is the answer to our ailing economy. Now they are telling \nthe American people they were not aware of the economic situation and, \nguess what, they are going to want another stimulus package. I think \nthat idea would be soundly rejected by the American people. And now \nthey are telling the American people that we must rush to pass a new \ngovernment health care plan that we cannot pay for, will increase \ntaxes, and kill jobs. We are talking about one-sixth of the gross \nnational product of America. And it is pretty obvious the other side \nwants to jam this through in the next 4 weeks. We should not do\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\nthat. They still have not come up with ways to pay for this grandiose \ntakeover of the American health care system.\n  Americans are losing health care coverage every day. And it gets back \nto the issue of affordability, not quality. But the Democrats cannot \nproduce legislation that responsibly makes coverage available to all \nAmericans without trillions of dollars in new spending.\n  This weekend, after a 4-week delay, we finally received new \nprovisions in their new government-run health care plans. Here is what \nwe know about the legislation before us:\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the preliminary cost estimate \nfor the new language they reviewed was nearly $900 billion in new \nspending. The other side says this is a cost reduction from an earlier \nversion of the bill. Do not be fooled by the smoke and mirrors. After \nan inexplicable 4-year phase-in that delays several provisions in the \nDemocratic bill in an effort to hide costs through accounting \ntechniques, the bill will actually spend $1.5 trillion when it is fully \nimplemented. And that is not counting the hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new Medicaid spending promised by that legislation.\n  CBO also tells us the HELP Committee bill still leaves over 30 \nmillion Americans without coverage. Mr. President, for all the spending \nbeing proposed, don't you think we should be covering more than 40 \npercent of the uninsured? When the final numbers come in, don't be \nsurprised if the cost of this ``rush'' proposal is at or above $2 \ntrillion. What is worse, the sponsors cannot tell us how we will pay \nfor such a massive price tag.\n  My colleagues and I plan to continue talking to the American public. \nI suggest the other side in the Senate talk to all Americans about what \nthey need rather than making these decisions for them.\n  Again, Mr. President, we cannot risk running through a legislative \nproposal in the next 4 to 5 weeks and be sure that we are not making \nserious and fundamental mistakes. And the serious and fundamental \nmistake is the approach to this legislation, which is, the quality of \nhealth care in America can and must be preserved; it is the cost that \nneeds to be brought under control. We can bring those costs under \ncontrol by innovative techniques, by competition, by allowing Americans \nto go all across America to get the health insurance of their choice--\nthe same way we have been able to reduce costs in other sectors of our \neconomy, as technology has improved the quality of our lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I was here to listen to the \nthoughtful comments of the Senator from Arizona. His leadership on the \nHELP Committee in trying to help make certain we help Americans have \naccess to health care they can afford and that we do that in a way that \nleaves them with a government they can afford and with choices so they \ndo not have government in between themselves and their doctors has been \nvery important. I thank him for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7159-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7159-S7161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAXPAYER STOCK OWNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator talked about spending and \ndebt. During my week in Tennessee last week, if I heard about anything, \nit was about too much debt. People are genuinely worried about the \namount of new debt and spending in Washington. But if I heard anything \nelse last week, it was about too many Washington takeovers. Senator \nMcCain mentioned some of them. He mentioned banking. He talked about, \nperhaps, student loans. He mentioned the health care industry. And he \nmentioned the automobile industry, which is what I would like to talk \nabout for a few minutes this morning.\n  Yesterday was good news for General Motors. The judge in the \nbankruptcy case apparently approved a plan that by the end of the week \nshould free General Motors from bankruptcy, and we could have a new GM, \nfor which I wish great success because General Motors has made great \ncontributions to our State of Tennessee over the last 25 years. Its \nSaturn plant has helped to attract hundreds of suppliers and has \nproduced a good car, although they never made any money for one reason \nor another. But they made a great contribution to our State. So the \ngood news is General Motors is going to get out of bankruptcy. The bad \nnews is that the U.S. Government still owns 61 percent of General \nMotors, as well as about 8 percent of Chrysler. And it was paid for \nwith real dollars.\n  Mr. President, $50 billion or so in taxpayer dollars went to buy 61 \npercent of General Motors. Well, I have a solution which I would like \nto discuss, offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett; the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl; the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, other \nSenators, and myself. Our legislation would direct the Department of \nthe Treasury, within 1 year after General Motors comes out of \nbankruptcy, to distribute all of the government stock in General Motors \nand in Chrysler to the 120 million Americans who pay taxes on April \n15--in other words, a stock dividend. We want to give the stock to the \npeople who paid for it. The idea is pretty simple: I paid for it, I \nought to own it. Not only would that stop the incestuous political \nmeddling that seems to go on here in Washington with General Motors--\nWashington cannot seem to keep its hands off the car company--it would \nalso create an investor fan base of 120 million Americans who might be \ninterested in the success of General Motors or be a little more \ninterested than they are today.\n  Think of the Green Bay Packers. The fans own the team, and the fans \nare even a little bit more interested in who the quarterback might be \nthan they might otherwise be. Well, if 120 million Americans owned a \nlittle bit of General Motors, the New GM, they might be a little more \ninterested in the next Chevy and it might help General Motors succeed.\n  I can suggest one thing that will make sure the company does not \nsucceed, and that is to keep the ownership of General Motors in \nWashington, DC, with meddling politics interfering with the executives \nand the workers who are designing and building and selling cars--or \nwho, I might say, ought to be designing, building, and selling cars.\n  Madam President, about how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  When I first suggested that what we ought to do is just give the \nstock to taxpayers, I think some of my colleagues thought I might be \nbeing facetious. But this is a very normal corporate event. It is \ncalled a stock distribution or a corporate spinoff. In 1969, Procter & \nGamble did a spinoff with Clorox, its subsidiary. Procter & Gamble \ndecided its Clorox subsidiary was not a part of the core business of \nProcter & Gamble anymore, so it simply gave shares of Clorox to people \nwho owned the major company, Procter & Gamble. Time Warner did it with \nTime Warner Cable in March of 2009. PepsiCo did it with its restaurant \nbusiness in 1997 by spinning off KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell.\n  If you stop and think about it, it is the simplest way to solve the \nproblem. The President has said he does not want to micromanage General \nMotors and that he plans to sell it. But the President himself has \nalready fired the president of General Motors, put in the board, and \ncalled the mayor of Detroit and said he believes the headquarters ought \nto be in Detroit instead of Warren, MI. Next, you have the chairman of \nthe House Financial Services Committee calling up General Motors \nsaying: Don't close a warehouse in my district. Senators from Tennessee \nand Michigan and other States are saying: Please put a plant in our \nstates. We have at least 60 Congressional committees and subcommittees \nthat could have the General Motors and Chrysler executives drive their \ncongressionally approved hybrid cars to Washington to testify all day \nwhen they ought to be home trying to figure out how to make a car that \nwould sell better than a Toyota or a Nissan or a Honda or some other \ncompany.\n  So let's get the stock out of Washington and into the hands of the \ntaxpayers.\n  Madam President, I have twice presented a car czar award to try to \nput a spotlight on the political meddling in Washington, DC. Once I \ngave it to Barney Frank, the chairman of the House\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nFinancial Services Committee, who called up the General Motors \npresident and said: Don't close a warehouse in my district, and General \nMotors did not close the plant. Once I gave the award to myself and \nothers, who met with GM people and said: Please put a plant in our \ndistrict. Today I would like to present it to a real car czar.\n  In the June 1 Wall Street Journal, there is an article by Lieutenant \nGeneral Pacepa, who was literally the car czar of Romania.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, \nthis article about what Lieutenant General Pacepa learned as car czar \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, basically, he says:\n\n       The United States is far more powerful than Great Britain \n     was then, and no American Attlee should be capable of \n     destroying its solid economic and political base. I hope that \n     the U.S. administration, Congress, and the American voters \n     will take a closer look at history and prevent our automotive \n     industry from following down the [road of the Romanian cars.]\n\n  He cites many examples. For example, how the President of Romania \ndecreed that the Oltcit parts were to be manufactured at 166 existing \nRomanian factories in parts of the country that corresponded to the \nvoting districts. I can see that happening in the United States. We \nalready have Congressmen saying: Don't buy a battery in South Korea; \nbuy one made in my congressional district. General Motors might be \nbuying a battery from South Korea because it would make the Chevy Volt \na success.\n  In the New York Times in 1989, there was an article talking about \nSoviet cars called the Lada, which were the brunt of many jokes, and \nthe difficulty the Soviet Union had coming out of perestroika and \nglasnost.\n  There were jokes such as: What do you call a Lada with twin \ntailpipes? A wheelbarrow.\n  Why do Ladas have heated rear windows? So you can keep your hands \nwarm when you are pushing them in the snow.\n  We politicians don't know anything about making cars. We should not \npretend we do. The American people know that. They don't like the fact \nthat the federal government has spent more than $50 billion bailing out \nthe car companies, but the American people like it worse that we in \nCongress are sitting on 60 committees and subcommittees acting as if we \nare going to help the auto companies succeed. The single most important \nthing we can do to celebrate General Motors coming out of bankruptcy \nthis week is to pass legislation we have offered, which would give all \nof the stock the government has in General Motors and Chrysler, within \n1 year, to the 120 million Americans who pay taxes on April 15.\n  The rationale is very simple: They paid for it; they should own it. \nThat would begin to stop this trend we are seeing every day and every \nmonth in Washington of too many Washington takeovers and move us back \nin the direction we ought to go to rebuild a great car company and get \njobs flowing in this country again.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      What I Learned as a Car Czar\n\n                         (By Ion Mihai Pacepa)\n\n        They say history repeats itself. If you are like me and \n     have lived two lives, you have a good chance of seeing the \n     re-enactment with your own eyes. The current takeover of \n     General Motors by the U.S. government, and United Auto \n     Workers makes me think back to Romania's catastrophic \n     mismanagement of the car factories it built jointly with the \n     French companies Renault and Citroen. I was Romania's car \n     czar.\n       When the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, decided in \n     the mid-1960s that he wanted to have a car industry, he chose \n     me to start the project rolling. In the land of the blind, \n     the one-eyed man is king. I knew nothing about manufacturing \n     cars, but neither did anyone else among Ceausescu's top men. \n     However, my father had spent most of his life running the \n     service department of the General Motors affiliate in \n     Bucharest.\n       My job at the time was as head of the Romanian industrial \n     espionage program. Ceausescu tasked me to mediate the \n     purchase of a minimum, basic license for a small car from a \n     major Western manufacturer, and then to steal everything else \n     needed to produce the car.\n       Three Western companies competed for the honor. Ceausescu \n     decided on Renault, because it was owned by the French \n     government (all Soviet bloc rulers distrusted private \n     companies). We ended up with a license for an antiquated and \n     about-to-be-discontinued Renault-12 car, because it was the \n     cheapest. ``Good enough for the idiots,'' Ceausescu decided, \n     showing what he thought of the Romanian people. He baptized \n     the car Dacia, to commemorate Romania's 2,000-year history, \n     going back to Dacia Felix, as the ancient Romans called that \n     part of the world. In that government-run economy, symbolism \n     was the most important consideration, especially when it came \n     to things in short supply (such as food).\n       ``Too luxurious for the idiots,'' Ceausescu decreed when he \n     saw the first Dacia car made in Romania. Immediately, the \n     radio, right side mirror and backseat heating were dropped. \n     Other ``unnecessary luxuries'' were soon eliminated by the \n     bureaucrats and their workers' union that were running the \n     factory. The car that finally hit the market was a \n     stripped-down version of the old, stripped-down Renault \n     12. ``Perfect for the idiots,'' Ceausescu approved. \n     Indeed, the Romanian people, had never before had any car, \n     came to cherish the Dacia.\n       For the Western market, however, the Dacia was a nightmare, \n     To the best of my knowledge, no Dacia car was ever sold in \n     the U.S.\n       Ceausescu, undaunted, was determined to see Romanian cars \n     running around in every country in the world. He tasked me to \n     buy another Western license, this time to produce a car \n     tailored for export. Oltcit was the name of the new car--an \n     amalgam made from the words Oltenia, Ceausescu's native \n     province, and the French car maker Citroen, which owned 49% \n     of the shares. Oltcit was projected to produce between 90,000 \n     and 150,000 compact cars designed by Citroen.\n       Ceausescu micromanaged Oltcit, but he didn't even know how \n     to drive a car, much less run a car industry. To save the \n     foreign currency he coveted, he decreed that the components \n     for the Oltcit were to be manufactured at 166 existing \n     Romanian factories. Coordinating 166 plants to have them \n     deliver all the parts on time would be a monumental job even \n     for an experienced car producer. It proved impossible for the \n     Romanian bureaucracy, which pretended to work and was paid \n     accordingly. The Oltcit factory could produce only 1% to 1.5% \n     of its intended capacity owing to the lack of the parts that \n     those 166 companies were supposed to furnish simultaneously. \n     The Oltcit project lost billions.\n       Ceausescu was an extreme case, but automobile manufacturing \n     and government were never a good mix in any socialist/\n     communist country. In the late 1950s; when I headed Romania's \n     foreign intelligence station in West Germany, I worked \n     closely with the foreign branch of the East German Stasi. Its \n     chief, Markus Wolf, rewarded me with a Trabant car--the \n     pride of East Germany--when I left to return to Romania.\n       That ugly little car became famous in 1989 when thousands \n     of East Germans used it to cross to the West. The Trabant \n     originally derived from a well regarded West German car (the \n     DKW) made by Audi, which today produces some of the most \n     prestigious cars in the world. In the hands of the East \n     German government, the unfortunate DKW became a farce of a \n     car. The bureaucrats and union that ran the Trabant factory \n     made the car smaller and boxier, to give it a more \n     proletarian look. To reduce production costs, they cut down \n     on the size of the original, already small DKW engine, and \n     they replaced the metal body with one made of plastic-covered \n     cardboard. What rolled off the assembly line was a kind of \n     horseless carriage that roared like a lawn mower and polluted \n     the air worse than a whole city block full of big Western \n     cars.\n       After German reunification, the plucky little ``Trabi'' \n     that East Germans used to wait 10 years to buy became an \n     embarrassment, and its production was stopped. Germany's \n     junkyards are now piled high with Trabants, which cannot be \n     recycled because burning their plastic-covered cardboard \n     bodies would release poisonous dioxins. German scientists are \n     now trying to develop a bacterium to devour the cardboard-\n     and-plastic body.\n       Automobile manufacturing and government do not mix in \n     capitalist countries either. In the spring of 1978 Ceausescu \n     appointed me chief of his Presidential House, a new position \n     supposed to be similar to that of the White House chief of \n     staff. To go with it he gave me a big Jaguar car, That \n     Jaguar, which at the time had been produced in a government-\n     run British factory, was so bad that it spent more time in \n     the garage being repaired than it did on the road.\n       ``Apart from some Russian factories in Gorky, Jaguars were \n     the worst,'' Ford executive Bill Hayden stated when Ford \n     bought the nationalized British car maker in 1988. How did \n     the famous Jaguar, one of the most prestigious cars in the \n     world, become a joke?\n       In 1945, the British voters, tired of four years of war, \n     kicked out Winston Churchill and elected a leftist parliament \n     led by Labour's Clement Attlee. Attlee nationalized the \n     automobile, trucking and coal industries, as well as \n     communication facilities, civil aviation, electricity and \n     steel. Britain was already saddled by crushing war debts. Now \n     it was sapped of economic vigor. The old empire quickly \n     passed into history. It would take decades until Margaret \n     Thatcher's privatization reforms restored Britain's place \n     among the world's top-tier economies.\n       The United States is far more powerful than Great Britain \n     was then, and no American Attlee should be capable of \n     destroying its solid economic and political base. I hope\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\n     that the U.S. administration, Congress and the American \n     voters will take a closer look at history and prevent our \n     automotive industry from following down the Dacia, Oltcit or \n     Jaguar path.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7161-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7161-S7162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Tennessee for his insightful comments. Indeed, it is a \ntangled web we create when we first start to regulate. It is a tangled \nweb, too, when we start owning automobile companies which we know \nnothing about. Madam President, we are looking forward to next week and \nworking as hard as we can to ensure that we have a very fine \nconfirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee for the judge nominated \nto be a Justice of the Supreme Court by President Obama, Judge \nSotomayor. I will share a few thoughts about that and some matters that \nI think are important for my colleagues to think about as they study \nthis issue and work to do the right thing about it.\n  The President's nominee is, of course, his nominee, and it is our \nresponsibility--and the only opportunity the American people have to \nknow anything about this process is the hearing in which the nominee \nhas to answer questions and respond. Senators will make comments and \nask questions.\n  When we elevate one of our citizens to a Federal judgeship, we give \nthem an awesome responsibility, and particularly so when elevated to \nthe Supreme Court. They are the final word on our Constitution, how the \nConstitution and our laws are to be interpreted. Some judges, I have to \nsay, have not been faithful in their responsibilities. They have \nallowed personal views and values to impact them, in my view. We ask \nthem as judges to take on a different role than they have in private \npractice. We ask them to shed their personal beliefs, their personal \nbias and, yes, their personal experiences. We ask them to take an oath \nto impartial justice.\n  Our wonderful judicial system--the greatest the world has ever seen--\nrests upon this first principle. It is an adversarial system that is \ndesigned to produce, through cross-examination and other rules and \nprocedures, truth--objective truth. The American legal system is \nfounded on a belief in objective truth and its ascertainability. This \nis a key to justice.\n  But in this postmodern world, our law schools and some intellectuals \ntend to be of a view that words don't really have meaning; words are \njust matters some politically powerful group got passed one day, and \nthey don't have concrete meanings and you don't have to try to \nascertain what they meant. And, indeed, a good theory of law is to \nallow the judge to update it, change it, or adopt how they would like \nit to be.\n  I suggest this is not a healthy trend in America. It impacts this \nNation across the board in so many ways. But I think it is particularly \npernicious, when it comes to the law, if that kind of relativistic \nmentality takes over.\n  This notion of blind justice, objectivity, and impartiality has been \nin our legal system from the beginning, and it should not be eroded. \nEvery judge takes this oath. I think it sums up so well the ideals of \nthe fabulous system we have. A judge takes this oath:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without \n     respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the \n     rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge \n     and perform all the duties incumbent upon me under the \n     Constitution and laws of the United States, so help me God.\n\n  Well, I guess the Court hasn't gotten around to striking their oath \nyet--at least that part that says ``so help me God.'' Those phrases \nhave certainly been attacked around the country by Federal judges, in \nmany instances. This oath--I have to say this--stands in contrast to \nthe President's standard for judicial nominees.\n  I am concerned, based on her speeches and statements, that it may \nalso be the judicial philosophy of Judge Sotomayor.\n  In 2005, then-Senator Obama explained that 5 percent of cases, he \nbelieves, are determined by ``one's deepest values and core concerns . \n. . and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.'' He means a judge's \npersonal core concerns, values, and empathy.\n  Well, according to the President, in 5 percent of the cases where \nissues are close, that is acceptable. I think we must draw from his \nstatement that it is acceptable for judges to not set aside their \npersonal beliefs, not discard personal bias, not dispense with their \npersonal experiences as they make rulings, as they decide cases, which \nis what judges do.\n  According to the President, in 5 percent of cases, Lady Justice \nshould remove her blindfold, take a look at the litigants, and then \nreach out and place her thumb on the scales of justice on one side or \nthe other. I think this is a dangerous departure from the most \nfundamental pillar of our judicial system--judicial impartiality. That \nis why judges are given lifetime appointments. They are supposed to be \nunbiased and impartial.\n  Whatever this new empathy standard is, it is not law. It is more akin \nto politics than law. Whenever a judge puts his or her thumb on the \nscale of justice in favor of one party or another, the judge \nnecessarily disfavors the other party. For every litigant who benefits \nfrom this so-called empathy, there will be another litigant who loses \nnot because of the law or the facts, but because the judge did not \nempathize or identify with them.\n  What is empathy? Is this your personal feeling that you had a tough \nchildhood or some prejudice that you have--you are a Protestant or a \nCatholic or your ethnicity or your race or some bias you brought with \nyou to life and to the court? Is that what empathy is? Well, it has no \nobjective meaning, and that is why it is not a legal standard. The oath \nof ``impartiality'' to ``equal justice to the rich and the poor alike'' \nis violated when such things infect the decisionmaking process.\n  With this as his stated standard, the President nominated Judge Sonia \nSotomayor for the Supreme Court of the United States. Thus far our \nreview of her record suggests that she may well embrace the President's \nnotion of empathy, and I will share a few thoughts on that.\n  On a number of occasions over the years, Judge Sotomayor delivered a \nspeech entitled ``Women in the Judiciary.'' In it she emphasizes that \nshe accepts the proposition that a judge's personal experiences affect \njudicial outcomes:\n\n       In short, I accept the proposition that a difference will \n     be made by the presence of women on the bench and that my \n     experiences will affect the facts that I choose to see as a \n     judge.\n\n  In fact, in one speech, she rejected another woman judge's view that \na woman and a man should reach the same decision in a case. She \nexplicitly rejected that concept. She reaffirms:\n\n       I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be \n     in my judging, but I accept there will be some [differences] \n     based on my gender and the experiences it has imposed on me.\n\n  I think this would tend to be a rejection of even the aspiration, the \nideal, of impartiality that is fundamental to our legal system and our \nfreedoms.\n  In a later speech, Judge Sotomayor takes a giant step, expressing a \ndesire to draw upon her experiences in her judging. She states:\n\n       Personal experiences affect the facts judges choose to see. \n     My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and \n     extrapolate them further into areas with which I am \n     unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference \n     will be in my judging. But I accept that there will be some \n     based on my gender and my Latina heritage.\n\n  Well, are the days now gone when judges should see their taking \noffice as a commitment to set aside their personal experiences, biases, \nand views when they put on the robe? Gone are the days when judges even \naspire to be impartial.\n  In that same speech, which has been given a number of times, Judge \nSotomayor goes a step further, saying:\n\n       I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the \n     differences resulting from experience and heritage, but \n     attempt continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies \n     and prejudices are appropriate.\n\n  She says a judge should attempt continuously to judge when those \nopinions, sympathies, and prejudices are appropriate. That means that a \njudge's prejudices are appropriate to use in the decisionmaking \nprocess.\n  I find this to be an extraordinary judicial philosophy. Some might \nsay you\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\nare making too much of it, that empathy sounds fine to me; I don't have \nany problem with that. Empathy is great, perhaps, if you are the \nbeneficiary of it. The judge is empathetic with you, your side of the \nargument, but it is not good if you are on the wrong side of the \nargument, if you don't catch a judge's fancy or fail to appeal to a \nshared personal experience.\n  This approach to judging, as expressed in her speeches and writings, \nappears to have played an important part in the New Haven firefighters' \ncase Senator McConnell mentioned earlier. These are the 17 firefighters \nwho followed all the rules, studied for the test. It was publicly set \nout how the promotions would take place in that department. A number of \npeople passed, but a number of people did not, and there were a number \nof minorities who did not pass. They wanted to change the test after it \nhad been carried out, to change the rules of the game after it had been \ncarried out because they did not like the results. This is a results-\noriented question.\n  Bowing to political pressure, the city government looked only at the \ntest results and the statistical data and changed the rules of the \ngame. They threw out the test. This was challenged by the persons who \npassed. The district judge then agreed with the city in a 48-or-so-page \nopinion. It was appealed to Judge Sotomayor's court. In one paragraph \nonly, she agreed with that decision, even though it raised fundamental, \nimportant constitutional questions, important questions.\n  She concluded that the complaining firefighters were not even \nentitled to a trial, that the pretrial motions were sufficient to deny \nthem the remedy they sought and to affirm the city's opinion in one \nparagraph.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed. They wrote almost 100 pages in \ntheir opinion, and all nine Justices voted to reverse the opinion. It \nwas not 5 to 4. Five of the Justices, the majority, ruled that based on \nthe facts in evidence that had been presented prior to trial, the \nfirefighters were entitled to total victory and be able to win their \nlawsuit. This is a pretty significant reversal, I have to say.\n  The question is: Did she allow her prior experiences and beliefs to \nimpact her decision in that case? I point out that she was an active \nmember of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, where she spent a number \nof years working on cases such as this and filing litigation and \nchallenging promotion policies in cities around the country, which is a \nlegitimate thing for a group to do. But they did take a very aggressive \nstandard criticizing tests and the standardized process of testing.\n  Of course, her stated philosophy is that a judge should use life \nexperiences in reaching decisions. We do know she believes a judge is \nempowered to utilize his or her personal ``opinions, sympathies, and \nprejudices'' in deciding cases. We do know her particular life \nexperiences with the Legal Defense Fund were contrary to the claims \nbrought by the New Haven firefighters. We know she was a leader and \nboard member and chair of that organization's litigation committee. \nAccording to the New York Times, she ``met frequently with the legal \nstaff of the organization to review the status of cases.'' According to \nthe New York Times, ``she was involved and was an ardent supporter of \ntheir various legal efforts.'' She oversaw, as a board member and \nlitigation chair, several cases involving the New York City Department \nof Sanitation, which challenged a promotion policy because Hispanics \ncomprised 5.2 percent of the test takers but only 3.8 percent had \npassed the test. They declared that was an unfair result and challenged \nthe test. Another involved the New York City Police Department on \nbehalf of the Hispanic Police Society. Another one involved police \nofficers in a discrimination case challenging the New York Police \nDepartment's lieutenants exam, claiming that exam was biased.\n  Under her leadership, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, before she \nbecame a judge, involved itself in a series of cases designed to attack \npromotion exams because the group concluded that after the fact, after \nthe test, not enough minorities were being promoted. It sounds a lot \nlike this firefighters case we talked a good bit about so far.\n  We are left to wonder what role did the judge's personal experiences \nplay when she heard the case. Did her personal views, as she has \nstated, ``affect the facts she chose to see?''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, those are important questions, and we \nwill ask about them and give her full and ample opportunity to respond. \nI did wish to raise these issues.\n  The firefighters were denied promotion, and under her stated \nphilosophy, her prior background, they are left to wonder: Was perhaps \nthe reason they lost in her court because she brought her background \nand her prejudices to bear on the case and did not give them a fair \nchance? Very few cases are taken by the Supreme Court, but the Supreme \nCourt did take this one, to the benefit of the firefighters, and \nreversed this decision. All nine Justices concluded the decision was \nimproperly done and should be reversed, and five of them rendered a \nverdict in favor of the firefighters on the record as existed then.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The time suggested for the Senator from Nebraska is how \nmuch?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I anticipate 10 minutes, and I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My only hesitation is the fact that we are having a \nSenator sworn in at 12:15 p.m., and there is going to be a speech given \nbefore that by his colleague. We also wanted to have opening statements \non the bill. If I may ask the Senators--I will not object--but if I may \nask them to be closer to the 5-minute mark, I think we can achieve all \nthat in a timely fashion. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nNebraska be recognized for 5 minutes----\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In morning business and that the Senator from North \nCarolina be given up to 10 minutes. I know he said he would not use up \nto 10 minutes, and we will be protected with whatever time is used by \nthese two Republican Senators being allocated to the Democratic side \nfor morning business, which we will not likely use. I make that \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7162-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7162-S7163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I spent several days during the recess \nhosting a series of discussions on health care. I met with doctors and \nhospitals, underwriters, small business owners, and uninsured \nNebraskans. Many of them feel as if they are one illness away from a \ncrisis. The economic slowdown has only heightened this fear as they \nworry that they may lose their job and the health insurance their \nfamily depends upon to stay healthy.\n  Their concerns are real, and Congress should act carefully to address \nthem. We need to create a health care system that protects patient \nrights, let's them see their doctor, and is affordable.\n  But I am concerned about the discussion that is occurring today. The \nAmerican people deserve true solutions and should not be led down a \npath that is fraught with shadowy numbers and unfulfilled promises. \nSpecifically, I have reservations about a government-run public plan. \nSome have attempted to sugar-coat this new bureaucracy as simply an \noption. However, the more you learn about it, the more you realize \nthere is nothing optional about it.\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\nIn my judgment, it is a one-way ticket to a single-payer, government-\nrun health care system, one that will compromise patient access to \nquality care.\n  It is impossible for private industry to compete with the government. \nThe government can fix the prices and pick the rules that make only one \nplan feasible--the government plan. When the government acts as both \nthe player and the umpire, it's not a level playing field. That close \ncall at the plate will never go to the runner and the foul ball \nmagically will become a home run.\n  Some will say the government-run option will increase competition and \nkeep the private insurers honest. Left unsaid is that government \nunderpayments on Medicaid and Medicare are creating enormous cost \nshifting and increase the health care costs for others. Underpayments \nfor Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to shift about $89 billion onto \npeople who have private insurance. Each family pays an additional \n$1,800 annually to make up for the government's flawed payment system. \nHospitals and doctors literally told me they could not keep their \nbusinesses open on the Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rate. So the \ncreation of another plan, a government plan, will only rob from Peter \nto pay Paul. Eventually, there will be no private insurance companies \nleft to bear the burden.\n  Bottom line is that government does not balance the books, and it \nviews itself as not having to. Washington seems happy to keep on \nprinting money and raising taxes. How can private business compete with \nthat?\n  If a government-run public plan was truly going to compete, it would \nface the same regulations and the same risks that the private industry \nfeels. No bailouts if it becomes insolvent. Does anyone think the \nbill's proponents would honestly let that happen? The Administration \nwould probably claim it is too big to fail, like AIG, Citibank, General \nMotors.\n  A system with a competitive government option, I fear, is a fairy \ntale. A government-run plan will undercut the private market and \nultimately drive them out of business. I am not defending the private \ninsurance industry. Far from it. But we need to be honest with the \nAmerican people. An uneven playing field is not right, and it will not \nbenefit Americans.\n  The effect, I fear, will be longer waiting lines, less innovation, \nand rationing of care. In Canada, the average wait time for radiation \ntreatment is 7 weeks. I cannot imagine asking Americans diagnosed with \ncancer to wait that long. There are some in Washington who have their \nheels dug in on a single-payer plan. It contradicts the President's \npromise. He has said over and over that people will be able to keep \ntheir health care. But Americans beware. One study estimates 119 \nmillion people will shift to the government plan. They will not choose \nthat; their employer will choose it for them. We cannot fault employers \nthat are trying to save money.\n  In the committee draft, businesses that employ 25 or more employees \nwould be required to pay an annual penalty of $750 per employee. When \nyou do the math, this is no penalty compared to the cost of private \ninsurance.\n  In 2008, the average employer's cost for an individual health care \nplan was $3,900. Putting their employees on the public plan option \nwould save them over $3,200 a year for each employee. So you can see \nwhy this shift would occur.\n  Ultimately, people will not have a choice. Their employer will make \nthe choice, and they will be forced onto the government plan. To \npromise otherwise is misleading. Even the President has recognized that \nshift is going to occur.\n  I conclude my comments today by saying: Don't be fooled. A government \nplan that does not compete on a level playing field means people will \nmigrate to the government plan, and the choice to keep private \ninsurance will not be a viable option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one of the privileges of being a Senator \nis that we have the opportunity to meet extraordinary people every day. \nWhether you are the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from Nebraska, \nextraordinary people walk through your door every day of the week. But \nsometimes we get to meet amazing individuals whom we can honestly call \nheroes, who lay their lives on the line for their country and sacrifice \nthemselves for our freedom.\n  MSG Brendan O'Connor, a medic in the 7th Special Forces Group, is one \nof those very special people. In June of 2006, Master Sergeant O'Connor \nwas deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. \nHis group was stationed near Kandahar and charged with a variety of \nthings, including security, training of the Afghan Army, and \ncounterterrorism operations against a ruthless enemy.\n  We have all heard news reports and heard of suicide bombers driving \ncars loaded with explosives into markets and crowded areas killing \ninnocent men, women, and children. We have all heard accounts of \nsuicide bombers strapping explosives to their waists and walking \nthrough a market, intentionally killing individuals. All of these \nindividuals have been branded as religious zealots willing to die for \ntheir cause. However, that is not always the case. Oftentimes, these \nTaliban warlords recruit suicide bombers in other ways. They go into \nsmall villages and they hold whole families hostage. They instruct the \nyoung men in the family that if they do not carry out a suicide \nmission, they are going to kill the rest of the family, or if they do, \nthey will let them live.\n  Brendan's team was tracking one of these Taliban warlords, one of \nthese thugs, outside of Kandahar, who was notorious for this type of \n``recruitment.'' They tracked the terrorist to a small farming village \nsurrounded by vineyards and orchards. Once in the area, Brendan's team \nset up a perimeter and defensive position to root out these warlords. \nThey arrived late one evening and, working under the cloak of darkness, \nproceeded to sweep the village, hoping to surprise the local Taliban \nleader. However, their arrival was tipped off to the Taliban, and they \nhad fled just minutes before U.S. soldiers arrived.\n  Having found evidence of the Taliban's existence, the soldiers knew \nit was only a matter of time before they engaged the enemy. That first \nskirmish started the next day at dusk. Brendan's team, about 70 \nsoldiers comprised of 8 U.S. special ops and 60 Afghan soldiers, took \nsome small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire, but it didn't last \nlong. The Taliban attacked the U.S.-led forces several more times over \nthe next day and night but never amounting to much. U.S.-led forces \ndidn't even sustain a single injury during those firefights.\n  After having arrived on Wednesday evening and sporadically fighting \nthe Taliban for 2 days, Brendan's team decided it was time to take the \nfight to the enemy. On that Saturday, MSG Tom Maholluck led a small \nrecon group to a Taliban stronghold, which was just outside the village \nin a cluster of farm buildings. The team was comprised of four special \nforces operators and a dozen Afghan Army. Sergeant Maholluck was able \nto get in close enough to the compound without being detected. Once he \nassessed the situation, Sergeant Maholluck thought he could take the \ncompound with a simple recon team. He ordered two of his soldiers--SSG \nMatt Binnie and SSG Joe Feurst--to take a fire suppression position and \ncover Sergeant Maholluck and the remaining Afghan Army contingency \nwhile they stormed the compound.\n  When the U.S.-led recon team launched its first attack on the Taliban \ncompound, they were quickly greeted with heavy machine gunfire. The \nfirst fire expression team returned fire; however, the machine gun nest \nhad a tactical advantage over the fire team--they had the higher \nground. Matt was struck first by a bullet that grazed his neck and \nstunned him for a moment. Matt regained his senses, and he and Joe \nreturned fire, as much as they could, but the Taliban had them pinned \ndown. Then an RPG round came and struck Staff Sergeant Feurst directly \nin the leg. It didn't explode, thankfully, but badly wounded SSG Joe \nFeurst. As Staff Sergeant Binnie was tending to Joe's leg, he was shot \nthrough the shoulder. The only thing left of the fire suppression team \nwas a young Afghan interpreter who had stayed with them. Master \nSergeant\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\nMaholluck was cut off from Staff Sergeant Binnie and Staff Sergeant \nFeurst, so he radioed for help.\n  Back at the main perimeter, Brendan O'Connor got the call and put a \nteam together to go get his wounded soldiers. When Brendan's team got \nto the area, the Taliban had taken positions along the route to the \nwounded soldiers, leaving Brendan only one path--an exposed field. \nBrendan instructed his team to take up positions to support the wounded \nand started on his mission to save the lives of these soldiers.\n  At first, Brendan started crawling through an open field with his \ngear on. He quickly realized this wasn't going to work. So under a hail \nof small arms, RPG, and machine gun fire, Brendan removed all his armor \nand crawled through an open field to get to the two wounded. Brendan \ncouldn't locate the two soldiers by sight, only by calling out. And as \nhe heard them, he would get closer and closer.\n  When he arrived at the two wounded, he had to make a quick decision \nabout Joe's injuries, which were life threatening. Brendan quickly got \nStaff Sergeant Binnie taken care of and instructed him to crawl through \na culvert to get to safety. Staff Sergeant Feurst wasn't so easy. He \nwas unconscious and unable to move. Brendan pulled him down as far as \nhe could into the culvert. He started to drag him, but he realized he \ncouldn't drag him the entire way.\n  As if the actions of Brendan and his team weren't heroic enough at \nthis point, the next part of this account will send chills down your \nspine.\n  At this time during the fight, it was estimated that nearly 300 \nTaliban fighters had engaged the approximately 15-member U.S. force. I \nsay approximately because several Afghan Army members who originally \naccompanied Brendan's team had fled by this point. As Brendan's natural \ncover was coming to an end, he pulled Joe on to his shoulder, and he \nran across an area while 300 Taliban fighters were shooting at him. God \nwas watching Brendan that day. God saw one man risk his life to save \nanother, and he saw fit to keep Brendan from harm as he carried a \nwounded U.S. soldier to safety. Unfortunately, Joe Feurst died soon \nafter Brendan got him back due to massive blood loss. SSG Matt Binnie \nsurvived because of Brendan's leadership and courage under fire.\n  The battle that had gone on for nearly 3 days was coming to an end at \nthis point. U.S. forces had air support, which escorted them out of the \narea. All told, the U.S.-led force killed 125 Taliban fighters and only \nlost 2 of their own, with 1 wounded. They weren't able to capture or \nkill the warlord that time; however, due to the losses to the Taliban \nthat day in that strike, U.S. forces got him several weeks later.\n  For their heroics in combat, MSG Tom Maholluck and SSG Matt Binnie \nwere awarded the Silver Star. SSG Joe Feurst was awarded the Bronze \nStar. Brendan O'Connor was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for \nhis valor. It was the first time a member of the 7th Special Forces \nGroup had been awarded the medal since 1964.\n  It is an honor to have Brendan and his family in Washington today. He \nis joined by his beautiful wife Meg and their children, Ryan, Colin, \nDarby, and Dillon.\n  It is this type of story that we rarely hear about on the nightly \nnews, but this story was so amazing that ``60 Minutes'' felt compelled \nto do a piece on it after the soldiers arrived back home. MSG Brendan \nO'Connor is a person held in the highest regard by other warriors who \nhave proudly served this country. He is a soldier who truly understands \nthe price of freedom. The Senate salutes MSG Brendan O'Connor today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7164-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2892, which the clerk will state \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2892) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I call up the amendment at the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Byrd and Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] for Mr. Byrd and Mr. \n     Inouye, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 1373.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we now turn to the fiscal year 2010 \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. The chairman of \nthe Homeland Security Subcommittee, Senator Robert C. Byrd, is home \nfrom the hospital and is improving daily and is eager to return to the \nSenate as soon as he can.\n  He has been in regular consultations with his staff in the \ndevelopment of the bill that was approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee on June 18 by a vote of 30-0. This is a bipartisan bill. I \nthank the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Thad \nCochran, and the ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator George \nVoinovich, for their cooperation in the development of the bill. I also \nthank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Daniel K. \nInouye, for his support.\n  The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security after the \ndevastating events of September 11, 2001, was one of the most ambitious \nFederal reorganizations since the Department of Defense was created \nfollowing World War II. Regrettably, it was the official position of \nthe Bush administration that the Department could be created at no cost \nto the taxpayer. This translated into a Department with aging assets, \nan inability to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and future \nthreats, and significant management and employee morale problems.\n  In response, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, increased homeland \nsecurity spending by an average of $2 billion per year above the \nPresident's request. These increases were invested in border security, \nchemical security, port security, transit security, aviation security, \nand cyber security. Congress also ensured State and local partners in \nhomeland security received adequate resources to equip and train our \nfirst responders. These investments have paid off, making our Nation \nmore secure and making us better prepared for any disaster. But we have \nmuch more work to do.\n  The committee-reported bill totals $42.9 billion of discretionary \nbudget authority, an increase of 7 percent over fiscal year 2009.\n  Chairman Byrd has set five major goals for the bill: No. 1, securing \nour borders and enforcing our immigration laws; No. 2, protecting the \nAmerican people from terrorist threats and other vulnerabilities; No. \n3, preparing and responding to all hazards, including natural \ndisasters; No. 4, supporting our State, local, tribal and private \nsector partners in homeland security with resources and information; \nand finally, giving the Department the management tools it needs to \nsucceed.\n  To meet these goals, the bill provides $10.2 billion for Customs and \nBorder Protection, including an initiative to combat drugs and violence \non the Southwest border; $5.4 billion for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, including increased funds for the Southwest border \ninitiative, and the Secure Communities and Criminal Alien Programs, \nwhich identify dangerous criminal aliens for deportation when they are \nreleased from prison.\n  It includes $7.7 billion for the Transportation Security \nAdministration, including a $513 million increase for the\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\npurchase and installation of explosives detection systems at airports. \nAnd funding is included for 50 additional air cargo inspectors to help \nmeet the August 2010 mandate in the 9/11 act for 100 percent air cargo \nscreening.\n  The bill also provides $143 million for surface transportation, \nincluding 100 additional inspectors and 15 additional security teams to \nimprove security on our transit and rail systems, and $8.9 billion for \nthe Coast Guard, including funding to complete national security cutter \nNo. four and provide long lead materials for NSC No. five.\n  The bill also funds 4 fast response cutters, 2 maritime patrol \naircraft, 40 medium-sized response boats, and includes funding for \ninteragency operations centers, which are required by the Safe Port \nAct. And $4.2 billion is provided for first responder grants, including \n$800 million for fire grants, $887 million for urban area security \ngrants, $950 million for State homeland security grants, with $350 \nmillion for emergency management performance grants.\n  Port security grants receive $350 million and transit/railroad/bus \ngrants receive $356 million.\n  The bill also includes $399 million to combat the evolving cyber \nsecurity threat.\n  Since its inception, the Department has had significant management \nproblems.\n  The committee bill includes funding increases and clear direction to \nstrengthen financial, procurement, and information technology systems \nat the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This is a good bill. By focusing on the five goals that Chairman Byrd \nestablished for this bill, we provide the resources and the information \nnecessary to build confidence in our ability to secure the homeland. I \nurge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield the floor to the ranking Republican on this appropriations \nsubcommittee, Senator Voinovich of Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam. President, I thank Senator Durbin. I would like \nto acknowledge the cooperation we received from Senator Byrd and his \nstaff. We are pleased Senator Byrd is out of the hospital and \nrecuperating at home. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from \nIllinois has stepped in to pinch-hit for him this morning.\n  I think the Senator from Illinois has done an outstanding job of \ncovering the details of the bill. I would like to concentrate on some \nof the highlights I think need to be underscored.\n  The bill recommends a total of $44.3 billion in appropriations to \nsupport programs and activities of the Department of Homeland Security. \nOf this amount, $42.7 billion is for discretionary spending. This is \nroughly $145 million less than the President's total discretionary \nrequest and is consistent with the subcommittee's spending allocation.\n  In addition, $1.4 billion is provided for Coast Guard retired pay--\nthe only mandatory funding in the bill--and $241.5 million is provided \nfor Coast Guard overseas contingency operations, the same amount as \nrequested by the President in the Department of Defense budget to be \ntransferred to the Coast Guard and instead of being appropriated in the \nDefense Appropriations bill is being appropriated here.\n  The bill includes significant resources: for border security and \nenforcement of our immigration laws, for continued improvements in \nsecurity at our Nation's airports and modes of surface transportation, \nfor the Coast Guard's operations and Deepwater Program recapitalization \nefforts, for helping our citizens prepare for and recover from natural \ndisasters, and for equipping and training our Nation's first \nresponders.\n  As Senator Durbin has indicated, there is much in this bill to \nrecommend. I am pleased the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity understands we have done our best to fund her priorities. I \nwill not list all the bill's funding recommendations, but I do want to \nnote some.\n  Full funding is provided for border security, including the funds to \nsupport 20,063 border patrol agents; 21,12 customs and border \nprotection officers; 33,400 detention beds; and $800 million for \ncontinued work on the virtual border fence and improved radio \ncommunications.\n  Starting in fiscal year 2005, significant increases have been \nprovided for border security and immigration enforcement. This bill \nalone provides an increase of $880 million from the fiscal year 2009 \nlevel, excluding emergency appropriations. Progress has been made with \nthese investments.\n  Fewer people are illegally crossing our borders. This can be seen in \nthe decrease in apprehensions of aliens along our borders--from \n1,198,075 in fiscal year 2005 to 723,825 in fiscal year 2008. In other \nwords, we have made it more difficult for 474,250 illegal aliens to \ncross our borders. More fencing, roads, and personnel have allowed the \nborder patrol to increase the number of miles over which it has \neffective control--from 241 miles in October 2005 to 625 miles in \nOctober 2008. Additional agents and detention beds have allowed U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement to increase total removals of \naliens--from 246,431 removals in fiscal year 2005 to 347,184 in fiscal \nyear 2008. We are making progress but we still have a long way to go \nand at great expense.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the bill includes funds above the \nrequest to implement a biometric air exit capability. As the chief \nSenate sponsor of the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership \nAct of 2007, expanding and improving the Visa Waiver Program is one of \nmy top priorities. The Visa Waiver Program has become an important \nnational security tool because under that law, countries who \nparticipate in the program are required to share information on \nterrorists and criminals, report lost and stolen passports, and \nmaintain high counterterrorism and document security practices. Since \nenactment of this law, 8 new countries have been accepted into the \nprogram and we are seeing improvements in the security practices of the \n27 countries that were already participating.\n  I have just returned from Lithuania and Latvia, where I was joined by \nseveral other Members of the Senate, including Senator Durbin. \nLithuania and Latvia are two countries that were recently admitted into \nthe visa waiver program. From a public diplomacy point of view, it has \nbeen a home run and has been well received by government officials and \ncitizens alike.\n  I was up in Latvia. They pointed out to me that General Mullen was in \nLatvia, which should have been the biggest thing in the newspaper the \nnext day, that he was there. The thing that blew him away was the fact \nthat Latvia was approved for visa waiver status. It was so well \nreceived by the people of Latvia.\n  I must note however the two areas which continue to be of concern to \nme. One is the way this administration has budgeted for disasters. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2010 request for disaster relief is only $2 \nbillion. We know now from FEMA estimates that this is not enough to pay \nfor the declared disasters already on the books. Based on current \nneeds, an appropriation of $5.8 billion is required. I understand we \ncannot afford that within the discretionary spending limits for this \nbill, but I am hopeful this is addressed in future budgets.\n  This administration has worked hard to break the cycle of requesting \nemergency funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet no one has \nsuggested fixing the way we budget for natural disasters. Last year \nalone, $11.757 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations were \nprovided for disaster relief.\n  We cannot continue to ``kick the can down the road,'' relying on \nsupplemental emergency appropriations to pay for known costs. Hurricane \nKatrina was a catastrophic event. Exceptions were made to regulations \nand policies to speed assistance to those struggling to recover from \nthe enormity of the losses. But now these are becoming the standard \nrather than an ``exception to the rule,'' and the Federal taxpayers are \npicking up an ever increasing share of disaster recovery costs.\n  It is kind of interesting that at the time of Katrina I commented we \nwere doing some things we ordinarily do not do in a FEMA environment \nand predicted that what we were doing at Katrina would become the role \nmodel for other disasters that have been experienced by States. The \nfact is, more and more States are now asking for\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\nmore and more FEMA money, saying: You did it in Katrina, why can't you \ndo it in Texas? Why can't you do it wherever else we have a disaster? \nThis has to change if we are going to handle Federal spending and do \nsomething about the deficit.\n  In addition, this bill provides almost $16 billion for border and \nimmigration enforcement. That does not even include Coast Guard funding \nto protect our maritime borders. This is a 99.6-percent increase for \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, and US-VISIT from fiscal year 2004 levels in the first \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.\n  It is a significant increase. I think the citizens of our country \nshould know that. They have been saying, for a long time, that we have \nnot been doing the job in enforcing the security of our borders. I must \ntell them we are doing a much better job than ever before because we \nare allocating the resources to get the job done.\n  As we have increased the resources for border I have often wondered \nif there was another way we can secure our borders and deal with 11 or \nso million illegal immigrants other than by drastically increasing the \nresources for border and immigration enforcement. In fiscal year 2008, \nthe Federal Government removed 347,184 individuals. In fiscal year \n2009, $5.6 billion is available to locate, detain, and remove \nunauthorized aliens. At the current pace of removals, it could require \na further investment of $272 billion and 31 years to locate and remove \nthe estimated 11 million unauthorized aliens in the United States. We \nmust ask whether we are willing or can afford to make that kind of \ninvestment in enforcement rather than investing time in comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I appreciate very much the courtesies of the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and his staff and all members of the Appropriations \nCommittee during our preparation of this bill. I believe it reflects \nour careful consideration of the President's budget request for the \nDepartment and our best effort to address the Department's resource \nrequirements of the Department for the coming fiscal year. I look \nforward to considering amendments which Senators may suggest to the \nbill and to work throughout the appropriations process to ensure the \nDepartment has the funds to carry out its duties and responsibilities.\n  In closing, I would point out that the President's budget was \nreceived on May 7 and the Appropriations Committee is working \ndiligently to move forward on the passage of our 12 appropriations \nbills. Two of the 12 fiscal year 2010 appropriations bills were \nreported by the committee on June 18--including this Homeland Security \nbill--and 2 more were reported on June 25. Another five of the \nappropriations bills are scheduled to be considered and reported by the \ncommittee this week--two this afternoon and another three on Thursday.\n  The House considered and adopted its version of the fiscal year 2010 \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations bill on June 24. It is \nunfortunate that Senate consideration of this bill could not have \noccurred that same week, which would have put us in a position now to \ngo to conference with the House.\n  Expeditious consideration of the fiscal year 2010 appropriations \nbills by the Senate is required if the Congress is to complete its work \non all twelve of the appropriations bills by the October 1 start of the \nfiscal year. I have long been concerned about our failure to complete \nour appropriations work on time and the consequences of inaction, and I \nintend to speak at greater length on that during our consideration of \nthis bill.\n  But, I do want to note here that a letter, dated March 24, 2009, to \nthe majority leader, which included the signatures of all Republican \nMembers, asked that the legislative schedule for this session:\n\n       . . . allocate an appropriate amount of time for the Senate \n     to consider, vote and initiate the conference process on each \n     of the 12 appropriations bills independently through a \n     deliberative and transparent process on the Senate floor.\n\n  The letter goes on to point out that:\n\n       For a variety of reasons, over the past several years, the \n     Senate has failed to debate, amend and pass each of the bills \n     separately prior to the end of the fiscal year. Far too often \n     this has resulted in the creation of omnibus appropriations \n     bills that have been brought to floor so late in the fiscal \n     year that Senators have been forced to either pass a \n     continuing resolution, shut down government or consider an \n     omnibus bill. These omnibus bills have not allowed for \n     adequate public review and have clouded what should otherwise \n     be a transparent process.\n\n  The letter further points out that President Obama, on March 11, \n2009, said that he expects future spending bills to be\n\n       . . . debated and voted on in an orderly way and sent to \n     [his] desk without delay or obstruction so that we don't face \n     another massive, last minute omnibus bill like this one.\n\n  So let us proceed with this bill and debate and dispose of amendments \nSenators may wish to offer to it without unnecessary delay to allow us \nto complete our appropriations work this session. And, I would like to \nadd that it is incumbent on our side of the aisle to make sure our \namendments are relevant and germane.\n  I recommend this bill to my colleagues for their consideration and \nsupport, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today the Senate begins its \nconsideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill which was \npassed by the House and marked up by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee late last month. This week the Committee on Appropriations \nwill meet, to consider five additional appropriations bills.\n  Over the next several weeks we expect to have many of these bills \ndebated and hopefully passed by the Senate so that we can begin final \nconference deliberations on these critically important measures.\n  The bill before the Senate was prepared by our Homeland Security \nSubcommittee chaired by Senator Robert Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd along with this ranking member Senator Voinovich of Ohio \nand all the subcommittee members crafted this bill which provides $42.7 \nbillion in discretionary spending for the critical programs to defend \nour Nation, protect our borders and coastline, and respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  The amount represents a 7 percent increase over the funding provided \nin fiscal year 2009, but is approximately $150 million less than \nrequested.\n  An additional $241 million is also included in the bill for the \noverseas contingency operations of the Coast Guard. This sum was \nrequested in the defense bill for the same purpose.\n  Our colleagues should thank Senators Byrd and Voinovich for \ncompleting their hard work on this bill. The bill was marked up by the \ncommittee 3 weeks ago and approved on a unanimous bipartisan vote.\n  As the Senate reviews this and the other spending bills which will \nsoon follow I urge it to be mindful of the importance of this task.\n  It is imperative to the efficient operation of our Federal Government \nthat we move to pass this measure and complete a conference with the \nHouse. For too long we have relied on cumbersome omnibus spending \nmeasures to fund our Federal agencies.\n  In order to break this habit, the Appropriations Committee will \ncontinue to report noncontroversial bipartisan bills which will be \nwithin the congressionally approved budget levels and should be \nconsidered expeditiously by the Senate. Passage of this bill quickly \nwill demonstrate the Senate's ability to act responsibly and \ncollegially in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.\n  The bill before the Senate deserves the support of every Member of \nthis body. It is a clean bill free of unnecessary legislative riders. \nIt is within the committee's spending allocation and $150 million below \nthe amount requested. I strongly recommend its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1371 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. \n1371, and would ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1371 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To make the pilot program for employment eligibility \n   confirmation for aliens permanent and to improve verification of \n                    immigration status of employees)\n\n       On page 72, strike lines 8 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 545.

Section 401(b) of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n     and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (division C of \n     Public Law 104-208; 8 U.S.C. 1324a note) is amended by \n     striking ``Unless'' and all that follows.\n       Sec. 547.  The head of each agency or department of the \n     United States that enters into a contract shall require, as a \n     condition of the contract, that the contractor participate in \n     the pilot program described in 404 of the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (division C \n     of Public Law 104-209; 8 U.S.C. 1324a note) to verify the \n     employment eligibility of--\n       (1) all individuals hired during the term of the contract \n     by the contractor to perform employment duties within the \n     United States; and\n       (2) all individuals assigned by the contractor to perform \n     work within the United States the under such contract.\n       Sec. 548. (a)(1) Sections 401(c)(1), 403(a), 403(b)(1), \n     403(c)(1), and 405(b)(2) of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n     and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (division C of \n     Public Law 104-208; 8 U.S.C. 1324a note) are amended by \n     striking ``basic pilot program'' each place that term appears \n     and inserting ``E-Verify Program''.\n       (2) The heading of section 403(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     is amended by striking ``Basic Pilot'' and inserting ``E-\n     Verify''.\n       (b) Section 404(h)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 8 \n     U.S.C. 1324a note) is amended by striking ``under a pilot \n     program'' and inserting ``under this subtitle''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is an amendment to make permanent the E-Verify \nsystem that is supported by Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano \nand would require that all governmental contractors who do work for the \nFederal Government use it before they hire people to ensure that the \nindividuals they hire are Americans and not illegally in the country.\n  At a time when our unemployment rate is now 9.5 percent, this is more \nimportant now than ever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today, a new Senator from Minnesota \nis being sworn in. It is my honor, along with former Vice President \nMondale, to escort Al Franken as the new Senator from our State. I \nthink it was Al who told me the third year of his campaign would be the \nbest, and he was right.\n  I did want to thank my staff, first of all--some of them, many of \nthem, are here--for the hard work they did in the past 6 months doing \ndouble duty. They never complained, they did it without extra \nresources, and they are as happy as can be this has finally been \nresolved.\n  I also wanted to say something about Norm Coleman. Last week, he made \na difficult decision. He had the right to pursue a legal challenge, but \nhe did what was right for Minnesota. Norm was my Senate colleague for 2 \nyears. We often worked together on issues for Minnesota, and we all \nwish him and his family the best.\n  So despite a little delay, to be exact, 246 days since election day \nand 183 days since the Senate convened--why would I know that--Al \nFranken now joins me in representing the State of Minnesota. I have \ngotten to know Al very well over the past few years. I know he will be \ngetting acquainted with his fellow Senators in the coming weeks and the \ncoming months. This a special place with special people. I know Al \nlooks forward to working with every Member of the Senate.\n  I also know Al arrived in Washington ready to get to work and ready \nto serve the people of Minnesota. He brings with him that same high \nenergy and passion and idealism of our friend Paul Wellstone.\n  I was telling Al when I first came to the Capitol I was stunned at \nhow many people would come up to me, when I said I was a Senator from \nMinnesota, and say: That is where Paul Wellstone was from. It was not \njust other Senators, it was people such as the tram operators, the \nsecretaries at the front desk, the cops who work on the front line. \nThey remembered Paul because of his dignity and how he treated people. \nAnd Al, I know, will do the same.\n  Before seeking elected office, Al had a full career. Among other \nthings he was an Emmy Award-winning television writer and producer, a \nbest-selling author with three of his books going to the very top of \nthe New York Times Bestseller List. He was the host of a national radio \nshow and a Grammy Award-winning satirist, who, with the USO, has gone \noverseas several times--seven times in fact. He went four times to Iraq \nto entertain our troops and to visit our wounded solders.\n  We all know Al spent some time in comedy, but during this long \ncampaign, he has demonstrated to Minnesotans that he takes his job very \nseriously. I know he is taking his new job as a Senator incredibly \nseriously.\n  Al's heart is with middle-class families who work hard, live \nresponsibly, and follow the rules. He knows their hopes and fears, \ntheir dreams and their struggles. He knows it because he has lived it.\n  When Al was 4 his family moved to the town of Albert Lea in southern \nMinnesota. Al always tells the story about that move. His dad never \ngraduated from high school and never had a career. But his mom's father \nowned a quilting business out East, and he gave Al's dad a chance to \nstart up a factory in Albert Lea. After about 2 years the factory \nfailed, and Al's family moved to the Twin Cities. Years later, Al asked \nhis dad: Dad, why Albert Lea?\n  His dad said: Well, your grandfather wanted to open a factory in the \nMidwest, and the railroad went right through Albert Lea.\n  So then Al asked: Why did the factory fail?\n  His father said: Well, it went through Albert Lea, but it didn't stop \nin Albert Lea.\n  Eventually the family, including Al and his older brother, settled \ninto a two-bedroom, one-bathroom home in the Minneapolis suburb of St. \nLouis Park. His father became a printing salesman and his mom was a \nhomemaker and worked as a real estate agent. Because of the security \nand opportunity his family enjoyed living in America, he says he felt \nlike the ``luckiest kid in the world.''\n  While Al likes to tell jokes, and he has some good ones, he is not \none to make fun of family values because there is no husband or father \nwho is more devoted to his family than Al is.\n  He met his wife--I see her right now up there in the gallery--Franni \nduring his first year at college. They have been married 33 years, and \ntogether they have raised two children.\n  Al often tells the story about Franni's family. Her dad, a decorated \nWorld War II veteran, died in a car accident when she was 17 months \nold. Her dad left her mom suddenly widowed and alone with five \nchildren.\n  It was a lesson for the family, and it was an example of how one \nfamily pulled themselves up with help. He knows how difficult it is for \nso many families who are struggling to make it, squeezed over high \nhealth care costs, college costs, housing costs.\n  During the past 2 years, Al has traveled to every corner of \nMinnesota, from the Iowa border to the Canadian border. He has had \ncoffee at the Main Street cafes, and he has spoken at local bean feeds. \nHe has toured homegrown businesses, and he has stood with workers. He \nhas been to veterans halls, and he has gone to college campuses.\n  He has been there day in and day out listening to the people of \nMinnesota. Now he has the honor and the responsibility to serve them in \nthe U.S. Capitol. The Senate is an old and established institution. For \nany newcomer, it takes some getting used to the arcane rules and unique \ncustoms, but I am confident Al can adapt.\n  This is a big moment for Franni and their kids as well. Al and his \nfriends and relatives have been waiting for a while. The State has been \nwaiting. The Senate has been waiting. But, most importantly to me, \nFranni has been waiting.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n  My favorite image from the last few months was this idea that Franni \nhad actually packed a bag with her toothbrush in it; that she had it \nright next to her bedside in case at any moment the court would come \nwith a decision and she and Al would have to rush to Washington so he \ncould take a critical vote.\n  Well, today the time has come and Al will cast his first vote. If \nthere is any silver lining to the past 8 months, it is that Al has had \ntime to prepare for this moment. The times are tumultuous, the stakes \nare high, and history will forever judge whether we fail or succeed, \nwhether we are courageous or timid.\n  Al Franken is ready for this job. It is time to get to work, and, Al \nFranken, there is a desk waiting for you in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Sessions' \namendment to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. \nThe Sessions amendment would make E-Verify permanent and would \nimmediately mandate all Federal contractors and subcontractors to use \nE-Verify.\n  First of all, obviously, legislating on and delaying a critical \nappropriations bill, which is necessary for us to pass quickly to \nsecure our borders, ports of entry, and our interior points of \nvulnerability, is a delay we do not need. But, secondly, and more \nimportantly, despite claims that this amendment only seeks to \nreauthorize E-Verify for 3 years, which I do not oppose, the actual \nlanguage of the amendment of my distinguished colleague would make E-\nVerify permanent and mandatory.\n  There would be nothing wrong with that if the system actually worked, \nbut it does not. The distinguished Senator from Alabama and I agree \nupon one of the main seven principles for immigration reform which I \nissued 2 weeks ago; namely, that an employer verification system with \ntough enforcement and auditing is necessary to significantly diminish \nthe job magnet that attracts illegal aliens to the United States. The \nbottom line is that they mainly come for jobs, and until they are tough \non employers, wave after wave is not going to stop.\n\n  As we speak, even under the E-Verify system, any individual who \nsteals a Social Security number--and that is easy these days--and has \naccess to a credible fake ID can get a job in the United States. What \nis more, nothing about E-Verify stops a U.S. citizen from ``loaning \ntheir identity'' to their friends and family to get a job. In either of \nthese cases--an illegal immigrant stealing a Social Security number and \ngetting a fake ID done or some citizen, an employer or whatever, giving \na Social Security card to the person--it doesn't do the job because \nthat illegal immigrant can enter into the system. Once they are in the \nsystem, they stay in it, never to be removed. So E-Verify, frankly--and \nI know many in the immigrant community object to it because it only \naffects immigrants. But there is also another objection, and that is \nthat it is just not tough enough, it is not strong enough. If we are \ngoing to make a system permanent, it really ought to work.\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\n  The current E-Verify system creates havoc for both employers and \nemployees. No one has any certainty. Employers who accept all credible \ndocuments in good faith are not guaranteed they will never be targeted \nby ICE for turning a blind eye toward illegal immigrants in their \nworkplace, and employers who question suspicious documents face \npotential lawsuits from U.S. citizen employees who can claim they were \nwrongly profiled as illegal immigrants.\n  There is only one way to really get a system that will stop illegal \nimmigration and stop employers from hiring, and that is by creating a \nbiometric-based Federal employment verification system that will give \nboth employers and employees the peace of mind that employment \nrelationships are both lawful and proper. It will also give the \nAmerican people the same peace of mind. This system will be our most \nimportant asset in dramatically reducing the number of illegal aliens \nwho are able to live and work in the United States.\n  There are many proposals for practical and effective biometric-based \nemployment verification systems, and the immigration subcommittee, \nwhich I chair, will be vetting each proposal during our upcoming \nhearing on July 22. The distinguished Senator from Alabama, my friend, \nis a member of the immigration subcommittee. I invite him to engage in \nthis critical process for our country during the hearing and ask all of \nthe questions he would like to the distinguished panel of expert \nwitnesses who will be appearing. We are not seeking to delay. I am \neager to enact comprehensive reform with a strong, tough employer \nverification system.\n  An amendment making the flawed E-Verify system permanent and \nmandatory will only create more problems than it solves. Once we go \ndown the road of making this flawed system permanent and mandatory, \nwithout fixing what is wrong with the program, we will waste \nsubstantial amounts of taxpayer money and we will make life more \ndifficult, rather than simpler, for employers who wish to do the right \nthing, and for employees.\n  The time is coming for comprehensive immigration reform. The \nlegislation will create the best employment verification system \npossible that will be a product of deliberation and consensus and will \nbe informed by the world's foremost experts on this issue. It will be \ntougher, tighter, and more effective than E-Verify. I believe we can \nget that done this year.\n  Let's not do something hasty and counterproductive just to say we are \ndoing something, and, just as important, let's not do it as an \namendment to an appropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment, and let's get to work on crafting an employer \nverification system that really works, prevents identity fraud, and \nactually curtails the illegal immigration job magnet.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, last week, over \nthe Fourth of July break, I spent much of the week traveling in my \nState of South Dakota. Many of my colleagues were in their individual \nStates and probably heard a lot from their constituents about what they \nperceive to be the challenges facing our country's economy. First and \nforemost is jobs and the economy.\n  I think there is a real concern--and rightly so--about in which \ndirection the economy is headed and what are the things Congress ought \nto properly be focused on, and I think that discussion is always \ninformed by the American people by commonsense realizations. One \nrealization is that you cannot spend money you don't have. That is \nsomething I think the American people get very clearly, largely because \nthat is their reality. They cannot spend money they don't have. They \nhave to live within a budget. The same is true with many small \nbusinesses. The second realization is that when you borrow money, \nsomeday you have to pay it back. You cannot continue to borrow \nendlessly and rack up more and more debt. At some point, there is an \nend to that. Certainly, that is true for family budgets and small \nbusiness budgets. The only place it is evidently not true is in \nWashington, DC, where we continue to borrow and spend and put massive \namounts of borrowing and debt upon future generations. Even most State \ngovernments--mine included--have balanced budget amendments that \nrequire them in any given year to make sure the revenues they take in \nmatch up with expenses. If they don't do that in South Dakota, the \nlegislature has to stay until the budget is balanced. So most \nAmericans, as they observe what is happening in Washington these days, \nare increasingly concerned by the massive amounts of spending and \nborrowing and, frankly, the taxes they perceive to be in their future \nas well.\n  One of the things that is clear to me in doing parades and public \nevents over the Fourth of July break is how much people picked up on \nthe debate about the cap-and-trade bill, which is a national energy tax \non the American people. It passed in the House a little over a week \nago--before the break--by a seven-vote margin. There was big pressure \nto move it very quickly and jam it through the process. It was over \n1,200 pages long. One amendment was 300 pages long. There weren't many \nMembers of the House--before the bill passed--who had an opportunity to \nreview it and study it closely to determine what the ramifications will \nbe on their constituents if the bill passed. Yet it did. It was a very \nclose vote. At some point, it will be considered by the Senate.\n  The one thing we know, at a minimum, is that we can debate about how \nmuch or how big the cost of that bill will be, but we do know it is \ngoing to impose significant increases in costs on the American public \nfor power, whether it is electricity, fuel, natural gas, or home \nheating oil--the things the American people depend upon every single \nday for their very existence. They are going to see the cost of those \nthings go up if this cap-and-trade bill passes. We have seen different \nestimates by different organizations. The most recent one was done by \nthe CBO, which concluded that it will have a $700 billion impact. I \nthink that if you reduced it to a per-family cost, it ends up being \nseveral hundred dollars a year in increased rates that they are going \nto pay. I argue that it will be much higher for people in the Midwest, \nwhere I come from, because of the way we derive our power. Most of it \ncomes from coal-fired power. It is true that we get a good amount in \nSouth Dakota and other States around us get even more from those \nsources. There will be additional costs imposed upon the people in the \nMidwest, where the people on the west or east coasts may not see their \ncosts go up as much. This will disproportionately impact people in the \nheartland, but everybody's electricity costs and fuel costs are going \nup if this passes.\n  The American people are asking: OK, if you are going to put a massive \nnew tax on us with a new energy tax, what kinds of benefits do we \nderive? I think there is increasing concern and questions being raised \nabout whether the environmental benefit that would be derived as a \nresult of this massive new tax on energy in this country would be in \nany way close to the cost that would be associated with it. I think \nmost Americans have concluded that it will not. Most of the data bears \nthat out. Other countries in the world are not going to participate in \nthis system, and America will be unilaterally implementing this regime, \nif passed, and the Americans will pay the costs for little benefit.\n  There are many ways you can get reduction in carbon emissions, and we \nare all looking for ways to reduce pollutants in the atmosphere. You \ncan give incentives and drive investment in certain directions, and we \ncould make more use of nuclear power, which is clean, green energy--\nsomething we do very little of relative to our counterparts in other \nparts of the world.\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\nFrance gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy. There is no \nreason why the United States could not turn to that clean, green energy \nsource, as well as renewable energy sources that we have an abundance \nof in my part of the country, such as wind energy. If you put in \nincentives and drive investment in that direction, you can achieve the \nsame ends without putting the big cap, top-down government mandate on \nthe American economy at an enormous cost to the American consumers.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  That is the issue, I would say, probably as much as anything else I \nhave heard people talk about, but not far behind it was this notion \nthat the government is now going to take over one-sixth of our economy \nbecause of the legislation that is moving through the Congress right \nnow that would ``reform'' our health care system.\n  It is, I guess, no surprise to most Americans that we spend a lot on \nhealth care. Most of us would like to see us spend less on health care. \nMany of us think we can do that, that we can get costs under control, \nthat we can do it through reforms that preserve what is good about the \nAmerican health care system, that doesn't copy what is happening in \nother places around the world, Europe being an example, where care is \nrationed, where people don't have access to the types of therapies and \ntreatments because the government decides what procedures are going to \nbe covered, which procedures are cost-effective.\n  Those are decisions made by government. In this country, those are \ndecisions made by patients and doctors, by physicians, by health care \nproviders and those they serve. We believe that is a basic relationship \nwe ought to preserve when we talk about reforming our health care \nsystem.\n  But most Americans are very concerned that the government may take \nover one-sixth of the American economy and run it, imposing the \ngovernment in the place of, as I said before, what has typically been a \nrelationship between physicians and patients.\n  What I would argue is that whether it is the issue of new energy \ntaxes on the American consumer, whether it is the issue of the \ngovernment taking over the health care system in this country at a \nminimum cost of $1 trillion--there was a CBO Congressional Budget \nOffice report that came out recently that said the new plan the \nDemocrats are unveiling may only be $600 billion, but it also doesn't \ninclude many of the most costly parts of the plan that we expect the \nDemocrats to put on the floor of the Senate at some point in the not \ntoo distant future.\n  I will simply say again that based on the feedback I got from people \nacross this country and people across South Dakota in particular over \nthe break, the government takeover of health care in this country is \nsomething with which they are very uncomfortable, and they don't want \nto pay trillions of dollars in new taxes to make that possible.\n  If you talk about the amount of spending that is going on, the amount \nof borrowing we are doing from future generations, I think most \nAmericans come back to those two basic principles I mentioned earlier, \nwhat I call our sort of commonsense conclusions that the American \npeople come to. One is, you cannot spend money you do not have, and \nthey see Washington doing that every single day; that when you borrow \nmoney, at some point you have to pay it back. And there is borrowing \ngoing on here right now like there is no tomorrow.\n  The health care entitlement program, if passed, would be a minimum of \n$1 trillion in new spending and would either have to be financed by tax \nincreases, by revenue raisers the economy is going to pay for at a time \nwe can least afford it, or by borrowing at a time when we are running \nover the next decade at least on average $1 trillion a year in \ndeficits.\n  We cannot continue on this path. It is unsustainable. I believe the \nAmerican people are coming to that realization. I hope the Senate will \nput the brakes on this energy tax, will put the brakes on this massive \nrush to take over one-sixth of our economy by taking over the health \ncare system in this country.\n  I believe as the American people start to weigh in to this debate \nthose of us in Washington who are in positions to make some of these \npolicies and shape some of these policies will be getting an earful, \nand I hope so because we need to put the brakes on this massive \ntakeover of the health care system, and we need to put the brakes on \nthis cap and trade, this energy tax imposed on the American people, if \nit is passed in the Senate as it was a week ago in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I hope we can stop those things. I hope at least we can bring some \nsense to the debate about health care that does reform our system, that \ndoes get costs under control, that does not allow the government to get \nin the way of making decisions that rightfully ought to be made by \npatients and their doctors.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Thune, for \npointing out, again, the disastrous course we are on as a nation with \nthe level of spending, borrowing, and debt we are creating and the \namount of government intrusion into so many areas of our economy that \nhave alarmed so many Americans. I appreciate the Senator bringing up \nthat issue today.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1399 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  I rise today to express my grave concerns about the administration's \nresponse to the situation in Honduras. There are few absolutes in the \narena of diplomacy and international affairs. As circumstances and \nregimes change, so do our interests and allegiances. But one principle \nthat should stand as a bedrock constant is this: a friend of freedom is \na friend of America. Our commitment to freedom is not confined to a \nculture or a continent. It is absolute and universal.\n  It was this principle, hardwired into our DNA, that President Obama \nappeared to violate during his 8 days of silence while innocent \ndemocratic demonstrators were tortured and murdered in the streets of \nTehran by Iran's tyrannical regime.\n  Thankfully, the President finally changed his rhetoric and offered \nsome support to the people of Iran risking their lives for their \nfreedom. But he stopped short of any criticism or action that might be \nconstrued as ``meddling,'' in his words, in the domestic affairs of a \nsovereign nation.\n  But in the last week, the President has reversed course, meddling up \nto his ears in the domestic affairs of another sovereign nation, \nHonduras. Depressingly, the President has once again sided with an \nillegitimate and anti-American autocrat over democracy, the rule of \nlaw, and an oppressed people who only want to be free.\n  The facts on the ground in Honduras are neither disputed nor \nconfusing, but they have been largely ignored by an international media \ndistracted by the death of a celebrity.\n  Let me read these facts into the record.\n  Honduras is a constitutional republic and a longtime ally of the \nUnited States. It is one of the poorest nations in the Western \nHemisphere, especially since it was ravaged by the direct hit of \nHurricane Mitch in 1998.\n  In 2005, Hondurans elected as their President Manuel Zelaya, a left \nof center but seemingly moderate candidate from the Liberal Party. \nGiven Latin America's troubling history of military coups and self-\nappointed Presidents for life, the Honduran Constitution strictly \nlimits Presidents to one term.\n  So seriously do Hondurans take their Presidential term limits that in \nLatin America, the phrase--and I will butcher this Spanish, but I want \nto give it a try--``continuar en el poder.'' It means to continue in \npower. It carries with it a dark connotation to the region for everyone \nliving there.\n  For a President to overthrow the Constitution and violate term limits \nis violating the constitutional form of government. So seriously that \narticle 238 of the Honduran Constitution says any President who even \nproposes an extension of his tenure in office ``shall immediately \ncease performing the functions of his post.'' So it is a de facto \nresignation of office in Honduras for a President to attempt to do what \ntheir President did.\n\n  Zelaya's 2005 campaign was supported by Hugo Chavez, the Marxist \nVenezuelan dictator bent on amassing\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\npower in the Western Hemisphere at the expense of what he calls ``the \nNorth American empire.'' That is us.\n  Zelaya quickly aligned his government with Chavez's and joined anti-\nAmerican socialists, such as the Castro brothers in Cuba and Daniel \nOrtega in Nicaragua, in Chavez's economic cartel.\n  With Zelaya's term coming to an end early next year, Chavez convinced \nhim to do as he has done in Venezuela: to force a constitutional \namendment extending his Presidential term. This would be in direct \nviolation of what their Constitution says.\n  Earlier this year, Zelaya called for a referendum to initiate a \nconstitutional convention. In the ensuing litigation, the Honduran \ncourts ruled the referendum was unconstitutional and illegal, as the \nHonduran Constitution explicitly gives only its Congress the power to \ncall such a vote.\n  Zelaya forged ahead, calling his referendum a ``nonbinding survey.'' \nThis, too, the supreme court found unconstitutional.\n  Zelaya then ordered the head of the Honduran military, General \nVasquez, to conduct the election anyway. Vasquez expressed concerns \nabout the vote's legality, so Zelaya fired him.\n  The supreme court ordered Zelaya to reinstate Vasquez, and Zelaya \nrefused. The supreme court ordered the military to seize the referendum \nballots to prevent Zelaya from going ahead with the illegal vote. \nZelaya then personally led an armed mob to steal back the ballots, \nwhich, it should be noted, were suspiciously printed in Venezuela. \nZelaya ordered his government to set up 15,000 polling places to \nconduct the referendum for June 28.\n  On Friday, June 26, the Attorney General of Honduras, Luis Rubi, \nfiled a complaint before the Honduran Supreme Court petitioning for an \narrest warrant for President Zelaya. The court issued the warrant \nunanimously and, according to the Constitution, ordered the Honduran \nmilitary to execute it.\n  Early in the morning of Sunday, June 28, the day of the vote, the \nmilitary arrested President Zelaya at his home. They put him on a plane \nto Costa Rica, as Honduras has no prison capable of withstanding a mob \nriot of the sort they feared Chavez and Ortega might whip up. So they \ndid it for his safety.\n  That same day, the Honduran Congress, controlled by his Liberal \nParty--his own party--voted 125 to 3 to replace Zelaya with their \nspeaker, Roberto Micheletti, as a member of the Liberal Party. This \ntransfer of power was strictly in keeping with Honduras's \nconstitutional line of succession as the Vice President had recently \nresigned.\n  The regularly scheduled general elections remain set for this \nNovember, and interim President Micheletti is not a candidate. The \npreviously nominated candidates from the two major parties remain on \nthe campaign trail, and both candidates and parties overwhelmingly \napproved the ouster of Zelaya.\n  At every step in the process, the legitimate democratic government \nstrictly adhered to the Honduran Constitution and civilian leadership \nof the military remained intact. The military did not execute a coup. \nIt thwarted the coup plotted by Hugo Chavez and implemented by Manuel \nZelaya.\n  Honduras's democratic institutions are operating today, and its \ngovernment functions are secure. The only aggrieved party in this \nprocess is Mr. Chavez, whose brazen attempts to corrupt Honduran \ndemocracy was thwarted by what has now been nicknamed ``the little \ncountry that could.''\n  The people of Honduras stood up to Hugo Chavez, Daniel Ortega, the \nCastro brothers, and they stood up for freedom and the rule of law. For \ntheir courage, President Obama has condemned them. He has called the \nconstitutional ouster of President Zelaya not legal, claiming an \nexpertise in Honduran law over and above that of a unanimous Honduran \nSupreme Court and a nearly unanimous Honduran Congress.\n  Secretary of State Clinton lazily joined the international media in \ncalling the removal of President Zelaya ``a coup,'' a term fraught with \ndark memories of military juntas and banana republic. Of course, this \nis the same administration that insists on calling the recent fraud in \nIran an election.\n  The Obama administration joined Chavez's preposterous Soviet-style \npropaganda resolution in the Organization of American States condemning \nHonduran democracy. Hondurans I have spoken with--I have spoken with a \nnumber of folks who have missionary groups there, medical groups. I \nhave talked to Miguel Estrada who was born and raised in Honduras and \nis now a constitutional expert in this country. This morning I talked \nto former Honduran President Ricardo Maduro. They are all totally \nbefuddled at the strange response they are getting from the supposedly \nfree world, including our own administration. Why are we siding with \nHugo Chavez?\n  This morning in Russia, President Obama reiterated his support for \nZelaya, the would-be dictator, as the rightful President of Honduras. \nAccording to ABC News, he said:\n\n       America supports now the restoration of the democratically \n     elected President of Honduras, even though he has strongly \n     opposed American policies.\n\n  Continuing with the quote from President Obama:\n\n       We do so not because we agree with him. We do so because we \n     respect the universal principle that people should choose \n     their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with or \n     not.\n\n  The President appears to think his support for Zelaya is based on \nsome principles of self-determination. He speaks as if opposition to \nZelaya is based on partisan political differences. Zelaya was not \nousted by political enemies; he was ousted by a government controlled \nby his own party. He was ousted by a unanimous supreme court operating \nin accordance with the Honduran Constitution and in conjunction with \nthe nation's attorney general and Supreme Electoral Tribunal. These \nfolks followed the rule of law.\n  The Honduran people have chosen their own leaders. Those leaders--in \na constitutional, bipartisan, and nearly unanimous process--removed \nManuel Zelaya from office. The Honduran people have upheld our \nPresident's so-called universal principle. The people seeking to \nundermine that principle are Hugo Chavez, the Castro brothers, Daniel \nOrtega, Mel Zelaya, and--unbelievably--the Obama administration.\n  This is not about politics. This is about the rule of law, freedom, \nand democracy, all of which are being defended by the Hondurans right \nnow against their enemies--of which we appear to be one. Why are we not \nstanding with them? Blood was shed in Iran while we stood idly by. \nZelaya's return to Honduras on a Venezuelan jet and with the moral \nauthority of the United States will almost certainly lead to more \nbloodshed. What are we doing on the side of tyrants and sworn enemies \nof freedom; going as far, on their behalf, to threaten economic \nsanctions against one of our poorest and bravest allies?\n  Secretary of State Clinton is reportedly planning a meeting with Mr. \nZelaya in Washington this week. I implore her to reconsider that \nmeeting. Elevating an impeached and disgraced autocrat is more than an \ninsult to Honduran democracy, it is a green light to other would-be \nChavezes around Latin America. It is a signal to the enemies of \ndemocracy and freedom that the United States no longer stands as a \nbeacon of liberty. It is a signal that the rule of law is now passe in \nLatin America and that Hugo Chavez and his corrupt and brutal idealogy \nhas free rein to meddle wherever he pleases in the Western Hemisphere.\n  What do we stand for, if not for freedom, democracy, and the rule of \nlaw? Where is the spine of the administration to stand up to anti-\nAmerican and antidemocratic thugs in our own back yard? Where is the \nintellectual clarity to see the facts on the ground as they are? Manuel \nZelaya is a criminal, a constitutionally removed former President of a \nproud and noble country. To my knowledge, no administration official \nhas refuted or even grappled with the facts regarding Zelaya's \nattempted coup.\n  Given those still undisputed and documented facts, on what basis does \nthe administration demand Zelaya's reinstatement? His removal from \noffice was no more a coup than was Gerald Ford's ascendance to the Oval \nOffice or the election to the Senate of our newest colleague, Al \nFranken. It is bad enough that the President's ad hoc and highly \npersonalized foreign policy seems to be less about supporting the\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nrule of law than it is about supporting particular rulers. But the last \n4 weeks suggest that the President cannot even be counted upon to \nsupport our legitimate allies.\n  What happened in Honduras last week was not a tragedy, it was a \ntriumph of democratic courage and the unyielding determination of a \nfree people to stand up to despotism. The tragedy has been the failure \nof the West and of our own government in Washington to stand up for \njustice and freedom in Latin America.\n  It is not too late. I have written to Secretary Clinton, and there is \ngrowing congressional support for the legitimate government in \nHonduras. Everywhere I go someone comes up to me and tells me to stand \nup for freedom in Honduras. There is still time to look at the facts, \neven to visit Honduras itself. Call down there, talk to the people, \neven Americans in the Peace Corps or on missionary work, and ask them \nif they are living under an oppressive military junta. They will laugh \nand tell you they are living under an independent and vibrant \ndemocracy, with a representative government led by people they elected. \nThey will tell you about the free and open debate in the ongoing \nPresidential campaign and whom they are supporting in the November \nelections.\n  There is still time to correct our position and support our true \nallies. And because we can, we should. We must. Because today--and I \nwill try my Spanish again--``un amigo de libertad es un amigo de \nHonduras''--a friend of freedom is a friend of Honduras.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1399 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

Mr. President, I will speak to the amendment later. I see \na colleague wanting to speak and so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DeMint amendment No. 1399.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the underlying legislation is the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1400 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up amendment No. 1400.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1400 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill before us today spends $44.3 billion. It is $207.5 \nmillion--or 7 percent more than last year's appropriation and nearly \n$97 million more than the budget request. An increase of this size is \nremarkable. I need to remind my colleagues that Americans are hurting, \nthey are losing their jobs and their homes at record rates, and here we \nare, business as usual, as was made very clear in the vote on the \namendment that was defeated concerning a museum in Nebraska on another \nappropriations bill--a bill that was supposed to be for funding \nlegislative business of the Congress. On this bill again, it is \nbusiness as usual. The level of spending is wrong, and there are \nnumerous unrequested, unauthorized earmarks which were added at the \ndirection of members of the Appropriations Committee and the Senate.\n  Maybe we ought to take a look at them. This is the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, I would remind my colleagues, \nbut we threw in $4 million for the Fort Madison Bridge in Fort Madison, \nWI. As always, there are earmarks and geographic locations delineated \nin the bill for these pork-barrel projects. There is $39.7 million for \nthe Advanced Training Center in West Virginia and $3.6 million for the \nCoast Guard Operations Systems Center in West Virginia. That is a good \nplace for Coast Guard operations, to say the least.\n  I wish to point out that none of these earmarks were authorized. None \nof them had a hearing. None of them were requested. In fact, three of \nthem I will read about were included in the President's budget request \nin a report from the Office of Management and Budget entitled \n``Terminations, Reductions, and Savings: Budget of the U.S. Government, \nFiscal Year 2010,'' which was submitted by the Office of Management and \nBudget. In other words, the administration requested that these \nspecific appropriations not be spent because of the fact they either \nare not needed or are outright wasteful spending of the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Continuing with the list of earmarks in this bill, we have another \n$16.8 million for the Coast Guard Station in Cleveland Harbor, OH, to \ndemolish the existing facility and construct a new multipurpose \nbuilding.\n  I wish to emphasize to my colleagues that these may be worthy \nprojects. They may be. Generally, they aren't, but they may be. But \nthere has been no hearing, there is no request on the part of the \nadministration, there is no request from anybody except for the \nrepresentative of that State.\n  Continuing: $4 million for the National Infrastructure Simulation and \nAnalysis Center; $102 million for the National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium--and that contains six earmarks: The National Energetic \nMaterials Research and Testing Center in New Mexico, $23 million; \nNational Center for Biomedical Research and Training at Louisiana State \nUniversity, $23 million; National Emergency Response and Rescue \nTraining Center at Texas\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\nA University, $23 million; National Exercise, Test, and Training \nCenter in Nevada, $23 million; Transportation Technology Center in \nPueblo, CO, $5 million; and, of course, we never want to forget the \nNatural Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of \nHawaii, $5 million.\n  There is $3 million for the Distributed Environment for Critical \nInfrastructure Decision-making Exercises. We need $3 million for the \ninfrastructure decision-making exercises. Money is also set aside for \nthe Cyber Security Consortium, which is a group of schools, including \nMiami University of Ohio, Utah State University, University of Nevada \nat Reno, and Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.\n  A certain thread may become apparent throughout this conversation and \nthat is that States which are generally getting most of this money \nhappen to have representatives in the Senate on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  There is $2 million for the Cincinnati Urban Area Partnership; $20.8 \nmillion for the Southeast Region Research Initiative; $300,000 for the \nCity of Hackensack Emergency Operations Center. Emergency operations \ncenters are very popular in this bill. But there was no competition for \nthese emergency operation centers. They may be worthwhile, they may \nnot. We will never know because they are earmarked by the Members and \nthey range from $1 million to $20 million to $247,000. We have New \nJersey, New Jersey, New Jersey; Washington State; Providence, RI; north \nLouisiana; Little Rock; Vermont; Columbus, OH; city of Ames; and the \ncity of Mount Vernon.\n  There is $900,000 for the City of Whitefish Emergency Operations \nCenter in Montana. And because we wouldn't want to leave them out, \nthere is $1 million for the City of Chicago Emergency Operations \nCenter.\n  None of these projects were requested by the administration or \nauthorized or competitively bid in any way. No hearing was held to \njudge whether these were national priorities worthy of scarce \ntaxpayers' dollars. They are in this bill for one reason and one reason \nonly: because of the selective prerogatives of a few Members of the \nSenate. Sadly, these Members choose to serve their own interests over \nthose of the American taxpayers.\n  I have filed, and intend to offer, amendments to strike each and \nevery one of these earmarks. Enough is enough. The American people are \ntired of this process, and they are tired of watching their hard-earned \nmoney go down the drain. I intend to fight every single unnecessary, \nunrequested, unauthorized earmark in every appropriations bill.\n  In addition to the earmarks I covered, this bill includes millions of \ndollars for programs that the administration has sought to cut due to \nthe program's ineffectiveness or lack of necessity. The amendment I \npropose has as an example: The Over-the-road Bus Security Program. The \nadministration proposed in its 2010 budget to eliminate the Over-the-\nRoad Bus Security Program since the awards are not based on risk, as \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission, and has not been assessed as \neffective. Specifically, the Office of Management and Budget stated:\n\n       Recently, the funding (for this program) has gone to \n     private sector entities for business investments in GPS-type \n     tracking systems that they could be making without Federal \n     funding. For now, this program should be eliminated in favor \n     of funding initiatives aimed at mitigated verified transit \n     threats.\n\n  Again, in the Office of Management and Budget submission the \nadministration says:\n\n       The Government Accountability Office has recommended that \n     TSA conduct an in-depth risk analysis of the commercial \n     vehicle sector before more funding is allocated.\n       For now, this program should be eliminated in favor of \n     funding initiatives aimed at mitigating verified transit \n     threats. Funding for the intercity bus industry should be \n     included in the larger Public Rail/Transit Security Grant \n     program and prioritized against all transit-related security \n     investments.\n\n  But it is not. Here, on the one hand, we have the President announce \nwith great fanfare a group of reductions and terminations and savings \nthat the administration is going to make and is strongly urging be \ndone. Here we have on the bill an earmark that, indeed, funds these \nvery same programs the administration wants eliminated.\n  There is another one, and that is the U.S. Coast Guard Loran-C. \nLoran-C sounds like a pretty good program, but the fact is, this $35 \nmillion, by the way, is a federally funded radio navigation system for \ncivil marine use in coastal areas. I will quote from the Office of \nManagement and Budget:\n\n       The Nation no longer needs this system because federally \n     supported civilian Global Positioning System--GPS--has \n     replaced it with superior capabilities. As a result, Loran-C, \n     including recent limited technological enhancements, serves \n     only the remaining small group of long-time users. It no \n     longer serves any governmental function and is not capable as \n     a backup for GPS.\n\n  So we are going to spend $35 million on GPS that is useless. It is \nuseless for Loran-C. Why? Why would we want to do that? Why would we \nwant to spend that kind of money? It is amazing.\n  Then there is the emergency operation centers, of course, some $20 \nmillion for operation centers in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey--\net cetera. These, of course, are obviously the result of earmarks. \nAgain, the Office of Management and Budget says the administration is \nproposing to eliminate the Emergency Operations Center Grant Program in \nthe 2010 budget because the program's award allocations are not based \non risk assessment.\n  Oh, really. Also:\n\n     . . . other Department of Homeland Security grant programs \n     can provide funding for the same purpose more effectively.\n\n  It goes on to talk about how the grant program was established:\n\n     . . . by supporting flexible, sustainable, secure and \n     interoperable EOCs, with a focus on addressing identified \n     deficiencies and needs. . . . The EOC Grant Program uses \n     award criteria that are not risk-based, and the \n     administration supports a risk-based approach to homeland \n     security grant awards.\n\n  I wonder how many of these would be awarded if they were risk based \nand how many of them are awarded because of the influence of members of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n\n       In addition, in 2009, EOC construction and renovation was \n     approved as an allowable expense under the Emergency \n     Management Performance Grant Program, thus providing a more \n     effective funding mechanism through which potential grantees \n     prioritize expenditures on EOCs against other emergency \n     management initiatives.\n\n  In other words, we are spending these millions of dollars--$20 \nmillion I guess it is--in an unnecessary fashion that has nothing to do \nwith risk but has everything to do with influence.\n  It is business as usual in our Nation's Capitol. We just came off a \nrecess. A lot of us spent time, as I did, traveling around our States. \nPeople in my State are hurting. People in my State are wondering \nwhether they are going to be able to keep their jobs or get a job; \nwhether they will be able to afford health care; whether they are going \nto be able to educate their children. They are having to tighten their \nbelts in ways that certainly no one has ever had to do before in their \nlifetime.\n  So what do we do here? Business as usual: $97-some-million of \nunnecessary and unwanted pork. Last year, Congress appropriated many \nmillions of dollars. This, once again, is $97 million more than the \nbudget request, and much of that is obviously unnecessary and unneeded \nand in some cases even unwanted.\n  On behalf of the citizens of my State who are having to tighten their \nbelts, who are undergoing unprecedented difficulties and hard times \nwhile we are on this spending spree and accumulating trillions of \ndollars of debt--we are committing generational theft, laying it on our \nchildren and grandchildren. I intend to fight for their tax dollars, \nand I intend to fight until this egregious practice of porkbarrel \nearmarked spending, which has bred corruption, is brought to a halt.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor I would like to \ninclude in the Record at this time a list of the various bus companies \nand the States in which they operate. I ask unanimous consent they be \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     FY 2009 INTERCITY BUS SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM FINAL ALLOCATIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               State                     Entity name          Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Tier I\n \nMA................................

The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business for a period of about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my dear friend \nfrom the State of Arizona for once again reminding us of this egregious \npractice of earmark spending that continues to not only grow but \ncontinues to be a dark mark on our record as Members of the Congress.\n  I think, as he rightly pointed out, at a time of serious economic \ndistress in places such as Arizona--and I certainly could say as well \nin Florida--it is a bit out of sync for us to continue the spending as \nusual just for the mere fact that there is a member of the \nAppropriations Committee who can, in fact, command something be done \nonly because it would benefit a narrow interest in their State, within \ntheir district, and which, in fact, may not be requested and which may \nnot be needed.\n\n\n                                Honduras\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise, though, to speak about the \nevents in Honduras. The events that are taking place in Honduras right \nnow are the unfortunate result of the silence of both the United States \nand the inter-American community to the assault on Honduras' democratic \ninstitutions.\n  It is difficult for Hondurans and other democrats within the region \nto understand the full significance of President Zelaya's expulsion \nfrom Honduras. Up until this point, there has not been any significant \nvoice in the opposition to the dismantling of democratic institutions \nand free societies in Venezuela, Bolivia--and as Honduras was going \ndown the path, you might also add Nicaragua to that, to name only a few \nof the most visible cases.\n  It is also hard to explain why there was this silence in the face of \nPresident Zelaya's earlier unconstitutional actions, especially the \nevent that appeared to precipitate his ousting: the storming of a \nmilitary base to seize and distribute ballots for a referendum that \npreviously had been declared unconstitutional by the Honduran Supreme \nCourt.\n  A fundamental tenet of democracy is the separation of powers. You \nhave a President in the executive branch and then you have the judicial \nbranch of government, a coequal and separate branch, and that branch \ntold the President the referendum he was seeking to have to extend his \nrule beyond the constitutional term was illegal, it should not be done. \nHe was undeterred and he was completely unrepentant as he sought to \ncontinue his plan to have a referendum, even though the Congress, even \nthough the judiciary had already told him that was in contravention of \nthe Constitution of their country.\n  Where was the region's outrage over Hugo Chavez's support for Mr. \nZelaya's unconstitutional actions in Honduras? Mr. Chavez supported Mr. \nZelaya because they are kindred spirits, because Mr. Chavez had already \nbeen able to usurp every institution of democracy within his country of \nVenezuela and now rules as an autocrat. He wanted to have the same \nplaybook applied in Honduras as he coached and shepherded to do some of \nthe same things in Bolivia and to some degree in Nicaragua as well--and \nNicaragua coming along.\n  The Honduran people decided this was not going to happen in their \ncountry, and the people in the Honduran Congress and in the Honduran \nSupreme Court decided it was not going to happen on their watch. But \nthe region's silence toward the assault on democracy in Honduras \nfollowed a pattern of acquiescence of Chavez's dismantling of \ndemocratic institutions and civil liberties in Venezuela.\n  For instance, the OAS has said absolutely nothing about Chavez's \nclosing of independent media, his manipulation of elections, his \nerosion of independent branches of government, and his usurping of the \nauthority of local elected officials. Leaders like Chavez, Ortega, and \nZelaya have cloaked themselves in the language of democracy when it was \nconvenient for them. Yet their actions ignored it when it did not \nfurther their personal ambitions.\n  This situation was compounded by the actions of the United States, \nincluding work behind the scenes to keep the Honduran Congress and \nSupreme Court from using the clearly legal means of Presidential \nimpeachment. Some of us have wondered why wasn't he impeached? Why \ndidn't the Congress go ahead and impeach President Zelaya? Our Embassy \nin Tegucigalpa counseled that the Hondurans should not use the tools of \nimpeachment.\n  Having stood on sidelines while Mr. Zelaya overstepped his nation's \nConstitution, the United States and the inter-American community only \nspeak now. Protecting a sitting President, regardless of his illegal \nacts, sets a dangerous precedent. Instead, U.S. policy should be \nfocused on only supporting efforts that uphold the integrity of \nconstitutional order and democratic institutions.\n  In fairness to the Obama administration, this distorted policy is not \nnew. Through advice from the State Department, former President George \nW. Bush was talked out of having the United States stand visibly with \ndemocratic advocates in Latin America. The advice was based on the \nbelief that by not making the United States an issue, this would allow \nthe region to stand up for democratic activists. Unfortunately, no \ncountry or leader did so, and most significant of all, the leader of \nthe OAS has sat idly by, year after year, as democracy after democracy \nwas dismantled, one piece at a time, one election at a time, one \ninstitution at a time, saying absolutely nothing.\n  The OAS has a responsibility to condemn and sanction Presidential \nabuses, not just abuses against Presidents. Because of the OAS failure \nto uphold the checks and balances within democracies, it has become an \nenabler of authoritarian leaders throughout the region. The result of \nthis has been a signal of acceptance to antidemocratic actions and \nabandonment of those fighting for democracy in Venezuela, Bolivia, \nNicaragua, Ecuador, and elsewhere.\n  This silence was compounded by the recent repudiation of the \napplication of the Inter-American Democratic Charter to the Cuban \ndictatorship. Ironically, it was in Honduras, with Mr. Zelaya taking a \nleading role, where the OAS General Assembly decided against any clear \ndemocratic standards for Cuba retaking its seat in that organization.\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\n  So here is what occurred: The OAS, filled with a desire to \nreincorporate Cuba into the family of nations, completely ignored that \nfor 50 years Cuba has been a military dictatorship without even the \nvestiges of a free and fair election, and they invited Cuba to be \nreadmitted without setting up a standard by which they would have to \nlive.\n  President Zelaya, with his partner Hugo Chavez, was leading the \ncharge in saying Cuba should be welcomed back and there should be no \nconditions, no conditions of democratic rule like the ones he is now \nrelying upon to try to get his Presidency back.\n  It is Mr. Zelaya now seeking the very protection of the Democratic \nCharter of the OAS which he thinks applies to him but which he felt was \nunimportant to apply the rights and opportunities to the Cuban people \nto try to claim the democratic future for themselves.\n  The crisis in Honduras stems from the failure of its leaders to live \nwithin constitutional boundaries and from the earlier silence of the \nUnited States and the international community regarding the abuse of \npower by the Honduran executive. Tragically, the United States and the \nOAS have put Honduras and the region in a position where democracy is \nthe loser once again.\n  The return of Mr. Zelaya will signal the approval of his \nunconstitutional acts. If he is not allowed to return, then the \nunacceptable behavior of forcibly exiling a leader elected by the \npeople would be given tacit approval. This is what happens when \nprinciples are sacrificed for a policy that can only be described as \nthe appeasement of authoritarians.\n  In the current crisis, neither the United States nor other countries \nin the region or the international community should be taking sides in \na constitutional dispute but, rather, encouraging a resolution through \ndialog among Hondurans. To this end, efforts should be focused on \nhelping Hondurans form a reconciliation government that would include \nrepresentatives not associated with either the Zelaya administration or \nthe current interim government.\n  The objective should be to keep Hondurans on track to hold currently \nscheduled Presidential elections in November, with the inauguration of \na new President in January as mandated in the Honduran Constitution. \nThe newly elected President, with an electoral mandate, then can decide \nwhether and how to deal with Mr. Zelaya and those involved in his \nouster.\n  As the Senate takes up President Obama's nominees for key State \nDepartment positions in Latin America, it is time to question the \nacceptance by the United States and the inter-American community of the \nsustained dismantling of democratic institutions in free societies by \nPresidents seeking to consolidate personal power at any cost. This is \nthe larger challenge in Latin America, and Honduras is only the latest \nsymptom. The United States must no longer remain silent when democratic \ninstitutions are undermined. Any disruption of the constitutional order \nis unacceptable, regardless of who commits it.\n  It would be well for us to remember that as we look forward to what \nmay come next, the Presidential succession ought to be honored, \nhowever, institutions of democracy ought to also be equally honored.\n  Secretary of State Clinton met today at 1 o'clock with deposed \nPresident Zelaya. It appears she is seeking to align the United States \nwith the mediation that is about to be undertaken by President Oscar \nArias, a Nobel Prize-winning, well-regarded man from Costa Rica, and \nthat President Arias might take this opportunity to see how we can \nbring this process back together again.\n  It seems to me that the elections in Honduras ought to take place as \nscheduled and a new democratically elected government ought to go \nforward. The real question is, Will Mr. Zelaya be allowed to return to \nthe office of President? It seems to be fairly unanimous that all \nHonduran institutions oppose such an outcome. They do not want Mr. \nZelaya back. They have seen the dark movie of what life can be like in \na Cuba-type situation. They have seen the dark movie of what life can \nbe like in a Cuba-type situation. They have seen the erosion of \ndemocracy with the complete erosion of freedoms, so much made a dear \npart of what we in this country believe in that has taken place in \nVenezuela. They have seen the continued erosion of democratic values in \nNicaragua and they do not want to see it happen in their country, and \none cannot blame them. It would only be fitting that they should find \ncomfort by those of us in this country who not only value democracy for \nus but believe it should be shared by others around the world no matter \ntheir circumstances.\n  It isn't good enough to be elected democratically but then rule as a \ndictator and in the process of being an elected President, then move to \nerode all of the institutions of democracy--the courts, the congresses, \neven the military as an institution; they ought to be respected. Their \nindependence ought to be valued. The playbook of Mr. Chavez, which is \nto dismantle the military leadership and bring in cronies of his, the \nefforts to then discredit the courts and bring in judges that he would \nalso approve--this has been the playbook by which Chavez has operated \nand one that Mr. Zelaya was attempting to put into play.\n  So let's hope President Arias from Costa Rica will be able to lead a \nmediation effort that will bring together all of the disparate groups \nso that there can be a free and fair election and there can be a \nresolution to this crisis of democracy. But let this also be a wake-up \ncall to the rest of us who have sat silently by as this erosion of \ndemocracy takes place one country at a time in Latin America. We ought \nto say: Enough is enough. Let's stand for the rule of law, let's stand \nfor democracy, not only on election day but each and every day \nthereafter as we seek leaders who not only are elected democratically \nbut govern democratically.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from \nFlorida for a very thorough explanation of what has been, to many \nAmericans, a very confusing situation and also his support for the most \nrecent call for a mediation and discussion among the various parties so \nthat this whole matter can be brought to a successful conclusion \nwithout armed force or other inappropriate action. I, too, hope that \ncan produce the right kind of result. But I think the point--if I \ncould, while the Senator is still here, make this point strongly, as he \ndid--you have to stand up for what is right. And we all know an \nelection does not a democracy make. You can elect a government which \nthen begins to govern undemocratically.\n  Unfortunately, some of the governments in the southern part of our \nhemisphere have started all right with the elections and then ended in \na very bad way. We certainly did not want that to happen to our friends \nin Honduras. And, in fact, the people of Honduras did not want that \neither. They are people who stood by us when we were trying to support \nthe forces of freedom who were fighting in Nicaragua, and there were \nsome sacrifices on the part of the Hondurans to do that. It is a \ncountry that has had very friendly relations with the United States \nover the years, and it is important for us to stand up for our friends.\n  For that, I compliment my colleague from Florida, and I again add my \nvoice to his saying we hope these discussions the Secretary of State \nhas now called for can produce an appropriate resolution to this issue \nwithout any kind of bloodshed.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his kind comments. \nBut it also brings up one more point. Honduras has been by our side. \nThere is no more important country, in terms of military relations in \nCentral America, than Honduras, where we have a presence of our \nmilitary, where we work together in partnership to try to stem the flow \nof drugs and narcotics into our country, and where we conduct not only \ntraining missions but other important training missions with the \nHonduran military, where we are very involved in providing aid and \nassistance.\n  I think it would be well for us to hold back any declaration that a \ncoup has taken place that would then trigger other events. This is not \nyour traditional military coup where a military group decides to set up \na junta. These are military people who, while maybe they acted a little \ntoo strongly, the\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nfact is, they did not seek power for themselves but they established a \ncongressional order. So it is important.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is precisely the way I see it as well. I \nhope that helps to clarify for the American people what is really going \non there and that we can support our friends in Honduras and that \nrelationship which has existed all these years can continue to be the \nproductive one it has been.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Helsinki Commission\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time as the Chairman of the \nU.S. Helsinki Commission, for which I had the opportunity to lead a \ndelegation of 13 members representing the United States at the 18th \nAnnual Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe. We attended meetings in Europe, along with \nrepresentatives, parliamentarians from 56 countries representing \nEurope, central Asia, Canada, and the United States.\n  We first decided to stop in Bosnia, and we did that because I am sure \nmy colleagues recall the bloody conflict that erupted in the former \nYugoslavia, in Bosnia, in which communities were dislocated and people \nwere killed because of their ethnic background.\n  We found in Bosnia, because of outside interference, the three ethnic \ncommunities that had coexisted for many years were drawn into a \nconflict. The United States, in the Dayton Accords, took the leadership \nin trying to figure out a way in which we could get the ethnic \ncommunities to live together in peace. As a result of the Dayton \nAccords, there was this government established for Bosnia which is a \nbit unusual. There are three Presidents, one representing the orthodox \ncommunity, the Serbs, one representing the ethnic Bosnians, and one \nrepresenting the ethnic Croats. And this government brought an end to \nthe open violence.\n  But we knew in recent weeks and months there had been problems in \nBosnia. So we traveled to Sarajevo to talk to all of the ethnic \ncommunity leaders to see what was happening. And I must tell you, there \nhas been progress in that region, particularly with the neighboring \ncountries that are now progressing, some of which are our strong allies \nin NATO, and we have seen progress to integration in Europe. So we can \ntake pride in what we have been able to achieve in that region of \nEurope in the Balkans.\n  But Bosnia needs our attention. I am pleased we were there. I think \nit is clear to each member of our delegation that if Bosnia is going to \nbe able to continue its integration into Europe--we hope that will \noccur--if Bosnia is going to be able to move on a path toward NATO \nmembership, it needs to have constitutional reform so it has a \nfunctioning federal government protecting the rights of the three \nentities. But it needs to have a government that can function, and \nduring our trip I think we delivered that message. We were there \nshortly after Vice President Biden was there.\n  We then traveled to Vilnius, where the annual meeting was taking \nplace. But we took the opportunity to visit Minsk in Belarus. We did \nthat because Belarus is a repressive state in which the President, Mr. \nLukashenko, rules with an iron fist. The political opposition is denied \nthe normal opportunities of a government.\n  We went there because we wanted to have an opportunity to advance the \nOSCE principles. The Helsinki Commission, which is our arm in \nimplementing the OSCE, is known for advancing human rights, it is known \nfor advancing economic cooperation, it is known for advancing security \nissues. And we went to Belarus because we wanted that country, which is \na member of OSCE, to live up to its OSCE commitments, to allow its \npeople basic human rights, the right of a free press, the right to \nexpress their views, the right to challenge their government \npeacefully, the right to organize the religions of their choice, and \nthe right for economic reform, which is being denied to the people of \nBelarus. We met with President Lukashenko, and we met with the leaders \nof the different factions, of the activists.\n  We also carried a humanitarian request. There was an American, Mr. \nZeltser, Emanual Zeltser, who was imprisoned in Belarus. We do not know \nwhy he was imprisoned. There were secret indictments and a secret \ntrial. The United States was not permitted to monitor the trial. He was \nsentenced to 3 years. He has a very serious medical condition. It is \nbelieved he could not survive if he remained in Belarusian prisons. So \nwe carried a humanitarian request that he be released. Mr. Lukashenko \nhad the power to do that, and we were very pleased that our \nhumanitarian request was granted. During our meetings, the President \ntold us he would honor our request that he be released immediately, and \nMr. Zeltser was released later that afternoon, and he is now back in \nsafe care. So we appreciated that effort, and we hope that represents a \nchange in the direction of Belarus.\n  We made it clear that if the Belarusian Government made concrete \nsteps toward the OSCE-type reforms on human rights, on economics, and \nother issues, then it would be a signal to the international community \nthat we would bring Belarus more into the family of nations.\n  This Congress passed the Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions \nagainst Belarus because of their repressive regime. I hope our trip, \nwhich was the highest delegation to visit Belarus in over a decade, \nwill be the first step to seeing change in that country and a better \nrelationship between Belarus and other countries in Europe and the \nUnited States.\n  The main reason for our visit was to go to Vilnius, Lithuania, to \nparticipate in the Parliamentary Assembly. One member of our delegation \nvisited Latvia in order to advance relations. At the Parliamentary \nAssembly, I was pleased that Congressman Robert Aderholt was elected \nvice chairman of the Third Committee, which is human rights. There are \nonly three committees in the OSCE: for human rights, economics, and \nsecurity. An American, Congressman Aderholt, will be vice chairman of \nthe Human Rights Committee. I was elected vice president. That follows \nin the footsteps of Congressman Alcee Hastings, former President of the \nParliamentary Assembly.\n  The United States proposed three resolutions in addition to the \nnormal work. All three were adopted--one on maternal mortality, one on \nAfghanistan encouraging the Obama administration's policies in \nAfghanistan, and one on Internet freedom. All three of these \nresolutions were adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly.\n  We also recommended 26 amendments to the core resolutions. All 26 \namendments were adopted. I wish to cover some quickly because I think \nthey are important to U.S. policy and we now have the support of the \nOSCE, of the European and central Asian communities in advancing these \ngoals.\n  One was to seek Pakistan's interest in becoming an OSCE partner. They \nare not eligible for membership because it is central Asia, Europe, and \nNorth America. But we have partners in cooperation that work with us. \nWe have Mediterranean partners, including Israel and Jordan and Egypt. \nWe have Asian partners that belong, including Afghanistan. We think it \nwould be helpful if Pakistan sought membership as a partner in \ncooperation within OSCE. By way of example, OSCE has a mission in \nAfghanistan that deals with border security. They know how to do nation \nbuilding, how to help countries. We think that could be useful in \ndealing with U.S. policies against terrorists in Afghanistan and \nPakistan if both had an arrangement with the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe. That amendment was approved by the \nParliamentary Assembly.\n  We offered another amendment dealing with combating anti-Semitism. \nThe U.S. Helsinki Commission has been a leader in developing strategies \nto deal with the rise of anti-Semitism. We have made a lot of progress. \nWe continued to make progress at this meeting in dealing with the rise \nof anti-Semitism.\n  There were amendments offered dealing with water issues, energy, \nclimate change, and preserving cultural heritage sites. We had a very \nactive delegation, and we advanced many causes that were important to \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\n  We had bilateral meetings. We met with our counterparts from Russia \nto try to improve the dialog between Russia and the United States. This \nwas a day or two before the meeting of our Presidents in Moscow. I \nthink it is in keeping with the Obama strategy of trying to have a more \neffective dialog between the United States and Russia. We have \ndifferences, but we need to understand each other's positions to try to \nbring about the type of change that would be in the interests of both \ncountries. We underscored those points during our bilateral meetings \nwith the Russian parliamentarians.\n  We also met with the parliamentarians from Georgia. We were very \ndisappointed that the OSCE mission in Georgia was terminated as a \nresult of Russia's veto of the continuation of that mission. That \nmission deals with conflict prevention. It is there to keep peace in \nGeorgia, where we know there is still the potential for conflict to \nerupt at any moment. We had a chance to meet with the Georgia \nparliamentarians to go over those issues.\n  We met with the parliamentarians from Lithuania. The last time I was \nin Lithuania was February 1991, when the Soviet tanks were in \nLithuania, where they had taken over the TV towers. We returned to the \nTV towers. We were there in 1991 and saw the tragedy that the Soviets \nhad committed in that country. We also went to the parliament building, \nwhere it was barricaded in 1991 because of Soviet tanks. Now we were \nable to enter a free country, a close ally of the United States, a \nmember of NATO. It was a proud moment to return to that site and see \nwhat has happened. The United States has a proud record of always \nrecognizing the independence of Lithuania and never recognizing the \nSoviet takeover of that independent country. We had a chance to meet \nwith the President. We had a chance to meet with the parliamentarians, \nand we met with the Prime Minister. We mentioned an issue that is still \npending that needs to be resolved; that is, property restitution issues \nand community property issues dating back to the Nazi occupation. We \nurged the Lithuanian Parliament to promptly pass an appropriate law so \nthat the payments can be made to the appropriate victims as quickly as \npossible since many of the families are dying out and it is important \nthat this issue be handled as quickly as possible. I hope Lithuania \nwill follow through on those recommendations.\n  We had a very busy agenda. I am very proud of the work of each member \nof our delegation. We advanced the interests of the United States. We \nwill be following through on the different discussions we had to make \nsure progress continues in each of these areas. It was an honor to \nrepresent the Senate with the Helsinki Commission. We will keep \nSenators informed on the progress we are making.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45 p.m. \ntoday, there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \nMcCain amendment No. 1400, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senator McCain and the majority leader or their designees; \nfurther, that on Wednesday, July 8, when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of H.R. 2892, there be 5 minutes for debate prior to a \nvote in relation to the Sessions amendment No. 1371, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senator Schumer and Senator \nSessions or their designees; that upon disposition of the Sessions \namendment No. 1371, the Senate resume consideration of DeMint amendment \nNo. 1300, with 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation thereto, \nwith the time equally divided between Senator Murray and Senator DeMint \nor their designees; that no amendment be in order to any of the \namendments covered in this agreement prior to a vote in relation to \nthese amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me quickly say, before I turn it over to \nmy friend from New Hampshire, we have been in many quorum calls today, \nwith plenty of opportunities to offer amendments. We have to move \nforward on this bill. When we finish this bill, we have 10 other \nappropriations bills to do. We have to move forward on this bill. \nPeople cannot complain that they have not had opportunity to offer \namendments when they don't offer them.\n\n\n                             Debt explosion\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a couple of items. The \ntwo things I wish to speak about are, first, this rumbling we are \nstarting to hear about having a third stimulus package. Some people say \nit is a second. It is a third stimulus package. We did a tax stimulus \npackage about $140 billion and the $700-plus billion stimulus package \nearlier this year. It is incomprehensible to me that we would want to \nhave another stimulus package unpaid for and add that to the debt.\n  We are facing a massive explosion of debt in this country. The best \nthing we can do to get this economy going would be to show the world \nand the American people we are serious about doing something about our \ndebt.\n  To roll out another stimulus package in the face of that type of a \nsituation that would be unpaid for is a huge mistake, whether it is a \ntax cut or whether it is spending. I cannot understand why we are even \nthinking about it.\n  When we look at the stimulus package which was just passed a few \nmonths ago, that hasn't even spent out. Only 15 percent of that is \ngoing to be spent this year, and another 37 percent of it will be spent \nnext year. That means we still have 50 percent of the spending of that \n$700-plus billion bill to occur in 2011 and beyond. So if the purpose \nof a new stimulus package is to try to bring up the slack in the \neconomy as we move into 2010 and on to 2011, we do not need it because \nwe already have a stimulus package that is coming down the road, if you \naccept that as being useful--I don't happen to--but it is clearly \ncounterproductive if it is simply going to add to and increase the debt \nof this Nation and the debt that is passed on to our children.\n  The debt of this country is increasing to astronomical proportions. \nWe are looking at deficits of 4 to 5 percent of GDP for the next 10 \nyears. We are looking at a debt that goes to 80 percent of GDP. The new \nstimulus would aggravate both those numbers dramatically.\n  To quote my colleague from North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, the debt is the threat. If we continue to pass through this \nCongress spending which is not offset, which is not paid for, in the \nname of stimulus or anything else, we are simply aggravating this \nextraordinarily difficult situation, which is the massive explosion of \nFederal debt. It is not fair to our children. More importantly, it is \nnot correct, and it is not good policy.\n  Nothing would energize this economy more than to have the world look \nat America and recognize that we are going to do something substantive \nabout reducing our debt and our deficits. People around the world and \nin our Nation would have confidence in our government again. But if we \ncontinue to talk about rolling out another stimulus upon the stimulus \nwe already have--the first stimulus and the second stimulus--rolling \nout a third stimulus, which will be unpaid for and expensive, that is \nnot sound fiscal policy.\n  Since the debt is the issue, let me turn to the second point I wish \nto make. The TARP, which has received a lot of negative press over the \nlast few months, has accomplished its purpose in large degree. The \nreason the TARP was passed was to stabilize the financial industry \nduring a period when it looked like we were going to have a cataclysmic \nimplosion of the financial industry. We were on the verge of a \ncatastrophic event, where basically our whole financial industry would \nhave melted down, bringing down with it Main Street and people's \nability to get loans, people's ability to send their kids to school, \npeople's ability to buy a house, to meet a payroll, run a small \nbusiness. All that would have been at risk if the financial \ninstitutions of this country had been allowed to implode, which is \nexactly where we were back in September and October when the TARP was \npassed.\n  With those TARP dollars, those financial institutions are stabilized, \nand\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\nthey were stabilized by purchasing what is known as preferred stock in \nthem.\n  As part of the TARP, it was made very clear that the $700 billion \nthat was going to be spent to stabilize the financial institutions, or \npotentially spent--not all of it was spent--that those dollars, when \nthey came back--and we expected them to come back because it was an \ninvestment; it was not spending like a stimulus package where we \nessentially put money out the door and it never comes back; we were \nbuying assets, the preferred stock of these banks. When those moneys \ncame back to the Treasury, it was understood that those moneys would be \nused to reduce the deficit and the debt. That was the understanding \nthat was written in the bill. The moneys from TARP, as they came back \nin, would be used to reduce the debt.\n  We are now seeing the first group come in. Mr. President, $70 billion \nhas come back to the Treasury as a result of four or five major banks \npaying off the TARP moneys through repurchasing their preferred stock. \nInterestingly enough, the taxpayers made some money here. We made about \n$4.5 billion on that investment--a pretty good deal over 4 months to \nmake $4.5 billion. That money is also coming to the Treasury. Those \ndollars should be used to reduce the debt. That is what the whole idea \nwas: Buy assets, stabilize the financial industries, as the assets come \nback, pay down the debt that was run up in order to purchase those \nassets.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues in the other body have suggested \nthat we now start spending this money as it comes in on what happens to \nbe, I am sure, very worthwhile initiatives which they want to pursue in \nthe area of housing, in the case of one proposal. That would be the \ntotally wrong thing to do. These dollars have to be used to reduce the \ndebt, and by using them to reduce the debt, once again we will make it \nclear to Americans and to the international community that we are going \nto act in a fiscally prudent way, and we will have a very positive \nimpact on how much it costs us as a nation to borrow on the value of \nour dollars and on the amount of outstanding debt which we face as a \nnation, which is extraordinary, as I mentioned earlier.\n  It is totally inappropriate to spend this money on something other \nthan what the proposal originally was, which was to spend it to \nstabilize the financial institutions and then take the money we \nreceived--in this case, with interest--and use it to pay down the debt.\n  The administration understands this, and I respect the fact they made \nit very clear in a letter to me from Secretary Geithner--I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nSecretary Geithner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2009.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: Thank you for our recent conversation \n     on June 11. In addition to our discussion on deficit \n     reduction and the repayment of Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act (EESA) funds, I also wanted to formally \n     respond to your letter of April 23.\n       As you know, banks are indeed permitted to repay Treasury's \n     investments through the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). \n     Repaid funds will be deposited into the general fund for the \n     purpose of deficit reduction, as required by EESA. This \n     reduction in the total amount of outstanding assets frees up \n     headroom under EESA's $700 billion cap, providing additional \n     flexibility to Treasury in its efforts to stabilize the \n     economy and build the foundation for long-term economic \n     growth.\n       To date, 32 banks have repaid Treasury's investment for a \n     total of approximately $70.1 billion, including $68.3 billion \n     received on June 17, 2009, from ten of the largest banks that \n     participated in the stress test. With these repayments, we \n     have $127 billion remaining to support EESA's objectives. \n     Another important item to note is that to date the United \n     States Government's general fund has received $5.2 billion in \n     dividends.\n       These repayments and dividends are an encouraging sign of \n     financial repair, but we still have work to do in order to \n     mend our economy. We believe that it is critical that \n     Treasury maintain the full flexibility provided by EESA to \n     strengthen our financial system, promote the flow of credit, \n     and permit a rapid response to unforeseen economic threats.\n       As you know, I share your concerns about the fiscal \n     situation. I look forward to working with you to bring down \n     the deficit once we are confident that the economy is back on \n     track and we have successfully addressed the challenges to \n     our financial system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Secretary Geithner has made it very clear \nthat they understand this money should go to reduce the debt. They \nwould like to hold it sort of at the desk for a few months to make sure \nthey are not going to need it for another event of maybe severe fiscal \nstrain. But it is pretty obvious we are past that time and they \nprobably are not going to need it. So this money is coming back to the \nTreasury and will only be used to reduce the debt unless we, as a \nCongress, change the law.\n  I wished to come to the floor and say it would be a real failure of \nfiscal stewardship for us to use these dollars for anything other than \nwhat their purpose was, which was to reduce the debt.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to McCain amendment No. 1400. The yeas \nand nays were previously ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate just voted against the \nPresident of the United States--I think we should know that--and his \nrecommendation. The President, on May 7 of this year, as part of his \nbudget submission, recommended terminating or reducing 121 Federal \nprograms, which was estimated to save the taxpayers $41 billion over \nthe next decade. One of the programs the President hopes to see \nterminated is the Intercity Bus Security Grant Program.\n  What the Senate did was to tell the President of the United States: \nNo, we are sorry, this is a vital program, the Intercity Bus Security \nGrant Program. I am sure the folks in Maryland at Cavalier Coach \nTrailways that got $8,000 and Crystal Transport, Inc., that got \n$108,000--there is one in here that is a limousine service that got \nseveral thousand dollars, the Rimrock Stages got only $8,000. But \nBusco, Inc., doing business as Arrow Stage Lines, they\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\ngot $137,000 in Nebraska. Maybe they will take people to visit the \nlibrary that just got $200,000, those from outside of Omaha.\n  What we are talking about is that we cannot even eliminate a program, \nwith a decent number of Democratic votes, about which the President \ntold the American people: We will reduce spending, we will cut \nspending, don't worry; here are the 121 Federal programs. There are two \nmore that are coming, my friends, that you will be able to vote against \nthe President on because there are two more on his list that are \nincluded in this appropriations bill.\n  Anybody in the United States who thinks we got the message that it is \ntime to tighten our belts, including especially members of the \nAppropriations Committee on both sides of the aisle, they are sadly \nmistaken.\n  They are sadly mistaken. We are going to vote on all 27. We are going \nto be on record, and the American people are going to hear about it. \nThey are going to figure it out. It is business as usual. The \nporkbarrel spending continues even to the point where we cannot even \neliminate a program the President of the United States said we would \neliminate. There are 60 votes over there. We could not get 51.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1402 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to call up amendment No. 1402 to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1402 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require grants for Emergency Operations Centers and \n   financial assistance for the predisaster mitigation program to be \n                  awarded without regard to earmarks)\n\n       On page 32, strike line 19 and all that follows through \n     page 33, line 22, and insert the following:\n\n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5196c), which shall be awarded on a \n     competitive basis: Provided, That the Administrator of the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency shall award financial \n     assistance using amounts made available under the heading \n     ``national predisaster mitigation fund'' under the heading \n     ``Federal Emergency Management Agency'' under this title--\n       (A) in accordance with section 203 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5133); and\n       (B) without regard to any congressionally directed spending \n     item (as defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate) or any congressional earmark (as defined in rule XXI \n     of the Rules of the House of Representatives) in a committee \n     report or joint explanatory statement relating to this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This amendment would prohibit the earmarking of two \ncritically important homeland security grants: the Emergency Operations \nCenters and the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program.\n  The Emergency Operations Centers, or EOC program, is intended to \nimprove emergency management and preparedness capabilities, and it \nfunds, among other things, construction of State and local EOCs. These \ncenters are a vital part of the comprehensive national emergency \nmanagement plan.\n  The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program is intended to implement hazard \nreduction measures before disasters strike. Eligible projects can \ninclude, for example, preparing mitigation plans, or retrofitting \npublic buildings against hurricane-force winds, and constructing so-\ncalled ``safe rooms'' in tornado-prone areas.\n  While we may not all agree on the appropriateness of earmarking in \ngeneral, I certainly hope we can agree certain things should not be \nearmarked, including FEMA grant programs such as those that protect \nAmericans from terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n  Obviously, these funds should be awarded by an impartial entity that \nis expert in matters of emergency operations and disaster mitigation. \nIt is FEMA that actually possesses these qualities; Members of Congress \ndo not. Indeed, FEMA has informed me that many past earmarks would not \nhave even qualified for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program under the \nestablished guidelines. The result is that low-priority projects get \nfunded and high-risk areas do not have adequate resources they need so \npeople in those areas can truly be protected from natural disasters. I \nthink these funds are too important to be passed out based on political \ndealings.\n  The Association of State Floodplain Managers supports this amendment \nand notes that a key element of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program is \nthe encouragement of hazard mitigation planning. According to the \nAssociation:\n\n       Congressional earmarks, unfortunately, undercut the local \n     planning process when it became evident that process could be \n     short-circuited by getting a Congressional earmark.\n\n  This year, the House has earmarked all of its Emergency Operations \nCenters funds in its Homeland Security appropriations bill. The Senate \nhas earmarked nearly half of its funds. The earmarks in the Senate are \ndirected to 10 States. That means 40 States will have to compete for \nthe remaining half of these funds.\n  If my amendment fails, 10 States get half and the other 40 States \nonly get half combined. Many of these earmarks have historically gone \nto small communities while at the same time many State operations \ncenters in major cities still need assistance. So my amendment would \nstrike the earmarks in the text of the Senate bill so that FEMA can \ndecide which projects are homeland security priorities and Federal \nresponsibilities.\n  With regard to the Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds, the House report \nhas earmarked one-fourth of the funds, and the Senate has so far not \nearmarked any of them. However, last year both the House and the Senate \nearmarked roughly 27 percent of the funds in conference. So my \namendment directs FEMA to disregard any such earmarks in the \nexplanatory statement of managers. As the majority of us will not be \nmembers of the conference committee, I urge my colleagues to consider \nwhether it is in the best interests of your State to permit the \nearmarking of these critical homeland security funds outside of the \nregular legislative process.\n  The chairman and the ranking member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee introduced legislation last year to \nmandate that Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds be awarded competitively. I, \nof course, commend both of them for their leadership on this issue.\n  Given that a percentage of these funds are guaranteed for every State \nin light of the fact that all States are at risk of natural disasters, \nthere is even less reason for these funds to be earmarked.\n  President Obama has stated that he would like these funds to be \nawarded on the basis of risk. Federal law lays out the criteria for the \ncompetitive awarding of these grants and focuses on the need to fund \nthose projects that will mitigate the most high-risk areas.\n  Therefore, I think this amendment is consistent with the President's \nrequest that we focus on those communities that are in most need of \nassistance. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Not only will the amendment restore objectivity to two \nhomeland security grant programs, it will also help ensure important \ndecisions about Federal spending are actually made on the merits not on \nthe basis of political backroom deals.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\n                           Generic Biologics\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, for allowing me to go first. I appreciate his public service \nas he concludes his Senate career in the next year and a half.\n  This week Congress is debating whether to broaden access to \naffordable generic drugs for millions of Americans. Let me explain how \naccess to generic drugs--and generic drugs for pharmaceuticals--so-\ncalled chemical drugs are called generics, just to make this clear, for \nlive--what are called biologics they are called follow-on biologics. \nBut either is the same concept.\n  Let me explain how the access to generic, or follow-on biologics, \nwould benefit millions of Americans who cannot afford the crushing drug \ncosts they face, whether prescription drugs or biologics.\n  Sergio from Rocky River, a suburb west of Cleveland, wrote about how \nhe and his family lost their health insurance last year and are heavily \nburied with debt. His young son has type 1 diabetes, a terrible disease \nthat an increasing number of young people have. His wife has severe \nasthma, and Sergio had quadruple heart bypass surgery, along with \nsurgeries to repair a hernia and treatment for back and knee injuries, \nall within the last 3 years. Sergio and his family have cut back on the \nmedications they were taking and stopped going to the doctor because \nthey can't afford the $35,000 in outstanding medical bills, much of it \nin prescription drug costs. Sergio writes that his family walks on \neggshells each day hoping they don't get sick and slide further into \ndebt.\n  For far too long, Americans like Sergio have struggled with the \nexorbitant cost of prescription drugs. For far too long, soaring drug \ncosts have meant seniors were forced to choose between eating and \ntaking medicine. I have heard these stories for more than a decade, \nmost acutely when I traveled with seniors from Ohio to Canada to buy \naffordable prescription drugs. I was a Member of the House in those \ndays in the late 1990s. It was curious that an elected Federal official \nin one country would rent a bus and take 30 to 40 seniors 3 hours from \nLorraine up through Toledo, OH, into Detroit, then into Windsor, \nOntario, from one country to another to buy prescription drugs. Of \ncourse, I did that because these people were hurting. They didn't have \ndecent health care and couldn't get low-cost prescription drugs. So \nthey went to Canada where the prices were much, much cheaper, one-half \nto one-third the cost, the same drug, same manufacturer, same \npackaging, same dosage, but costing one-half or one-third as much.\n  As we move forward on health care reform, we have the opportunity to \nmake affordable generic drugs more accessible to seniors and to the \nNation's middle class. Health care reform must broaden access to \ngeneric alternatives to the most expensive kinds of prescription drugs \nknown as biologics. Biologics are different from the chemical \npharmaceuticals we are most used to that sell in much larger numbers \nthan the biologics based on living ingredients that are more expensive \nand--much more expensive to produce, originally, with the research but \nalso much more expensive for the person taking the biologics. Failing \nto come up with generic alternatives to these most expensive kinds of \nprescription drugs is not just bad policy, it is irresponsible on our \npart.\n  Countless Americans simply cannot afford these expensive brand-name \ndrugs. These drugs provide promise and hope to those suffering from \ndevastating diseases and chronic illness: cancer, Parkinson's, \ndiabetes, Alzheimer's, MS. For example, annual treatment for breast \ncancer in the 1990s was with a drug called Taxol which cost an \nexorbitant amount of money--$4,000 a year. Today, annual treatment for \nsome cancers--in this case, breast cancer--is with the biologic drug \nHerceptin, which costs $48,000 a year or $4,000 a month. Annual \ntreatment for rheumatoid arthritis with Remicade costs approximately \n$20,000 a year, almost $2,000 a month. These drugs are simply too \nexpensive for many people to afford.\n  Liz from Brecksville is a director of a breast cancer advocacy group \nin northern Ohio and wrote to me that many of her members and clients \nface impossible financial barriers after being diagnosed with breast \ncancer and needing treatment. Liz works with breast cancer patients who \nface excessive copays and deductibles for prescription drugs, often \nwith 10-year preexisting condition restrictions. That is why we must \nprovide broader access to generic drugs to help lower prescription drug \ncosts for millions of Americans.\n  This isn't a debate about policy between biologics and follow-on \nbiologics and prescription drugs and generics. That is interesting for \nthe textbooks and the economists. This is about the lives of people who \nsimply cannot afford $4,000 a month for a cancer drug, $1,500 a month \nfor a drug if they are dealing with rheumatoid arthritis.\n  Ensuring a pathway for generic drugs and breaking the monopoly \npharmaceutical companies have on brand-name drugs can make prescription \ndrugs affordable for Americans who need them. By setting a reasonable \nperiod of exclusivity for many brand-name drugs, we will speed up the \ngeneric approval process and speed up cost savings for families in \nToledo, Lima, Canton, Youngstown, and Cincinnati, OH.\n  It is estimated that biologics, those drugs that increasingly are \nused to help treat cancer and Parkinson's and diabetes and Alzheimer's \nand MS, will make up 50 percent of the pharmaceutical market by 2020. \nThese are becoming more and more common. Yet there is not even a \nprocess to establish generic drug alternatives. Therefore, there is no \nprice competition and the price for these biologics goes up and up and \nup. The prices go up and up and up, yet there is no competition and \nthey can keep charging outrageous prices. These prescriptions cost \nanywhere from $10,000 a year, almost a $1,000 a month; sometimes they \ncost as much as $200,000 a year, which is $16,000 or $17,000 a month.\n  We are not saying the prescription drug companies don't deserve a \nchance to recoup the $1.2 billion they spend on research and \ndevelopment. This chart is 1 year of sales with no competition from \ngenerics. It often means multiple billions of dollars in revenue. This \nwas compiled by the AARP. The drug Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis--\naverage cost to develop a new biotech product, $1.2 billion; annual \ntotal U.S. sales for top-selling biologic drug, $14.8 billion. Look at \nanother pretty common drug, Remicade, for rheumatoid arthritis. In this \ncase, this company spends a little more than $1.2 billion to develop \nthis product; $13 billion in sales. We can go down the list: Epogen for \nanemia, Procrit for anemia, Rituxan for rheumatoid arthritis, Humira \nfor rheumatoid arthritis, Avastin, Herceptin, Aranesp for anemia, \nNeulasta for neutropenia. On biologic after biologic, the average cost \nnot just to develop this biologic, the average cost to the company as a \nwhole for its successful biologics and its unsuccessful biologics, for \nthe amount of research they are putting forward averaging $1.2 billion, \nlook at their sales: 14.8, 13, almost 15, almost 14, almost 12, almost \n7, 8 billion, 5.5 billion, 11, almost 12 billion. These are costs for \nwhich consumers are paying $2,000 a month, $3,000 a month. They simply \ncan barely afford it in many cases and can't afford it at all in other \ncases. These are costs that employers have to pay, that taxpayers have \nto pay if they are in Medicaid.\n  It is pretty clear these are huge profits these companies are making. \nAnd I want more innovation. You bet I want to see these companies \nsucceed. But they don't need to make these kinds of profits at the \nexpense of taxpayers and small businesses that are paying the freight \nand larger businesses that are less competitive because they have to \npay such high costs for health care. That makes it harder for GM to \ncompete with Toyota and compete with overseas auto manufacturers, one \nafter another after another.\n  Sales in 2008 for the average biologic, not just the blockbusters, \ntotaled over $666 million. That means it takes less than 2 years for \nthe average brand-name biologic to recoup the R cost. Why are some of \nmy colleagues advocating for a 12-year monopoly period? They want to \ngive these companies that are recovering this kind of money this \nquickly each year, this kind of money with the kinds of sales they have \nhad, they want to give them 12 years to recoup this $1.5 billion. Many \nof them recoup it in the first year, let\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nalone the second, third, fourth, and fifth. Again, I want to have a \nhealthy profit, but I don't want to see price gouging aimed at small \nbusinesses and large companies that are less competitive as a result, \naimed at seniors and others who suffer from these diseases. Why a 12-\nyear monopoly period? Twelve years sounds good. If the industry gets 12 \nyears, they will laugh all the way to the bank. They will be exultant \nif they get 12 years.\n  The President says 12 years is too long. The President thinks it \nshould be 7. The Federal Trade Commission says it is too long. The \nFederal Trade Commission thinks giving them 12 years will actually \nreduce innovation because the drug companies won't even try to compete \nwith themselves and come up with new drugs. Nearly everyone--insurance \ncompanies, patients groups, consumer groups, and the AARP--has said \nthis is too long. All kinds of organized labor unions, because of their \nmembers, say it is too long. Most insurance companies say it is too \nlong. Patient groups, groups that advocate for people with diabetes, \nwith heart disease, groups that advocate for people with arthritis and \nMS and other deadly and crippling diseases--all say 12 years is too \nlong. Everyone says 12 years is too long except two groups: the drug \ncompanies and some House Members and Senators.\n  It is clear this is a fight between pharmaceutical companies looking \nto make lucrative profits and patients in need of prescription drugs.\n  I read yesterday in the Washington Post how the pharmaceutical \nindustry is spending well over $1 million every single day trying to \ninfluence the outcome of health care reform legislation. Over $1 \nmillion a day spent to prevent generic drugs--affordable medicine--from \nmaking their way to seniors in Zanesville and Bolero and Youngstown and \nVan Wert and Piqua and all over my State, from making their way to \npeople in middle-class families, to patients who can't afford brand-\nname drugs. We can't let special interests or political maneuvering \ndelay making affordable prescription drugs more available to millions \nof Americans.\n  We are on the cusp of fundamental reform of our health care system. \nLet's not blow it. Let's not pass this giveaway of billions and \nbillions of taxpayer dollars, individual dollars out of people's \npockets, dollars raided from small businesses and large corporations \nalike.\n  We should not let that stand in the way. We are on the cusp of \nmeaningful, fundamental reform. We must ensure access to generic drugs \nthat will reduce costs, that will improve quality of care for millions, \nthat will mean more innovation and more miracle drugs. This is part of \nour historical moment. We need to do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, it is time for Congress to join forces \nand unite in a bipartisan way to help the President deal with the \nunbelievable challenges he has domestically and internationally. One \neasy way to help our Nation is by passing our appropriations bills by \nSeptember 30. Our getting it done this year is urgent because of the \nstate of our economy and the impact Federal spending has on that \neconomy. Our reliance on continuing resolutions to fund the Federal \nGovernment continues to plague Congress and has a cascading effect on \ngovernment agencies and the citizens they serve.\n  In recent decades, it has become common for appropriations bills to \nbe enacted after the start of the fiscal year, during the last quarter \nof the calendar year, or even in the next session of Congress, as was \nthe case this year. Repeatedly managing by continuing resolution is \ninefficient. It results in wasteful spending, disruption and chaos in \nthe operations of Federal programs, and dramatic productivity \nslowdowns. This is not a good record for either party and is an \nirresponsible approach to managing our limited resources. It has to \nstop.\n  Last year, because the Senate did not do its job, agencies were \nrushed to spend their budgets before the end of the fiscal year and \nused overtime to ensure requests were processed before midnight on \nSeptember 30, making it ripe for overspending as agencies stockpiled to \ntry to meet future needs. This also means fewer dollars being returned \nto the Treasury to help reduce our growing budget deficit.\n  We need to get back to basics to solve it. This is one problem the \nCongress can solve, and we need to do it this year. Congress may hold \nthe power of the purse, but we undermine our credibility by starving \ngood managers and agencies of necessary resources and by turning a \nblind eye to failing programs. This is about more than allocating \nfunds. It is about good management and good public policy. I can assure \nyou, as a county commissioner, mayor, and Governor, if the \nappropriations were not done on time we would have been run out of town \nfor not doing our job.\n\n  Inaction causes chaos in the operations of our Federal Government. \nContinuing resolutions do exactly what their name implies: they \ncontinue funding at prior year levels, without regard to whether \nchanges in funding are necessary or appropriate. As a result, agency \nprogram managers are now in the untenable position of having to manage \non the prior year's budget, which often results in a loss of \nproductivity and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Imagine if these same \nprogram managers could spend their time instead on our current economic \nsituation, ensuring that the stimulus funds are being spent wisely and \nappropriately.\n  Programs which cannot justify the level of funding they used to have, \nand ought to be cut, will continue to get the level of funding they \nwere getting. Likewise, programs for which increased need has been \ndemonstrated, and which therefore should get increased funding, will \ncontinue to be funded at the prior year's level, leaving the increased \nneed unaddressed.\n  Since 1990, the Government Accountability Office has issued its \nbiennial high-risk report, which examines the challenges faced by \nFederal programs and operations and recommends ways to improve their \nperformance and accountability. Many of the programs on the GAO high-\nrisk list are dysfunctional and fail to deliver the intended services \nto the taxpayer. In other instances, the Federal Government is wasting \ntaxpayer dollars that could be better used for higher priority programs \nor cutting the deficit.\n  Imagine if we were able to dedicate 1 week--or even 1 day--per month \nas a body debating solutions to the challenges identified by GAO \ninstead of debating whether and when to proceed on appropriations bills \nor throwing together a continuing resolution to ensure we avoid the \nembarrassment of a government shutdown.\n  This is not a case of benign neglect. We have become overly reliant \non past practice and refuse to make the end-to-end budget process a \npriority. Continuing appropriations acts have become commonplace and, \nunfortunately, fully integrated into the process. The end result is \nfunding uncertainty--not because the money is not there but because \nCongress cannot join in a bipartisan manner and hammer out an agreement \non how money should be spent. No business would manage its affairs in \nthis manner, and neither should the Federal Government. As I said, the \nFederal Government is the only level of government that gets away with \nit.\n  I think few in the Senate recognize the adverse impact continuing \nresolutions have on agencies where budgets rely heavily on personnel. \nHiring freezes, cuts in training budgets have lasting effects. It is \nirresponsible for us not to provide appropriations on time to those we \nhave asked to provide services to the American people and give them \ngigantic excuses to not perform.\n  Our inaction also has an impact on program management. Federal public \nservants spend countless hours preparing detailed budget justifications \nfor our review. We reward their hard work by asking them to spend their \ntime figuring out how to manage under last year's budget. Imagine if \nthese people could spend their time managing programs instead of \nfiguring out how to operate under a continuing resolution, including \ncompletion of reprogramming requests.\n  Managing by continuing resolution has the effect of delaying \nconstruction,\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nreducing overall efficiency, wasting time and paper resources, and \ndisallowing any new starts in procurement. Fortune 100 companies do not \nwalk away from difficult budget choices by taking a pass to the next \nfiscal year. Neither does Main Street USA. Regardless of whether you \nsubscribe to the belief that CRs save money, this is no way to run an \norganization. It is part of our obligation to the American people to \nensure our scarce resources are given to projects that produce results.\n  I want to share a few examples of the true impact of continuing \nresolutions, taken from a memo prepared by the Congressional Research \nService and hearings before the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Let's take the Department of Education. The Impact Aid Program is an \nelementary and secondary education program that does not receive \nforward funding or advance appropriations and, therefore, is more \neasily affected by an interim continuing resolution. Payments for \nchildren with disabilities are delayed when the Department of Education \nis operating under a continuing resolution.\n  USAID: The delay of funding of the President's Malaria Initiative, \nwhich was enacted in order to reduce deaths due to malaria by 50 \npercent, lasted until February 15, 2007, 5 months or 138 days into \nfiscal year 2007. Doing the math, this delay in funding relates to the \nloss of, say, 198,000 lives unnecessarily. In other words, by delaying \nit, the money was not there. We did not get the job done, and this \nresulted in the deaths of individuals.\n  NASA: On June 8, 2009, the Federal Times reported the following from \nNASA Administrator Michael Griffin:\n\n       Any time Congress passes a continuing resolution that holds \n     agencies to their current spending levels at a time when the \n     economy is experiencing inflation translates into a budget \n     cut. And so we will be cutting the budget at NASA and the \n     only question is how much. . . . And then the second \n     question, after how much is decided, is will the continuing \n     resolution be broadly applied and left to the discretion of \n     agency heads to implement or will special programs be \n     targeted to be either favored or disfavored.\n\n  FEMA: In fiscal year 2008, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, \nwhich ``provides emergency food and shelter to needy individuals,'' did \nnot receive funds under the CR. Thus, the program did not have funds \navailable for communities and their respective homeless provider \nagencies during what many view as critical winter months until February \n26, 2008, or 149 days into fiscal year 2008.\n  The judiciary: The judiciary has had to resort to hiring freezes or \nfurloughing employees under continuing resolutions. In fiscal year \n2004, the judiciary reduced 1,350 positions, with probation and \npretrial services receiving significant cuts.\n  HUD: During fiscal year--I am just giving you examples that have been \npointed out by CRS. During fiscal year 2004, the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development had to temporarily suspend the General Insurance \nand Special Risk Insurance Fund of the Federal Housing Administration \nbecause the continuing resolution did not provide a sufficient credit \nsubsidy to continue with the programs. During the suspension, HUD was \nunable to meet the needs of the borrowers who would ordinarily be \nserved by the respective programs, which created uncertainty among the \nlenders and potential borrowers. Mr. President, I think most of us have \nseen what happens when we have uncertainty in our mortgage system.\n  The Treasury Department: Continuing resolutions in fiscal year 2007 \nand fiscal year 2008 limited and delayed the IRS's ability to implement \nimprovements in the taxpayer service. Also, these continuing \nresolutions prevented the agency from making job offers to highly \nqualified candidates until enactment of a full year's appropriation.\n  Just jerk them around.\n  Research and development: Most research and development programs \ncontinue to receive funding at the prior year's level when operating \nunder a continuing resolution. However, this funding mechanism can only \nsupport existing R priorities rather than shifting to new ones \nbecause only existing programs retain funding. New and emerging \ntechnologies must be funded in real time.\n  The Social Security Administration: Operating under a continuing \nresolution for fiscal year 2010 will hamper efforts to reduce backlogs \nin the agency's disability program, which would result in decreased \nefficiency. Also, in previous years continuing resolutions caused the \nagency to implement a hiring freeze that contributed to service \ndelivery problems. While Commissioner Astrue has gone to great lengths \nto send additional resources, for example, to my home State, Ohio still \nhas people waiting more than 500 days for a decision on their Social \nSecurity disability claim.\n  I was very critical of SSA. I started looking back on the continuing \nresolutions that were passed. It was a chaotic situation. They were not \nable to keep the people they had. They were not able to hire more \npeople, and we have a 500-day wait now. I am sure the Presiding Officer \ngets the same complaints from his people that they cannot get their \ndisability appeals heard.\n  DHS: In testimony before the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on \nManagement, the Department of Homeland Security's Deputy Procurement \nOfficer, Richard Gunderson, spoke to the impact continuing resolutions \nhave on the key homeland security programs. Gunderson testified:\n\n       A CR would stop those programs in their tracks and we would \n     not be able to grow the way that everybody is saying that we \n     need to grow.\n\n  Mr. President, there are a lot more examples of what I am talking \nabout. I think this has to be the year we do our job. The Senator from \nNevada, our leader, and the Senator from Kentucky, our minority leader, \nhave both publicly stated that we need to do our job on time. As I \nmentioned earlier, the need for it is more urgent than ever before.\n  If I were the President of the United States today, I would probably \nlook at what the Congress is doing, and I think I would say: One of the \ngreatest gifts you can give me, one of the greatest gifts you can give \nour country, is to do your work on time so we do not have this chaotic \nsituation we have had for so many years.\n  None of our hands are clean. None of our hands are clean. I have been \nhere when we have deliberately not passed appropriations with the idea \nthat maybe our guy is going to get elected President or we are going to \nget the majority in the Senate or the Congress and so then we can tweak \nit the way we want to because a majority is no longer in the majority.\n  This game has been played for too long around here, and it is about \ntime we recognized it and did something about it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, I have spoken many times on the \nfloor of the Senate about the desperate need for reform of our broken \nhealth care system. Today the Congress stands at a moment of historic \nopportunity. The attention, hopes, and anxieties of the American people \nare focused on us like never before.\n  We have seen over the course of the last 60 years constant lament \nover the\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nsystem's flaws and failure--failure when true opportunities for reform \narise. President Obama has now challenged this Congress to reform our \nNation's health care system, to expand access to insurance, to improve \nbelow-average results, and to bring down its costs. It is about this \nlast challenge--the challenge of our unimaginable and grotesque health \ncare costs--that I speak today.\n\n  In his recent speech to the AMA, the President called escalating \nhealth care costs ``a threat to our economy . . . an escalating burden \non our families and businesses . . . a ticking time-bomb for the \nfederal budget, and . . . unsustainable for the United States of \nAmerica.''\n  I hope all of us share his sense of urgency. Our country's economic \nfuture may well depend on it.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have been privileged to work with my HELP \nCommittee colleagues to make long-awaited reforms and investments to \ncontrol costs and wring savings from the system. In that process, much \nattention has been paid to the Congressional Budget Office's cost and \nsavings estimates--estimates that, in many cases, have significant \nlimitations.\n  CBO, as we know, plays a vital role in our legislative branch by \nensuring that we have objective, nonpartisan estimates of the likely \ncosts and savings to the Federal budget of legislation. These estimates \ncan help us make responsible and efficient use of the taxpayers' money, \nbut we must recognize that in the particular context of health care \nreform, they are fundamentally limited by CBO's professional \nrestrictions.\n  CBO can only estimate health care costs and savings that have \nhistoric precedent. For example, since we have the experience of \nMedicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, CBO can estimate \nhow much expanding coverage to all needy families will cost. These \nsubsidies account for the vast majority of CBO's $600 billion estimate \nof the 10-year cost of the HELP Committee bill.\n  On the cost savings side, however, CBO's capability is limited. We \nknow our health care system is on an unsustainable course, and there is \nbroad agreement on which of the broken pieces need fixing, but it is \nimpossible to estimate cost savings with the degree of certainty CBO \nrequires to provide what we call a score.\n  CBO's Director has been refreshingly candid about this. In a recent \nletter to our budget chairman, Senator Conrad, he writes the following:\n\n       Changes in government policy have the potential to yield \n     large reductions in both national health expenditures and \n     Federal health care spending without harming health.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Moreover, many experts agree on some general directions in \n     which the government's health policies should move, typically \n     involving changes in the information and incentives that \n     doctors and patients have when making decisions about health \n     care. Yet many of the specific changes that might ultimately \n     prove most important cannot be foreseen today and could be \n     developed only over time through experimentation and \n     learning.\n\n  CBO's professional discipline requires it to score legislation \nthrough a rearview mirror, looking back, and basing its calculations on \nwhat it can chronicle has happened in the past. But when we propose to \ntake the country in a new direction, when there is a turn in the road, \nwhen we seek to fulfill President Obama's promise of true change in \nAmerica, the rearview mirror doesn't help much. We have not been where \nwe need to go.\n  In addition, getting there will require leadership, creativity, and \nperseverance. It will require executive administration with constant \nadjustments and improvements as we work toward our goal. Those factors \nare beyond the capability of CBO to predict.\n  I speak not to criticize the hard-working public servants of the \nCongressional Budget Office. They do an exemplary job with the tools at \ntheir disposal. Americans owe them a particular debt of gratitude now \nfor how incredibly hard they have worked over these past weeks, but \ntheir tools come with their own limitations. The point of this reform \nis to turn around a system that is spiraling out of control. We spent \n18 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, the next \nhighest spending Nation in the world--the next worst is Switzerland, at \n11 percent. Even if our success in this reform is limited to shaving a \nfew percentage points off our national expenditure on health care, that \nchange will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Yes, there \nwill need to be an initial investment in health care reform, but the \npotential savings are multiples larger. CBO's inability to score those \nsavings does not mean that those savings are not both real and \nsubstantial.\n  One measure of the potential savings is the recent report of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, June 2009. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the executive summary of this document be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                The Economic Case For Health Care Reform\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has undertaken a \n     comprehensive analysis of the economic impacts of health care \n     reform. The report provides an overview of current economic \n     impacts of health care in the United States and a forecast of \n     where we are headed in the absence of reform; an analysis of \n     inefficiencies and market failures in the current health care \n     system; a discussion of the key components of health care \n     reform; and an analysis of the economic effects of slowing \n     health care cost growth and expanding coverage.\n       The findings in the report point to large economic impacts \n     of genuine health care reform:\n       We estimate that slowing the annual growth rate of health \n     care costs by 1.5 percentage points would increase real gross \n     domestic product (GDP), relative to the no-reform baseline, \n     by over 2 percent in 2020 and nearly 8 percent in 2030.\n       For a typical family of four, this implies that income in \n     2020 would be approximately $2,600 higher than it would have \n     been without reform (in 2009 dollars), and that in 2030 it \n     would be almost $10,000 higher. Under more conservative \n     estimates of the reduction in the growth rate of health care \n     costs, the income gains are smaller, but still substantial.\n       Slowing the growth rate of health care costs will prevent \n     disastrous increases in the Federal budget deficit.\n       Slowing cost growth would lower the unemployment rate \n     consistent with steady inflation by approximately one-quarter \n     of a percentage point for a number of years. The beneficial \n     impact on employment in the short and medium run (relative to \n     the no-reform baseline) is estimated to be approximately \n     500,000 each year that the effect is felt.\n       Expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured would \n     increase net economic well-being by roughly $100 billion a \n     year, which is roughly two-thirds of a percent of GDP.\n       Reform would likely increase labor supply, remove \n     unnecessary barriers to job mobility, and help to ``level the \n     playing field'' between large and small businesses.\n\n\n                  WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE HEADED\n\n       Health care expenditures in the United States are currently \n     about 18 percent of GDP, and this share is projected to rise \n     sharply. If health care costs continue to grow at historical \n     rates, the share of GDP devoted to health care in the United \n     States is projected to reach 34 percent by 2040. For \n     households with employer-sponsored health insurance, this \n     trend implies that a progressively smaller fraction of their \n     total compensation will be in the form of take-home pay and a \n     progressively larger fraction will take the form of employer-\n     provided health insurance.\n       The rising share of health expenditures also has dire \n     implications for government budgets. Almost half of current \n     health care spending is covered by Federal, state, and local \n     governments. If health care costs continue to grow at \n     historical rates, Medicare and Medicaid spending (both \n     Federal and state) will rise to nearly 15 percent of GDP in \n     2040. Of this increase, roughly one-quarter is estimated to \n     be due to the aging of the population and other demographic \n     effects, and three-quarters is due to rising health care \n     costs.\n       Perhaps the most visible sign of the need for health care \n     reform is the 46 million Americans currently without health \n     insurance. CEA projections suggest that this number will rise \n     to about 72 million in 2040 in the absence of reform. A key \n     factor driving this trend is the tendency of small firms not \n     to provide coverage due to the rising cost of health care.\n\n\n  INEFFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND KEY ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL \n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n       While the American health care system has many virtues, it \n     is also plagued by substantial inefficiencies and market \n     failures. Some of the strongest evidence of such \n     inefficiencies comes from the tremendous variation across \n     states in Medicare spending per enrollee, with no evidence of \n     corresponding variations in either medical needs or outcomes. \n     These large variations in spending suggest that up to 30 \n     percent of health care costs (or about 5 percent of GDP) \n     could be saved without compromising health outcomes. \n     Likewise, the differences in health\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\n     care expenditures as a share of GDP across countries, without \n     corresponding differences in outcomes, also suggest that \n     health care expenditures in the United States could be \n     lowered by about 5 percent of GDP by reducing inefficiency in \n     the current system.\n       The sources of inefficiency in the U.S. health care system \n     include payment systems that reward medical inputs rather \n     than outcomes, high administrative costs, and inadequate \n     focus on disease prevention. Market imperfections in the \n     health insurance market create incentives for socially \n     inefficient levels of coverage. For example, asymmetric \n     information causes adverse selection in the insurance market, \n     making it difficult for healthy people to receive actuarially \n     reasonable rates.\n       CEA's findings on the state of the current system lead to a \n     natural focus on two key components of successful health care \n     reform: (1) a genuine containment of the growth rate of \n     health care costs, and (2) the expansion of insurance \n     coverage. Because slowing the growth rate of health care \n     costs is a complex and difficult process, we describe it in \n     general terms and give specific examples of the types of \n     reforms that could help to accomplish the necessary outcomes.\n\n\n         THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SLOWING HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH\n\n       The central finding of this report is that genuine health \n     care reform has substantial benefits. CEA estimates that \n     slowing the growth of health care costs would have the \n     following key effects:\n       1. It would raise standards of living by improving \n     efficiency. Slowing the growth rate of health care costs by \n     increasing efficiency raises standards of living by freeing \n     up resources that can be used to produce other desired goods \n     and services. The effects are roughly proportional to the \n     degree of cost containment.\n       2. It would prevent disastrous budgetary consequences and \n     raise national saving. Because the Federal government pays \n     for a large fraction of health care, lowering the growth rate \n     of health care costs causes the budget deficit to be much \n     lower than it otherwise would have been (assuming that the \n     savings are dedicated to deficit reduction). The resulting \n     rise in national saving increases capital formation.\n       Together, these effects suggest that properly measured GDP \n     could be more than 2 percent higher in 2020 than it would \n     have been without reform and almost 8 percent higher in 2030. \n     The real income of the typical family of four could be $2,600 \n     higher in 2020 than it otherwise would have been and $10,000 \n     higher in 2030. And, the government budget deficit could be \n     reduced by 3 percent of GDP relative to the no-reform \n     baseline in 2030.\n       3. It would lower unemployment and raise employment in the \n     short and medium runs. When health care costs are rising more \n     slowly, the economy can operate at a lower level of \n     unemployment without triggering inflation. Our estimates \n     suggest that the unemployment rate may be lower by about one-\n     quarter of a percentage point for an extended period of time \n     as a result of serious cost growth containment.\n\n\n               THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF EXPANDING COVERAGE\n\n       The report identifies three important impacts of expanding \n     health care coverage:\n       1. It would increase the economic well-being of the \n     uninsured by substantially more than the costs of insuring \n     them. A comparison of the total benefits of coverage to the \n     uninsured, including such benefits as longer life expectancy \n     and reduced financial risk, and the total costs of insuring \n     them (including both the public and private costs), suggests \n     net gains in economic well-being of about two-thirds of a \n     percent of GDP per year.\n       2. It would likely increase labor supply. Increased \n     insurance coverage and, hence, improved health care, is \n     likely to increase labor supply by reducing disability and \n     absenteeism in the work place. This increase in labor supply \n     would tend to increase GDP and reduce the budget deficit.\n       3. It would improve the functioning of the labor market. \n     Coverage expansion that eliminates restrictions on pre-\n     existing conditions improves the efficiency of labor markets \n     by removing an important limitation on job-switching. \n     Creating a well-functioning insurance market also prevents an \n     inefficient allocation of labor away from small firms by \n     leveling the playing field among firms of all sizes in \n     competing for talented workers in the labor market.\n       The CEA report makes clear that the total benefits of \n     health care reform could be very large if the reform includes \n     a substantial reduction in the growth rate of health care \n     costs. This level of reduction will require hard choices and \n     the cooperation of policymakers, providers, insurers, and the \n     public. While there is no guarantee that the policy process \n     will generate this degree of change, the benefits of \n     achieving successful reform would be substantial to American \n     households, businesses, and the economy as a whole.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. This report compares the share of America's gross \ndomestic product spent on health care to the share spent by our \ninternational industrialized competitors. It also looks to the wide \nvariation in health care expense and quality, region to region, within \nthe United States of America. From each of these measures, the report \ncomes to the same conclusion: They estimate excess health care \nexpenditures of about 5 percent of GDP, which translates to $700 \nbillion per year. Former Treasury Secretary O'Neill has written \nrecently that the target is $1 trillion per year. Whether $700 billion \nor $1 trillion, that is a savings target that is worth an enormous \nexpenditure of executive and legislative effort to achieve, \nparticularly when all the evidence suggests that achieving it will \nactually improve health care outcomes for the American people.\n  Perfect examples of the savings that await us are in quality of care. \nI have spoken before about the Keystone Project up in Michigan which \nreformed care in a significant number of Michigan's intensive care \nunits. It reduced infections, respiratory complications, and other \nmedical errors. Between March 2004 and June 2005, just a little over a \nyear, the project is documented to have saved 1,578 lives, 81,020 days \npatients otherwise would have spent in the hospital, and over 165 \nmillion health care dollars--just in a little over a year, just in \nintensive care units, just in one State, and not even all of the \nintensive care units in that State.\n  In my home State, the Rhode Island Quality Institute has taken this \nmodel statewide with every hospital participating, and we are already \nseeing hospital-acquired infections and costs declining.\n  Why aren't these quality reforms happening spontaneously all over the \ncountry? Because government and private insurers haven't set up the \nright rules for the game. When we began our intensive care unit reform \nin Rhode Island, the Hospital Association of Rhode Island estimated a \n$400,000 cost for a potential $8 million savings from the ICU reform \nprogram. That is a 20-to-1 return on investment. Super deal, right? Who \nwouldn't take that? Well, the hospitals pointed out that all the \nsavings--the $8 million--went to the payers--to Medicare, to the \ninsurance companies--and all the costs and all the trouble and all the \nrisk came out of their own pockets. The savings actually cut hospital \nrevenues. So with a lot of business experience around this Chamber, do \nwe know a lot of businesses that would spend $400,000 in cash in order \nto lose $8 million in revenues? That is not a good economic \nproposition. We have made the rules such that it is not a good economic \nproposition for hospitals to invest that way.\n  That is why the HELP Committee bill changes payment incentives and \ninvests in grant programs so it begins to make economic sense for \ndoctors and hospitals to invest in lifesaving and cost-saving quality \nimprovements. If we can make it an economic win for providers to \nimprove quality this way, think of the torrent of American ingenuity \nthat will unleash. Now we are stuck. We are stuck in a bog of market \nfailure, with the connection between risk and reward--the fundamental \nconnection between risk and reward that is the basic engine of American \ncapitalism--interrupted and disabled. But CBO can't score that \ninnovation because we haven't been down this road before. There is \nnothing in the rearview mirror for CBO professionals to work with to \ndetermine what those savings will be.\n  There is a similar problem in disease prevention. A study by the \nTrust for America's Health found that investing $10 per person per year \nin proven community-based programs to increase physical activity, \nimprove nutrition, and prevent tobacco use could save the country more \nthan $16 billion annually within 5 years. Out of the $16 billion in \nsavings, Medicare could save more than $5 billion, Medicaid could save \nmore than $1.9 billion, and private payers could save more than $9 \nbillion, but those program providers don't get funded. That is why the \nHELP Committee bill establishes a prevention and public health \ninvestment fund to provide expanded and sustained nationwide investment \nin preventing illness. Well run, the savings could be enormous. But CBO \ncan't score it because we haven't been down this road before, and there \nis nothing in the rearview mirror for CBO professionals to work with.\n  A third area for significant efficiencies and savings is the \ncontentious, inefficient billing and approval process.\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nRight now, doctors and insurance companies are locked in an arms race. \nPrivate insurers delay claims and deny claims for reimbursement and \nthrow up barriers to payment, and the providers, in turn, staff up and \nhire consultants and add people to fight back. This battle creates a \ncolossal burden on the system, consuming perhaps 10 to 15 percent of \nall private insurance expenditure and then creating a reciprocal and \nprobably actually greater cost shadow out in the provider community \nfrom having to fight back against that 10- to 15-percent expenditure. \nIt all adds no overall health care value--none. It is pure \nadministrative cost shifting. Even the insurance industry estimates \nthat $30 billion per year could be saved through simplification of that \nprocess. That is why the HELP Committee bill has strong administrative \nsimplification requirements. But again, CBO can't score it because this \nis another new road. Again, there is nothing in the rearview mirror for \nCBO to work with.\n\n  Finally, multiple studies show that the private insurance market is \nplagued by inefficiency and waste. While administrative costs for \nMedicare run about 3 to 5 percent, overhead for private insurers is an \nastounding 20 to 27 percent--charges that consumers pay for higher \npremiums. A Commonwealth Fund report indicates that private insurer \nadministrative costs increased 109 percent--they more than doubled--\nprivate insurer administrative costs more than doubled from 2000 to \n2006, just in 6 years. The McKinsey Global Institute and a leading \nhealth economist indicate that Americans spend roughly $128 billion \nannually on ``excess administrative overhead''--that is, $128 billion \non excess administrative overhead--in the private health insurance \nmarket.\n  That is why the HELP Committee bill establishes a strong nonprofit \npublic health insurance option that would compete on even terms with \nprivate insurance companies, bringing down premiums, negotiating more \nefficient provider payments, and increasing consumer access--all \nthrough the power of free market competition. All this is done through \nthe power of free market competition. But, again, CBO cannot score it \nbecause we have not been down that road before. There is, again, \nnothing in the rearview mirror for CBO professionals to work with.\n  In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's proposal for an innovative \nprogram called the Tennessee Valley Authority faced this dour \nprediction from a Member of the House of Representatives:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, I think I can accurately predict no one in \n     this generation will see materialize the industrial empire \n     dream of the Tennessee Valley.\n\n  Another Member remarked:\n\n       The development of power in that particular locality of the \n     Nation . . . can be of no general good.''\n\n  Had FDR been cowed and discouraged by such pessimism, by the \ndifficulty and uncertainty and novelty of his task, the TVA would never \nhave brought electricity, jobs, and prosperity to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Likewise, today, it is precisely because our reforms are innovative \nand because they will take energy, commitment, and leadership to \nachieve that they are unscorable. That should be an inspiration to us, \nnot a discouragement. Through this reform bill, we must challenge \nourselves and the Obama administration to do that which economists and \ncommentators cannot specifically score and analyze. With strong \nleadership and dedication, we can not only bend the cost curve, we can \nbreak it.\n  Let's set a hard target, say, $500 billion in annual savings, and see \nhow fast we can get there. Let's make this the Apollo project of our \ngeneration. The stakes are high enough to justify that effort.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes in morning business and that Senator Sessions be \nrecognized when I have finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, most everybody knows I am an \northopedic surgeon. In Wyoming, many refer to me as ``Wyoming's \ndoctor.'' That is because for over two decades folks have invited me \ninto their home with statewide television and radio health reports, \nwhere I gave people information on how they can stay healthy and how to \nkeep down the cost of their medical care. I ended each report by \nsaying: ``Here in Wyoming, I'm Dr. John Barrasso, helping you care for \nyourself.''\n  That is also my philosophy for government--helping people help \nthemselves. As medical director of the Wyoming Health Fairs, I worked \nto give people around the Cowboy State access to lifesaving preventive \ntests and low-cost medical screenings.\n  My goal was always to encourage families to eat right, exercise, \nmanage chronic diseases, and stop smoking because prevention is one of \nthe keys to a long and happy and healthy life.\n  As I travel home every weekend, I hear the concerns people have about \nhealth care and the cost of their medical care. They are concerned \nabout the specific cost of their medical care and how it affects them \nand their family budgets. Many families across Wyoming and in this \ncountry worry that they will lose the health care coverage they \ncurrently have. Others cannot afford insurance today. That is what is \nwrong with our current health care system. That is what we need to fix.\n  I know from firsthand experience that doing nothing is simply not an \noption. We must be careful, thoughtful, and deliberate about the \nchanges we make. Health care is a very complex and an intensely \npersonal issue. It deserves a national debate--a serious, open, and \ntransparent national debate.\n  I welcome the opportunity to talk about the concerns of people living \nlonger and needing more care and more advanced care. The concerns are \naffordable care, access to care, and high-quality care.\n  In the midst of this debate, we cannot stand for rural Americans to \nbe left behind. They need access to high-quality, affordable health \ncare like everybody else.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I promised the people of Wyoming I \nwould fight each and every day to protect and modernize our rural \nhealth care delivery system. I committed to do my part to strengthen \nour rural hospitals, rural health clinics, and community health \ncenters. I committed to do my part to increase rural America's access \nto primary health care services and to aid in the successful \nrecruitment and retention of nurses, nurse practitioners, doctors, and \nphysician assistants all across rural and frontier America.\n  There are obstacles faced by our hospitals, clinics, and our \nproviders--obstacles they have to overcome to deliver quality care to \nall the families in rural America. They end up having to do it in an \nenvironment of markedly limited resources. The Federal Government needs \nto recognize these important differences and then respond with \nappropriate policy.\n  The people of Wyoming know I am here not just as their Senator but \nalso as a rural doctor who has practiced medicine, fighting on their \nbehalf.\n  Recently, I joined three of my colleagues to introduce S. 1157, the \nCraig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act.\n  Today, I rise to talk about a different bill that I have introduced \nalongside my colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden. It is called the \nRural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act.\n  This legislation is a great example of what true bipartisanship can \nproduce. I thank Senator Wyden and his staff for working so hard to \ncollaborate with me on this very important bill. I commend him for his \ndedication to helping rural Americans have equal access to the high-\nquality medical care they deserve.\n  This legislation strengthens America's 3,500 rural health clinics \nthat serve rural and frontier communities.\n  Rural health clinics are a highly valued medical provider in \ncommunities all across this country. In Wyoming, we have rural health \nclinics located in communities that many people have never heard of, \nsuch as Baggs, Glenrock, Hulett, Lovell, Medicine Bow, Saratoga, and my \nwife Bobbie's hometown of Thermopolis. These clinics make sure people \nhave access to primary care as close to home as possible. That is not \neasy to.\n  To give you a snapshot of Wyoming's health care landscape, we have \nonly 26\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\nhospitals and 18 rural health clinics spread over nearly 100,000 square \nmiles, which is a remarkably large distance. With vast distances, \ncomplex medical cases, and increased demand for technologically \nadvanced medical care, the rural health care system is certainly not \none size fits all.\n\n  Let me explain what this Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and \nImprovement Act actually does.\n  First, the rural health clinics currently receive an all-inclusive \npayment rate that is capped at $76. That payment has not been \nadjusted--except for inflation--since 1988. We all know that medical \ninflation has gone up at a much greater rate than regular inflation.\n  This bill addresses this problem by raising the rural health clinic \ncap from $76 to $92. Rural health clinics are a key component of the \nrural health care delivery system, and we need to make sure there is \nfair pay for patients who are taken care of in those facilities.\n  We also need to give them enough flexibility to meet their \ncommunity's health care needs.\n  Additionally, this measure would establish a new quality reporting \nprogram for rural health clinics.\n  Three years ago, Congress required the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid to create a physician quality reporting system. This program \noffers bonus payments to doctors who report quality measures on \nMedicare services.\n  The quality incentive program is linked to the Medicare physician fee \nschedule. Rural health clinics, though, are not paid using the \nphysician fee schedule. If Congress wants to pay doctors based not on \nvolume but on the quality of care, then it is important to remember \nthat the one-size-fits-all approach will not work here.\n  That is why this bill ensures that a comparable quality incentive is \navailable to rural health care providers.\n  Third, the Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act \nwould create a provider retention demonstration project. It is a five-\nState project that will study the extent to which a medical \nprofessional can be encouraged and enticed to practice in an \nunderserved rural and frontier area.\n  The States would be given grants to help physicians, physician \nassistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives to help \nthem pay a small portion of their medical liability costs.\n  I believe these incentives will help draw more providers--especially \nthose who deliver babies--to work in an underserved area because their \nmalpractice insurance is the same whether they deliver 1 baby or 100. \nIn these small areas, there aren't that many babies being born each \nyear, so the cost, while it is the same for malpractice insurance, has \nto be distributed over a fewer number of patients. This will encourage \nthem to practice in underserved areas.\n  Wyoming has too few primary care providers for the population we must \nserve. My State is not alone. This bill that Senator Wyden and I have \nintroduced reflects our commitment to ensure rural Americans have \naccess to high-quality health care services.\n  I strongly encourage all my colleagues with an interest in rural \nhealth to cosponsor this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7186-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7186-S7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I offered an amendment to the Homeland \nSecurity legislation that is before us which would make that system \npermanent, and make its use mandatory for contractors that do business \nwith the U.S. Government.\n  Essentially, employers all over America are accessing the E-Verify \nonline system that allows them to have an instant check to determine \nwhether the person who has applied for employment with them is legally \nin the country. They simply check their Social Security number and \nother data against the Social Security Administration and Department of \nHomeland Security databases. When the system determines a person is not \nhere legally, employers don't hire them. Over 96 percent of the people \nare cleared automatically when a business checks. Of the remaining 3.9 \npercent of queries with an initial mismatch, only .37 percent of those \nwere later determined to be work authorized. A certain percent of \napplicants are found to be here illegally, and they should not get a \njob or any taxpayers' money from a part of the stimulus package. \nStimulus funds were set aside to help us reduce our unemployment rate \nin this country and to hire American workers. The prospect of jobs \nshould not be a magnet to draw more illegal workers into the country.\n  The first thing you do, if you have an immigration problem, is stop \nrewarding those who break the law. One of the things you do not do is \nreward people who come illegally with jobs. You do not have to arrest \nthem or do anything unkind. You simply do not hire them, especially \nwith taxpayers' money that is designed to create American jobs.\n  This has been a matter we have talked about for some time. It is very \nimportant in this time of economic slowdown because the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported that the unemployment rate for June, just a week or \nso ago, had jumped to 9.5 percent, 467,000 jobs lost, the highest \nunemployment rate in 25 years. We have massive job losses. A lot of \ngood people are out of work, they need work and are willing to work.\n  E-Verify is not a perfect system. People can find ways beat it, no \ndoubt, but it actually works. One study by the Heritage Foundation \nconcluded that as much as 13 percent of the jobs created under the \nstimulus plan would go to people illegally in the country the way we \nwere operating. By utilizing the E-Verify system, I have no doubt we \ncould drop that percentage dramatically. I am very concerned about it. \nI am a bit baffled by the difficulty we have had in moving forward with \nthis amendment.\n  I will say that two bits of progress--small progress, I know--have \noccurred. The House Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2010 has come over to the Senate, and it includes a 2-year \nextension of E-Verify. That is better than letting it expire. In \naddition, the Senate version of the bill includes a generous 3-year \nextension of this proven system. I have to say that is OK, but neither \nbill has any language that would make this system permanent. It leaves \nit on very shaky ground, making businesses that might voluntarily want \nto utilize it wonder if it really is the policy of our country to use \nit. Madam President, over 1,000 businesses a week are now voluntarily \nsigning up to use the system.\n  Failing to make the system permanent also raises questions about the \nsincerity of our commitment. More significantly, neither one of the \nbills has any language that says that government contractors, people \nwho are doing work for the U.S. Government, paid for by us, the \ntaxpayers, must use this system. I ask, Why not? What possible, \njustifiable, rational reason can we give to pass legislation designed \nto help deal with this recession, to try to create American jobs and \nnot make sure federal contractors only hire lawful workers? What basis \ncould we utilize to say that those contractors should not at least take \nabout 2 minutes--that is about all it takes to punch in a Social \nSecurity number into the system--to see whether a person applying for a \njob is legally in the country.\n  There is a long history on this amendment. For some reason, interest \ngroups have been lobbying against permanent authorization and mandating \nuse of E-Verify by federal contractors. Certain business groups oppose \nthis amendment. It scares them. Why? I suggest there is only one \nlogical conclusion: They like the idea of hiring illegal workers. But \nhow can we as Members of the Senate representing the American taxpayers \npossibly justify using their money that is designed to create jobs for \nAmerican citizens to hire people who are here illegally, creating an \neven greater magnet to attract more people to come into our country \nillegally?\n  I have offered this amendment to the appropriations bill to ensure \nthis successful program be made permanent. And, of course, any time in \nthe future if it ceases to be practical, we could end it. But this \namendment would make it permanent, sending a signal--that is part of \nwhat we want to do--and it would also be mandatory for government \ncontractors. If a Federal contractor gets a contract to do work, at\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nleast they ought to determine whether a worker is legally in the \ncountry before they hire them. I don't think that is too much to ask, \nand I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose it. But I understand, once \nagain, we are going to have objections.\n  It is working, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet \nNapolitano recently said this in response to a question I asked:\n\n       The administration----\n\n  She is talking about the Obama administration--\n\n     strongly supports E-Verify as a cornerstone of work site \n     enforcement and will work to continue to improve the program \n     to ensure it is the best tool to prevent and deter the hiring \n     of persons who are not authorized to work in the United \n     States.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good affirmation of it. In fact, that has \nbeen a known reality for years. We have known this system has worked \nfor years, but we have had people say: Oh, it is a bureaucratic \nnightmare. Why do businesses voluntarily sign up to use it, then? They \nsay some people might be held up in employment. Under the bill, if \nsomething in the system raises questions about your employability, the \nperson can still be hired while the problem is worked out. What we \nfound is that 96 percent of the people are cleared immediately and only \na very small number have turned out to have some sort of mistake in \ntheir situation. It is just not a practical objection, in my view.\n  I understand that some are claiming--my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle--that it looks as if Secretary Napolitano will announce \nsomething with regard to federal contractors soon, maybe even tomorrow. \nThat would be good. It would be a Presidential directive that could, in \nthe short run, solve this problem. But we have heard that talk before.\n  President Bush finally, after being subjected to some criticism about \nthis, issued Executive Order 12989 last June. That order mandated the \nuse of the E-Verify system for Federal contractors and subcontractors \nand was supposed to take effect in January of this year. President \nObama came in, as he has the power to do, and he delayed implementation \nof the order. Indeed, we have had four delays to date in implementing \nthis Executive Order. The first was when President Obama said that the \nJanuary 28 date was not appropriate. He put it off to February 20 and \nsaid that on February 20, businesses that get government contracts have \nto use the system. Then a few weeks later, the implementation was \npushed back to May 21. Before May 21 got here, they pushed it back to \nJune 30. A few weeks ago, we heard it would not be implemented until \nsome time in September. And now we are hearing that they may implement \nit soon.\n  E-Verify is certainly one of the most effective tools we have, as the \nSecretary herself has stated. Why are we not moving forward with making \nit permanent, I ask. I ask Members of Congress in the House and in the \nSenate, why don't we play a role in this? Why leave it totally up to \nthe President, who is subjected to all kinds of political and corporate \nlobbying to not do this program? Why don't we as a Senate just pass it, \nas we do so many other things, and make it law? If Secretary Napolitano \nplans to do this in the future, it wouldn't conflict with anything she \nplanned to do. If they were not going to do it, it would be mandated \nand it would come into effect.\n  We have to be aware that we have had a lot of obstacles before with \nthe implementation with this system and it has not gone forward in an \neffective way. I don't think we should wait any longer. Jobs are being \nlost every single day. They are being lost in significant numbers to \npeople illegally in our country.\n  T.J. Bonner, the head of the Border Patrol Union, told us most \npassionately at a Judiciary Committee hearing a number of years ago \nthat jobs are the magnet. If you can stop the magnet, the number of \npeople they have to deal with at the border can be reduced. It sends a \nsignal that the days of open borders and the ability to get a job even \nif you are illegally here are past. That is the way you do things and \nmake it work. It is all part of a plan to send a message to the world \nthat we are not open for illegality. Under E-Verify nobody is arrested, \nnobody is captured and taken to be deported. We just simply are taking \na reasonable step to reduce the magnet of jobs from taxpayers' money, \nnot private businesses, just government businesses and government \ncontractors. The Federal Government uses it today in its hiring \nprocess.\n  I was surprised to hear one of my Democratic colleagues asking that \nwe not support this amendment, saying that we should have a biometric \nemployment identification database and that he cannot support E-Verify \nbecause it is not strong enough. That was a remarkable thing. Anyone \nwho has studied the history of this program has good reason to wonder \nabout the sincerity of people who object because E-Verify is not tough \nenough. The reason people are objecting is because it works. That is \nwhy the immigrant advocacy groups and the business crowd object to it. \nThat is why. There may be better systems, but this one has been up and \nrunning for some time and been incredibly successful.\n  It was contended that I.D. thieves can defeat the system. I suspect \nthat is so. But does that mean the system has to be perfect before we \nuse it? That argument ignores the fact that this bill appropriates a \nsignificant amount of extra funds to assist the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's continuing effort to reinforce the system's antifraud \nprotections. We have money in this legislation to try to eliminate the \nability of people to defeat the system by fraud.\n  I don't think the argument can rationally be made that extending it \nwould be ``a waste of taxpayers' money.'' We already have the system up \nand running. In reality, it is not going to cost any more money to have \npeople use it. The system is up and working. I guess if people want to \nuse that as an excuse to vote against the amendment, they can, but it \nmakes little sense to me.\n  I would like to see an enhanced biometric system. It is absolutely \nsomething that can work. We need to do that. There are a lot of things \nwe can do this very day, but you have to admit, if we cannot get the \nvotes to just maintain the E-Verify system, it looks as if we may have \neven more difficulties with an advanced system.\n  I won't go on at length about this anymore. We have debated it \nbefore. Earlier this year on the stimulus bill, I offered an amendment \nto make E-Verify apply to the stimulus bill and the people who got \ngovernment contracts would have to use it. The House put that in their \nbill. I kept getting objection from the Democratic leadership to my \namendment. I couldn't understand why. And then I began to think about \nit, and it dawned on me what was happening. If my amendment were to \npass and the language was in the House bill, unless real skullduggery \nwere to occur, that language should be in the final bill. But if they \ncould keep the language out of the Senate bill, even though the House \nhad put the language in their bill by an overwhelming vote, they could \ntake it out in conference when they meet in secret to deal with the \nconflicts between the House bill and the Senate bill. So I brought it \nup three or four times, and every time I tried to get a vote, it was \nblocked.\n\n  Then, finally, the bill passed without my amendment having passed. \nAnd do you know what happened? When they met in secret, in conference, \nthe House leadership--the Speaker and her team--receded to the Senate \nbill, agreed to eliminate their language, and therefore the language \nwasn't in the bill. And what happened politically? All the House \nMembers, Republicans and Democrats, could say: I voted for E-Verify. \nAnd the Senate Members, when hearing complaints, could say: Well, I \nwould have voted for it if it had come up. It just never came up.\n  See, this was the plan all along. I just have to tell you what the \ntruth is and how this happened and what is at work out there.\n  So I hope Secretary Napolitano will do what she can do and the \nPresident will do what he can do and order that this system be \nmandatory for government contractors and to permanently authorize it. \nBut I don't see any reason in the world why we should wait on that. \nWhat we should do as a Congress, if we believe in what we say about our \ngoal to eliminate the surge of illegal immigration and trying to \nprotect American jobs at this time of economic recession, is we ought \nto vote for the amendment. What harm can there be?\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to do the right thing on this amendment and \nvote for it. I am baffled as to why there would be hesitation about it. \nI think if people look at it, it is very simple. The E-Verify system is \nup and running. The government employment offices use it before they \nhire anybody for the government. Thousands of businesses are using it \nevery day. Over 130,000 employers are currently enrolled in the \nprogram, and about a thousand businesses a week are signing up to use \nit. It protects them, in a way. If somebody says: You knowingly hired \nillegal workers, they can say: I checked and they had a good I.D. and a \ngood name, and I did my best. And that will protect them from \ncomplaints against them. Most employers want to do the right thing. \nThey do not want to hire people who are not lawfully in the country. So \nthat is why it is working even as a voluntary program. We are not \nhearing complaints about it. It is not violating people's civil rights. \nIt is working in a healthy way.\n  All we need to do now is make this system permanent, not keep leaving \nit out here in limbo. And secondly, let's make sure it applies to \npeople who not only go directly to work for the U.S. Government but for \ncontractors who do work for the government, people who are getting \nmoney under the stimulus bill, which was designed to create jobs for \nAmerican citizens.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today, just a couple of hours \nago, I spoke in this Chamber about the need to expand access to generic \ndrugs. I spoke about expanding generic access for biologics--drugs that \ntreat cancer, and diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, \nmultiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and a whole host of disabling and \noften fatal diseases. I talked about how much money could be saved with \na pathway to what are called follow-on biologics--or generics--and how \nmuch better access that would be for people who simply can't afford the \nthousands of dollars per month that it often costs for these biologics, \nthese very expensive treatments. I talked about how it could save money \nfor small businesses that so often pay the freight for health care, for \nhealth insurance for their employees, and how it could save money for \nlarge companies that simply aren't able to be as competitive around the \nworld because of the high cost of these biologics. All this is part of \na larger debate about health care reform.\n  Just a few short days after celebrating our Nation's birthday, we are \nfighting for what should be a right for every American; that is, access \nto affordable health coverage. This isn't about the Republicans. It \nisn't about Democrats. It is not about my part of the country, the \nMidwest, or the Presiding Officer's part of the country, New England. \nIt is not about Ohio or New Hampshire or California or Nebraska. It is \nabout America. It is about fighting for the next great progressive \nchapter in our Nation's 233-year history.\n  Think of the progress as a nation we have made in the last hundred \nyears. I wear on my lapel a pin depicting a canary in a bird cage. The \nmine workers used to take a canary down in the mines. If the canary \ndied from lack of oxygen or toxic gas, the mine worker knew he had to \nget out of the mines immediately. He had no union strong enough to \nprotect him or no government that cared enough to protect him. Think of \nthe progress this country has made over these past 100 years since the \ncanaries went down in the mines with the miners.\n  A baby born in America at the turn of the last century, say, in 1900, \nhad a life expectancy of only about 46 years. Today, we live three \ndecades longer because of our progressive government, because of a ban \non child labor, because of civil rights and women's rights, because of \nsafe drinking water and clean air, because of seatbelts and airbags, \nbecause of Medicare and Social Security and minimum wage and workers' \ncompensation, and so many great things this institution has done.\n  Over the Fourth of July weekend, I was honored to have spent time \nwith the Scalia family from Australia. Natalie and Greg Scalia lived in \nthe United States, just upstairs from my wife when she was a struggling \nsingle parent. Greg Scalia was an intern, I believe at the Cleveland \nClinic, making very little money. They had two children then. They now \nhave four children. Will and Issy were born and were here a dozen years \nago when they lived in the United States for a couple of years in the \n1990s. Born to the Scalia family since living here and joining the \nfamily on this visit were Richie and Rosie. They came to Cleveland over \nthe Fourth of July weekend. They did what Americans do: They went to a \nCleveland Indians game. Unfortunately, typically, they saw the Indians \nlose--a pattern that has been all too common this year. They went to a \nparade in the southwest part of Cleveland, they went to picnics, and \nthey had family time.\n  As I talked with Dr. Scalia and all of us talked about the current \ndebate over health care reform, it occurred to me that this debate and \nthe hours and hours spent by staff and Members who work in the Senate \nin crafting the public plan we announced last Thursday, the issue of \ngeneric drugs we engage in today and all the work done on prevention \nand on quality of care and on workforce training and on stopping fraud \nin the Medicare system--all the different kinds of health care systems \noverall are really part of the American experience. But years from now, \nwhen we look back on this, we will know that it is not about terms such \nas ``public option'' or ``follow-on biologics'' or concepts such as \npreventive care, quality control, or the discharge plan, where people \nleave hospitals; this is really all about American families.\n  That is why, as we celebrated the Fourth of July over the weekend, it \nwas particularly important to think about what we do this month in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I sit, and \nin the Finance Committee--the two committees of the Senate joined with \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Labor \nCommittee and the Energy and Commerce Committee--as we work on this. \nOur first pledge is to protect what is right in our health care system, \nand our second pledge is to fix what is wrong.\n  Protecting what is right means if you have health insurance and you \nare pleased with your health insurance, you keep it. No government is \ngoing to tell you to change that; you keep what you have. If you are \nunhappy with your insurance, if you are dissatisfied or simply have no \nhealth insurance or have very inadequate health insurance, then we can \noffer you private insurance or we can offer you public insurance--the \npublic plan option, so to speak--that will give you the choices as an \nAmerican citizen.\n  This is a historic moment for our country. This is the first time \nsince Franklin Roosevelt thought about trying to add health care, a \nMedicare-like system, to Social Security in the 1930s. He backed off \nunder pressure from the American Medical Association. In the 1940s \nPresident Truman offered Medicare. He was not able to pass it for all \nkinds of reasons. In 1965, President Johnson, with the huge Democratic \nmajorities, the biggest majorities we have had in the last 70 years, \nwas able to pass Medicare and Medicaid, and look what that brought us.\n  Madam President, as you join us in your first term from New \nHampshire, and many other freshmen who have moved on this side of the \naisle--we have sort of squeezed these desks together, as we see--we \nwill be facing a historic moment where we will have a chance to provide \nhealth insurance and help all these families I saw on the Fourth of \nJuly reach the American dream. It is an opportunity for people who have \nnot had health insurance and people who have inadequate health \ninsurance to be able to provide for their families. They are working \nhard and they are playing by the rules. They work as hard as any United \nStates Senator. The comforts of their job are not nearly as much as we \nhave in this body, and they are deserving of the\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nsame kind of health insurance that people in this Chamber have--\nSenators, staff people, all of us.\n  This is a great moment, a historic moment, as we move forward in the \nhistory of our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7189-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I am sorry to see Republican obstructionism \nin the Senate return with such a vengeance. Just last November, the \nAmerican people voted for change. They sent a new President to the \nWhite House to lead our government and sent a strong message that they \nexpected Washington to put aside pettiness and work on their behalf on \nthe serious problems facing them and the country. After only 6 months, \nit seems Republicans in the Senate have already forgotten that message.\n  The Senate majority leader has spoken about the difficulties he is \nhaving getting any semblance of reasonable cooperation from across the \naisle. The Republicans' obstruction of Presidential nominees is a stark \nexample. Just a few years ago, they were intent on employing the \n``nuclear option'' and risking destruction of longstanding Senate rules \nand practices in order to ensure that every one of President Bush's \nnominees was confirmed. This year, with President Obama making the \nnominations, they have reverted to the anonymous holds that \ncharacterized their actions during the Clinton years. It is impossible \nto find a principle that justifies this obstruction. It is likewise \ndifficult to see what ``extraordinary circumstances'' exist to justify \nfilibusters and unwillingness to proceed to consider these nominations.\n  The Senate's last week in session before the July 4th recess \nwitnessed a Republican filibuster of the President's nominee to serve \nas the Legal Advisor at the State Department. The target was Harold \nKoh, the distinguished dean of the Yale Law School, a former high-\nranking official in the State Department as well as a former official \nat the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. That \nfilibuster was unsuccessful, although 31 Republican Senators supported \nit. That was not the first attempt by Senate Republicans to filibuster \nexecutive branch nominees. Earlier this year, the Senate was forced to \nfile for cloture to avert a Republican filibuster against the \nnomination of David Ogden to serve as the Deputy Attorney General.\n  The destructive strategy culminated on June 25 when Republicans \nobjected to confirming nine executive branch nominees reported by the \nJudiciary Committee for action by the Senate. They included five U.S. \nattorneys, 3 Assistant Attorneys General and the Chairman of the U.S. \nSentencing Commission. In addition, the Judiciary Committee has \nreported 3 judicial nominees to begin filling the 74 vacancies in our \nFederal courts around the country. Republicans are turning the clock \nback to 10 years ago, when their obstructionism led to more than 100 \njudicial vacancies and earned rebukes from Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n  In an editorial entitled ``Call It Obstructionism,'' the New York \nTimes on June 28 noted that the Senate adjourned for the July 4th \nrecess with ``21 nominees for important posts awaiting confirmation.'' \nThirteen had been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee but \nremained stalled before the Senate by Republican objections. I hope \nthis work period sees the cooperation from Senate Republicans that the \nAmerican people have demanded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7189-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING TERRY BARNICH AND MAGED HUSSEIN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about two \nbrave Americans who were tragically killed in Iraq earlier this year. \nOn May 25, 2009, Terrance Barnich of Illinois and Maged Hussein of \nFlorida died when an improvised explosive device detonated near a \nconstruction site outside of Fallujah.\n  Terry Barnich was the deputy director of the Iraq Transition \nAssistance Office in Baghdad. He had signed on for multiple tours in \nIraq and was the senior American expert responsible for expanding the \ngeneration of electricity across Iraq. Dr. Maged Hussein was the senior \nadviser for water resources in the Iraq Transition Assistance Office \nand a civilian member of the Army Corps of Engineers. He, too, \nvolunteered for multiple tours in Iraq.\n  These two men represent the very best America has to offer. Both gave \nup the comforts of home to live in trailers in Baghdad in an effort to \nhelp provide a better future for Iraq. Countless thousands of Iraqi \ncivilians have access to electricity and potable water as a result of \nTerry's and Maged's efforts. Along with the personal tragedy, their \nloss represents a serious setback for American reconstruction efforts \nin Iraq. We mourn their passing and offer our deepest condolences to \ntheir families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7189-5", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7189-S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              COMMENDING LIEUTENANT GENERAL SCOTT C. BLACK\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to LTG Scott C. Black for his many years of loyal and \nexceptionally meritorious service to our Nation culminating in his \nsteadfast devotion, stewardship, and leadership of the Army Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps as the 37th and first 3-Star Judge Advocate \nGeneral. Lieutenant General Black will retire from the Army on 1 \nOctober 2009 having completed a distinguished military career of over \n35 years. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his many contributions to \nour Nation and the legal profession, particularly during operations in \nsupport of the global war on terror.\n  Born on September 1, 1952, in Camp Cook, CA, this great patriot grew \nup traveling around the world in a military family but always \nconsidered California his home and is a resident to this day. He \ngraduated in 1974 from California Polytechnic State University with a \nbachelor of arts in political science. While attending Cal Poly, \nLieutenant General Black was enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps. Upon graduation, he began his military career as a commissioned \narmor officer. After completing the armor officer basic course and \nAirborne and Ranger schools, he returned to California for his first \nduty assignment and served at Fort Ord from 1974-1977. In 1977, the \nArmy selected him to attend law school through the Funded Legal \nEducation Program. He remained on the west coast and graduated in 1980 \nwith his juris doctor degree from the California Western School of Law.\n  He then attended the Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course in \nCharlottesville, VA, before heading to Fort Bliss, TX, where he honed \nhis legal skills serving as the chief of legal assistance; trial \ncounsel; chief, criminal law; and as a contracts attorney. In 1984, he \nreturned to Charlottesville to attend the judge advocate officer \ngraduate course. In\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nthe short time he was a judge advocate before attending the graduate \ncourse, Lieutenant General Black quickly distinguished himself from his \npeers as possessing the legal acumen and interpersonal skills to serve \nin the Judge Advocate General's Corps' most visible and challenging \npositions. From 1985-1989 he served in the general law branch, \nadministrative law division, Office of The Judge Advocate General. \nDuring this time period, he received the high honor and rare \ndistinction of being selected to serve as an assistant counsel to the \nPresident of the United States. After leaving the White House, his \nstellar performance led to his selection to attend the U.S. Army \nCommand and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, KS. In 1990, he \nreturned to Fort Ord, CA, where he served as the deputy staff judge \nadvocate for the 7th Infantry Division, Light, until 1993. After \nleaving Fort Ord, Lieutenant General Black continued to expertly fill \nand excel in challenging positions.\n  In 1993, Lieutenant General Black and his family moved to Europe \nwhere he was the chief, military and civil law division, Office of the \nJudge Advocate, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army, Germany. In 1994 he \nbecame the staff judge Advocate, 3d Infantry Division, later \nredesignated 1st Infantry Division, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army, \nGermany. In 1996, he returned to Washington, DC, where he served as the \nlegislative counsel and chief, investigations and legislative division, \nOffice of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, Office of the Secretary of \nthe Army, until 1998. From 1998-1999, Lieutenant General Black attended \nthe Industrial College of the Armed Forces. In 1999 he returned to the \nOffice of The Judge Advocate General to serve as the chief, personnel, \nplans, and training office. In 2000, Lieutenant General Black returned \nto Germany as the staff judge advocate, V Corps, U.S. Army Europe and \nSeventh Army, Germany.\n  In 2001 Lieutenant General Black was selected for promotion to \nbrigadier general, and so he returned to Washington, DC, to serve as \nthe assistant judge advocate general for military law and operations. \nIn 2003 he was assigned as the first commanding general of the U.S. \nArmy Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School. In 2005 he \nbecame the 37th The judge advocate general of the Army. He was promoted \nto lieutenant general on 8 December 2008 to become the Army's first 3-\nstar the judge advocate general.\n  As the judge advocate general of the Army, Lieutenant General Black \nserved as the principal staff officer responsible for the largest legal \nservices corps within the Department of Defense, with over 9,000 \nuniformed and civilian attorneys, paralegal noncommissioned officers, \nand civilian support staff across 651 offices in 19 countries. \nLieutenant General Black expertly advised the Secretary of the Army and \nthe Army Staff on sensitive issues affecting the Army and the \nDepartment of Defense during a tumultuous and difficult time in our \nNation's history. Along with the judge advocate generals of the other \nservices he was the conscious of the nation as he provided counsel on \nnovel legal issues in international law and the ethical values \nfundamental to the United States.\n  Under his leadership the Judge Advocate General's Corps transitioned \nalong with the rest of the Army so that judge advocates were more \naccessible and effective to the commanders who rely on their advice. \nLieutenant General Black's awards include the Legion of Merit with Oak \nLeaf Cluster, Army Meritorious Service Medal with four Oak Leaf \nClusters, Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Army \nAchievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. He has earned the Ranger Tab \nand the Parachutist Badge.\n  Lieutenant General Black and his wonderful wife Kim have been married \nfor 33 years. They have four children and one grandchild.\n  I know all my colleagues join me in saluting LTG Scott C. Black and \nhis family for their many years of truly outstanding service to the \nJudge Advocate General's Corps, the U.S. Army, and our great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7190-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7190-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/07/senate-section/article/S7190-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 2454.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount allowed as a deduction for start-up expenditures; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation that \nwill make it significantly easier for small businesses to open their \ndoors. Providing a helping hand to small businesses is important at any \ntime, but never more so than now, when so many Americans are out of \nwork.\n  Small businesses are the engines of our economy. By some estimates, \nthey employ approximately half the private workforce, and, in rural \nAmerica, comprise nine out of ten businesses. In my home State of \nOregon, many of the rural counties have unemployment rates \napproaching--or even surpassing--20 percent. Clearly, small businesses \nare going to be instrumental in turning things around.\n  Furthermore, small businesses are innovators--they produce 13 times \nmore patents per employee than large firms. Right now, the U.S. needs \nthis kind of innovation more than ever.\n  Our economy cannot thrive if small businesses are not doing well.\n  Unfortunately, it can be very difficult for small businesses to \nsucceed. Start-up expenses are often prohibitive and it can take a few \nyears before business owners begin to see a profit. There are \nadministrative systems to create, employees to hire, a client base to \nbuild and supplies to purchase. This adds up to a lot of expenses. A \nGallup poll showed that the average small business incurs $10,000 in \nexpenses during that first year. However, if a business can last 4 \nyears, it is much more likely to survive in the long term. We need to \ndo more to help these businesses get through this difficult period.\n  Today, I am joining with my colleague from Tennessee, Senator \nAlexander, to introduce legislation that will help small businesses \nthrough their first year. The Small Business Jump Start Act of 2009 \nlessens the tax burden on new small businesses by doubling the \ndeduction they can take for start-up expenses to $10,000. The Act also \nwidens the pool of businesses eligible to take the full amount of the \ndeduction in their first year of business. The Small Business Jump \nStart Act gives these new businesses a boost that first year, and for \nsome, will eliminate the tax complications of amortizing start-up \nexpenses. The Small Business Jump Start Act of 2009 is supported by the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the National Association of the Self-Employed, and the \nNational Association of Small Businesses.\n  I will highlight one Oregon small business that the Jump Start Act \ncould have helped. Jack and Giovanina Giaccarini moved to Grants Pass, \nOregon after Hurricane Katrina came through their town in Mississippi. \nIt was their dream to start a business installing systems to help \nquadriplegics and disabled veterans maneuver around their homes. The \nfirst year of their business was tough--finding start-up capital was \ndifficult and purchasing just one system to use for demonstrations cost \n$10,000. They struggled. Now they are in their third year of business \nand finally making a profit. Having a Jump Start in that first year \nwould have made a significant difference early on.\n  This bill will go a long way for new small businesses looking to open \ntheir doors and employ people in their communities. Colleagues, in \norder to help America's small businesses and the economies of rural \nAmerica, I urge you to support the Small Business Jump Start Act of \n2009.

Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: As a longstanding advocate of tax \n     relief for small businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     applauds your leadership on introducing the ``Small Business \n     Jump Start Act of 2009.'' This bill would increase the small \n     business start-up expense deduction from $5,000 to $10,000 \n     and increase the threshold for the deductions phase-out from \n     $50,000 to $60,000.\n       A robust small business community is a vital component to \n     America's economic recovery. Allowing small business owners \n     the opportunity to expense additional start-up costs up front \n     would foster more entrepreneurial activity and further \n     encourage the important role of small business as the job \n     producers in our economy.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest \n     business federation, representing more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region. More than 96 percent of the Chamber's members are \n     small businesses and organizations with 100 or fewer \n     employees. On behalf of these small employers, the Chamber \n     strongly supports your efforts to encourage investment and \n     growth in America's 27 million small enterprises and looks \n     forward to working with you to pass this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: On behalf of the National Association \n     for the Self-Employed (NASE) and our 250,000 member \n     businesses, I am pleased to announce our support for the \n     Small Business Jump Start Act of 2009. We strongly believe \n     that in this uncertain economic time it is more important \n     than ever to assist our nation's budding entrepreneurs.\n       By increasing the start up business expenses deduction, the \n     Small Business Jump Start Act will greatly assist start up \n     ventures at the most critical time--their first year of \n     business--and give them the financial boost they need to \n     succeed.\n       The NASE believes that entrepreneurs have been pillars of \n     innovation and job creation, fueling much of what is great \n     about America. Legislation that supports and invests in these \n     enterprises is in the best interests of our economy and our \n     nation. We feel that the Small Business Jump Start Act of \n     2009 will encourage many individuals who have been \n     considering entrepreneurship, to take the next steps to open \n     their small business and in turn, help create jobs in this \n     tough economy.\n       If you have any questions or comments, please contact \n     Kristie Arslan, NASE's executive director. We are looking \n     forward to working with you and your staff to gain passage of \n     this legislation.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important small \n     business issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Robert Hughes,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                      Nashville, TN, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: On behalf of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, I want to thank you for \n     introducing the Small Business Jump Start Act, a bill to \n     increase the start-up deduction for new small businesses from \n     $5,000 to $10,000.\n       While a typical business can deduct its ordinary business \n     expenses in the year the expenses are paid, a start-up \n     business is limited as to how much and when it can deduct \n     start-up expenses. Start-up business expenses are the costs \n     associated with formation of a business made prior to the \n     actual opening of the business. Most new small businesses \n     face significant start-up costs, including advertising, \n     obtaining licenses, permits and fees, paying rent, hiring \n     business and financial consultants and providing employee \n     training. Under this bill, expenses\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n     connected with setting up or investing in the creation of a \n     new business are deductible up to $10,000 in the first year \n     of the business.\n       During a time of economic uncertainty, this legislation \n     provides a significant incentive for entrepreneurs--as well \n     as many people who have recently lost their jobs--to start \n     their own business. By increasing the start-up cost \n     deduction, small business owners will be able to put money \n     back into their business sooner, creating greater \n     opportunities for job creation and investment in local \n     economies.\n       Thank you again for introducing this bill to help America's \n     small businesses. I look forward to working with you on this \n     issue as the 111th Congress continues.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National small\n\n\n                                         Business Association,\n\n                                                     July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: On behalf of the National Small \n     Business Association, I would like to thank you for your \n     leadership in crafting the Small Business Jump Start Act of \n     2009. As the nation's oldest nonpartisan small business \n     advocacy group, NSBA reaches more than 150,000 small \n     businesses nation-wide, and our members have highlighted tax \n     relief as a top priority for the 111th Congress.\n       Small business is one of the primary catalysts of both job \n     growth and innovation in our national economy. In fact, \n     according to the Small Business Administration since the mid-\n     1990s, small businesses have created 60 to 80 percent of the \n     net new jobs annually.\n       However, over the past year, small businesses have \n     experienced marked economic challenges. Between skyrocketing \n     gas prices, a weak real estate market and the credit crunch, \n     today's slow economy is having a noticeable effect on our \n     entrepreneurs. This new reality is coupled with the fact that \n     the first year of a small business is often difficult and \n     expensive. New employer establishments face challenges \n     keeping up with growing first year demands--building a client \n     base, hiring employees, creating new products and services, \n     and often opening a facility.\n       Yet, small businesses that make it past the first four \n     years have a better chance of surviving long-term and this is \n     why your legislation is so crucial. It will boost the federal \n     tax deduction for small business start-up costs and broaden \n     the pool of businesses eligible for the deduction.\n       Start-up businesses are currently eligible for a $5,000 tax \n     deduction if they spend $50,000 or less to open their doors. \n     The legislation proposed by you would boost the deduction to \n     $10,000 and also expand eligibility to companies that spend \n     up to $60,000 on start-up costs. The deduction would be \n     phased out dollar-for-dollar for expenditures above $60,000. \n     A business that spends $61,000 in start-up costs, for \n     example, could deduct $9,000 under the proposed legislation \n     and take the remaining $1,000 deduction over 15 years, just \n     as in current law.\n       Small businesses are the lifeblood of all communities, and \n     this bill supports them by providing the financial assistance \n     they need to achieve success. The Small Business Jump Start \n     Act of 2009 will give small businesses the necessary \n     financial boost in their first year which will encourage \n     investments that create jobs and economic growth. NSBA \n     supports this measure, and commends you for working to bring \n     this legislation to the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Todd McCracken,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1404. A bill to implement demonstration projects at federally \nqualified community health centers to promote universal access to \nfamily-centered, evidence-based behavioral health interventions that \nprevent child maltreatment and promote family well-being by addressing \nparenting practices and skills for families from diverse socioeconomic, \ncultural, racial, ethnic, and other backgrounds, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Supporting Child \nMaltreatment Prevention Efforts in Community Health Centers Act of \n2009. I am introducing this bill on behalf of the American \nPsychological Association and the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers. This much-needed legislation would help address a \ncritical problem in our country, the abuse and neglect of millions of \nchildren. Today, I am introducing legislation that will help address \nthis preventable tragedy.\n  Unfortunately, child maltreatment continues to be a serious public \nhealth problem in our country that affects millions of children and \ntheir families. Child abuse and neglect can take many forms, including \nneglect of children's medical needs, physical or psychological \nmaltreatment, sexual abuse, and multiple types of maltreatment.\n  In 2007 alone, an estimated 5.8 million were allegedly victims of \nmaltreatment, 3.2 million referrals were made to Child Protective \nServices agencies, and 794,000 children were determined to be victims \nof abuse and neglect. During that same year, 1,760 children died as a \nresult of abuse or neglect, most of them younger than 4-years old.\n  Nearly 80 percent of the perpetrators of child maltreatment were \nparents, and approximately seven percent were other relatives. \nTherefore, child maltreatment is a tragedy that impacts millions of \nchildren in their own families. Considering that not all maltreatment \nis reported to the authorities, the actual numbers are estimated to be \nhigher.\n  Focusing on prevention will help save billions of dollars that are \ncurrently spent annually--due to victimization and injuries--with \nhospitalization, visits to ER, out-of-home placements, CPS services, \ninvestigations, incarceration of abusers, services to address mental \nhealth issues, and other related costs.\n  At the same time, we know that community health centers represent a \nunique resource for many families who depend on their services to \nobtain much-needed health and mental health care. Community Health \nCenters, CHCs, served 16 million individuals in 2007, most of them \npoor, uninsured, and at-risk for child maltreatment. In fact, one in \nfive low-income children in the U.S. receives health care at a CHC. \nFurthermore, the centers provide comprehensive primary care services \nthat set up the stage for an integrated care model.\n  Given this evidence, the American Psychological Association, APA, \nconvened a group of experts to review the best available science to \nidentify and recommend public health strategies to prevent child \nmaltreatment within the context of behavioral health integration at \ncommunity health centers. For decades, the APA and its members have \nbeen at the forefront of child maltreatment prevention efforts in \nresearch, development of interventions, and evaluation. The findings of \nthis report provided the seed to develop this critical legislation on \nbehalf of children and families in our country.\n  Among its provisions, this important legislation supports the \nimplementation of demonstration projects at federally qualified health \ncenters to promote universal access to a family-centered integrated and \nvoluntary services model, evidence-based behavioral health \ninterventions that prevent child maltreatment and promote family well-\nbeing by addressing parenting practices and skills for families from \ndiverse socioeconomic, cultural, racial, ethnic, and other backgrounds. \nThe bill would also support program evaluation outcomes, technical \nassistance, project coordination, and the design and implementation of \na cross-site evaluation plan.\n  I have been committed to the support of psychology contributions to \nchildren and families and the vital role of community health centers \nfor decades. This bill will help address the critical need to help and \nprotect our nation's children by giving their parents and caregivers \nthe tools and skills they need to be become the best parents and \ncaregivers they can be and to, ultimately, help prevent child abuse and \nneglect.\n  It is my hope that the science-based recommendations utilized in the \ndevelopment of this legislation will serve as a useful resource to \ninform current health care reform legislative efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Child \n     Maltreatment Prevention Efforts in Community Health Centers \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Child abuse and neglect are serious public health \n     problems in this country. During\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n     2007, approximately 3,200,000 referrals, involving the \n     alleged maltreatment of approximately 5,800,000 children, \n     were sent to child protective services agencies.\n       (2) The most recent data show 794,000 substantiated cases \n     of child abuse and neglect in 2007, and child maltreatment-\n     related deaths rose 15.5 percent in 2007. Approximately 1,760 \n     children in the United States, nearly \\3/4\\ of whom were \n     under 4 years of age, died as a result of abuse or neglect.\n       (3) Early childhood experiences may have lifelong effects. \n     Severe and chronic childhood stress, including from \n     maltreatment and exposure to violence, is associated with \n     persistent effects and can lead to enduring health, behavior, \n     and learning problems.\n       (4) Child maltreatment has--\n       (A) psychological and behavioral consequences such as \n     depression, anxiety, suicide, aggressive behavior, \n     delinquency, posttraumatic stress disorder, and criminal \n     behavior;\n       (B) health consequences, including injuries and death, \n     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, heart \n     disease, liver disease, and drug use; and\n       (C) developmental consequences that can compromise brain \n     development and learning.\n       (5) Child maltreatment has significant financial \n     consequences, including the short-term costs associated with \n     case handling by child protective services and \n     investigations, hospitalization or emergency room visits for \n     medical treatment of injuries, out-of-home placement \n     alternatives, services to address mental health and substance \n     abuse problems, loss of productivity, and poor physical \n     health requiring multiple treatments.\n       (6) Child maltreatment can be prevented. Given that parents \n     and caregivers are responsible for the majority of the abuse \n     and neglect, caregiver-focused strategies and interventions \n     that address parenting skills and parental risk factors such \n     as depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner \n     violence, as well as strategies and interventions that \n     promote family well-being are critical. Parenting practices \n     are amenable to change, given reasonable efforts, and the \n     building of safe, stable, nurturing parent-child \n     relationships is a scientifically proven strategy for the \n     prevention of child maltreatment.\n       (7) Prevention of child maltreatment should have a focus on \n     primary prevention (before any maltreatment), emphasizing \n     community-centered and population-based strategies.\n       (8) Prevention of child maltreatment should focus on \n     promoting healthy parent-child relationships and an \n     environment that provides safe, stable, nurturing \n     relationships for children.\n       (9) Primary health care is an existing and widely-accessed \n     system in which a range of prevention strategies can be \n     implemented, and there is growing evidence that primary \n     health care settings are promising venues in which to conduct \n     child maltreatment prevention and behavioral health promotion \n     programs.\n       (10) Community health centers (referred to in this Act as \n     ``CHCs'') serve more than 18,000,000 individuals in the \n     United States annually, including individuals who are poor, \n     uninsured, hard-to-reach, and at-risk for child maltreatment.\n       (11) One in 5 low-income children in the United States \n     receives health care at a CHC.\n       (12) CHCs are an existing network of neighborhood health \n     clinics widely and regularly accessed by families in need \n     that can serve as a fitting venue for child maltreatment \n     prevention initiatives.\n       (13) In the last decade, behavioral issues have had an \n     expanding presence in the portfolio of services of CHCs. \n     Seventy percent of CHCs have some, if minimal, on-site mental \n     health and substance abuse services. When demand exceeds \n     capacity or on-site services do not exist, CHCs refer \n     individuals to off-site options.\n       (14) The integration of behavioral health services in \n     primary care settings is a promising framework. Evaluation \n     results of integrated care have shown--\n       (A) improvement in service utilization, such as shorter \n     waiting time and fewer sessions to complete treatment;\n       (B) reduction in the stigma related to mental health \n     services; and\n       (C) improvement in access to services.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To fund the implementation of a minimum of 10 \n     demonstration projects of evidence-based and promising \n     parenting programs at federally qualified health centers.\n       (2) To provide universal access to a family-centered \n     integrated and voluntary services model that prevents child \n     maltreatment and promotes family well-being and which may \n     include:\n       (A) implementation of evidence-based preventive parenting \n     skills training programs at health centers or permanent or \n     temporary residences of caregivers to strengthen the capacity \n     of parents to care for their children's health and well-being \n     and promote their own ability to create safe, stable, \n     nurturing family environments that protect children and youth \n     from abuse and neglect and its consequences and support \n     children's optimal social, emotional, physical, and academic \n     development;\n       (B) screening to identify parental risk factors such as \n     depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence \n     that are associated with the likelihood that parents will \n     abuse or neglect their children, and to further develop \n     screening methods and instruments; and\n       (C) linkage with, and referral to, on-site individualized \n     quality mental health services provided by trained mental \n     health professionals for parents and caregivers screening \n     positive for child maltreatment risk factors to help them \n     overcome the impediments to effective parenting and change \n     their behaviors toward child rearing and parenting.\n       (3) To coordinate the design and implementation of an \n     evaluation plan to assess the impact and feasibility of \n     integrated services model implementation at each federally \n     qualified health center participating in the demonstration \n     project for health outcomes, cost effectiveness, patient \n     satisfaction, program local adaptation, reduction of child \n     maltreatment and injuries, and improvement of parenting \n     behaviors and family functioning.\n       (4) To implement critical system factors for successful \n     implementation of the integrated services model to prevent \n     child maltreatment. Such factors include training of a \n     culturally- and linguistically-competent workforce, use of \n     best available technology, establishment of cooperation among \n     FQHCs participating in the demonstration project, and \n     building internal and external buy-in and support for the \n     project.\n       (5) To coordinate the design and implementation of the \n     cross-site system-wide evaluation plan to assess the impact \n     and feasibility of an integrated services model on the \n     reduction of child maltreatment and injuries, to increase a \n     family's access to services, to evaluate the effectiveness of \n     the response of FQHCs organizational systems to the model \n     implemented, and to identify lessons learned and outline \n     recommendations for system-wide areas for improvement and \n     changes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 209\n\n       Whereas vision impairment and eye disease are major public \n     health problems, especially due to the aging of the \n     population;\n       Whereas there is a disproportionate incidence of eye \n     disease in minority populations;\n       Whereas vision loss as a result of diabetes and other \n     chronic diseases costs the people of the United States \n     $68,000,000,000 each year in health care expenses, lost \n     productivity, reduced independence, diminished quality of \n     life, increased depression, and accelerated mortality;\n       Whereas approximately 38,000,000 people in the United \n     States over 40 years of age currently experience blindness, \n     low-vision, or an age-related eye disease, and this number is \n     expected to grow to 50,000,000 by 2020, as the tidal wave of \n     approximately 78,000,000 baby boomers who will begin to reach \n     65 years of age in 2010, many of whom will continue working \n     well beyond age 65, crashes;\n       Whereas, in public opinion polls conducted during the past \n     40 years, people in the United States have consistently \n     identified fear of vision loss as second only to fear of \n     cancer, and, as recently as 2008, a study by the National Eye \n     Institute showed that 71 percent of respondents indicated \n     that a loss of eyesight would have the greatest impact on \n     their life;\n       Whereas, with wisdom and foresight, Congress passed an Act \n     entitled ``An Act to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     provide for the establishment of a National Eye Institute in \n     the National Institutes of Health'' (Public Law 90-489; 82 \n     Stat. 771), which was signed into law by President Johnson on \n     August 16, 1968;\n       Whereas the National Eye Institute (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``NEI'') held the first meeting of the \n     National Advisory Eye Council on April 3, 1969;\n       Whereas the NEI leads the Federal commitment to basic and \n     clinical research, research training, and other programs with \n     respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders, \n     mechanisms of visual function, preservation of sight, and the \n     special health problems and needs of individuals who are \n     visually-impaired or blind;\n       Whereas the NEI disseminates information aimed at the \n     prevention of blindness, specifically through public and \n     professional education facilitated by the National Eye Health \n     Education Program;\n       Whereas the NEI maximizes Federal funding by devoting 85 \n     percent of its budget to extramural research that addresses a \n     wide variety of eye and vision disorders, including ``back of \n     the eye'' retinal and optic nerve disease, such as age-\n     related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic \n     retinopathy, and concomitant low vision, and ``front of the \n     eye'' disease, including corneal, lens, cataract, and \n     refractive errors;\n       Whereas research by the NEI benefits children, including \n     premature infants born with retinopathy and school children \n     with amblyopia (commonly known as ``lazy eye'');\n       Whereas the NEI benefits older people in the United States \n     by predicting, preventing, and preempting aging eye disease, \n     thereby enabling more productive lives and reducing Medicare \n     costs;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in basic research, \n     working with the Human Genome Project of the National \n     Institutes of Health to translate discoveries of genes \n     related to eye disease and vision impairment, which make up \n     \\1/4\\ of genes discovered to date, into diagnostic and \n     treatment modalities;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in clinical research, \n     funding more than 60 clinical trials (including a series of \n     Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Trials Networks, in association \n     with the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and \n     Kidney Disorders) which have developed treatment strategies \n     that have been determined by the NEI to be 90 percent \n     effective and to save an estimated $1,600,000,000 each year \n     in blindness and vision impairment disability costs;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in prevention research, \n     having reported from the first phase of its Age-Related Eye \n     Disease Study that high levels of dietary zinc and anti-\n     oxidant vitamins reduced vision loss in individuals at high \n     risk for developing advanced age-related macular degeneration \n     by 25 percent, and, in the second phase of Age-Related Eye \n     Disease Study, studying the impact of other nutritional \n     supplements;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in epidemiologic \n     research, identifying the basis and progression of eye \n     disease and the disproportionate incidence of eye disease in \n     minority populations, so that informed public health policy \n     decisions can be made regarding prevention, early diagnosis, \n     and treatment;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     across the National Institutes of Health, working with the \n     National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and \n     Blood Institute to identify factors that promote or inhibit \n     new blood vessel growth, which has resulted in the first \n     generation of ophthalmic drugs approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in the \n     form of age-related macular degeneration commonly known as \n     the ``wet'' form of age-related macular degeneration, thereby \n     stabilizing, and often restoring, vision;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     with other Federal entities, and its bioengineering research \n     partnership with the National Science Foundation and the \n     Department of Energy has resulted in a retinal chip implant, \n     referred to as the ``Bionic Eye'', that has enabled \n     individuals who have been blind for decades to perceive \n     visual images;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     with private funding entities, and its human gene therapy \n     trial with the Foundation Fighting Blindness for individuals \n     with Leber Congenital Amaurosis, a rapid retinal degeneration \n     that blinds infants in their first year of life, has \n     demonstrated measurable vision improvement even within the \n     initial safety trials;\n       Whereas, from 2011 through 2020, the people of the United \n     States will face unprecedented public health challenges \n     associated with aging, health disparities, and chronic \n     disease; and\n       Whereas Federal support by the NEI and related agencies \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services is \n     essential for prevention, early detection, access to \n     treatment and rehabilitation, and research associated with \n     vision impairment and eye disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the NEI, commends \n     the NEI for its leadership, and supports the mission of the \n     NEI to prevent blindness and to save and restore vision;\n       (2) supports the designation of the years 2011 through 2020 \n     as the ``Decade of Vision'', to--\n       (A) maintain a sustained awareness of the unprecedented \n     public health challenges associated with vision impairment \n     and eye disease; and\n       (B) emphasize the need for Federal support for prevention, \n

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 209\n\n       Whereas vision impairment and eye disease are major public \n     health problems, especially due to the aging of the \n     population;\n       Whereas there is a disproportionate incidence of eye \n     disease in minority populations;\n       Whereas vision loss as a result of diabetes and other \n     chronic diseases costs the people of the United States \n     $68,000,000,000 each year in health care expenses, lost \n     productivity, reduced independence, diminished quality of \n     life, increased depression, and accelerated mortality;\n       Whereas approximately 38,000,000 people in the United \n     States over 40 years of age currently experience blindness, \n     low-vision, or an age-related eye disease, and this number is \n     expected to grow to 50,000,000 by 2020, as the tidal wave of \n     approximately 78,000,000 baby boomers who will begin to reach \n     65 years of age in 2010, many of whom will continue working \n     well beyond age 65, crashes;\n       Whereas, in public opinion polls conducted during the past \n     40 years, people in the United States have consistently \n     identified fear of vision loss as second only to fear of \n     cancer, and, as recently as 2008, a study by the National Eye \n     Institute showed that 71 percent of respondents indicated \n     that a loss of eyesight would have the greatest impact on \n     their life;\n       Whereas, with wisdom and foresight, Congress passed an Act \n     entitled ``An Act to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     provide for the establishment of a National Eye Institute in \n     the National Institutes of Health'' (Public Law 90-489; 82 \n     Stat. 771), which was signed into law by President Johnson on \n     August 16, 1968;\n       Whereas the National Eye Institute (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``NEI'') held the first meeting of the \n     National Advisory Eye Council on April 3, 1969;\n       Whereas the NEI leads the Federal commitment to basic and \n     clinical research, research training, and other programs with \n     respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders, \n     mechanisms of visual function, preservation of sight, and the \n     special health problems and needs of individuals who are \n     visually-impaired or blind;\n       Whereas the NEI disseminates information aimed at the \n     prevention of blindness, specifically through public and \n     professional education facilitated by the National Eye Health \n     Education Program;\n       Whereas the NEI maximizes Federal funding by devoting 85 \n     percent of its budget to extramural research that addresses a \n     wide variety of eye and vision disorders, including ``back of \n     the eye'' retinal and optic nerve disease, such as age-\n     related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic \n     retinopathy, and concomitant low vision, and ``front of the \n     eye'' disease, including corneal, lens, cataract, and \n     refractive errors;\n       Whereas research by the NEI benefits children, including \n     premature infants born with retinopathy and school children \n     with amblyopia (commonly known as ``lazy eye'');\n       Whereas the NEI benefits older people in the United States \n     by predicting, preventing, and preempting aging eye disease, \n     thereby enabling more productive lives and reducing Medicare \n     costs;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in basic research, \n     working with the Human Genome Project of the National \n     Institutes of Health to translate discoveries of genes \n     related to eye disease and vision impairment, which make up \n     \\1/4\\ of genes discovered to date, into diagnostic and \n     treatment modalities;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in clinical research, \n     funding more than 60 clinical trials (including a series of \n     Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Trials Networks, in association \n     with the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and \n     Kidney Disorders) which have developed treatment strategies \n     that have been determined by the NEI to be 90 percent \n     effective and to save an estimated $1,600,000,000 each year \n     in blindness and vision impairment disability costs;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in prevention research, \n     having reported from the first phase of its Age-Related Eye \n     Disease Study that high levels of dietary zinc and anti-\n     oxidant vitamins reduced vision loss in individuals at high \n     risk for developing advanced age-related macular degeneration \n     by 25 percent, and, in the second phase of Age-Related Eye \n     Disease Study, studying the impact of other nutritional \n     supplements;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in epidemiologic \n     research, identifying the basis and progression of eye \n     disease and the disproportionate incidence of eye disease in \n     minority populations, so that informed public health policy \n     decisions can be made regarding prevention, early diagnosis, \n     and treatment;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     across the National Institutes of Health, working with the \n     National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and \n     Blood Institute to identify factors that promote or inhibit \n     new blood vessel growth, which has resulted in the first \n     generation of ophthalmic drugs approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in the \n     form of age-related macular degeneration commonly known as \n     the ``wet'' form of age-related macular degeneration, thereby \n     stabilizing, and often restoring, vision;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     with other Federal entities, and its bioengineering research \n     partnership with the National Science Foundation and the \n     Department of Energy has resulted in a retinal chip implant, \n     referred to as the ``Bionic Eye'', that has enabled \n     individuals who have been blind for decades to perceive \n     visual images;\n       Whereas the NEI has been a leader in collaborative research \n     with private funding entities, and its human gene therapy \n     trial with the Foundation Fighting Blindness for individuals \n     with Leber Congenital Amaurosis, a rapid retinal degeneration \n     that blinds infants in their first year of life, has \n     demonstrated measurable vision improvement even within the \n     initial safety trials;\n       Whereas, from 2011 through 2020, the people of the United \n     States will face unprecedented public health challenges \n     associated with aging, health disparities, and chronic \n     disease; and\n       Whereas Federal support by the NEI and related agencies \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services is \n     essential for prevention, early detection, access to \n     treatment and rehabilitation, and research associated with \n     vision impairment and eye disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the NEI, commends \n     the NEI for its leadership, and supports the mission of the \n     NEI
