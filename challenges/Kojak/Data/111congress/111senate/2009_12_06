Mr. President, first, I wish to extend a welcome to \nthe President, who is coming to the Capitol today to meet with \nDemocrats on the subject of the health care bill.\n  So far, they have voted to cut Medicare three times--cuts they \npreviously described as immoral and irresponsible; cuts that made it \nimpossible for the President to keep his pledge that people who like \ntheir plans can keep them; cuts that will reduce the quality of home \nhealth care; cuts that will reduce benefits for nearly 11 million \nAmerican seniors on Medicare Advantage; cuts that raid Medicare instead \nof fixing it; and cuts the American people vehemently oppose.\n  Democrats are in a tough situation on this bill. They want to expand \nthe government's reach into health care, but they do not have the \nmoney, and they don't have the support, more importantly, of the \nAmerican people. So\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\nwhat did they do? They decided to take the money they need out of \nMedicare, and that has only made their health care plan even less \npopular with the American people.\n  The Gregg amendment, which we will vote on later this afternoon, will \nhelp reverse the damage of last week's votes. The Gregg amendment says \nDemocrats can't raid Medicare, which is already in serious trouble, in \norder to pay for their $2.5 trillion bill. The money going out of \nMedicare's hospital insurance trust fund already exceeds its annual \nincome. It is already drying up. By 2017, the hospital insurance trust \nfund will not be able to pay full benefits, and that is before our \ncolleagues get their hands on it. This program needs to be fixed, not \npillaged to create another one.\n  So the Gregg amendment prohibits using money from Medicare to pay for \nany new government programs, for expanding existing programs, or for \nsubsidies. Instead, it directs that any money from Medicare be put back \ninto Medicare to strengthen and preserve it for future generations so \nwe can keep our promises. Frankly, this is common sense.\n  Americans don't want this bill to pass, and they certainly don't want \nit to pass at the expense of the roughly 40 million American seniors \nwho depend on Medicare. The Gregg amendment would keep that from \nhappening. A vote for the Gregg amendment is a vote to keep our promise \nto seniors.\n  We are also going to have a vote today on the Ensign amendment. The \namendment is simple: It is designed to ensure that injured patients--\nnot their lawyers--receive the vast majority of any settlement in a \nmedical malpractice suit. It says that since lawsuits should benefit \npatients, not lawyers, lawyers can't take more than one-third of the \nrecovery their clients receive. In other words, the lawyers can't take \nmore than one-third of what the client gets.\n  These are responsible limits. Moreover, they were written by a \nDemocrat and supported in the past by 21 of our current Democratic \ncolleagues, as well as the Vice President, and they would drive down \ncosts, which was the original purpose of reform.\n  The independent Congressional Budget Office has said comprehensive \nliability reforms would save the taxpayers more than $50 billion. The \nEnsign amendment is a step in that direction.\n  We will offer a better, step-by-step reform to end junk lawsuits \nagainst doctors and hospitals later in the consideration of this bill. \nI am hopeful my Democratic colleagues will support it again, since so \nmany of them have supported it in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nleader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill \nand, in part, respond to the minority leader. At the end of the day, \nwhy are we staying around the clock discussing this bill with the \nintent that we are going to pass the bill? It is simply that we cannot \ncontinue as we are. We are in a system whereby insurance is not solving \nthe Nation's health needs.\n  All you have to do is talk to a doctor. If they haven't already \npulled their hair out, they are about to, in that when they want to \ngive a certain treatment to a patient, they feel like they have to \nnegotiate with the insurance company. In fact, the insurance company \noften is dictating to them what treatment and what drugs they can or \ncannot use or look at the simple little cases we hear about.\n  They are absolutely simple cases but end up with catastrophic results \nbecause someone is in the middle of a treatment for something and then \nthey get a notice that their insurance company is going to cancel them \nor, perhaps, they have lost their job and they are desperately trying \nto get health insurance again and an insurance company uses, as an \nexcuse, that they had a preexisting condition. It may be a flimsy \nexcuse. I gave the example yesterday of a reason for denial being \nsomething as silly as a skin rash as a preexisting condition and so \nthey can't get health insurance now on their own. We have a system that \nis out of control.\n  We hear a lot about cost out here. We hear a lot about cost. Indeed, \nif we don't do something about the cost of health care, none of our \npeople are going to be able to afford it. Talk to corporate America and \nthe CEOs and listen to them as they describe what the insurance \ncompanies are saying to them and how they are jacking up their rates on \ntheir employer-sponsored group policies. Please, pray that you are not \nan individual who can't get a group policy and you are having to go out \nthere and try to find an individual policy because the likelihood is \nyou are not going to be able to afford it.\n  So cost is a critical factor. It is a factor also to the Government \nbecause the U.S. Government cannot afford the cost of Medicare as it \nkeeps exploding into the future. We have to bring these costs under \ncontrol. When you mix that in with the horror stories that we hear of \nthe 46 million people who don't have health insurance but who, when \nthey get sick, end up in the emergency room, we know they are getting \nthat care at the most expensive place while the rest of us pay. That is \na hidden tax.\n  On average, in this Nation, that hidden tax is $1,000 per family's \nhealth insurance policy. I can tell you, in my State of Florida it is \neven higher. It is $1,400. In Florida, a family with a group\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\ninsurance policy is paying $1,400 more per year to take care of those \nfolks who do not have insurance but end up getting sick, and that bill \nis paid by everybody else.\n  What I have described is a system that is in tilt. It is not working. \nThe whole purpose of this bill is to try to make it work so, No. 1, it \nis affordable; No. 2, that health insurance is available. At the end of \nthe day, we are going to pass it. At the end of the day, poor old Harry \nReid, our majority leader, is going to figure out a way to get 60 of us \nto come down here to shut off the filibuster so we can go to final \npassage and get it down to a conference committee in the House. At the \nend of the day, after that conference committee comes back, we are \ngoing to get those 60 votes again because this is so desperately \nneeded, despite all the supposed arguments we hear from the other side.\n  Can this product be improved? Of course it can. I certainly wish to \nshare, as I did in the Finance Committee, an amendment that would cause \nthe pharmaceutical industry to come up with some more money.\n  They have made a pledge, to their credit. Let me just say that Billy \nTauzin, the head of the pharmaceutical association, is smart. He knows \nwhat he is doing, and he is trying to play ball with the leadership and \nthe White House. I want the pharmaceutical industry to know this \nSenator appreciates that because with everybody else, such as the \ninsurance industry, trying to kill it deader than a doornail, at least \nthey are helping. But the pharmaceutical industry said they were coming \nforth with $80 billion over 10 years that they were going to \ncontribute. The hospital industry said they were going to contribute \nabout $150 billion over 10 years, and so forth. But, in fact, the \npharmaceutical industry is not contributing $80 billion.\n  Here is a Morgan Stanley analysis for investors of pharmaceutical \nstocks. This is their analysis of what is going to happen to the \npharmaceutical industry in the future. Morgan Stanley has said these \nguys are so smart, they are not contributing $80 billion. They are \ncontributing only $22 billion. Why? Because when they say they are \ngoing to contribute discounts to allow half of this so-called doughnut \nhole to be filled, that means there is going to be a lot more drugs \nsold.\n  Oh, by the way, the bill takes Medicaid from 100 percent to 133 \npercent. That is going to mean a lot more drugs sold as a result of \nthis bill.\n  So the real loss, or contribution, if you will, of the pharmaceutical \nindustry is $22 billion over 10 years, not $80 billion. That does not \neven include--remember, they just raised their prices 9 percent, three \ntimes the rate of inflation. So they are going to make up a lot of that \nanyway.\n  What I want to plead with the leadership in the White House and the \nleadership of the pharmaceutical industry--come back to your $80 \nbillion real figure over 10 years. One way to get there is the \namendment I offered in the Finance Committee that was rejected on a \nnarrow vote of 13 to 10. Out here on the floor it is my intention to \noffer that amendment. I filed it. It would produce, according to the \nCBO, $106 billion of taxpayer fund savings over 10 years because the \ndiscounts would have to be there for the Medicaid recipients who are \nentitled to discounts, but now, since they buy their drugs through \nMedicare, they can't get those discounts. That is because we changed \nthe law 6 years ago in the prescription drug benefit. That is just \nsimply not right.\n  I am not out here to try to punish anybody. I am out here to try to \nmake this work and to get 60 votes so we can go to final passage. But \neverybody has to do their part. Everybody has to contribute for their \npart.\n  I look forward to the future discussions as we close in on what \nprobably is going to end up being the final passage of this, probably a \nweek or 8 days down the road.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the schedulers have allocated 15 minutes \nto me, so I ask unanimous consent at this time that I may speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nopposition to the Ensign amendment. The authoritative statement on \nattorney's fees has come from the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners in a 2008 document entitled ``Countrywide Summary of \nMedical Malpractice Insurance.'' These are authoritative figures on how \nmuch the defense lawyers have taken and how much the plaintiffs' \nlawyers have taken.\n  It shows that the plaintiffs' lawyers, on this state of the record, \nare underpaid--paid less than defense lawyers--hardly the cause for an \namendment to lower attorney's fees even more for plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  These are the statistics by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners as to the attorney's fees. The attorney's fees for \ndefendants were $2.110 billion. The total recovery by plaintiffs was \n$4.09 billion. Calculating attorney's fees at one-third would mean that \nthe attorney's fees were, for the plaintiffs' attorneys, $1.340 \nbillion, substantially under the $2.110 billion for defense attorneys.\n  Attorneys who take on cases on a contingent fee do so because, unlike \ninsurance companies which have the funds to retain lawyers on an hourly \nbasis, most plaintiffs are unable to pay attorney's fees, do not have \nthe capital to do so. The arrangement is worked out that the fee will \nbe paid by a share of the recovery. If there is no recovery, there is \nno fee. Beyond the absence of the fee, the plaintiffs \ncharacteristically cannot afford the costs of litigation. When \ndepositions are taken or filings are made or various other costs arise, \nit is up to the plaintiff's lawyer to pay those fees and those are not \nreimbursed.\n  An effort is being made now to have those deductions on an annual \nbasis. The plaintiff's attorney cannot even take them in the year when \nthey are paid. So if you see a situation where, in absolute dollars \nplaintiffs' lawyers on contingent fees are paid less than defense \nlawyers, and you have added to that the risk factor that the \nplaintiff's lawyers may get nothing, there should even be a greater \ncompensation for plaintiffs' lawyers than defense lawyers. As these \nstatistics show, it is less.\n  Most of my experience in the courtroom has been as a prosecuting \nattorney, but some experience--I worked for a big law firm, Barnes, \nDechert, Price, Myers and Rhoads, representing the Pennsylvania \nrailroads, defendants, representing insurance companies. In the firm \npractice in that kind of representation, there is frequently a senior \nlawyer, junior lawyer, associate, paralegal, and multiple tiers running \nup the costs.\n  Most plaintiffs' lawyers do not have large firms. Many are single \npractitioners. To postulate a situation where the fees be cut even \nfurther is just not reasonable or not realistic.\n  When the contention has been made--it was just made by the Republican \nleader, repeated earlier contentions--that there are Senators who voted \nin favor of the Kennedy bill on liability reform, it is not so as \nrepresented. First of all, Senator Kennedy's bill in 1995 was a much \ndifferent bill. Second, it was a tabling motion. Those who voted \nagainst tabling were willing to consider the issue, not that they \nagreed with what was in the bill. Procedurally, when there is a motion \nto table, if it is passed the bill is off the floor. If a motion to \ntable is defeated, then the bill remains on the floor for \nconsideration. But it does not mean that people who want to consider \nthe bill are in agreement the bill ought to be enacted.\n  The issue of attorney's fees and the issue of malpractice litigation \nought to be left to the States in our Federal system. Pennsylvania, my \nState, is illustrative of the way State governments can handle the \nissue and deal with it to avoid excesses. In Pennsylvania there was a \nrule change made to require that before a malpractice suit could be \nbrought, there had to be a certification from a doctor that the case \nfell below applicable standards of care. A second major change was made \nwhich required that the medical malpractice action be brought only in \nthe county where the cause of action took place. That was a move aimed \nat eliminating so-called venue shopping, to go to a venue where there \nis likely to be a better result.\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\n  As a consequence of these two rule changes, the number of filings in \nPennsylvania dropped dramatically. With the comparison of the years \n2000 to 2002, it was noted that the rates dropped by more than 37 \npercent in 2003, continued to decline in every succeeding year, and in \n2008 had dropped 41.4 percent.\n  The improvement in the picture was further illustrated by the fact \nthat the reforms resulted in the reduction of premiums on malpractice \ninsurance. These reductions are in sharp contrast to 2002, when one \nleading carrier increased its rates an average of 40 percent and a \nsecond leading carrier increased its rates by 45 percent. Then the \nrates have been decreased consistently and in ensuing years.\n  Other indications in the success of Pennsylvania was the renewed \ninterest of companies that want to sell medical malpractice insurance \nin Pennsylvania--57 newly licensed entities are now writing medical \nmalpractice coverage since April, 2002. This is illustrative of the way \nthe States can deal with this issue. It ought to be left to the States.\n  Interestingly, the Senator from Nevada, who has proposed this \namendment, has filed legislation this year, S. 45, and in S. 45 he has \na different approach. He allocates for some recoveries up to 40 \npercent. Why there is a difference now, cutting it back to 33 percent, \nand then down to 25 percent, is unexplained. But when an amendment of \nthis sort is offered on a bill for comprehensive health care reform, it \nis not germane to the issues before the Senate. The standard of being \ngermane means whether there is any provision in the bill now which \nrelates to this matter.\n  Had this really been a serious effort to get legislation, the process \nor recourse to be followed would have been considerably different. The \nway to get legislation enacted is not merely to come before some bill \nand offer it without hearings before the committee of jurisdiction, \nwithout the consideration of witnesses. There have been no hearings on \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. Had there been \nhearings we would have been in a position to make a determination as to \nwhat are the real facts.\n  Are the fees collected by plaintiffs' attorneys on a contingent basis \nexcessive? What is the reality for the justification, in terms of the \ntime it takes and the expenses involved? But no request was made, to my \nknowledge, for a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. I do know that \nno hearing was held. So we do not have a factual basis for making an \nevaluation of this amendment at this time.\n  It is my hope that we will move from this amendment and take up the \nissues which are in dispute. We need to eliminate and reject the false \nrumors which have been advanced. The contention has been made that \nthere would be death panels as a result of this bill. That has been \nthoroughly debunked. There has been a context that there would be cuts \nin Medicare. We argued an amendment a few days ago on the contention \nthat there would be very substantial cuts in Medicare. The AARP opposed \nthat amendment because it was fallacious. It was untrue. AARP is an \noutstanding guardian of the interests and rights of senior citizens, \nand AARP opposed that amendment.\n  The contention has been made that there will be a government takeover \nof medical care which has also been disputed and pretty well disproved. \nWhen the government option is offered, it is just that. I believe \nAmerica would be well served by having a robust public option. But the \noption is nothing more or less than what it says. It is one \nalternative. Private insurers would still be in the picture.\n  There have been repeated contentions that there will be an increase \nin the deficit. President Obama is pledged not to sign a bill which \nwill add to the deficit. I am pledged not to vote for a bill which will \nadd to the deficit. When you take a look at what this bill will \naccomplish, there are very substantial savings in the current cost of \nmedical care, which is $2.4 trillion. I will be specific in what they \nare. With annual examinations available and incentives for people to \ntake annual examinations, they will be catching what could turn out to \nbe chronic ailments, very disabling, very expensive. Catching a problem \nwith a cardiac issue, with a heart problem, or catching breast cancer \nat an early stage or catching Hodgkin's at an early stage--I speak with \nsome experience about this issue--will cut down medical expenses \ntremendously. When there are advance directives, there will also be \nadditional savings. This bill provides for counseling for people who \nwant to know about advance directives. No one should tell anyone else \nwhat they ought to do about end-of-life medical care, but it is fair to \nsay consider it, make a decision, have a living will, do not leave it \nto the last minute when someone is rushed to the hospital and the \nburden then falls on family members. Estimates range as high as 27 \npercent of Medicare costs in the last few days, few weeks of a person's \nlife.\n  There are also very substantial savings available for changes in \nlifestyle. Safeway has demonstrated lower insurance premiums for people \nwho stop smoking, lower insurance premiums for people who have lower \ncholesterol. That is another major area of savings.\n  An additional area of savings would be to change the current approach \nof having fines imposed for Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Currently the criminal justice system results most of \nthe time in fines for health care fraud. That is totally ineffective. \nBut if there were jail sentences imposed, that would be a deterrent to \nothers, something I learned years ago as a prosecuting attorney. We can \nalso come to terms on the abortion issue, allowing women to pay for \nabortion coverage in their medical care. There is no reason they should \nbe denied in maintaining the principles of the Hyde amendment with no \nfederal payment for abortion services.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania for his opening remarks. He has addressed an issue \nrelative to a pending amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. He \nmakes note of a very critical flaw in this amendment. The Senator from \nNevada is restricting the ability of the victims of medical malpractice \nto go to court to recover by restricting the attorney's fees that can \nbe paid, contingency fees, because people usually don't have enough \nmoney to buy an attorney. The attorney takes the case and says: If you \nwin, then I get paid. If you lose, I don't get paid. Contingent fee \nbasis.\n  The Senator from Nevada is restricting the ability of these attorneys \nto represent plaintiffs, victims, on a contingency fee basis, but does \nnot restrict the defense attorneys and the amount they are paid. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania noted, the record is clear, the amount of \nmoney being paid to defense attorneys in medical malpractice cases is \n50 percent higher on an annualized basis than that paid to those \nrepresenting victims.\n  I won't question the motive of the Senator from Nevada, but the \neffect of his amendment is to reduce the likelihood that an injured \nvictim will be able to go to court and be represented by an attorney to \nmake their claim. Our system of justice has a courtroom and jury and a \njudge there to make that final decision. What the Senator from Nevada \ndoes is preclude and reduce the possibility that victims can recover. \nHow many people die each year in America from medical malpractice? The \nInstitute of Medicine told us 10 years ago the number was 98,000 people \na year. Many more are injured because of medical malpractice. How many \nlawsuits, claims are successfully filed each year in America for \nmedical malpractice, for injuries and deaths? About 11,000. A very \nsmall percentage of the actual victims of malpractice go to court. It \ndoesn't happen. Those who try to go to court are usually not rich \npeople so they do it on a contingency fee. What the Senator from Nevada \nis trying to do, unfortunately, is to close the courthouse door to \nfavor the defense of a malpractice case over the victim. That, to me, \nis unfortunate, and I hope we are successful in defeating it. For those \nwho are following the proceedings of the Senate today, either in person \nor through C-\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\nSPAN, it is an unusual--not unprecedented but unusual--meeting on \nSunday. But it is appropriate that we would do something extraordinary \nwhen you consider the matter at hand. This 2,000-page bill is the \nhealth care reform bill that has been in the works now for a year. It \nhas been considered by three committees in the House and two in the \nSenate. The Presiding Officer from New Mexico has the dubious \ndistinction of having been privy to all of the Senate committee \nproceedings and some extraneous proceedings. He has probably been \nsubjected to more debate on this issue than any other Member.\n  A lot of hard work has gone into this bill. Some critics say it is \ntoo long. There are too many pages. When you consider that we are \ntackling our health care system, which comprises one-sixth of our gross \ndomestic product--$1 out of every $6 spent in America--it is \nunderstandable that we would need to work carefully and try in a \ncomprehensive way to address all the issues.\n  So what does this bill do? First, it is historic in that it moves us \ntoward 94 percent of the American people having health insurance. Today \nabout 50 million people don't have health insurance. That is not \ncounting the people with bad health insurance. These are people who \nhave no health insurance. Some have lost jobs, some worked for \nbusinesses that can't afford insurance, and some can't afford to buy it \nthemselves, 50 million of them. Thirty million are going to move toward \ncoverage in this bill. It will be the largest percentage of Americans \nwith the security of health insurance protection in our Nation's \nhistory. That is what this bill does.\n  Secondly, this bill makes health insurance premiums more affordable. \nFor over 80 percent--some say over 90 percent--of the people in \nAmerica, they will see either a reduction in premium or a slowdown in \nthe rate of growth in health insurance premiums. That is something that \nis absolutely essential because health insurance premiums are breaking \nthe bank. Ten years ago, the average health insurance plan for a family \nof four cost $6,000 a year. That is a lot of money, $500 a month. That \nwas 10 years ago. Now it has doubled. The average is $12,000 a year, \n$1,000 a month for a family of four for health insurance coverage. That \nis the average, to work and earn $1,000 a month strictly for health \ninsurance. What is the projection in 8 years? That it will double again \nto $24,000, that you will be working and earning $2,000 a month just to \npay for health insurance. That is unaffordable for so many people. That \nis why that is one of the highest priorities in this bill.\n  The third thing this bill does is to give people across America a \nfighting chance against the health insurance companies. These private \ninsurance companies are some of the wealthiest companies in America and \npay the highest amounts to their CEOs each and every year. What we are \ntrying to do is to make sure they don't turn down people when they need \nhelp the most. Too many of these insurance companies, as has been noted \nmany times, raise the issue of preexisting conditions and say: We are \nnot going to cover that particular surgery or that particular drug \nbecause you had a preexisting condition you didn't disclose. They game \nthe system against the person who is sick. That is going to change. \nThis bill will provide for coverage despite preexisting conditions, and \nwe won't allow the insurance companies to assert a limit, a lifetime \nlimit on what they can pay.\n\n  You know what happens. You get seriously ill, and they cut you off. \nWhat is happening today is that two out of three people who file for \nbankruptcy in America do so because of medical bills, bills they can't \npay. That tells us that the number of people facing this threat is \nhuge. But even worse is the fact that some 74 percent of those filing \nbankruptcy already have health insurance. It turns out the health \ninsurance was not worth much when they needed it.\n  The last thing this bill does--and one of the most important things--\nis it doesn't add to the deficit. President Obama told us to do this \njob but don't make the deficit worse. The Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is the referee and umpire when it comes to the cost of bills, \ncame back and said our bill will actually reduce the Federal deficit by \n$130 billion over the first 10 years and $650 billion over the next 10. \nBringing down the cost of health care brings down the cost of \ngovernment health programs. It saves us money, saving families and \nbusinesses money, saving the government money. It is the largest \ndeficit reduction bill ever considered by Congress. It is before us \nnow.\n  It is no surprise--we heard this morning from the Republican Senate \nleader, and we have heard before--that there are those who are arguing \nthis is a dangerous bill and this bill should not be passed. I asked my \nstaff to do a little bit of work on previous debates right here on the \nfloor of the Senate and what was said.\n  In 1934, when Congress was considering the Social Security Program, \nwhich gave everybody a basic retirement plan, an insurance plan for \nretirement, even after the Social Security bill came to the Senate \nfloor, not including health insurance, a Republican Senator from \nDelaware, Daniel Hastings, said on the floor about Social Security:\n\n       I fear it may end the progress of a great country.\n\n  A Congressman from the State of New York, James Wadsworth, in the \nsame debate over Social Security, said that the passage of Social \nSecurity:\n\n       . . . opens the door and invites the entrance into the \n     political field of a power so vast, so powerful as to \n     threaten the integrity of our institutions and to pull the \n     pillars of the temple down upon the heads of our descendants.\n\n  We know that when former Senator from Ohio Robert Taft was addressing \nthe effort by President Harry Truman to have universal health care in \nAmerica, he said:\n\n       I consider it socialism.\n\n  It was used against Lyndon Johnson. That same charge was used against \nBill Clinton. It is virtually being used today. When we hear the \nRepublicans who are opposing this bill come to the floor, I have a \nbasic question to ask them. We have been at this debate for a year. \nWhere is your bill? What do you want to do?\n  Oh, they tell us: We have some bills, and you are going to see them \nany day now. Well, I would like to. I would like to see the \ncomprehensive health reform bill from the Republican side of the aisle. \nThis is ours, and it has been on the Internet for 2 weeks for everybody \nin this Nation to read word by word, line by line. Sadly, there is no \nRepublican bill.\n  I know there are two possible reasons for that. This was hard work. \nThis was not easy politically or otherwise and they have not engaged in \nthat hard work. What we have seen are press releases and speeches, \ngraphs and pictures, but no bill, no comprehensive health care reform \nbill from the Republican side. Secondly, there are many on that side of \nthe aisle who like this system of health care. They agree with the \nhealth insurance companies: Let's keep it the way it is.\n  But Americans know better. We are going to work today in the Senate \non this bill, as we should. While we are working today, 14,000 \nAmericans are going to lose their health insurance. Mr. President, \n14,000 Americans lost their health insurance yesterday, and 14,000 will \nlose it tomorrow, and every single day of the year. That is how many \npeople, despite their best efforts, lose their coverage.\n  We have to stop that. It is time for us to provide the kind of peace \nof mind that every single family deserves in America when it comes to \nquality and affordable health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2927\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about one of \nthe amendments we are going to be voting on later today. As we stand \nhere today, we are debating the bill on the floor, the health care \nbill, where we are trying to do a couple things at one time, and I \nthink we can, and I think this bill does it, even though we will make \nsome changes to it.\n  We are trying to improve the quality of care for Americans, whether \nthey get their health care through a public program or through a \nprivate insurance company or a private plan. We are trying to finally \nuse preventive measures to make people healthier and have better health \noutcomes.\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\n  We are also working to reduce costs. If you want to talk about it in \nterms of a doctor and a patient or a health care system and an \nAmerican, who should benefit from the health care system, we basically \nwant to have people get the care they need from the doctor they choose.\n  What we are engaged in now is a debate about an amendment which the \nother side says is about the fees going to trial lawyers. That is the \nway they like to talk about it, and I know that is popular. When the \nother side makes an amendment such as this, they like to have a target, \nso their target is trial lawyers. But, unfortunately, for this debate, \nI think it is misleading because this amendment, which I would urge \npeople to vote against, is not about lawyers. It is about victims and \nwhether we are going to ensure that victims have a shot, a fair chance, \nwhen they have a claim for medical negligence when they have been \ninjured as a result of negligent conduct.\n  I said before, we are debating the health care bill and we are \ntalking about costs. This amendment will do nothing to lower costs. \nWhat it will do is not lower anyone's costs. What it will do is \nincrease the cost or the burden a claimant has to bear when they have a \nclaim against any kind of hospital or doctor in the case of a medical \nnegligence case. So the question is, are we going to enable people who \ndo not have the means to bring cases versus very powerful interests? \nThat is one of the basic questions we will answer with regard to this \namendment.\n  I would hope if a member of my family or any family--and I think this \nis true of everyone in this Chamber--if a member of your family, as a \nresult of medical negligence, had to bring a claim, you would hope that \nindividual could walk into a courtroom or file a claim with someone who \nhas the skill and the ability to be their advocate. Because I will tell \nyou one thing, they are going to be up against a very powerful \ninterest: insurance companies that write medical liability policies, an \nincredibly powerful interest.\n  A lot of us come at this question through our own personal \nexperience, through the experiences of our families. I had a \ngrandfather who I never met, my father's father, Alphonsus Casey. He, \nlike a lot of people in northeastern Pennsylvania, as a young kid, went \ninto the coal mines at a very young age. He worked as a mule boy. One \nof the days he was tending to the mules in that mine, just as a kid, 11 \nor 12 years old at the time, he was kicked by a mule. He got a scar \nthat started above his eyebrow and went across his face, split his lip, \nand went down through one side of his chin. So he understood injury as \na child, injury in the course of working. I think he also understood \nthat when he became a lawyer, many years later, well into his \nadulthood. He understood what it is like to suffer an injury and to \nmake a claim for an injury. But what he did is represent injured \nworkers. That was his law practice. I wonder what he would say if he \nwere here talking about what happens to victims when they have an \ninjury they want redress for.\n  Like on so many other things in this debate, I think the other side \nof the aisle is carrying water for the insurance companies. Just my \nopinion, but I think that is the case. Yet in the case of medical \nnegligence and what happens in the real world, we know that 98,000 \ndeaths a year are from preventable medical errors. Let me say that \nagain. We know there are 98,000 deaths in America a year, according to \nthe Institute of Medicine, from preventable medical errors.\n  So what this amendment does is deny patients the attorney of their \nchoice. It further restricts access to the courts. It drives up costs \nfor victims. When we talk about bringing a case and the barriers to \ndoing that, that is not some future result of this amendment. Oh, I \nthink this amendment will make that problem a lot worse. But right \nnow--no matter what happens in this debate, no matter what happens on \nthe vote on this amendment--there are barriers right now for people to \nbring a lawsuit. It costs, in many cases, thousands, if not tens of \nthousands, to bring a case. And then to see a case all the way through \ncosts a lot more than that.\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about allowing someone \nwho has a claim for a serious injury to go see a lawyer and to sit down \nwith that lawyer and enter into an agreement for the fee, whatever that \nfee will be, whatever that will be. If that lawyer and that person, \nthat patient or victim, goes forward with the case, they bear a risk. \nThe victim bears a risk that they will not be successful and that at \nthe end of that they will have no recovery at all.\n  But because of the way the contingent fee works, the lawyer bears a \nrisk as well that he or she will not be paid, and they also stand a \nrisk of having to pay for costs the victim cannot pay--and the lawyer \nwill bear those costs throughout the pursuit of that case.\n  So here is what we are talking about. This is basically a debate \nabout victims and whether they are going to have the kind of \nrepresentation they need. If I were going in to have surgery in a \nhospital, I would hope the surgeon would be someone of the best, the \nhighest skill possible. I would want the best surgeon, as I take on \nthat battle. Anyone would.\n  I would hope we would not do something in the debate to reduce the \nchances that a victim of medical negligence could go into a courtroom \nor file a claim with the best, most highly skilled lawyer they can \nfind. I would hope we would not want to do anything that would injure \nthat basic right.\n  It is interesting that this amendment applies only to patients--it \ndoes not apply to anyone else--patients who would become victims of \nmedical negligence.\n  In conclusion, in terms of what happens in our States, States \nregulate the conduct of lawyers. They do it all the time. But we also \nhave evidence from the States about what happens in these kinds of \ncases. In Pennsylvania, for example, in most counties, as to cases \ngoing to trial because of medical malpractice claims--those kinds of \nlawsuits--in most counties in Pennsylvania, 90 percent of those cases \nare won by the defense, won by the insurance company. That is the \nevidence in Pennsylvania.\n\n  I know we have others who are ready to speak on this and other \namendments. But I think we should make it very clear. On this \namendment, this is a debate about two parties: victims of medical \nnegligence versus insurance companies. It is time to choose up which \nside you stand on. Unfortunately, this amendment is very clearly \ndrafted and intended to help insurance companies, not victims of \nmedical negligence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold that suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, I want to \ntake a moment to review today's program. This is the seventh day of \ndebate on the health care reform bill. It has been nearly 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nsince the majority leader moved to proceed to this bill. We have now \nconsidered 14 amendments, and we have conducted 10 rollcalls.\n  Between now and 3:15 this afternoon, the Senate will continue to \ndebate the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, on \ninsurance company executive compensation and, at the same time, we will \ndebate the amendment by Senator Ensign limiting attorney's fees. The \nmajority controls the first 60 minutes, and the Republicans will \ncontrol the next 60 minutes. At 3:15 p.m., the Senate will conduct \nback-to-back votes on or in relation to the Lincoln amendment and the \nEnsign amendment.\n  Thereafter, we expect to turn to another Democratic first-degree \namendment and another Republican first-degree amendment. That is the \nlineup at this time. It is possible the Senate may vote on those next \ntwo amendments today. As a result, additional votes are possible \nfollowing the two votes at 3:15.\n  Once again, I thank all Senators for their cooperation and courtesy \non this extraordinary weekend session.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that Senator Harkin be next recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will have more to say about this later. \nBut there has been so much talk about fear, fear, fear. Everybody has a \nfear. Let's get away from that. It is time to quit talking about fear. \nLet's talk about hope. Let's talk about the realities of\n\n[[Page S12529]]\n\nwhat is affecting people out there, what we are trying to do to make \ntheir lives better. Why do we always want to inject fear into people? \nLet's talk about hope. Let's talk about real people and what this bill \ndoes.\n  As shown in this picture, this is Sarah Posekany of Cedar Falls, IA. \nLet me tell you her story. It is incredible. She was diagnosed with \nCrohn's disease when she was 15 years old. During her first year in \ncollege, she ran into complications from the disease and had to drop \nclasses. Because she was no longer a full-time student, her parents' \nprivate health insurance company terminated her coverage. Then the \nmedical bills piled up. Four years later, she found herself $180,000 in \ndebt, and was forced to file for bankruptcy.\n  Sarah has undergone seven surgeries--seven. Here is what is \ndisturbing. Two of those came as a direct result of not being able to \nafford medication. So again, it is an incredible story, but it is a \ntrue story.\n  So many people have to go through this. Our bill says: Look, you can \nstay on your parents' coverage until you are age 26, and--guess what--\nno preexisting conditions will apply to you from here on out. Think \nabout Sarah when we are talking about this bill and the hope she \nneeds--and so many like her--that we are going to change this system to \nmake her life better.\n  Second, this is a picture of Tasha Hudson of Des Moines, IA. She is a \nsingle mother, with three kids. She had a job which provided health \ninsurance, but she took a new job that paid her more, 50 percent more. \nYou would think: Isn't that the American way? You learn, you get \nbetter, you get a better paying job. The problem is, the private sector \njob did not come with health insurance. Despite the higher pay, she \ncould not afford the coverage.\n  Ironically, her higher pay led to cuts in her Medicaid benefits and \nthe loss of childcare services. As a result, Tasha is now in the \nprocess of returning to a lower paying job, despite its limited \nopportunities, for one reason: because it will provide health insurance \nfor her family. These are real people. These are the people to whom we \nneed to give hope.\n\n  Here is one last one. Eleanor Pierce lives in Cedar Falls, IA. She \nlost her job when her company was eliminated. She had the option of \npurchasing COBRA, but she couldn't afford it. So she searched for \ncoverage, but because of high blood pressure--preexisting condition--\nshe was denied access. So age 62, suffering from high blood pressure, \nshe had no choice but to go without insurance.\n  That is why we need this bill. Not for fear--let's quit talking about \nfear. Let's talk about hope for the people I just talked about, the \nhope that their lives will be better, that they will get the insurance \ncoverage they need, that they will be able to get on with their lives \nand not have to go so far in debt that they have to go into bankruptcy.\n  If you are a 62-year-old woman with a serious heart condition such as \nthe one Eleanor has, high blood pressure, you just don't have a prayer, \nyou are on your own, and the odds of premature death are disturbingly \nhigh. We can and must do better. That is what we ought to be talking \nabout: hope for the future, not fear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut \nall the remaining time, and if he wants to speak for a little longer, I \nknow we can make some accommodations with the other side.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes is remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, some of these numbers get thrown around so much that \nit is almost dizzying. I wonder how the average person, even someone \nwho is intently listening to these debates, can sort it all out: 47 \nmillion who have no coverage; 14,000 people every single day in our \ncountry who lose health care coverage either because they are thrown \ninto personal bankruptcy or because of medical costs or job loss around \nthe country--14,000 a day, every day, 7 days a week. Just do the math. \nFor 7 or 8 days, we have been debating this legislation. You can run \nthe numbers yourself to determine over that period of time how many \ncitizens across the country have found themselves in that free fall, \nthat dreaded fear that a child or a loved one may end up needing care. \nIt is not as though you can postpone the decision to some later time, \nas you can about whether to take a vacation or to buy that new car or \nmaybe to spend more than you thought you would over the holidays coming \nup. If you now have a medical emergency and you are one of those 14,000 \na day who have lost coverage, what do you do? So sometimes the sheer \nmagnitude of these numbers can cause us to lose sight of the individual \nstories, anecdotes that are not exclusive or isolated but commonplace \nstories that are happening as we speak here on this Sunday, on a rare \nSunday session in the Senate because of the importance of this issue.\n  So I rise today to share a few stories from my own State that I think \nput a face on these issues and why we are here. Let me start by asking \nsome questions because I think too often when we debate these issues, \nsometimes we are so removed as Members of this body, from what goes on \nin the daily lives of the people we represent that we fail to \nappreciate what is happening right outside these doors from this very \nChamber on a daily and an hourly occasion. The 535 of us who have the \nprivilege of serving in the Congress, including Members of the other \nbody, none of us here are worrying about losing our health care. Not a \nsingle Member here ever spent a nanosecond worrying about whether they \nare going to be dropped from their health care coverage--not one.\n  Is there anybody among the 535 of us who ever worries about whether \nwe will be able to afford health care insurance? I don't know of anyone \nwho ever worries about that, of the 535 who are here.\n  Has anyone ever been up late at night with a child or a loved one, \nwondering whether they are going to be able to afford the treatment \nthat child may need, or that loved one? I would go so far as to say I \ndon't think that happens here. God forbid if we are confronted with a \nchild or a loved one who needs that care. We may worry about that, but \nwe are not going to worry about whether the insurance will be there or \nwhether we will have the ability to pay for it. Not one of us ever \nworries about that.\n  Has anybody ever spent hours being bounced from voice mail to voice \nmail to voice mail trying to find out why the insurance company you pay \nthousands of dollars to every year suddenly refuses to pay for your \nspouse's cancer treatments? Has that ever happened to anyone here? I \ndoubt it. I sincerely doubt it.\n  Is there anyone stuck in a job that pays very little because you \ncan't afford to change jobs because you have a preexisting condition \nand you know if you go to that new job that may pay more, you are going \nto find yourself without the insurance coverage to take care of that \npreexisting condition? No one here worries about being in that \nparticular predicament.\n  Has anyone been driven into bankruptcy, any Members of Congress, \nbecause they had a medical crisis? We now know that 62 percent of all \nbankruptcies this year alone are medical crisis related, and 70 percent \nof that 62 percent have health care insurance--70 percent of that 62 \npercent.\n  Is anybody here a small business owner who has had to choose between \ncutting coverage or putting your employees out of work?\n  Well, the answer to all of these questions obviously is a resounding \nno. None of us have ever had to grapple with what 14,000 people do in \nthis country every day: losing their coverage, or the underinsured who \ndiscover all of a sudden that the coverage they thought they had \ndoesn't quite cover the problems, or the out-of-pocket expenses you \nhave to pay before getting to insurance are so high that you can't \npossibly meet them. That goes on every minute of every day all across \nour Nation, and it is why we are here on this Sunday in December, to \ntry to finally see if we cannot come to terms and start moving on a \ncoverage program, a health care and health insurance coverage program \nthat makes it possible for all of our fellow citizens to be in the same \nposition we are.\n  None of us are immune from health care crises. Every one of us here \nhas grappled with that at one time or another. The difference is, we \ndon't ever worry about the ability to pay for it, losing our coverage, \nhaving to go through what every other citizen does every single day.\n\n[[Page S12530]]\n\n  These are real people who go through this. We can get so lost in the \nweeds on this debate. I am not suggesting the details are unimportant--\nthey are important--but we are losing sight of the whole; that is, for \n80 years every single Congress, whether it has been controlled by \nRepublicans or Democrats, whether a Democrat or Republican has been in \nthe White House, has been unable to even come close to solving this \nproblem.\n  We are now that close--closer than we have ever been in our history--\nto coming up with a health care system that can begin to take care of \nthat basic right every American ought to have--and it is a right--that \nif you are a citizen of the United States and you get sick, you ought \nnot to be shoved into bankruptcy, lose your job, or have your family \nsuffer because of your economic circumstances. The privilege of getting \ngood health care ought not to be based on wealth; it ought to be based \non the fact that we live in the United States of America and we are \nable to take care of our fellow citizens when they reach those \ndifficult times every one of us will at one point or another.\n  There are stories, and I know my colleagues have them as well.\n  A young woman in Connecticut, Maria, diagnosed with non-Hodgkins \nlymphoma, asked her insurance company to cover her treatments. The \ninsurance company found out that Maria had once gone to a doctor for \nwhat she thought was a pinched nerve. Even though no tests had been \ndone for cancer, they denied her claim based on a preexisting \ncondition. How many have heard these stories? She passed away, by the \nway, from that illness.\n  A young man named Frank disclosed on his insurance application that \nhe sometimes got headaches. Some months after he got his policy, he \nwent in for a routine eye exam. The doctor saw something he didn't like \nand sent him to a neurologist, who told him that he had multiple \nsclerosis. The insurance company told him he should have known his \noccasional headaches were a sign of MS and took away his coverage \nretroactively. Frank's doctor wrote them a letter saying there was no \nway anyone could have known that an ordinary headache was related to \nmultiple sclerosis. But the insurance left Frank out to dry, sticking \nhim with a $30,000 medical bill he couldn't afford. Frank's condition \ngot worse. He had to leave his job and go on public assistance.\n  Kevin Galvin is a small business owner in my State. I have met with \nKevin a number of times, and we have talked over the last year or so \nduring my Connecticut Prescriptions for Change listening tour. Kevin \nowns a small business, a maintenance company. He employs seven people, \nsome older, some younger. He can't afford to insure them. He would like \nto, but he can't afford it. His younger employees use the emergency \nroom as their regular doctor. If one of them has a child with an ear \ninfection----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute, I ask my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues.\n  Kevin has three employees in their twenties and thirties. This is \nKevin here, by the way, running this maintenance shop in Hartford, CT. \nHe has employees in their twenties and thirties who have never had a \nphysical or a dental cleaning by a hygienist. One of them, age 28, with \ntwo children to support, was out of work for 12 weeks and nearly died \nfrom a staph infection he got from an untreated cavity.\n  Kevin has been working hard to try to provide for these people, but \nhe has recently lost people who worked for him for more than 20 years \nbecause they got a job that paid less than he pays them but they can \nget health insurance coverage. So here is an employee who leaves a job \nin order to get a job where he can have health insurance.\n  Again, small business owners who go through this are all across our \ncountry.\n  My simple point is this: Anyone who suggests this bill is the end-all \nobviously hasn't been through this process over the last several years. \nThere will be a lot more work that needs to be done in the years to \ncome. But we need to do what no other Congress has done before: We need \nto start. That is why I feel so passionately about getting this bill \npassed and moving it forward. I ask my colleagues to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire and 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nnext hour which we control we be allowed to enter into colloquies on \nour side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have certainly heard a lot of talk about \nMedicare over the last few days, and we have actually even voted on a \nfew amendments, but they have all had no force of law, and they have \njust been statements of purpose. They are called sense of the Senate. \nEvery one of these sense of the Senate has had as its purpose to try to \ngive political cover to Members on the other side relative to the issue \nof the fact that this bill reduces Medicare spending by close to $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in the first 10 years, $1 trillion when it is fully \nimplemented over a 10-year period, and $2.5 trillion over the first 20 \nyears, and that those reductions in spending in Medicare are going to \ntranslate immediately and unquestionably into a reduction in service \nand coverage for Medicare-recipient senior citizens. The money from \nthat--the $\\1/2\\ trillion in the first 10 years, the $1 trillion in the \n10 years that we are doing the implementation, and the $2.5 trillion \nover the next 20 years--is being taken out of the senior citizen \nprogram called Medicare, and it is going to be moved over into a \nbrandnew entitlement program and into the expansion of Medicaid.\n  Those dollars will be used to create new Federal programs for people \nwho have never paid, for the most part, into the Medicare \nhospitalization fund; for people who are not senior citizens and \ntherefore do not, arguably, deserve to receive the benefit of the \nMedicare hospitalization fund. As a result, seniors will see their \nbenefits reduced and other people will get a new benefit through the \nFederal Government. Ironically, the new benefit, this new entitlement, \nwill not be adequately funded either, but large portions of part of \nthat funding are going to come from the Medicare trust fund.\n  The problem here is that the Medicare trust fund is insolvent. It has \n$30 trillion of outstanding exposure to the Medicare trust fund, which \nwe don't know how we are going to pay for as seniors retire over the \nnext 20, 30, 40 years. Thus, there will be a reduction in the benefits \nto Medicare, a reduction to Medicare recipients, a reduction in the \nMedicare trust fund to the tune of $\\1/2\\ trillion in the first 10 \nyears, $1 trillion when it is fully implemented, and $2.5 trillion over \nthe next 20 years.\n  That type of reduction shouldn't go to create new Federal programs. \nIf it is going to be done at all, it should go to making the Medicare \ntrust fund more solvent. Well, that has been essentially the tenure of \nsome of the proposals from the other side of the aisle. We have heard a \nlot of people on the other side of the aisle say: All right, we are not \ngoing to cut Medicare. We are not going to cut Medicare. We are just \ngoing to reduce it by $\\1/2\\ trillion, and then we are going to create \na new program with it. We are not going to do this to the seniors. We \nare not going to take their money and start a new program.\n  We have heard that statement in different levels of machinations from \nthe other side of the aisle quite regularly.\n  I do, however, for the record, want to say--because I have immense \nrespect for him, and he has been totally forthcoming on these issues, \nand very accurate--that the chairman of the Finance Committee has not \nrepresented that is what is happening with the Medicare funds.\n  He has represented on the floor that those Medicare funds that are \nbeing reduced--those reductions in Medicare spending will go to create \na new program. But a lot of folks on the other side have said they \ndon't agree with\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\nthat, that is not what they are intending to do. Some of the sense of \nthe Senate have clearly had that implication in their passage.\n  So what does that amendment do that I am going to be offering? It \nshoots real bullets. No longer is it a political statement, a sense of \nthe Senate, a thought process, a virtual event saying you want to \nprotect the Medicare trust funds. This amendment is real. It protects \nthe Medicare trust fund. It is real hard language, which says that if \nyou vote for this amendment, you are voting not to move Medicare trust \nfund dollars out of the Medicare trust fund, away from Medicare \nrecipients, over to start a new program; that any new program started \nin this bill must be paid for by something other than Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. So this shoots with real bullets. It says, essentially, if \nyou vote for this amendment, you are voting to keep the Medicare \ndollars with Medicare, not to take those dollars that are being cut out \nof senior citizen programs and move them to create a brandnew set of \nprograms at the Federal level.\n  This will be the vote that I believe determines whether we raid the \nMedicare funds for the purpose of creating a new Federal program or \nwhether we maintain the integrity of the Medicare system. This is a \nserious amendment, and it is a real amendment. There is no sense of the \nSenate about this. This is enforceable language. Anybody voting against \nthis amendment is formally voting, unquestionably and unequivocally, to \ntake $\\1/2\\ trillion of Medicare funds, in the first 10 years, and move \nthem over to fund a new program; to take $1 trillion from the Medicare \nfunds, when fully implemented, and move them to fund a new program; to \ntake $2.5 trillion, over the next 20 years, of Medicare benefits that \nshould be going to seniors--because they are Medicare funds and should \nbe benefiting the solvency of the Medicare funds--and moves them to \ncreate new programs. Anybody who votes against this amendment is \naccomplishing that; they are cutting Medicare for the purpose of \ncreating a new program. If you vote for the amendment, to the extent \nMedicare savings occur, they would not be used to fund new programs. It \nis a real, enforceable amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the President of the United States is \nreportedly traveling to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Democrats in a \nfew moments. Unfortunately, Republicans are not invited, which follows \nan established pattern, where notwithstanding the public statements \nthat Republican ideas are welcome, they have been rejected at every \nstage of the development of this 2,074-page bill. There were party line \nvotes in the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee and virtually \nevery Republican idea was rejected. The President is coming to rally \nour Democratic friends to basically do it in a ``my way or the \nhighway'' sort of way. They are going to own it 1,000 percent.\n  I think it is perhaps very timely to recall some of the President's \npromises because, frankly, if the President follows the promises he \nmade to the American people, he will not be able to sign this bill or \nanything similar to it.\n  First of all, talking about transparency, he said we are going to \nhave negotiations around a big table on C-SPAN so people can see who is \nmaking arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making \narguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.\n  The reality is, this bill was merged between the Finance bill and the \nHELP Committee bill--merged behind closed doors, with only three \nSenators present and presumably their staffs.\n  Another promise the President made was this:\n\n       The plan I am announcing tonight--\n\n  This was during the joint session of Congress, I believe, we \nattended.\n\n     --will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, \n     our businesses, and our government.\n\n  This is a pledge the President made to the American people. That was \nhis stated goal for this bill. We see something very different in this \n2,074-page bill, a different reality. We see that premiums for those in \nthe individual market--families--will be increased by 10 percent by \n2016, according to the CBO. You don't have to take my word for it. It \nis not some insurance company talking. This is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Businesses that fail to comply with the job-killing mandates in \nthe bill will face additional taxes of $28 billion--yes, during a \nrecession when unemployment is at 10 percent. That is according to the \nCBO. They also say taxpayers will see Federal outlays for health care \ncoverage increase by $160 billion over 10 years.\n  This is from the dean of Harvard Medical School. He said:\n\n       In discussions with dozens of health care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health care \n     spending.\n\n  So much for bending the proverbial cost curve. Then there is this \npromise--another solemn promise. The President said:\n\n       I have made a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal \n     health care bill into law by the end of my first term as \n     President that will cover every American--\n\n  This bill obviously does not.\n\n     --and cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to \n     $2,500 a year.\n\n  As I mentioned, under the CBO score, the average premium for families \nin the individual market will go up by $2,100, not go down by $2,500--\nanother promise made that will not be kept if this bill is passed into \nlaw.\n  Then the President talked about deficits. There has been a lot about \nthis bill being so-called deficit neutral. If you cut enough benefits \nfor seniors and raise taxes enough on everybody, you can produce a \ndeficit-neutral bill. This bill will spend $2.5 trillion over the next \n10 years with full implementation. President Obama's chief actuary at \nthe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services called the ability to \nsign a bill such as this, without raising the deficit, ``unrealistic \nand doubtful.'' David Broder, the dean of the Washington press corps, \nsaid:\n\n       While the CBO said that both the House-passed bill and the \n     one Reid has drafted meet Obama's test for being budget \n     neutral, every expert I have talked to says that the public \n     has it right. These bills, as they stand, are budget busters.\n\n  Then there is the promise of choice. The President said the American \npeople ought to have choice when it comes to health care, their choice \nof their doctors and health plans. The fact is, this bill would consign \n60 million Americans to a health care ``gulag'' called Medicaid. I say \nthat because, although Medicaid provides what some people would say is \ncoverage, it certainly doesn't provide access. In the metroplex of \nTexas, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, 38 percent of doctors will not see a \nnew Medicaid patient because of Medicaid's low rates.\n  Then there is this claim that it will not raise taxes. Well, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation indicates that 38 percent of the people \nearning less than $200,000 a year will see a tax increase under this \nbill. In other words, this is another promise the President made that \nwill be violated if this bill is passed into law because taxes will go \nup for 38 percent of the people. As a matter of fact, out of that 38 \npercent, 24 percent of them will experience a tax increase, even after \ntaking into account the premium tax credit that is being paid under \nthis bill. Another promise made, another promise that cannot be kept if \nthis bill becomes law.\n  Then there is this one. The President said:\n\n       So don't pay attention to those scary stories about how \n     your benefits will be cut. That will never happen on my \n     watch. I will protect Medicare.\n\n  Dr. Elmendorf, the head of the CBO, said Medicare's managed care \nplans would see reduced benefits--I am sorry, that is according to CBS \nNews. The chief actuary said:\n\n       Providers might end their participation in the program, \n     possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries.\n\n  Dr. Elmendorf said you would see additional benefits that seniors get \nunder Medicare Advantage cut by about half. Another promise, another \npromise broken if this bill becomes law.\n\n[[Page S12532]]\n\n  There is this, which pertains to the Ensign amendment pending on the \nfloor. The President said:\n\n       I want to work with the American Medical Association so we \n     can scale back the excessive defensive medicine that \n     reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we \n     are providing better care simply--rather than simply more \n     treatment. So this is going to be a priority for me.\n\n  If this is a priority for the President of the United States, it is \napparently not a priority of those who have authored this bill because \nall that is contained in the bill is a nonbinding sense of the Senate. \nWe have heard that medical liability reform laws, such as those that \nhave been passed and implemented in Texas--if passed nationwide, this \nbill could bend the cost curve by $54 billion over 10 years. Yet all we \nget is a watered-down sense of the Senate that has no binding effect at \nall.\n  If the President was sincere about making those promises to the \nAmerican people, then this Congress ought to be sincere about helping \nhim keep that promise. The fact is, time after time, this bill breaks \nthe promises that President Obama made to the American people. It is \nnot too late to change that. I hope that, today, when he meets with \nSenate Democrats behind closed doors, to the exclusion of Republicans, \nthere will be some discussion of how can we help you keep those \npromises to the American people because this bill does not.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time as they need to several \nSenators for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to see my friends on the \nfloor again today--very intelligent people, such as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and my friend, Senator Enzi, who is an expert on this \nissue, and the rest of us who know that a fight not joined is a fight \nnot enjoyed. I look forward to another spirited discussion with my \ncolleagues.\n  Maybe if I could, to start with, I will take up a point about the \ndebate and discussion we had yesterday on the floor with the Senator \nfrom Montana, the chairman of the committee, where he asked me why did \nI think that certain groups supported this legislation pending before \nthe Senate. I said I didn't know what kinds of deals had been cut. I \nreferred to the deal made with PhRMA and others. I didn't know exactly \nwhy because I am not taken into the discussions and negotiations off \nthe floor in the office of the majority leader.\n  There seems to have been some blowback on that, and somebody said \nmaybe that wasn't appropriate to talk about deals that were cut. This \nmorning, on the front page of the Washington Post, it says:\n\n       Deals Cut with Health Groups May Be at Peril.\n\n  Perhaps the Washington Post is impugning the reputation of someone or \nstaffers or others. They have certainly impugned mine from time to \ntime. But the fact is, this is a news story.\n  Again, I go back, very briefly, because we have a lot to talk about, \nmy colleagues and I. The fact is, there have been deals cut, just like \nis reported in the Washington Post this morning, as has been reported \nall over America about the deals cut with various interest groups that \ndon't necessarily represent the people they claim to represent. I know \nthe American Medical Association does not represent the majority of \nphysicians and caregivers. In the State of Arizona, I know too many of \nthem. I also know they have a very large lobbying presence in our \nNation's Capitol, as do the other interested groups that have ``cut \ndeals'' that may be at peril now, according to the Washington Post.\n  With that, I will mention, again, that the doctor is in. Would the \ndoctor care to give us some enlightened information, before we give our \nvarious opinions on this issue?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with the Senator from Arizona. I looked at \nanother one of his favorite newspapers, the New York Times, today \nbecause we--\n  Mr. McCAIN. My absolute favorite.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. On this floor have said the Democratic proposal is \ncutting the Medicare the seniors of this country depend on for their \nhealth care. We pointed out that they have taken $120 billion away from \nMedicare Advantage. Mr. President, 11 million seniors use Medicare \nAdvantage. One out of four seniors is on Medicare. The reason they \nsigned up for Medicare Advantage is because there is an advantage for \nthe seniors--preventive care, coordinated care, things we know are \nimportant.\n  Yesterday on this floor, the Democrats voted to cut away from home \nhealth care. This is a lifeline for homebound patients. It helps keep \nthem out of the hospital and out of the nursing homes. Yet in spite of \nall the letters we have read from patients, as well as home health care \ncommunities in all of our States, they have cut back.\n  Yet the majority whip came to the floor at the opening of the session \ntoday and said: Oh, we have handled all of that. He said: We have \nhandled all of that with a wonderful resolution of the Senate by \nSenator Michael Bennet.\n  The New York Times today, about that resolution, said:\n  Democrats decided to respond to the Republicans saying: Hey, you are \ncutting Medicare for our seniors. ``Democrats decided to respond . . . \nwith a meaningless amendment.'' The New York Times editorial today, ``a \nmeaningless amendment.'' We knew it was meaningless, and we know they \nare cutting Medicare from the seniors who depend on it--Medicare \nAdvantage from hospitals, from nursing homes, from hospice, from home \nhealth care. This is robbing the people who need this care, deserve the \ncare.\n  If you said maybe we should take a look at Medicare, then do it, Mr. \nPresident, to save Medicare, to save Medicare that we know is going \nbroke.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire is here. He has been an expert \non this topic of the budget and ways we can save Medicare. I say to my \nfriend from New Hampshire, is this not true that Democrats have \nproposed a meaningless amendment but they are cutting the guts out of \nthe Medicare Program on which the seniors of this country are \ndependent?\n  Mr. GREGG. As usual, the Senator from Wyoming is absolutely true. The \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments we have had from the other side of the \naisle on Medicare are political amendments meant to make a political \nstatement, but they have no substantive effect. That is why I brought \nforward my amendment which hopefully will be voted on in the next \ncouple of days or so which says specifically what the Senator from \nWyoming has asked for.\n  To the extent there are reductions in Medicare spending--and there \nmay need to be some--that those reductions are reserved for the seniors \nfor the benefit of their program and to make Medicare more solvent and \nno new programs be created on the backs of seniors by cutting Medicare \nand moving the money from Medicare over to new programs.\n  My amendment is not a sense of the Senate. My amendment is a real \namendment. It is the one chance people are going to have to vote for \nprotecting Medicare and not creating new programs with Medicare money. \nAnd that is what it is going to be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. To be clear, the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire is exactly the same as the White House sense-of-the-Senate \namendment and the Bennet amendment, only it has the actual force of \nlaw.\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely. It is not exactly the same in the sense that \nit is real. Theirs is not real. Mine is real. It says you are going to \nkeep the Medicare money to benefit Medicare, and you are not going to \nuse the Medicare money for the purpose of creating new programs which \nhave nothing to do with Medicare for people who are not on Medicare.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I say to the Senator from Arizona, another place in this \nbill where they have a sense of the Senate that is not real is medical \nliability reform. Back in September, when The President addressed the \nNation, he said\n\n[[Page S12533]]\n\ndefensive medicine caused by the medical liability crisis may be \ncontributing to unnecessary costs; there are unnecessary tests.\n  Let me show you the amount of money they are going to save with their \nmedical liability reform sense of the Senate in this bill. That is it. \nThat is how much their sense of the Senate on medical liability reform \nis going to save--zero.\n  In contrast, the Medical liability reform several of us have offered \nis real medical liability reform. Several of us have been working on \nthat. The savings from a real medical liability reform: $100 billion.\n  We at least have said we have an amendment we are going to vote on \nlater today. Let's at least do something to get the ball rolling on \nmedical liability reform with the amendment we are offering today. The \nPresident suggested getting the ball rolling on medical liability \nreform.\n  Back in 1995, Senator Ted Kennedy offered an amendment that would at \nleast limit attorney's fees. These are contingencies fees. Twenty-one \nDemocrats who were here back in 1995 who are here now voted for that \nlimit. They are: Akaka, Baucus, Bingaman, Boxer, Byrd, Conrad, Dodd, \nDorgan, Feingold, Feinstein, Harkin, Inouye, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, \nLeahy, Levin, Mikulski, Murray, Reid, and Specter. All 21 of these \nSenators voted for caps on attorney's fees. That would at least do \nsomething. That would help get the ball rolling on medical liability \nreform.\n  But the same thing they have done with Medicare, saying they are \ngoing to keep Medicare savings in Medicare, they have not done. It is \nnot real. Senator Gregg has a real amendment to fix that. I have a real \namendment to fix the medical liability reform that hopefully will be \nvoted on later as well. But at least let's go for a little bit of \ncompromise right now.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Talk about liability, I have real statistics. I hear \nthe other side say: Oh, we are going to lower the cost; that is what \nhealth care reform is about, lowering the cost of health care so more \npeople will have access to affordable options. Yet the main one that is \nclearly available is medical malpractice reform, tort reform.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada has an amendment, and I am a \ncosponsor. Let me give some statistics about how we could save money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from Texas, is it not true that it \nis the State of Texas that is the demonstration project for medical \nmalpractice reform?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Exactly. And let me tell you what it has done in \nTexas and something we could do, and I think we would have bipartisan, \n100 percent support in this body because that would be reform that \nwould help health care.\n  Since medical malpractice and tort reform has been passed in Texas, \nover 7,000 new physicians have flooded into our State--a 7,000 \nincrease. The reason? Tort reform. Since passed just 5, 6 years ago, \nphysicians in Texas have saved $574 million in liability premiums, and \ntheir liability rates have been cut an average of 27.6 percent, almost \na 30-percent cut in premiums.\n  What has this done? Today in rural counties, the number of \nobstetricians has increased by 27 percent. Twelve counties did not have \none obstetrician before this was passed, and now they do; 24 counties \nhad no emergency room physicians, and now they do; and 58 counties, in \naddition to that, have added one more.\n  Rural counties are the ones that have suffered the most, and every \nState in this Union has rural counties--every one. They are the ones \nwho are hurt the most. Yet the Medicare cuts will take $135 billion out \nof rural hospitals' ability to serve Medicare patients. There is no \nmedical malpractice reform unless, of course, in a huge bipartisan \neffort and gesture we can adopt the Ensign amendment which we are \noffering to try to make this a bipartisan bill that can work.\n  We have seen from Senator Ensign's charts that Democrats have \nsupported limits on lawyer fees so that we would be able to cut back on \nthe frivolous lawsuits that have been hampering our ability to cut the \ncosts in Medicare.\n  I appreciate so much that Senator Ensign is offering this amendment \nbecause Texas can show us that this will work. It would be meaningful \nreform. It would cut the costs and make health care more available and, \nmost important, it will give patients the opportunity to have doctors \nin their rural communities who will not practice today because their \nliability premiums are so high they cannot afford to stay in medicine \nand give this care to those rural patients. That is what we need.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say in the immortal words of Howard Dean, the \nformer chairman of the Democratic National Committee--he put it simply:\n\n       The reason why tort reform is not in the bill--\n\n  Talking about this bill--\n\n       The reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because \n     the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial \n     lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on, \n     and that is the plain and simple truth. Now, that's the \n     truth.\n\n  I totally agree with Howard Dean. I could not agree with him more.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, in addition to that, the \nHouse said: We have medical malpractice reform. They put it in their \nbill. You know what it says? There will be a State grant program and \nStates can apply if they can show that they have made a meaningful \neffort at curbing frivolous lawsuits. But the only two reasons a State \nwould not be eligible are if lawyer fees are capped or if damages are \ncapped. Lawyer fees capped, damages capped--that is off the table. So I \nam thinking to myself--maybe the Senator from Nevada could tell me, if \nyou don't curb lawyer fees and you don't curb the caps, what meaningful \nreform do you think we could get in medical malpractice?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. No question, those are the two most important types of \nreforms for medical liability laws that have been placed in the \nStates--my State of Nevada, Texas, California and other States. The \ncaps are what have shown a reduction in the medical liability premiums \nfor doctors. They are what have shown a reduction in the cost of our \nhealth care system.\n  Mr. President, let me quote because the other side is talking about \nthese contingency fees; that they need these contingency fees to take \non these lawsuits, especially for those who are very poor. They say it \nis the only way for this to happen.\n  I quote:\n\n       Since 1960, the effective hourly rates of tort lawyers--\n\n  These are the personal injury attorneys--\n\n     have increased 1,000 percent to 1,400 percent (in inflation-\n     adjusted dollars).\n       While the overall risk of nonrecovery has remained \n     essentially constant though it has decreased materially for \n     such high end tort categories as products liability and \n     medical malpractice.\n\n  The lawyers, basically, have created all these laws that make it \neasier for them to sue and their contingency rates have gone up 1,000 \nto 1,400 percent since 1960, and yet there is no more increased risk \nand even reduced risk of nonrecovery in medical malpractice cases. It \nis easier to sue nowadays. This comes down to, are you on the patients' \nside or the trial lawyers' side? Which side are you on? We are on the \nside of the patients; the other side seems to be on the side of the \ntrial bar.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arizona for driving home this \npoint. The reason that malpractice litigation reform is not in the bill \nis simple, plain, and known to every Member of this body because it is \nopposed by the plaintiff trial lawyers who are big supporters of \nDemocratic Members of the body and the President. That is true.\n  Let me ask Dr. Barrasso, can the Senator think of any other thing \nthat we could do in reforming health care that could save $100 billion \nand not diminish the quality of care in America? Is there anything \nelse? How do fellow doctors feel about that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. When I talk to other doctors, they tell me, across the \nboard they order a number of tests, expensive tests--call it defensive \nmedicine--tests that do not necessarily help a patient get better, get \nwell, but just to make sure they get covered in case they are sued. It \nis not unusual, when\n\n[[Page S12534]]\n\nyou look at the numbers, that we are talking $100 billion a year in \ntests that are done that do not necessarily help somebody get better, \nbut they are doing it because of the legal atmosphere in this country.\n  Here we are on the Senate floor on a Sunday afternoon. The President \nis less than 100 yards away, a former Member of this body. He ought to \nbe involving all Senators. He is meeting behind closed doors, possibly \ncutting deals, trying to come to arrangements, twisting arms, asking \npeople to march, follow his marching orders right off a cliff that I \nthink is going to be coming for health care in America. I think he \nought to be involving all Americans. We are talking to the Americans in \nthis country. We are not hiding behind closed doors. People who aren't \npart of those discussions are completely cut out.\n\n  I know my colleague from Tennessee has been outstanding and outspoken \non these very issues, but we are here, and we want to visit with people \nbecause we do have solutions that work; that will not increase the cost \nof care, which is what we are seeing now; that are not going to cut \nMedicare, which is what the Democrats are proposing; that are not going \nto increase taxes, which the Democrats are proposing; and they are not \ngoing to drive up the premiums.\n  The whole idea behind this was to get the costs under control. \nSenator Ensign's amendment does that by taking a look at the lawsuit \nabuse that we look at in this country. But I want to turn to my \ncolleague from Tennessee, who I know has some more points he wants to \nmake.\n  Mr. CORKER. I know all of us benefit from the Senator's background as \na physician and knowledge in the industry. I also thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona for spending a lifetime focusing on how special interests \naffect this body.\n  I was thinking about this meeting taking place here in the Capitol \nnot far from us from 2 to 3 p.m. with the President and 60 of our \ncolleagues on the left, and I have this image of them being twisted up \nlike pretzels because of the fact there are so many interest groups \nthey have to sort of kowtow to. I have this image of a bunch of them up \nin a room with a yoga instructor, kind of loosening up, because they \nare so twisted in knots trying to basically undo all the pledges they \nhave made to so many groups.\n  I think about, for instance, Senator Ensign's amendment to deal with \nmedical malpractice, but, no, the trial lawyers keep them from doing \nthat. I think about the kinds of things Senator McCain ran on during \nhis Presidential election campaign, and others of us have looked at, as \nhas Senator Gregg, so that people in this country have choice; that we \ncreate a market system that allows people to have choice. But they \ncannot do that because the unions don't want them to do so. The unions \ndon't allow them to cap the exclusion, which many of us have talked \nabout. The unions keep them from doing appropriate health care reform, \nand so instead, what happens, in order to make this work? Again, they \nare so twisted up. Remember that Peter Orszag, the major guru within \nthis administration regarding health care, has said the thing that will \nbend the cost curve down would be these exclusions. I am so glad \nSenator Gregg, who has the integrity and the longstanding knowledge to \ndeal with this, is offering an amendment.\n  Yesterday I was challenged on this by Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle, but there is no doubt this bill throws seniors under the \nbus. We have an insolvent program that money is being taken from to \ncreate a whole new entitlement it is leveraging. If that is not \nthrowing seniors under the bus, I don't know what is. So we have a \nprogram that is throwing seniors under the bus because the unions \ncannot be offended, the trial lawyers cannot be offended, so many other \ngroups--AARP cannot be offended--and then we also lock 15 of the 31 \nmillion Americans who are receiving health care into a program none of \nus would be a part of--Medicaid. And they do that because of their \nunwillingness to address the free market issues that would make health \ncare work in this country: medical malpractice issues, addressing \ndefensive medicine, capping exclusions, and those kinds of things we \nRepublicans have put forth from day one.\n  So I think the Senator from Arizona is doing an outstanding job \npointing out the conflicts of interest that exist in this bill. We have \na group on the other side of the aisle that won't address health care \nin the appropriate way, and I believe are in another room twisted up in \nknots with themselves trying to figure out a way to get out of this box \nthey have put themselves into, and a President who is basically giving \nthem a pep talk to keep them from getting out of the box.\n  I thank the Senator so much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Our Republican leader is here on the floor of the Senate, \nand he can speak for himself, but I am sure he would appreciate the \nopportunity if the President would come and sit down and meet with us. \nI think we are all ready to have a meeting with him. Perhaps we would \nbe able to give our input and recommendations as to what we need to do \nto get this bill unstuck.\n  That was, as I recall, the campaign. And I am getting tired of going \ndown memory lane here, but that was going to be the ``change.'' That \nwas going to be the change in Washington. We are going to change the \nclimate. We are all going to sit down together, Republicans and \nDemocrats. Well, I think on this Sunday afternoon, we are all \navailable, are we not, I would ask the Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, normally we \nwould be watching the Redskins game today, but we are here and ready to \nsit down with the President and ready to discuss with the American \npeople this issue.\n  You know, it was said at the beginning of the debate, if they wanted \nto come up with a bill that would pass with 80 votes, the way to do \nthat is not to craft a bill that no Republican can support and end up \nin the position they are in now, trying to get every single Democrat in \nline so they can pass this bill, even though they know the American \npeople are overwhelmingly opposed to it. All the surveys indicate the \nAmerican people do not want us to pass this bill. They would like for \nus to stop, start over, and get it right, with some of the suggestions \nthat have been made here on the floor today and other days during this \ndebate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And we could do that, perhaps in the most effective \nfashion, if we sat down with the President and made some of the very \npoints he made in his State of the Union Message.\n  I want to turn to the Senator from South Dakota, but I want to \nmention something first on this issue of tort reform I have never quite \ngotten over. One of the most famous cases of the 1970s, and I think it \nspilled over into the 1980s, was agent orange, the defoliant that was \nused during the Vietnam war and which caused so many physical problems \nfor our Vietnam veterans who were exposed to it. It was a big class \naction suit the trial lawyers won. The trial lawyers got paid off \nfirst, and Vietnam veterans died before the money was distributed to \nthem. I will never get over that.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think the reason we are here today is that the Ensign \nand Gregg amendments strike at the very crux and the very core and the \nvery heart of what this is all about. The Democratic majority was \nunwilling to take on the trial lawyers, unwilling to do things that \nactually bend the cost curve down, such as capping contingency fees, \nand so now we are faced with voting on the Ensign amendment, which \nwould do that, but we are also voting on the Gregg amendment because \nthey weren't willing to put actual measures in this bill that would \nbend the cost curve down. What they have had to resort to is cutting \nMedicare to pay for it. A $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment has to be financed somehow, because there aren't any real \ncost-saving measures in here.\n  I point out to my colleagues that in spite of all that, this is where \nwe are. The Congressional Budget Office says that even with the all of \nthe Medicare cuts and all the tax increases that are in here, we \nactually still increase spending in this country on health care. The \ncost curve goes up. The blue line on this chart represents the existing \ncost curve if nothing is done. If we did nothing today, that is what \nwould happen. That is the blue line. The red line represents what \nhappens under this bill. We actually raise the cost\n\n[[Page S12535]]\n\ncurve even more. Costs for health care in this country under this \nlegislation go up $160 billion.\n  How does that affect the individual family? I want to show you \nexactly what this means in terms that I think most Americans can \nunderstand. This is the example of a family of four who today is paying \n$13,000, a little over $13,000 for their health insurance. Under this \nbill, their life doesn't get any better. In the year 2016, they are \ngoing to be paying over $20,000 a year in health insurance. So what \nhappens is they have locked in the status quo. And that status quo is \nyear over year increases, double the rate of inflation, all because \nthey were unwilling to put measures in this bill that actually do \ncontrol costs.\n\n  If we did something along the lines of the Ensign amendment, that \nactually would get these contingency fees under control. We all have \nseen the statistics. The CBO has said that would bend the cost curve \ndown.\n  We have all talked to physicians in our own States. I talked last \nweek to a physician from my State who, unsolicited, said that 50 \npercent of the tests he does are to avoid being sued. Fifty percent of \nthe tests he conducts are due to defensive medicine. That drives the \ncost of health care up for everybody. That is why the Ensign amendment \nis so important.\n  Unfortunately, why we have to vote on the Gregg amendment is because \nthe Gregg amendment forces the Democrats to put their money where their \nmouth is and to see if they mean what they say--that they want all \nthese savings in Medicare to go into Medicare. We all know that is not \ntrue. To pay for a $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal Government \nand create an entirely new entitlement, you have to take the cuts from \nMedicare and put them into this new entitlement program.\n  So we are voting on a couple of amendments today that will ensure \nseniors in this country are not going to be faced with cuts to their \nbenefits--home health care, nursing homes, hospitals, all those that \nreceive cuts in this bill--and actually try to substitute something in \nthere that would get costs under control, and would--according to the \nCBO--drive the cost curve down; would do something about this year over \nyear double the rate of inflation that the average American family is \nseeing.\n  This is what the CBO said would happen to the average American family \nof four if this bill passes. Today they are paying $13,000 a year--a \nfamily of four--and in the year 2016, they will be paying $20,000 a \nyear. Tell me, how is that reform? How can anybody go to an average \nAmerican family with a straight face and say they are reforming health \ncare when all they are doing is locking in permanently year-over-year \nincreases that are double the rate of inflation, and in some cases even \ngoing up beyond that if you have to buy your insurance in the \nindividual market?\n  I am glad the Senator from Nevada has offered this amendment. I am \nanxious to see how the other side votes on the amendment the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has offered which would guarantee these Medicare \nsavings would go back into Medicare and not be used to pay for a new \ngovernment entitlement program at a cost of $2.5 trillion to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will recognize the Senator from Texas, who will be \npresiding next, and wish to add one more comment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I so appreciate the opportunity to talk about these \ndifferent areas of cuts and then the increase in spending overall, \nbecause everyone in America today is concerned about the spending and \nthe debt and the ceiling we are about to reach.\n  I wanted to bring up one more point on hospitals, because this \naffects every State in America. In Texas, 29 percent of our hospitals \nare in rural areas. The cuts in this bill will especially affect \nhospitals in rural areas. In fact, out of the $135 billion in Medicare \ncuts to hospitals, $20 billion is cuts in Medicare payments for \ntreating low-income seniors and another $23 billion in Medicaid \npayments to hospitals for treating low-income patients.\n  I want to read an excerpt of a letter I received this week from the \nTexas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals, which represents \n150 rural hospitals in the State. They write:\n\n       We also fear the Medicare cuts as proposed could \n     disproportionately hurt rural hospitals, which are the health \n     care safety net for more than 2 million rural Texans. Because \n     of lower financial margins and higher percentage of Medicare \n     patients, rural hospitals will be impacted more than urban \n     hospitals by any reductions in reimbursement. These proposed \n     Medicare cuts could have a devastating effect on many of the \n     hospitals, which could lead to curtailing of certain \n     services. And, the closure of some of these Texas hospitals \n     is a real possibility. It has happened every time previously \n     when Congress imposed so-called large-scale, cost-saving \n     measures.\n\n  Well, this is the granddaddy of large-scale cost cuts--$500 billion, \nor $\\1/2\\ trillion--taken out of the hide of the hospitals that are \ntreating low-income patients and seniors.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada if he is experiencing that same thing, \nand if he feels that hospitals all over our country are going to be \nhurt by this bill?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ncomments, and I note that even the Congressional Budget Office has said \nwhen you cut, for instance, reimbursement rates, those are going to \ncome out of somebody's hide. And basically, the hide it is going to \ncome out of is the seniors.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said, we are throwing seniors under the \nbus. When you cut $465 billion out of Medicare, it is going to come out \nof services for seniors--if these cuts are real. And in this bill they \nare real. That is why the Gregg amendment is going to be so important.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas wants to jump in, so we welcome you to \nthe conversation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate that. I also note the Ensign amendment, \ninstead of cutting, creates.\n  A Robert Woods study in 2006 said caps on things such as this hold \ndown awards in cases 20 to 30 percent and increases the supply of \nphysicians, which is something else we need.\n  I wish to give a better live example that we have in my State of \nKansas. In the early 1980s, mid-1980s the piston engine industry of \naircraft was just about dead. It had been sued--the aircraft industry, \ngeneral aviation had been sued so much they were stopping making piston \nengine aircraft. Congress, finally, because the industry was dead, said \nwe are going to put a 17-year statute of limitations on it so after 17 \nyears you cannot sue the manufacturer anymore after that period of \ntime.\n  It brought the industry back. They are now being made. There is a new \nplant in Independence, KS. There is another one that is making this \naircraft because there was a limitation put, a reasonable limitation on \nmanufacturing reform.\n  If we do this, this will create--this will help our medical industry, \nit will hold down costs, it will increase the number of physicians. \nThese sorts of changes have worked. There is no reason at all not to do \nthis in this bill.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his excellent \nremarks. I know the Senator from Florida, the newest Member, one of the \nnewest Members of the body, would like to join in.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I don't know that there is a State that is going to be more impacted \nby cuts in health care for seniors than my State of Florida, with 3 \nmillion Floridians on Medicare, almost 1 million on Medicare Advantage. \nI think it is worth repeating what these cuts are going to mean: $137.5 \nbillion from hospitals that treat seniors. I talked to the director of \na hospital district down where I am from, down in south Florida. He \nsaid these cuts will be devastating: $120 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage, $14.6 billion from nursing homes that treat seniors, $42 \nbillion from health care for seniors--from home health care, and $7.7 \nbillion from hospice care.\n  Yesterday, our friends on the other side were trying to convince us \nand the American people that there are not going to be any cuts to \nbenefits. It is not going to affect health care for seniors because \nthey are going to pay less, but that will just get rid of the waste and \nthe fraud and the abuse.\n  Everyone is against waste fraud and abuse. We have a measure on this \nside of the aisle that actually, I think, would do something about it. \nWe have gone through the Reid bill to find all\n\n[[Page S12536]]\n\nthe provisions. My staff and I have been going through it, line by \nline, to find all the provisions that go after waste, fraud, and \nabuse--and there are some, to their credit. But the Congressional \nBudget Office has said, in their report that came out on November 18, \nthe provisions that go toward waste, fraud, and abuse would cut $1.5 \nbillion and create that efficiency. But the cuts are $464 billion. So \nif they are going to save $1.5 billion and there is going to be $464 \nbillion in cuts, where are the rest of the cuts going to come from?\n  It is, as my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, said, seniors are \ngoing to get thrown under the bus. But you are not going to be able to \ncut $464 billion, only get $1.5 billion in savings, and not cut \nbenefits. So seniors who want to go to the hospital are going to have \ntheir benefits cut; seniors who have home health care, their benefits \nare going to get cut and all the way down the line. Everyone needs to \nunderstand that at its base, this is a bill that hurts seniors.\n  Perhaps no State is going to be impacted more than Florida, where we \nhave this huge population of seniors. I know my friend from Nevada has \na huge population of seniors in his State. We have the highest per \ncapita number of seniors. We like to say all the rest of the seniors in \nthe country are eventually going to move to Florida anyway. We are \ngoing to have the greatest generation--we have them there now--we are \ngoing to have more of them living in Florida, and their health care is \ngoing to get cut.\n  This bill cuts from health care for seniors, it raises taxes, and it \ndoesn't decrease the cost of health care for the 170 million Americans \nwho have health insurance now. For some, it raises it.\n  For me, a new Member to this body, it does not make any sense. But \nwhat does make sense is what my esteemed colleague from New Hampshire \nhas done with this amendment. If you are for health care for seniors \nand you do not want it to be cut and if you are true to your word that \nwe have to put the savings back into Medicare, then this bill, which \nsays as its purpose ``to prevent Medicare from being raided for new \nentitlements and to use Medicare savings to save Medicare''--I cannot \nimagine that anyone could vote against that amendment, because if you \nvote against that amendment, you are voting against senior health care.\n  I ask my colleague from New Hampshire, who has so much experience on \nthese budget issues, if this amendment is not agreed to, what is going \nto happen to the Medicare program?\n  Mr. GREGG. To begin with, it is going to be reduced by $460 billion \nin the first 10 years. In the second 10 years, it will be reduced by $1 \ntrillion. In the full 20-year time, it will be reduced by $3 trillion. \nAll those funds, all those reductions, will go to create a new \nentitlement for people who are not seniors and who probably have not \npaid into the HI trust fund, not having paid into the Medicare trust \nfund, which is an insurance program, in part.\n  As a practical matter, it will take scarce resources out of the \nMedicare trust fund, which should be used to make the Medicare trust \nfund more solvent, and move them over to expand the Government in \nanother place.\n  It will mean that we as a government have basically used up some of \nthe resources which we might want to use to make Medicare more solvent \nbecause it has $35 trillion of unfunded liability out there, and we \nwill use up those resources to create a new Federal program which will \nnot help us address this outyear insolvency of Medicare.\n  It doubles the problem. First, it does not address the Medicare \nproblems in the future and, second, it creates a brandnew entitlement \nwhich will have to be supported forever by Medicare funds, it appears.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I see the Republican whip is on the floor and wants to \njoin in the fun we are having on a Sunday afternoon. Please join us.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleague from Nevada. I had the opportunity, \nwhich we don't have very much anymore, to preside for a half hour, \nwatching over a dozen of my Republican colleagues engaging in a very \ninformative debate for the American people.\n  It occurred to me, as my colleague from Nevada was talking about his \namendment, which would actually reduce the cost of medicine, would \nreduce the defensive medicine practiced by physicians and, therefore, \nhave a tendency to reduce health care costs, that he was doing that by \nactually attacking another problem we have been talking about; that is, \nthese runaway lawsuits or these junk lawsuits that have been talked \nabout.\n  As a person who used to practice law, as I was listening to the \nSenator, it occurred to me that maybe I should take the microphone and \ndefend the trial lawyers. So I wish to make sure I have the math right.\n  Under the amendment of my colleague, there would be a cap on the \namount of attorney's fees these lawyers could get, depending upon how \nmuch money they recovered for their plaintiff client; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, you would get one-third of all the money you \ncollected up to $150,000. That is $50,000. Then you would get one-\nfourth of everything beyond that; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. My colleague is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Is my colleague aware that the average malpractice award in \nthis country today is $4.3 million? Does that sound about right?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It depends on the State, but that sounds about right.\n  Mr. KYL. In fact, over half of all the awards are over $1 million. As \na poor trial lawyer, for every one of these cases--we are not talking \nabout cases per year and this is per case, you can try 20, 30, 40, 50 \ncases a year--so for each case, if the average award is $4.3 million, I \nam only going to keep $1.1 million. Is that fair; that the trial lawyer \nshould only get $1.1 million for every one of these cases? Of course, \nthe clients I am recovering the money for don't get that money. That \nmoney goes into my pocket.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Remember, if I would ask a practicing attorney, they also \ndon't just get that percentage, they also get court costs and various \nother research they have to do. It is not that the person who was \ninjured gets three-quarters; they actually get less than the three-\nquarters that even this amendment would limit them to.\n  Mr. KYL. Exactly so. Under the amendment of my colleague, at least \nthe plaintiff, on whose behalf the lawsuit was brought, would get a \nfair amount of recovery, unlike today, when there are no caps, and we \nfrequently find the person who was injured gets a very small percentage \nafter the lawyer gets his chunk, the expert witnesses, other court \ncosts, and so on.\n  Maybe I should not defend my lawyer friends. Maybe the Senator is \nright. This is a way to attack costs. It is certainly not unfair to the \ntrial lawyers and actually would benefit the people who do deserve to \nget some recovery in these cases where, in fact, they have been \ninjured.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We do have a couple attorneys on the floor, including the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and maybe one of the two of \nyou could also talk about the true victims who actually have had \nmedical malpractice against them. How long does it take to get through \nthe court today because of all of these frivolous lawsuits that clog \nthe courts?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator raises a very important point. It \nseems to me that there should be mechanisms created to settle cases \nmuch quicker, without the huge payouts going to lawyer fees and \nlitigation. Don't forget, the insurance company that the doctor hires \nand that is defending the doctor charges too. That is all money going \nto increase the cost of health care.\n  I have with me, today, working for me, Dr. Conrad Pierce. On a normal \nday in Alabama, he would be my Sunday school teacher today. Today he is \nworking.\n  He just retired. He delivered 7,000 babies. He told me, some years \nago, that an average OB's insurance for a year is $60,000. I don't know \nwhether it is still that way. That was several years ago. Some smaller \ntown physicians may not deliver more than 60 babies a year. That is \n$1,000 per delivery in insurance premiums. It is driven by this \nlitigation rush we are having, and the pursuit of these big verdicts \nthat sometimes occur and make lawyers wealthy--and, to be fair, \nsometimes serious injuries occur and serious malpractice occurs. But I \nabsolutely believe this country can, consistent with\n\n[[Page S12537]]\n\nour heritage of allowing individuals to sue for wrongs done to them, \ncreate a much better system for medical malpractice. One of the steps \nis the one the Senator has mentioned in his amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I appreciate that. Maybe we can have Dr. Barrasso jump \nin. I have a good friend who practices obstetrics and gynecology in Las \nVegas, and he is a specialist in high-risk pregnancies. Because of the \nmessed up medical liability situation, his insurance company limited \nthe number--the same as Senator Sessions was talking about--limited the \nnumber of high-risk deliveries he could participate in. So if you are \none of the unfortunate ones who got cut off--in other words, he had \nreached his cap of the number he could actually deliver, and you are a \nwoman who has a high-risk pregnancy--there may not be one of the \nspecialists around. Now you have to deal with just the normal OB who \nmay not have the expertise.\n  What does that do to not only the practice of obstetrics but, as an \northopedic surgeon, I am sure this kind of example plays out in many \nother areas in medicine?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Standing on the Senate floor, looking at so many \ncolleagues from States with a lot of rural areas, it is a challenge to \nhave people who can provide these excellent services, who are very well \ntrained, know how to do it, how they can provide the services in these \nsmall communities. We have dealt with that in Wheatland, WY, and New \nCastle, WY, where the expense for the malpractice insurance for those \nphysicians was so high that even though they didn't deliver that many \nbabies in these small communities, they could not afford and the \nhospital could not afford to allow them to continue to deliver any \nbabies. The amount of money they would receive from delivering babies \nwas not enough to cover the insurance. In New Castle, WY, there were \nthree physicians qualified to deliver, but the number of deliveries was \nsuch they ended up with no one delivering because they wanted to take \none night and the next and the next. So you have communities all across \nour country that are losing highly qualified medical practitioners--\nwhether it is cardiologists, surgeons, trauma surgeons, whether it is \nobstetricians, gynecologist. We are seeing this all over our \ncommunities.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is here. There are a lot of small \ncommunities where they are going to lose those. We are seeing it in the \ncuts yesterday for home health. Those people are not going to be \navailable to deliver small community care, lifeline, homebound, keeping \nthem out of nursing homes, keeping them out of hospitals.\n  There are real consequences of this bill, not just with the junk \nlawsuits--that is a big part of it--but also with the Medicare cuts, \nalso with the increased taxes we are seeing in this bill and how that \nis going to affect small businesses, which are the engines that drive \nthe economy of this country--and profoundly.\n  We heard the Senator from South Dakota show the premiums families are \ngoing to have to pay for insurance are going to climb faster if this \nbill becomes law than if nothing were passed. Even though the President \npromised that families in this country on average would see a $2,500-\nper-year decline in premiums, the President's own numbers people say: \nSorry, it is going to go up $2,100. That is a $4,600 shift for every \nfamily who tries to buy their own health insurance. That is what we are \nseeing in Wyoming.\n  I ask my colleague from Tennessee if he is seeing the same things at \nhome.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I have just finished my second tour of \nall 95 counties in our State. In 91 of the 95 counties in our State, \nwomen do not have access to the types of medical services they should \nhave. The reason is that this whole issue of malpractice is especially \nprevalent in the issue of OB. That is the area of babies being born. \nObviously, a physician cannot determine if there is going to be a \ngenetic deficiency of some kind or something else. But trial lawyers \nare out there waiting to ensure that no matter what happens, even if it \nis by the grace of God that something happens that is not so good, the \nfact is a trial lawyer is waiting there to take advantage of a \nphysician. So they have just decided to leave that particular industry.\n  We have had a bunch of side-by-side votes here. The American people \nunderstand the trickery that takes place. Fortunately, Senator McCain's \nfavorite publication, the New York Times, pointed out what absurdity it \nwas yesterday that we passed 100 to zip the Bennett amendment which \neverybody knows is toothless.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to actually have a values vote. The \nAmerican people can determine the values of each Senator. Senator \nEnsign has an amendment to cap the amount trial lawyers are paid. \nSenator Lincoln has one to cap the amount that people who are actually \ndelivering health insurance are paid. This is a values vote. We have a \nnonprofit in our State that pours every bit of its money back into \nproviding health insurance. Senator Lincoln's amendment would cap the \namount that person is paid. Senator Ensign would cap the amount a trial \nlawyer is paid who is pursuing a physician and causing them to pay \nmore. This is the first of a real values vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. One clarification: We don't cap the total dollar they can \nbe paid; we just cap the percentage. So even though they will cap at \n$400,000 what somebody can be paid for an insurance company, trial \nlawyers could still, because they can get up to 25 percent of the \nverdict--if the verdict is on average, as we learned from Senator Kyl, \n$4 million, they can still make $1 million on that one case, and they \ncan have however many of those cases they want per year.\n  Mr. CORKER. I know Senator Enzi wants the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there are a number of issues that this \namendment raises. Some are health care-related, most are not.\n  First, this amendment amends section 162(m) of the Tax Code--a tax \nlaw intended to curb excessive executive compensation.\n  Unfortunately, section 162(m) has been a disaster. It has encouraged \ncompanies to cook up complex design packages so as to avoid the \nlimitations under the law.\n  Actually, excessive executive compensation exploded as a direct \nresult of section 162(m)--which was enacted back in 1993.\n  I have consistently made it clear that the outrageous pay practices \nof many companies must stop. True pay-for-performance must be the \ncornerstone of any compensation package. And the boards of directors, \ncompensation committees, and shareholders must all be partners in \npracticing good corporate governance. We should look to reform section \n162(m) of the Tax Code, not add to it. And we should look at whether \nCongress needs to reform the way corporate governance is practiced.\n  This amendment adds to section 162(m). It does not reform it. This \namendment does nothing to empower shareholders to hold the \ncorporation's board accountable. All it does is hurt shareholders by \ntaking money out of the company and giving it to the government.\n  That is right. By limiting a corporation's deduction, shareholders \nare the ones who are disadvantaged, not the corporation.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle forget that seniors are \noften shareholders who rely on dividends and capital gains for income \nto live on day in and day out. So actually, my Democratic friends are \nenacting policies that will hurt seniors. All in an effort to show the \ncountry that they have it in for the big, bad insurance companies.\n  I also find it interesting to hear my friends say that it is unfair \nfor insurance companies to get a taxpayer funded ``subsidy'' in the \nform of a tax deduction.\n  First, all corporations are allowed to deduct compensation as a \nbusiness expense. Big, small, private, and public corporations get this \nsame tax deduction.\n  Are these companies getting a tax subsidy? If so, why not take the \nsubsidy away from them?\n  Now, my friends on the other side may argue that these restrictions \nare just like those Congress passed in \nT-A-R-P. And the way the legislation works, they would be correct.\n  But, the executive compensation restrictions in T-A-R-P were \nconditions for receiving taxpayer dollars. My constituents in Iowa \nwould call them bailouts.\n\n[[Page S12538]]\n\n  Now my friends may argue that health insurance companies are \nbenefiting from their reforms and they should pay their ``fair share.'' \nThey may also say that they are receiving the government-subsidized tax \ncredits for health insurance, which is taxpayer dollars.\n  The main reason why the government is subsidizing health insurance \nfor low-income individuals is because the Reid bill forces people to \nbuy health insurance.\n  If you force people to buy insurance, you have to make sure it is \naffordable for them to buy. This has forced the government to spend \nclose to $400 billion on these tax credits, which is one of most \nexpensive parts of the Reid bill. And the cost of these tax credits are \npaid with higher taxes, fees, and penalties on the majority of \nAmericans. Paid by many of those who earn less than $250,000 a year.\n  Data from the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that 38 percent of \ntax returns making under $200,000 in 2019 will see a tax increase under \nthe Reid bill. Yet only 8 percent of tax returns in 2019 will be \nbenefiting from the tax credit. That doesn't seem balanced.\n  Finally, this amendment directs the revenue generated from it to the \nMedicare trust fund. I commend my Democratic friends for crafting \npolicies that would help shore up Medicare. What is interesting is that \nthis bill cuts Medicare. To the tune of $400 billion--that is billion \nwith a B.\n  And the money raised from cutting Medicare is not being directed to \nhelp shore up Medicare. Rather, the money is being spent on expanding \nand creating new entitlement programs. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nscored this amendment as raising $651 million over 10 years--that is \nmillion with an M.\n  So what we have here is $400 billion in cuts in Medicare that is \nbeing used for other spending, in exchange for $600 million which would \nbe directed Medicare trust fund. Doesn't seem like a fair trade.\n  Do my friends on the other side feel guilty for using Medicare money \nfor non-Medicare purposes? And to make up for this guilt, they decided \nto direct non-Medicare-related money to the Medicare trust fund?\n  I will close by saying that my Democratic friends will take to the \nfloor and say that anyone who votes against this amendment is ``in the \npockets of the insurance companies.'' I will first tell my friends that \nthey should look in the mirror. Then I will say opposing irrational \npolicies that add complexity to our tax laws is not protecting \ninsurance companies.\n  Let's get on to reforming our health care system, instead of voting \non amendments so my Democratic friends can (1) look like they are \ntaking it to the insurance companies, and so they can look like (2) \nthey are helping Medicare solvency.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada, which I have also cosponsored, that calls for real \nreform of the medical liability system.\n  A key component to health care reform in our Nation is medical \nliability reform. However, the Democrats are not actually interested in \nmaking changes to the current system as evidenced by the inclusion in \nthis bill of ``the sense of the Senate that health care reform presents \nan opportunity to address issues related to medical malpractice and \nmedical liability insurance.'' Well that opportunity has come now, with \na vote on this amendment that will limit the amount of contingency fees \navailable to trial lawyers who bring medical liability actions.\n  The threat of massive lawsuits and the costs of insuring against them \nhave driven doctors out of the practice of medicine, influenced doctors \nand nurses to avoid certain specialties, and in part led to the steady \nincrease of health care premiums. With the threat of lawsuits hanging \nover their heads, doctors are forced to take extra precautions when \ndiagnosing and treating patients through the ordering of additional \ntests and procedures. The Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that 93 percent of doctors admit practicing this type of self-\nprotective medicine.\n  A recent study by the Pacific Research Institute estimates the cost \nof defensive medicine is at least $191 billion per year, while other \nreports put costs over $200 billion annually. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, if Congress adopted only a few of the \nmalpractice reforms we have seen various States enact, such as Texas \nand Alabama, the deficit would decrease by $54 billion over 10 years.\n  At the heart of this issue, beyond the costs and savings, is the \ndamage the current liability system does to the relationship patients \nhave with their doctors. When physicians are afraid they could be sued, \nnot only do they run unnecessary tests and procedures, but the quality \nof care patients receive is compromised. A 2003 GAO report concluded \nthat defensive medicine has also contributed to access issues, \nespecially in rural areas. Physicians tend to move to States and areas \nwith lower liability rates, and hospitals are able to expand available \nservices.\n  It is estimated that attorneys' fees and administrative costs amount \nto 54 percent of the compensation paid to plaintiffs. Less than 15 \ncents of every dollar awarded actually goes towards compensation for \nthe individual. This amendment is not about preventing compensation to \ninjured individuals; it is about increasing access to doctors and \nlowering costs. In fact, this measure allows injured plaintiffs to keep \nmore of the reward. The simple truth is that lowering the cost of doing \nbusiness allows doctors to serve more people at lower costs.\n  On November 6, I received a letter from the Oklahoma State Medical \nAssociation, confirming that medical liability reform would reduce \nhealth care costs because the practice of defensive medicine adds \nbillions of dollars to the yearly cost of health care. Oklahoma \nphysicians pay anywhere from $20,000 to $90,000 a year, depending on \ntheir specialty, for malpractice insurance, and their yearly costs have \nrisen astronomically since 1999 to the point that some specialties, \nlike OB-GYNs, have had to change careers or move to other States where \nState malpractice reform is already in place. Since 1999, Oklahoma OB-\nGYNs have seen their yearly malpractice costs rise from $15,000 to \n$63,000.\n  Meaningful malpractice reform must be a part of any comprehensive \nhealth care reform. This is not a partisan issue. As my colleagues \nmentioned yesterday, this amendment was actually proposed by Senator \nKennedy in 1995, with the support of many current Senators on the other \nside of the aisle. It will be very interesting to see just how serious \nthe Democrats are about health care reform. The bill has a ``sense of \nthe Senate'' recognizing medical malpractice costs are a problem. We \nwill see if they think it is important to really do anything about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the time for the colloquy has, \nunfortunately, expired. The balance of the time goes to the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I thank everybody for their participation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Because as I have been saying, the people who wrote the excesses of \nthe Reid bill appear willfully ignorant of what is going on in the rest \nof the economy outside of health care.\n  We are a nation facing very challenging economic times with \nindustries in financial crisis and Federal debt increasing to all-time \nhighs.\n  So we should be considering a bill that would create jobs and prevent \nthis country from being burdened with a bigger and more unsustainable \nFederal budget instead of this health bill.\n  But instead, we are now considering a bill that cuts half a trillion \ndollars from the Medicare Program to fund yet another unsustainable \nhealth care entitlement program.\n  You have heard from Members on this side of the aisle about how \nflawed this approach is and how these drastic Medicare cuts will \nthreaten beneficiary access to care.\n  Medicare's chief actuary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices has warned Congress in his report that these cuts could \njeopardize access to health care for beneficiaries.\n  In fact, a number of Members on the other side of the aisle have made \nclear that they share our concerns when they joined us to vote in favor \nof motions to eliminate these cuts.\n\n[[Page S12539]]\n\n  Most of the Members on the other side of the aisle, however, claim \nthat this bill does no such thing.\n  They claim that Medicare money is not being used to start up yet \nanother unsustainable entitlement program that we clearly can't afford.\n  They claim that the Reid bill doesn't technically change the law on \nguaranteed benefits for beneficiaries.\n  They are ignoring the fact that while those benefits may be \ntechnically guaranteed, if the cuts put health care providers out of \nbusiness, then those guarantees will be nothing more than useless words \nin the Medicare Act.\n  Guaranteed benefits are not worth much without health care providers \nwho can treat patients, provide home health services, run the hospitals \nand hospice agencies.\n  These claims are not good enough to assure seniors who have paid into \nthe Medicare Program all these years. It is not good enough for \nprotecting access to the health care services and benefits they were \npromised.\n  So the Gregg amendment would back up those claims with a real \nenforceable mechanism to ensure that Medicare savings aren't being used \nto fund a new program.\n  The Gregg amendment is needed to protect the Medicare Program.\n  After all, if you knew that the Medicare Program already had $37 \ntrillion in unfunded obligations, would you be assured without an \nenforcement mechanism to back up those promises?\n  No guarantee is worth the paper it is written on without an \nenforcement mechanism to back it up. Otherwise, it is just a \nmeaningless guarantee. It is not real without an enforcement mechanism.\n  The Gregg amendment provides that enforcement mechanism. It makes the \nguarantee real.\n  Opposition to the Gregg amendment will shine a light on the issue. If \nthe Gregg amendment is not approved, it should be clear to everyone \nwatching that all the guarantees they are making that Medicare is \nprotected in the Reid bill are, in fact, worthless. As a result, I hope \nthat everyone will be watching carefully how the other side votes on \nthe Gregg amendment.\n  Now supporters of the Reid bill trumpet the fact that their drastic \nand permanent Medicare cuts extend the life of the program.\n  I agree that we can't ignore the pending insolvency of the Medicare \nProgram.\n  The Medicare hospital insurance trust fund started going broke last \nyear. In 2008, the Medicare Program began spending more out of this \ntrust fund than it is taking in.\n  The Medicare trustees have been warning all of us for years that the \ntrust fund is going broke. They now predict that it will go broke right \naround the corner in 2017.\n  But rather than work to bridge Medicare's $37 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities, this bill cuts half a trillion dollars from the Medicare \nProgram to fund yet another unsustainable health care entitlement \nprogram.\n  By diverting Medicare resources elsewhere, this bill ignores other \nmajor problems in the Medicare Program, like fixing the physician \npayment flaw with the sustainable growth rate formula, or SGR as it is \nknown.\n  So the few years of extended life this bill would give to the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund is a Pyrrhic victory.\n  Because the drastic and permanent Medicare cuts in this bill will \nworsen health care access and quality.\n  And the Reid bill leaves problems that have long been vexing Congress \nlike the fatally flawed physician payment formula unsolved.\n  The Reid bill will leave Congress with few options for fixing these \nproblems.\n  So the Gregg amendment is essential for protecting the Medicare \nProgram. It is essential for making those guarantees real.\n  The way the Gregg amendment works to enforce those guarantees is \nquite simple.\n  The Gregg amendment would make sure that the Medicare Program is not \nused as a piggy bank to spend for other purposes. It would make sure \nthat the Medicare Program is not being raided to fund this new program \nas the other side claims.\n  Under this important amendment, the director of the White House \nOffice of Management and Budget and Medicare's chief actuary would both \nbe required to add up non-Medicare savings in the bill and compare that \ntotal to the total of new spending and revenues in the bill.\n  If non-Medicare savings don't offset all the new costs, then the \nTreasury Secretary and the HHS Secretary would be prohibited from \nimplementing the new spending or revenue provisions in the bill.\n  By doing so, the Gregg amendment would ensure that the non-Medicare \nsavings are paying for the new spending in this bill. And it would \nensure that Medicare itself is not being used to pay for the new \nspending in the bill.\n  It is that simple.\n  The amendment therefore would prevent massive government expansions \nat the expense of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As you can see, this amendment has teeth. This amendment is real.\n  As opposed to a mere nonbinding sense of the Senate resolution that \nthe other side has offered to pretend to protect Medicare, the Gregg \namendment requires action to protect the Medicare Program.\n  The Gregg amendment is the enforcement mechanism for the guarantees \nthe other side says they are making to protect Medicare benefits.\n  Slashing Medicare payments to start up another new unsustainable \ngovernment entitlement program is not the way to address a big and \nunsustainable budget.\n  That is why I support the Gregg amendment. And I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Vote to protect Medicare.\n  Vote to keep Medicare from being used to fund a separate new program.\n  Vote to keep Medicare funds from being siphoned off.\n  Vote to put in place a real guarantee that Medicare funds won't be \nused.\n  Vote to back up those promises with real action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. What is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 50 seconds remaining, and the \nmajority has 16 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 5 minutes \nunder the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the amendments we are about to \nconsider is offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  We know medical malpractice is an issue in this country. The \nInstitute of Medicine tells us that 98,000 Americans die each year from \nmedical malpractice. Many more are injured. In the United States of \nAmerica each year, there are about 11,000 medical malpractice claims \npaid.\n  There is a concern about the impact of medical malpractice on the \npractice of medicine. That is why President Obama and this legislation \nwere looking together for ways to reduce medical malpractice, \nnegligence, and errors. We are looking for ways to reduce any number of \nlawsuits that may not be necessary. That is a good and positive thing \nfor us to do.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada is \nnot a good amendment to achieve that goal because what the Senator from \nNevada does is puts together a formula for compensating the lawyers who \nrepresent the victims of medical malpractice and reduces the amount of \nmoney that is available. I want every single dollar we can bring to the \nvictims of medical malpractice, but the fact is, in our country today, \nmost victims are not wealthy, and the only way they can bring a lawsuit \nis if the lawyer says it is a contingency fee. If you, the victim, win, \nthen I will be paid. If you lose, I am not paid. It is the only way \nmany people of modest means can get into a courthouse.\n  The Senator from Nevada wants to limit the amount of money that can \nbe paid to the attorneys, limit the opportunity for victims to be \nrepresented. If his goal is to reduce the money paid to lawyers, you \nwould think the amendment would also reduce the money paid to defense \nlawyers, those insurance\n\n[[Page S12540]]\n\ncompany lawyers who are at the other table in the courtroom. Studies \nshow that 50 percent more is paid to them than paid to the victims' \nlawyers. But the Senator from Nevada does not restrict their payment in \nany way. In other words, if you are going to try to defeat a victim of \nmedical malpractice in a courtroom, you can spend an unlimited amount \nof money, according to the Senator from Nevada. However, if you are \ngoing to represent that victim, he would limit the amount of money that \ncounsel, that attorney can be paid. It will mean fewer victims will \nhave lawyers, and maybe some of the lawyers they have will not be the \nbest because of the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. That \nis bad policy. It is not fair to the victims because many of these \nvictims are innocent victims.\n  I recall a woman in Chicago who went to one of our more famous \nhospitals for the simple removal of a mole from her face. She was \nadministered a general anesthesia, and during the course of the general \nanesthesia, the oxygen, which she was receiving, exploded, caught fire, \nand burned off her facial features. She went through repeated \nreconstructive surgery, scarring, disfigurement, pain and suffering.\n  She was an innocent victim. She did nothing wrong. She wanted to make \nsure her medical bills were paid, her lost wages were paid, there was \ncompensation for her pain and suffering. She was not a wealthy person. \nShe went to an attorney, who said: I will take the case, but it is a \ncontingency. If you win, I am paid. If you lose, I am not paid.\n  What the Senator from Nevada does with his amendment is limit the \nopportunity for innocent victims, just like her, to go into a \ncourtroom, into our court of justice, and see justice at the end of the \nday. That is not a just result. We need to stick with this bill, which \nmoves us forward, with innovative ways to reduce medical errors, reduce \nmedical malpractice, and find ways to resolve the differences between \nmedical providers and the patients in the fairest possible way. That is \nwhat this bill does. That is what we should do.\n  The amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Nevada fails \nto reach that goal and is fundamentally unfair and unjust to victims \nwho are just asking for a day in court and for the compensation which \nthey deserve for their injury.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2905\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I think it is so important we look at \nthe choice we will be making when we vote on this amendment in a few \nminutes. It is very simple. When health insurance reform becomes law, \nhealth insurance companies will receive millions of new customers \npurchasing their product for the first time.\n  My amendment is intended to encourage those insurance companies to \nput the additional premium dollars they will be bringing in with the \nvolume of new customers back toward lowering their rates and making \nmore affordable coverage for consumers, not putting it in their own \npocketbooks.\n  Where health insurers spent more than 90 cents of every dollar on \npatient care in the early 1990s, that number has decreased dramatically \nto just over 80 cents for every dollar in 2007, and even more so in \nrecent years.\n  According to testimony delivered in the Senate Commerce Committee \nearlier this year, this trend has translated into a difference of \nseveral billion dollars in favor of insurance company shareholders and \nexecutives at the expense of health care providers and their patients.\n  I think it is so important we understand what it is. This amendment \ndoes not dictate what insurance companies can pay their executives. \nThey have the complete ability to pay what they choose. It is not a \nsalary cap. But it does limit the American taxpayers' subsidization of \noutrageous pay and, instead, devotes those resources to protecting \nMedicare.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote in support of strengthening the \nMedicare trust fund. A vote against this amendment is a vote in support \nof having the IRS write a check of $650 million to the health insurance \ncompanies to subsidize the multimillion-dollar salaries they are paying \ntheir executives.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this effort on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayer and our seniors and to vote in favor of our \namendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 39 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes 39 seconds to my \nesteemed friend from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2927\n\n  Mr. President, let me wear my hat as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and talk about the amendment we are going to vote on to cap \nattorney fees. It is a one-sided amendment. It does not hurt attorneys. \nIt hurts injured Americans who seek to recover damages in our court \nsystem. It may not be obvious to the nonlawyers listening to this \ndebate that many ordinary Americans who suffer an injury through \nanother's negligence cannot afford to pay for the legal representation \nthey need to go to court.\n  Our legal system allows for a plaintiff and an attorney to negotiate \nto determine what the compensation is going to be. In these cases, the \nparties sign a contract where the attorney may agree to work on a case \nwith no compensation at all unless the victim ultimately receives \ncompensation from the doctor or hospital responsible for the injury. \nThis is called a contingency fee. In other words, a judge and a jury \nhave to agree that person was injured and deserves this compensation. \nThe parties do not do that. This allows all Americans, not just the \nwealthy, to have their day in court.\n  It should also be noted that if a judge believes a compensation \nagreement is unfair to the victim, or if they believe it is \ndisproportionate, the judge has the power to reduce the fee. I believe \nthis is the same in virtually every State in this country. States have \nregulated the area of attorney compensation extensively, striving for \nreasonableness. States have done this. Doesn't that make the most sense \nthat the States decide?\n  Let's not forget that lawyers only are compensated if the client's \ncase is successful and if a jury finds that a wrong was committed and \nif that jury finds they should be compensated. This is not some kind of \nwindfall. It is the result of an attorney's very hard work to redress a \nwrong.\n  The pending amendment would override all of these traditional \nconsiderations. It would impose a flat cap on all attorney fees for \nsignificant injuries. But the amendment would not cap the attorney fees \nof those representing a negligent hospital or doctor. That hospital, \nthose doctors--their insurance companies could pay any amount of money \nthey wanted, for example, in the case--and there have been cases like \nthis--where the wrong leg was amputated by mistake or a person was \ngiven the wrong medicine and they end up paralyzed.\n  But this amendment says, if that person who was paralyzed wants to \nsue, we are going to cap the amount of compensation that could be \npossibly paid to their attorney. But for the person who wants to escape \nliability for giving the wrong medicine that paralyzed a patient--their \ninsurance companies, their hospitals--they can pay all however much \nthey want for attorneys. They can pay their own counsel 10 times what a \nplaintiff's attorney might get in their effort to prevent a hospital or \ndoctor from being held liable for that horrible mistake.\n  Trust me, this gives a defendant every incentive to prolong \nlitigation. Why should they settle? Why should they admit wrongdoing? \nThey have the deep pockets. Yet through this amendment, a plaintiff \nwould be limited by the actions of the Senate--made up of 100 people \nwho can afford a lawyer, unlike many of the people who are injured? And \nso are we going to say that the Senate has capped what a plaintiff's \nlawyer can get? By the way--wink, wink, nudge, nudge--if you are the \nhospital, the insurance company\n\n[[Page S12541]]\n\nfor a doctor or somebody who has done a grievous wrong, just keep this \nthing rolling long enough because you have the money and you can just \nbeat it down.\n  When a patient receives more than $150,000 in medical expenses or \ncompensatory or other damages, it is because the injury is severe and \nongoing or because it resulted in death. Those patients are going to \nhave a tougher time finding someone to hold the person who harmed them \naccountable. Adding this insult to injury does not further the laudable \ngoals of the pending health care bill. We should be increasing patient \nsafety and health, not punishing those who have already been injured by \nwrongdoing.\n  I understand that yesterday the junior Senator from Nevada identified \nseveral prominent Democrats as having supported a similar amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy a decade ago in a Republican-controlled \nSenate. I am not surprised by this tactic, given the disappointing \ntenor of the debate. Of course, upon a review of the actual vote, \nanyone would see that several Senators in this Chamber, including this \none, opposed a motion to table Senator Kennedy's amendment. That is \nhardly the same as advocating a cap on fees.\n  It is also worth noting that in 1995, the Senate was considering a \ndraconian products liability bill, not a health care bill. At that \ntime, the then-Republican majority was attempting to go further than \nany other Congress in history to prevent injured Americans from \nrecovering damages from the corporations that hurt them or their \nchildren.\n  I am relieved that legislation in 1995 never became law. I can see \nwhy some might have wished it had. Maybe they knew what was going to \ncome because after that, what came to light were many recent incidents \nof harmful products that had been introduced into commerce--many of \nthem toys for little children--and nothing could have been done about \nit had that bill become law. If that bill had become law, I fear we \nwould have seen many more deaths or serious injuries among children as \na result of faulty products.\n  I find it ironic, given the often-professed loyalty to the \nsovereignty of the States and the sanctity of private contracts, many \non the other side of the aisle now seem to have no concerns about the \nvast Federal intrusion into these areas of traditional State control \nthat this and other medical malpractice reform proposals represent.\n  Basically they are saying: Oh, we are all for States rights and \nsovereignty of the States except when it may cost some of the big \ninsurance companies some money. We are all in favor of the sanctity of \nprivate contracts--except when it may cost some of the big insurance \ncompanies some money.\n  So I am going to oppose the amendment offered by Senator Ensign. It \nis unfair. It will only hurt Americans who have already been injured by \nmaking it more difficult for them to gain access to our court system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. A minute and a half. I yield 1 minute to my friend from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I have been listening to this debate. It has been very interesting. \nIt is very clear what this amendment does. It hurts the victims who, \nthrough no fault of their own, get hurt in a medical malpractice case \nby essentially making it very difficult for them to get the best \nattorneys. Some of these cases cry out for the best attorneys.\n  But let me tell you, I have been in Congress since the 1980s. When a \nHouse Member or a Senator gets into trouble, do you know the first \nperson they call? An attorney--the best attorney--and they do not come \non this floor and say: Oh, let's make sure those attorneys do not earn \nenough money. They are willing to pay whatever it takes with their \ncampaign accounts. By the way, that is all legal.\n  But I find it amazing that Senators--who the first person they call \nwhen they are in trouble through their work is an attorney--would wind \nup going after victims the way they do. When they are a victim of a \nproblem, as they see it, they get the best attorneys and they pay the \nhigh price. It is just not right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds remain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope we will defeat the Ensign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me, in closing, remind Senators that \nthe Senate is about to conduct two back-to-back votes. The first vote \nwill be on the Lincoln amendment on executive compensation. The second \nvote will be on the Ensign amendment on attorney's fees.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds remains on the minority side.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Ensign amendment is going to come down \nto a choice: Are you on the side of the patients or are you on the side \nof the trial bar, personal injury attorneys. That is what it comes down \nto. Personal injury attorneys will be able to, on their contingency \nfees--the first $150,000 they will be able to collect\n33\\1/3\\ percent. Anything above that, we are going to cap them at \ncollecting 25 percent.\n  This was from an amendment that was offered in 1995 by Senator Edward \nKennedy. Twenty-one Members of the current Democratic majority who were \nalso Members of the Senate in 1995 who voted for that amendment. Let's \nsee how that vote comes out today. It is the right amendment. Let's be \non the side of the patient instead of the side of the personal injury \nattorneys.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Lincoln amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a brief conversation this \nafternoon\n\n[[Page S12542]]\n\nwith the Republican leader. We originally were not going to offer a \nside-by-side to the Gregg amendment. We have one more vote. We would \nlike Senators Gregg and Pryor to lay down their amendments after that. \nBecause we have told everybody we wouldn't be voting late tonight, we \nneed to complete work on these matters in the morning. So we will \ndebate this tomorrow.\n  It is my understanding that tomorrow there will be a bipartisan \namendment on abortion. We can debate the Pryor and Gregg thing in the \nmorning, and then we will debate abortion, and we will be able to \ndispose of the Gregg and Pryor matters no earlier than 3:15 tomorrow. \nSo we are going to be debating these two things tomorrow.\n  I say this off the subject: We have been grinding things out here for \nsome time on a very partisan basis. I was confronted yesterday with an \nissue. We are here working on a Sunday. We had the President come here \nto talk to the caucus. The Republican leader said: I don't really think \nthat is fair. Why should we be out of session? It is your caucus. So I \nsaid: You keep talking; you can preside. I had no concern about any \nuntoward action taken. In a situation such as that, I had no problem. I \ntrust implicitly Senator McConnell and Senator Kyl.\n  I hope that is kind of a breakthrough here. We have to start trusting \neach other. It is rarely done. I have never seen that happen before. I \nthink it is the right thing to do. I am disappointed that there weren't \nmore Democrats listening to what they had to say. From a procedural \nperspective, I never doubted that everything would go fine.\n  We are going to have one more vote. We will not be in session much \nlonger today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I did \nsuggest yesterday that, since the President was not meeting with us, we \nhad nothing constructive to do during that hour. I suggested that we be \nallowed to speak. We worked that out in our first bipartisan moment on \nthis bill, as he indicated.\n  With regard to the agenda tomorrow, as the majority leader indicated, \nwe have the Gregg amendment, the Pryor amendment, and the abortion \namendment. We will have an additional amendment on this side as well. \nThat is up to four.\n  Mr. REID. A counter to the abortion amendment or something like that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  Mr. REID. Just an additional amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't really know who is going to offer \nthe amendment tomorrow for sure, but it is an issue I want to get out \nof the way. I think we all do. So it is OK. It will be our slot, no \nmatter who will be the first person on the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2927\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 2927 offered by Senator Ensign.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the 2,074-page health care bill before us \nhas a provision on medical liability reform. Here are the savings: \nzero.\n  Back in 1995, Senator Edward Kennedy offered an amendment on \nliability reform to cap attorney's fees. Twenty-one current Democratic \nSenators, who were Members at that time, voted for that amendment. This \nchart lists the Members who were in the Senate then.\n  The Members from the other side of the aisle have made arguments that \nplaintiffs need these contingency fees to be that high. Let me quote an \nabstract of a study written in the Washington University Law Quarterly:\n\n       Since 1960, the effective hourly rates of tort lawyers have \n     increased 1,000 to 1,400 percent (in inflation-adjusted \n     dollars), while the overall risk of nonrecovery has . . . \n     decreased materially for such high-end tort categories as . . \n     . medical malpractice.\n\n  Mr. President, the complete study that I just quoted an abstract of, \nis entitled, Effective Hourly Rates of Contingency Fee Lawyers: \nCompeting Data and Non-Competitive Fees. I would urge all of my fellow \nMembers to review that study.\n  Let me also quote from Howard Dean, who said:\n\n       The reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because \n     the people----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object. If the Senator receives an \nextra minute, then we will have an extra minute on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Howard Dean said:\n\n       The reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because \n     the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial \n     lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on, \n     and that is the plain and simple truth. Now that's the truth.\n\n  That is a quote from Howard Dean.\n  We have a choice. We can be on the side of personal injury attorneys \nor we can be on the side of the patients. I think we should be on the \nside of the patients and vote for the Ensign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is hard to respond to all the \ninaccuracies in the statement of the junior Senator from Nevada.\n  One, incidentally, he may be interested in knowing, as I was leaving \nBurlington, VT, this morning after saying goodbye to a number of our \nGuard members I ran into Howard Dean. He hopes we will pass the bill \nthat is on the floor.\n  Second, the motion he talks about and those who voted, including this \nSenator, was a procedural motion on a question of tabling Senator \nKennedy's amendment. We thought he should be allowed to have a vote. It \nwas not a vote in favor of caps.\n  Lastly, if you look at what he has done with this amendment, he is \nsaying that the insurance companies and the hospitals or somebody who \nmay have cut the wrong leg off or paralyzed you by giving you the wrong \nmedication, they can spend all the money they want to stop you from \ngetting any relief. You, however, will be limited and the Federal \ngovernment will override the laws of your State and tell you what you \ncan contract for on fees with your attorney.\n  In other words, the people who caused the damage can spend any amount \nof money they want to escape liability from the damage. The poor \nindividual who has been damaged would not have an equal chance at \nrecompense. Come on. Is the Senate actually going to vote for something \nlike that? I would hope not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2927.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to ask to have printed in the \nRecord a letter dated December 1, 2009, from the insurance commissioner \nof the State of Oklahoma--she happens to be of your party, the \nmajority's party--outlining the significant problems that she sees for \nour State if this bill becomes law. This is not a partisan document. \nThis is a document that relates to what is going to happen to Oklahoma.\n  If I might summarize, very shortly: It will increase premium costs \nand increase the number of uninsured people in Oklahoma. That is \naccording to our State insurance commissioner, who is of your party. It \nwill decrease the amount of availability of insurance to people who do \nnot have insurance today.\n  The letter states it will not rein in the cost. In fact, it will \nincrease costs for everybody else in the State of Oklahoma. It will \ndrive up costs and increase the number of uninsured. It will increase \nthe costs for the private plans, negatively impacting medical providers \nand the health delivery system in Oklahoma, and it will encourage fewer \nbusinesses in Oklahoma to offer benefits.\n  That is a fairly strong indictment from somebody who cares about the \npeople of Oklahoma and what is going to happen in health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter from the State insurance commissioner of Oklahoma.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Oklahoma Insurance Department,\n\n\n                                            State of Oklahoma,\n\n                              Oklahoma City, OK, December 1, 2009.\n     Re Senate Leadership Bill Patient Protection and Affordable \n         Care Act.\n\n     Senator Tom Coburn,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to give you an \n     Oklahoma perspective on the latest health care reform measure \n     being considered by the US Senate. As you are well aware, the \n     challenges associated with health care in America are \n     immense. These complex problems require solutions grounded in \n     fact and sound deliberation.\n       Large numbers of uninsured Oklahomans generate more than \n     $954 million dollars in uncompensated medical care each and \n     every year in our state alone. This cost is shifted to those \n     with insurance. Recent estimates indicate that this adds an \n     additional $2,911 annually to health insurance premiums for \n     an Oklahoma family of four.\n       As Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner, I strongly support \n     efforts to provide our citizens with high quality health care \n     and affordable health insurance. Many features of the Senate \n     Bill attempt to accomplish this, at least in part, when taken \n     together. However, in the absence of a strong inducement to \n     purchase coverage, the consequences of adverse selection can \n     cause market disruption, higher costs and lower than desired \n     take-up rates.\n\n\n                           Impact to Oklahoma\n\n       (1) Individual Mandate:\n       The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has estimated that there \n     are nearly 600,000 uninsured working Oklahomans--nearly half \n     between the ages of 19 and 32. There is no indication that \n     most of those uninsured would voluntarily enroll in any \n     health benefit plan.\n       Our popular Insure Oklahoma individual plan offers \n     comprehensive, guaranteed issue coverage to individuals \n     earning less than 200% of federal poverty level for less than \n     $40 per month, yet we have only 6,000 covered by that plan \n     and most are over age 30. A healthy 25-year-old male in \n     Oklahoma can purchase a comprehensive individual health \n     insurance policy from a major Oklahoma medical insurer for \n     just $1,634 annually. In Oklahoma, affordability is not the \n     issue for this age cohort. Therefore, we support an \n     individual mandate to purchase health insurance that includes \n     a strong inducement to take up health coverage to avoid the \n     likelihood of adverse selection when only the older and \n     healthier are motivated to enroll.\n       The Senate Leadership bill includes a minor penalty for \n     non-enrollment scheduled to be phased in over a three year \n     period beginning in 2014. The penalty is $95 the first year, \n     increasing to $750 in year three. This penalty is inadequate \n     to induce a large-scale take up of health coverage among \n     Oklahoma's uninsured. Even with generous premium credits, the \n     absence of a strong non-compliance penalty will not encourage \n     the desired and necessary take-up among the young and healthy \n     to offset the greater risk and cost of the older and \n     unhealthier.\n       (2) Guarantee Issue:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would require insurers to offer \n     individual plans on a guaranteed issue basis without pre-\n     existing condition limitations. We support guaranteed \n     coverage when accompanied by a mandate to purchase coverage \n     that is strongly enforced. The absence of a meaningful \n     penalty for non-enrollment will likely result in those with \n     chronic or serious health issues purchasing coverage while \n     younger healthier individuals simply choose to pay the \n     nominal penalty. The result will be higher insurance rates \n     due to a higher percentage of insured being higher risk/\n     expense individuals.\n       (3) Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBP):\n       The Senate Leadership bill would establish ``Qualified \n     Health Benefit Plans'' and require all individual/family \n     plans to conform to QHBP standards by 2014. While the minimum \n     coverage requirements are suitable for some, they restrict \n     individual choice and limit the ability of healthy and/or \n     wealthier individuals from self-insuring part of their risk.\n       (4) Rating Standards:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would restrict the use of risk \n     factors in determining rates to geographic area, smoking and \n     age and would limit age bands to a 3:1 ratio. The age band \n     restriction will shift the cost of the older individual to \n     the younger individual. Blue Cross estimates that this factor \n     alone will increase the base cost for a healthy 25-year-old \n     by 44 percent in Oklahoma. This higher cost burden on the \n     young will further discourage coverage take-up and drive \n     up costs to the remaining insured's.\n       (4) Employer Penalties:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would impose a penalty on \n     employers who do not offer coverage equal to $750 for any \n     employee who purchases coverage through a state exchange. \n     This penalty is inadequate to induce an employer to establish \n     a plan. Most employers who do not offer coverage have fewer \n     than 50 employees (only 37 percent of Oklahoma small \n     businesses offer coverage compared to 48 percent nationally) \n     and most uninsured Oklahomans work for small businesses. This \n     nominal penalty creates a potential incentive for certain \n     small employers who currently offer coverage to employees to \n     drop their plan and simply incur the penalty at less expense \n     than the cost of a plan--particularly once the small employer \n     tax credits sunset.\n       (5) State-Based Health Insurance Exchanges:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would require the formation of \n     state-based exchanges from which individual coverage would be \n     solely available and small group insurance may be purchased. \n     While we support the state-based exchange concept and are \n     currently in the planning stages for a similar concept here \n     in Oklahoma, the infrastructure costs have been estimated in \n     the millions of dollars. In the absence of a financial grant, \n     current state budget limitations will preclude Oklahoma from \n     making the necessary investment to create the exchange.\n       (6) Public Health Insurance Option:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would allow for a federal \n     ``Public Health Insurance Option'' from which states may opt-\n     out. Oklahoma would likely resist participation as long as \n     the private insurance market remains robust and competitive. \n     Although the bill provides that the federal government would \n     ``negotiate'' provider rates, experience with Medicare and \n     Medicaid suggests that reimbursement rates for a federal \n     public option would result in low reimbursement rates.\n       Currently, our medical provider community relies on private \n     pay to make up the difference in cost of services over \n     government reimbursement rates resulting in higher private \n     insurance rates--more cost-shift. In addition, we have \n     concerns over the potential for government to assert an \n     unfair advantage that would adversely affect our insurance \n     markets and further stress our health care delivery system.\n       (7) Health Insurance Cooperatives (Co-Ops):\n       The Senate Leadership bill would provide funding to \n     establish non-profit health insurance ``co-ops,'' We question \n     the likelihood that this notion will produce a lower cost \n     option while meeting all requirements stipulated in the bill \n     (specifically, benefit and solvency requirements). Some of \n     the principles embodied in this idea already exist. For \n     example, Oklahoma's largest health insurer, with nearly 30% \n     of the Oklahoma health insurance marketplace, is a mutual \n     company owned by policyholders for the benefit of \n     policyholders.\n       (8) Premium Credits:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would provide ``Premium \n     Credits'' for individuals with incomes up to 400% of FPL. The \n     majority (approximately 65%) of Oklahoma's uninsured \n     population have incomes less than 250% of FPL. Currently, 74% \n     of Oklahoma's total population has incomes of 400% of FPL or \n     less.\n\n[[Page S12544]]\n\n       (9) Medicaid Eligibility Expansion:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would increase eligibility \n     requirements for Medicaid. Recently, the Oklahoma State \n     Coverage Initiative (SCI) process reached consensus and \n     recommended that Medicaid be extended to adults with incomes \n     up to 100% of FPL. The Senate Leadership bill would expand \n     eligibility to all non-elderly persons with incomes up to \n     133% of FPL. This would increase Medicaid rolls by an \n     estimated 285,000 adults and the state's annual cost share by \n     $116 million. This rough estimate is based on current \n     Medicaid experience and does not include working-aged \n     individuals who have not accessed reasonable and timely \n     medical care due to an inability to pay. Our concern is that \n     the cost of this expansion for the state is severely \n     underestimated.\n       (10) Long-Term Care:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would provide for a federal, \n     voluntary long-term care insurance plan. This plan appears to \n     directly compete with the private insurance market based on \n     reasons other than need.\n       (11) Anti-Trust Exemption:\n       The Senate Leadership bill would leave in place the anti-\n     trust exemption established by the McCarren-Ferguson Act. We \n     support such a decision. This exemption has long provided for \n     a more competitive insurance marketplace and has facilitated \n     solvency among carriers.\n       (12) Controlling Cost:\n       As mentioned in the opening of this letter, coverage is \n     essential to increasing access to affordable health care. \n     However, this bill does very little to address rapidly \n     increasing health care costs. Data shows that the number one \n     driver in health insurance premium costs are increased \n     medical costs and utilization. As you know, on average, \n     between $0.80 and $0.90 of every premium dollar for a \n     comprehensive health plan is spent directly on benefits to \n     policyholders.\n       In Oklahoma, we are studying the issue of rising costs as \n     it relates specifically to our non-profit self-insured state \n     plan. Medical costs for the Oklahoma State Employee and \n     Education Group Insurance plan have increased an average of \n     10% annually in recent years.\n       Of concern to us are reports from the CBO and others that \n     the Senate reform plan will reduce premium costs. In \n     actuality, we believe premium costs will rise substantially \n     if adverse selection is allowed to occur and if the cost of \n     medical care is not addressed. While the generous premium \n     subsidies contemplated by the bill will indeed reduce an \n     individual's expense in financing their health care needs (a \n     strategy we agree is necessary to ensure affordability), \n     health insurance premiums will not be lower.\n       Again, I thank you for the opportunity to provide this \n     perspective and I hope that you have found it helpful. If you \n     wish to further discuss this matter, please do not hesitate \n     to contact me at anytime.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kim Holland,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

PREVENTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ENTITLEMENTS \n                   THAT WOULD RAID MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Ban on New Spending Taking Effect.--\n       (1) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to require \n     that savings resulting from this Act must fully offset the \n     increase in Federal spending and reductions in revenues \n     resulting from this Act before any such Federal spending \n     increases or revenue reductions can occur.\n       (2) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services are prohibited from implementing \n     the provisions of, and amendments made by, sections 1401, \n     1402, 2001, and 2101, or any other spending increase or \n     revenue reduction provision in this Act until both the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget (referred to \n     in this section as ``OMB'') and the Chief Actuary of the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the \n     Actuary (referred to in this section as `` CMS OACT'') each \n     certify that they project that all of the projected Federal \n     spending increases and revenue reductions resulting from this \n     Act will be offset by projected savings from this Act.\n       (3) Calculations.--For purposes of this section, projected \n     savings shall exclude any projected savings or other offsets \n     directly resulting from changes to Medicare and Social \n     Security made by this Act.\n       (b) Limit on Future Spending.--On September 1 of each year \n     (beginning with 2013), the CMS OACT and the OMB shall each \n     issue an annual report that--\n       (1) certifies whether all of the projected Federal spending \n     increases and revenue reductions resulting from this Act, \n     starting with the next fiscal year and for the following 9 \n     fiscal years, are fully offset by projected savings resulting \n     from this Act (as calculated under subsection (a)); and\n       (2) provides detailed estimates of such spending increases, \n     revenue reductions, and savings, year by year, program by \n     program and provision by provision.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments or motions be in order today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this issue of health care and health care \nreform has been an issue that has caused a great deal of advertising \nand claims on television from both sides, back and forth. A substantial \namount of the advertising we have seen has been totally and completely \nwithout foundation--completely inaccurate. But, nonetheless, political \ndialogue in this country allows one to say whatever one wishes, so the \nvery aggressive discussion about this issue of health care has taken on \ninteresting tones--claims by some that Congress is working to undermine \nthe Medicare Program.\n  The fact is, those of us on this side of the aisle are the ones who \ncreated the Medicare Program, at a time when most senior citizens had \nno health insurance at all. There were no insurance companies in this \ncountry tracking down senior citizens and saying: Do you mind if we \nsell you a policy for health care? At a time when people's lives were \ngoing to need an increasing claim on health care benefits, were \ninsurance companies tracking them down and saying: Can I do business \nwith you? Of course they weren't. Over half the American people had no \naccess to health insurance. Folks reaching the end of their lives, \nretired, would lay their head down on their pillow at night and wonder \nif tomorrow would be\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\nthe day they would get sick and have no health insurance coverage; and \nwonder if they would get sick, who would treat them or how they would \nfind the money to provide for themselves. So the fact is, this Congress \ncreated something called Medicare at a time when it was decided that \nmaybe we should put together a program to give senior citizens an \nopportunity to be covered with health care.\n  It was decried as socialism--unbelievable--when we tried to put \ntogether this government program to provide Medicare for senior \ncitizens. Some old guy in a little town in North Dakota one night, at a \ntown meeting, got up, and he was so angry with the government. He shook \nhis hand as he spoke. He was a thin, older guy, and his neck was \ncoursing out and bulging so that I thought he was going to have a heart \nattack right there, shouting about the government. At the end of the \nmeeting, an elderly woman took me aside and said: You know what, I hope \nyou are not upset with Ernie because he's been pretty emotional about a \nlot of things. He just had open heart surgery and he gets kind of \nemotional about things.\n  So I saw the gentleman as he was leaving, and I sidled up to him and \nI said: I understand you just had open heart surgery, and he said: \nYeah. So I asked him if his surgery was covered by Medicare, and he \nsaid it was. I said: Well, there is at least one government program \nthat works. He said: Medicare ``ain't'' government. It just ``ain't'' \ngovernment.\n  Well, of course, it is government. The reason he had health insurance \ncoverage was because we--that is we the government, the Congress, the \nAmerican people--decided we weren't going to let people come to the end \nof their years and not have health insurance coverage.\n  Some might say: Well, yes, you put together Social Security and \nMedicare and now you have trouble financing it. That is true. That is \ntrue. We have trouble financing it because of success. We can handle \nsuccess. Our country can handle success. People are living longer and \nbetter lives these days--longer and better lives--and they claim more \nhealth care during those extra 5, 10 or 20 years they are living.\n  I have often told my colleagues that I have an 89-year-old uncle who \nruns in the Senior Olympics. He runs the 50 meter, the 100 meter, and \nthe 200 meter. He runs the 100 meter in under 19 seconds at age 89. \nWould that have happened 30 years ago? Not likely. But people are \nliving longer and healthier lives and it causes some strain on Social \nSecurity and Medicare, but we can deal with success. Surely, we can \ndeal with success.\n  Now we are talking about a system of health care that doesn't work \nfor everybody or it doesn't work very well for many people and it works \nvery well for some others. But should we do nothing or should we decide \nto try to tackle this question?\n  I walked into a restaurant about 2 weeks ago, and I saw what several \nof my colleagues have seen: advertisements on the wall. This particular \nrestaurant, as you walk through the door, has a plate glass window up \nto the ceiling, and it had a couple of advertisements on it. Both of \nthem were advertisements for people who needed to raise money to try to \npay for their health care costs--spaghetti dinners, bake sales, various \nthings to ask people to come and chip in some money for their health \ncare needs.\n  Let me read a few of them. I will not read the name, but this one is \na benefit for Chris's family: A spaghetti feed and silent auction is \ngoing to be held from 5 to 7:30 p.m. to benefit Chris. He is a \nsheriff's deputy who was shot in the head and the abdomen while on duty \nand is still recovering at a rehabilitation hospital outside of Denver, \nCO. They will have a spaghetti feed and silent auction to try to raise \nthe funds to benefit that family for their needs.\n  Here is a spaghetti supper, silent auction, bake sale, free-will \noffering for supper or donations to be made to the Duane fund at the \nCommunity National Bank. He has stomach cancer that has spread to other \nareas and is undergoing various treatments and needs help with medical \nand living expenses.\n  This is what you see on the side of the wall in cafes, posted to a \nbulletin board downtown: A burger supper and free-will offering to be \nheld for Amy. In July, Amy was diagnosed with uterine cancer, which has \nmetastasized to the lymph nodes. She has had surgery and is now \nundergoing chemotherapy radiation and needs to raise funds for health \ncare costs.\n  Here is a pancake breakfast to be held for Sean in the school \ncafeteria. Scrambled eggs, pancakes, and sausage will be served, and \nthere will be a free-will offering. Sean's infant daughter was born \nwith a heart defect and needs corrective surgery and a lengthy stay in \nthe hospital. The staff is hosting the event to defray the expenses so \nthey can provide the funds to try to afford this very expensive medical \ntreatment.\n  Joyce is the mother of Brandy. Brand is a 16-year-old who was \ninvolved in a car accident weeks after her parents decided to give up \ntheir health care coverage so they could afford mortgage payments. The \nfamily had a meatball and mashed potato dinner benefit last month to \nhelp pay for Brandy's health care needs.\n  I have a long list. The list goes on, and one wonders whether we \nshould be oblivious to that, that we walk into the business places in \nthe downtowns and the Main Streets of our communities and see that \nthere are many people who have to have a spaghetti supper or burger \nfeed to see if they can raise enough money just to get to the hospital, \njust for transportation, let alone the surgery, let alone the medical \ntreatment.\n  I think it is the worst, not the best of our political system that \nwhen we debate these things, there is so much misinformation, so much \nbad information that is alleged about legislation to try to deal with \nhealth care.\n  It is interesting to me, I do not know of an attempt of a government \ntakeover of the health care system. I have heard it 1,000 times on this \nfloor. I am not familiar with any legislation that has been discussed \nthat represents a government takeover of health care. I am just not \nfamiliar with it. Maybe it exists in some cubbyhole someplace, but I \nhave not seen it. But I know why the allegation comes to the floor \nevery day--because it works. Scare the devil out of people. Somebody is \ntrying to have a complete government takeover of the health care \nsystem. I wouldn't support a government takeover of the health care \nsystem. I wouldn't support it. I do support Medicare. By the way, that \nis a government-created system to make sure all citizens have access to \nhealth care because the private industry is not going to get there. \nThey didn't prior to Medicare, and they wouldn't now if we didn't have \nMedicare.\n  The very people who come and talk about government health care, it is \ninteresting they do not come to the floor of the Senate offering an \namendment that would abolish Medicare. I don't understand--if, in fact, \nthey really do not like this at all, they should be offering an \namendment that abolishes the Medicare Program, saying it is just not \nworthy, to have a system in which the government tries to guarantee \nhealth care for America's seniors. The reason I think they do not is \nthey agree with Medicare. They believe Medicare should exist, and as a \nresult, they support a form of government health care, at least for \nsenior citizens.\n  What I want to do briefly--I will talk more about that later. I am \ngoing to offer an amendment. I expect it will be tomorrow night or \nTuesday.\n  I see Senator Grassley is on the floor. He has been a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain and others--many on my \nside--Senator Stabenow. There are a lot of folks who have worked on \nthis, the issue of prescription drug importation. I want to make a \ncouple of comments about that. I have not been on the floor speaking \nabout the health care much until now, and I will be offering this \namendment; I guess it will either be tomorrow evening or I expect it to \nbe on Tuesday. But I want to make a couple of comments about it because \nI think it is very important.\n  I don't think you can leave the issue of health care, having tried to \ndo things about the escalating costs--some people talk about bending \nthe cost curve, whatever that means. All I know is, putting the brakes \non increasing costs at the time they are skyrocketing is important for \nbusinesses, for families, for individuals. The question is, What about \nprescription drugs? How can we possibly leave that subject behind?\n\n[[Page S12546]]\n\n  There are a whole lot of people in this country who are taking \nprescription drugs to manage their diseases and keep them out of an \nacute-care bed in a hospital. Cholesterol-lowering medicine, blood \npressure-lowering medicine--a whole lot of people take both every day \nof their lives and do so to manage health care problems. Yet what they \nsee with brand-name prescription drugs is a dramatic increase in \nprices. I want to just give some examples.\n  This year alone, the average price of brand-name prescription drugs \nhas gone up 9.2 percent, well over quadruple the rate of inflation. \nJustification for that? I see none. Should we do something about it? \nShould we try to put the brakes on some of this? I think we should. \nLet's look at some examples. Enbrel, for arthritis, up 12 percent in \n2009; Nexium, for ulcers, up 7 percent in 2009; Lipitor, up 5 percent; \nSingulair, for asthma, up 12 percent; Plavix, up 8 percent; Boniva, for \nosteoporosis, up 18 percent this year.\n  All of us understand--you watch television in the morning and brush \nyour teeth, you have a television set there someplace, and they are \nsaying to you: Do you know what you should be doing? You should be \ngoing to talk to your doctor. You should talk to your doctor and see \nwhether the purple pill is right for you.\n  I don't know what the purple pill is, but the television commercial \nis pretty seductive. You almost feel like: I ought to find a doctor \nsomeplace; maybe I am missing something; maybe the purple pill is right \nfor me.\n  The list go goes on and on. Flomax, Lipitor--you name it, they are \nadvertising it relentlessly. Go ask your doctor whether these pills are \nright for you.\n  The problem is, the American people, with respect to the price of \nprescription drugs, are charged the highest prices in the world. Not \neven close--brand-name prescription drugs cost much more here than \nanywhere else in the world.\n  I have in my desk something I would like, by consent, to show. These \nare two bottles of Lipitor. This is, by the way, the most popular \ncholesterol-lowering drug in America. These bottles, as you can see, \nare the same shape. These pills are made in the same place. They are \nmade in Ireland and then shipped around the world. This bottle was \nshipped to the United States. This bottle, with 20-milligram tablets of \nLipitor, was shipped to the United States. You get to buy them as a \nU.S. consumer for $4.48 per tablet. This bottle--one is red, one is \nblue, same size, same pills, same company--this bottle went to Canada, \nsame 20-milligram tablets. No, it was not $4.48, which the American \nconsumer paid, it was $1.83. It does not matter whether it is Canada, \nItaly, Spain, Germany, France--I would cite exactly the same numbers in \nterms of the American people being told they should be paying double, \ntriple, in some cases quadruple what other people are paying for \nexactly the same prescription drug.\n  On this chart, this represents inflation--the yellow line. This \nrepresents the increased prices for prescription drugs--the red line--\nwhich I think demonstrates clearly why something ought to be done.\n  A group of us have put together a piece of legislation that is \nsimple, and, in my judgment, very effective in addressing this problem \nthat the American people are charged the highest prices in the world \nfor brand-name prescription drugs.\n  An example of that, I sat on a straw bale out on a farm once about a \nyear or so ago with some people at a town meeting. One of the old guys \nout there--he was about 80 years old--he said: My wife and I have \ndriven to Canada every 3 months so she could buy Tamoxifen to treat her \nbreast cancer.\n  I said: Why did you do that?\n  He said: Because we can't afford to buy Tamoxifen in the United \nStates. I bought it for one-fifth of the price in Canada of what it \nwould cost us. My wife has been fighting breast cancer--in her late \nseventies now--for 3 years, and the only way we could afford the drug \nwas to drive into Canada.\n  Most people cannot drive into Canada. There is an informal \nopportunity for people to bring back a 3-month supply on their person \nif they go to Canada. Most Americans cannot possibly do that. But the \nsame drug is sold all over the world by the major drugmakers, and the \ndifference is they charge the highest prices to the American people.\n  The question is this: Why shouldn't the American people have some \nfreedom--the freedom to shop for that same FDA-approved drug wherever \nit is sold if it is sold at a fraction of the price? The answer is, \nthey should have that freedom. Our legislation gives them that freedom.\n  I assume there will be people coming here and saying: If you pass \nthis legislation, that allows the American people to access, through \npharmacists or through registered wholesalers, these identical FDA-\napproved drugs for a fraction of the price. If you do that somehow, we \nare worried we will have an unsafe drug supply, we are worried about \ncounterfeit drugs.\n\n  In this legislation I put together with my colleagues, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Stabenow, and Senator Grassley--a wide range, bipartisan group \nof Senators--that is pretty unusual. This is a bipartisan amendment, by \nthe way. But in our legislation, we have the significant changes that \nare necessary to ensure safe drug supply, not just those you would ship \nin but those you buy here. We talk in our legislation about batch lots \nand pedigree and a whole series of things. So you track every drug \nright back through the chain of custody, right to its manufacturer, and \nthat is something we do not do today.\n  When we offer this, the question is, Do we have the votes to get this \npassed? We have tried for a long time. We have been rebuffed here and \nthere for various reasons.\n  There is a supposed ``deal'' that has been struck with the \npharmaceutical industry, for $80 billion. I think the pharmaceutical \nindustry has something like $220 billion a year in revenues, so that is \n$2.2 trillion over 10 years. A very small fraction of that $220 billion \nwas agreed to by the White House, I guess, and somebody here in \nCongress.\n  One of my colleagues who served here years ago said, ``I am not for \nany deal I am not a part of.'' Most Members of the Senate were not part \nof any deal. So my expectation is, the time and place and reason to \noffer this is right now. We can't do health care and leave behind this \nquestion of the cost, the price of prescription drugs.\n  I think the drug industry is a fine industry. I want them to succeed. \nI want them to be profitable. I want them to be successful. I want them \nto produce the new miracle lifesaving drugs, and by the way, much of \nthat comes from public investments we make in the National Institutes \nof Health. But I just want them to change their pricing strategy. Why \nshould the American people be paying the highest prices in the world?\n  Europe has had a strategy--it is called parallel trading--that they \nhave had in place over 20 years. If you are in England and want to buy \na drug from France, no problem. If you are in Spain and want to buy a \ndrug from Italy, no problem. They have done it for 20 years \nsuccessfully. Somehow, people are suggesting that we can't do what the \nEuropeans do? That is nonsense.\n  We are going to offer this legislation: myself, Senator McCain, I \nmentioned Senator Stabenow, Senator Grassley--there are so many Members \nof the Democratic and Republican side on this. We will offer this \nlegislation, and I hope we will have the 60 votes necessary to pass it. \nI hope finally, at last--at long, long last--we will have enough people \nstanding on the floor of Senate who will say: You know what, I am on \nthe side of the American people here. I am not interested in having the \nAmerican people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs. How about some fair pricing for a change, fair pricing for the \nAmerican people? And how about some freedom, freedom for the American \npeople to access those identical drugs where they are sold at a \nfraction of the price? Why restrict the freedom of the American people? \nEverybody talks about this being a global economy. Well, that is so \nwhen it benefits everybody else, but what about a global economy that \nbenefits the consumer when they want to access an FDA-approved drug \nwhen it is sold elsewhere for a half, quarter, or eighth of the price?\n  Let's give people a little freedom. I hear people talk about freedom \non the floor of the Senate. This will be a bill in which we decide \nwhether we want to\n\n[[Page S12547]]\n\ngive the American people the freedom to access those low-cost \nprescription drugs.\n  I am going to have a lot to talk about when we offer this amendment.\n  Just this year, again, just this year the price of prescription drugs \nhas increased 9.2 percent.\n  I showed the chart. There is no reason that brand-named prescription \ndrugs should be on a stepladder like that. What about the people who \nstruggle, trying to figure out how to buy those drugs? Does anybody \ncare about them?\n  They say the deal that was made with the pharmaceutical industry \naffects what is called the doughnut hole, and 50 percent of the \ndoughnut hole is being filled if they buy brand-named--I don't care \nabout that. That is a recipe for a stew I was not part of making. What \nI do care about is a whole lot of folks going to the grocery store \nwhere the pharmacy is in the back of the store and they are trying to \nfigure out, what do these drugs cost me this time when I fill them so I \nknow how much money I have left to buy food. Over and over in this \ncountry, people are making those choices. There is no excuse for a 9-\npercent increase in these brand-name prescription drugs this year, in \nanticipation of health care reform.\n  The fact is, health care reform ought to contain the kinds of things \nthat begin to put brakes on this.\n  I am not saying you put the brakes on it by imposing government \npricing. I am saying you put the brakes on it by giving the American \npeople the freedom to access those drugs where they are sold at a \nfraction of the price they are sold here. And you give the American \npeople that freedom, I guarantee you, they will shop where they get the \nbest price on identical drugs, FDA approved. It will force the \npharmaceutical industry to reprice drugs in the United States.\n  A couple quick points in conclusion. President Barack Obama was a \ncosponsor of this legislation last year when he was a Senator. The \nChief of Staff at the White House, Rahm Emanuel, was one of the leaders \nin the House on this legislation last year when he served in the House. \nIt tells you a little something about the breadth of support that \nexists or existed for this. Somebody told me at the door as I came in: \nWe are not sure the White House is supporting this. I fully expect the \nWhite House to support an amendment they supported last year in the \nSenate.\n  There are big issues and small issues. This issue is an important \nissue. A lot of us have worked for a long time to get it right. We have \nbeen thwarted by a very powerful industry that has a lot of friends in \nthis town. I am hoping the consumers have a lot of friends as well. A \nlot of people are out there struggling to try to figure out how to \nafford the prescription drugs they need to take. A whole lot of folks \nare deciding, I guess what I will do is get the prescription drugs the \ndoctor says I should have, and I will cut them in half and see if I can \nmake that work somehow. The next time they show up at the counter, it \nis 9 percent more.\n  I say knock off a little of that advertising. There are different \nreports, but there are some reports that say they spend more money on \nmarketing promotion and advertising than they do on research. How about \nknocking off a little of that advertising if that is causing some of \nthe relentless price increases.\n  I want to begin the discussion because we will have a full discussion \non this when it comes to the floor. It will be either tomorrow \nafternoon or Tuesday morning. Senator McCain will be joining me on the \nfloor and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see if we \ncan't finally lift this piece of legislation and get it over the finish \nline. It is important for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had a chance to hear the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I am not rising to speak on that issue right now, but I \nsupport him in that effort. I thank him for working with my staff over \na period of years to develop a bill that does not violate any of our \ntrade agreements. That is an important aspect of the work of the Senate \nFinance Committee on which I serve. I look forward to that debate \ncoming up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to say it is so rare for us to have a bipartisan \namendment. Those of us who have worked on this, including Senator \nGrassley and Senator McCain and many on my side, will be faced once \nagain with the charge that this would undermine safety and so on. I \nwanted to make the point that Senator Grassley was one of those who \nespecially worked with us--and Senator McCain--to make sure we had \nsafety in this legislation, pedigrees, batch lots, safety that does not \nexist now even in domestic supply, let alone imported drugs.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Iowa working with us on this \nlegislation. This is a good piece of legislation. I look forward to \nseeing the Senator from Iowa on the floor when we get it to the floor \nto have that debate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Dorgan. He gave a very good description \njust now of how careful this piece of legislation--of which I am a \ncosponsor--would go not only to make price transparency and price \ncompetitiveness much better for the American consumer but to guarantee \nthe same safety we would for drugs imported as we do for drugs produced \nhere.\n  I rise to speak in a generic way about this 2,074-page bill that is \nbefore us, to speak about people who have raised questions about \nwhether this bill is or is not a first step toward a government \ntakeover of health care. I take the position that it is definitely a \nfirst step in that direction. If you spend a little bit of time \nwatching any of the cable news stations, you will hear someone talking \nabout how the current health reform proposals represent a government \ntakeover of our health care system. The phrase ``government takeover'' \nhas become a common talking point for people opposed to this pending \nbill. Unfortunately, these opponents rarely explain why this bill \nwarrants such a claim, that it is a step toward government takeover of \nthe entire health care system or the nationalization of health care. \nSupporters of these bills don't do much better as well. These \nsupporters dispute the claim but at the same time they seem unaware of \nall the new roles and responsibilities the Federal Government is taking \non in this 2,074-page health care reform bill. I want to explain why I \nsee the pending bills as a government takeover of our health care \nsystem.\n  I don't come to the floor to scare people or misinform them. I am \nmore than willing to listen to different points of view. But if I am \ngoing to use the phrase ``government takeover,'' I want to make sure \nother Senators--and particularly my constituents in Iowa--know what I \nam talking about. I wish to start with the simplest example of \ngovernment takeover, the government-run plan. It is sometimes referred \nto as the public option. This one seems to be pretty straightforward. \nIn other words, the government-run plan is a pretty straightforward \nexample that people can understand the government getting more \ninvolved.\n  If you wonder maybe sometimes why the public at the grassroots is a \nlittle bit concerned about the takeover of health care by the Federal \nGovernment, remember that it was only a few months ago the Federal \nGovernment nationalized General Motors, as an example, and has \npartially nationalized individual banks and financial institutions--in \na sense, taking a big step toward nationalizing the whole financial \nsystem with the Federal Reserve system's intimate involvement and the \nSecretary of the Treasury's intimate involvement in a lot of decision \nmaking there or decisions that affect the entire financial system.\n  We are here with the prospect of building upon other things that have \nhappened this year, having the Federal Government take over health \ncare. The public option is one step in that direction. I see a \ngovernment-run plan, whether it is an opt out, an opt in, a trigger or \na straight government plan paying Medicare rates, as this country's \nfirst step toward a single-payer system. A single-payer system is a \ngovernment-run system, one system for the entire country, as in Canada, \nwithout options or choices that people have. I don't want you to take \nmy word for it.\n  Let's look at a quote from Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois:\n\n\n[[Page S12548]]\n\n\n       A public option will put the private insurance industry out \n     of business and lead to single payer.\n\n  I have another quote by Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts:\n\n       If we could get a good public option it could lead to \n     single payer, and that's the best way to reach single payer.\n\n  Judging by these quotes, I would say both of these prominent Members \nof the Democratic party agree that the so-called public option is a \nfirst step toward government taking over our health care system. But we \ndon't need to rely only upon sound bites. Let me explain why I see the \ngovernment-run plan leading to a single-payer system. The government-\nrun plan may start out with some rules to keep it from having an unfair \nadvantage over private insurers. Supporters might say it is on a level \nplaying field with private insurers. They may say it would have to pay \nthe same rates, form networks, and be independently solvent. But I \nremind people, when they hear those promises today, why something the \ngovernment is doing can be competitive and not unfair competition with \nthe private sector.\n  Those same kinds of promises were made during the Medicare debate way \nback in 1965. Supporters of the bill in 1965 promised the new \ngovernment health insurance program would not interfere with the \npractice of medicine and would pay fair reimbursement rates. But over \ntime, as the costs of the program exceeded projections, the government \nbroke promises it made. The pending bills represent a government \ntakeover of our health care system, because I believe the same thing \nthat happened in 1965 with Medicare, the government breaking its \npromises, will also happen with the so-called public option.\n  In fact, I want to quote from a recent Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       Any policy guardrails built this year can be dismantled \n     once the basic public option architecture is in place . . . \n     That is what has always happened with government health \n     programs.\n\n  Isn't that what Representative Schakowsky and Representative Frank \nwere saying? Start in a very simple way, saying to people the private \nsector needs competition. Government will give that competition. But \nstart with a government-run plan so you can end up with a single-payer \nsystem, regardless of how innocent it sounded when you first started \nout. Slowly but surely, the government plan would take over the market. \nThis is just one example of why I see the pending bills as a government \ntakeover of our health care system. But there are others.\n  I wish to take a look at some health insurance reforms that are \nwithin this bill. All of these insurance reforms aren't bad as separate \nitems. But coupled with all the bad things in the bill, it makes it \ndifficult to sort out the good things.\n  For instance, I support stronger rules and regulations for private \ninsurers. This is within the principle of the Federal Government's \nconstitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, going way back to \n1944 or 1945. The Supreme Court ruled that. Then Congress passed the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act and gave it right back to the States to do, where \nit has been basically regulated. But this bill brings a lot of that \nregulation back to the Federal Government. I do support some stronger \nrules and regulations. Congress should make sure that people are not \ndiscriminated against because of preexisting conditions, and people \nshould not have to stay up at night worrying about whether their \ninsurance will be there when they get sick and need it most, just as \nyou wouldn't want your fire insurance on your house canceled at the \nsame time the fire starts in the house.\n  Those are the kinds of reforms I say are good in this bill and could \nget strong bipartisan support. But the pending bills go much further \nthan creating stronger rules and regulations.\n  First, let's keep in mind that under current law, health insurance is \nprimarily regulated under McCarran-Ferguson at the State level. State \ninsurance commissioners and legislatures set most of the rules. The \nhealth reform proposals being debated in the Senate and over in the \nHouse would have the Federal Government take over these \nresponsibilities. Under the present bills, the Federal Government, \neither through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or a newly \ncreated office of health choices commissioner, or an unelected Federal \nhealth board is going to decide what health insurance has to look like. \nWhat every health plan has to cover is what the Federal Government is \ngoing to decide.\n  It is not just a case of ending discrimination. It is a case of the \nFederal Government saying what that health insurance plan needs to look \nlike. If your current coverage does not meet one of the bronze, silver, \ngold, or platinum categories set up by the Federal Government--despite \nthe President's promise--you may not be able to keep what you have.\n  The Federal Government is also going to set a national standard for \nhow much insurers can vary prices between younger and older \nbeneficiaries. These reforms will result in drastic price increases, \nparticularly for younger and healthier beneficiaries. This means \nmillions of people who are expecting lower costs as a result of reform \nwill end up paying higher premiums.\n  So the Federal Government will decide how much plans can charge and \nwhat benefits can be covered. To help make these decisions, the Federal \nGovernment will have a newly created comparative effectiveness research \nprogram. This program would be similar to the ones in Great Britain and \nother foreign governments that decide which treatments you can and \ncannot have.\n  I want everyone to understand that the principle of comparative \neffectiveness research in and of itself is not something I oppose \nbecause I think when it is used as a way of informing patients and \nproviders about best practices, it is a good thing to have. But I am \nalso worried this research could be used as a tool for government to \nration care. Especially the reason for my concern is the recently \npassed House bill failed to include a prohibition on rationing that was \nin their original discussion draft. That discussion draft of the House \nbill, H.R. 3200, stated that the committee should ``[e]nsure that \nessential benefits coverage does not lead to rationing of health \ncare.''\n  But, unfortunately, that line was not included in the final bill.\n  Now, that makes you wonder: When everybody says comparative \neffectiveness research is not going to be used to ration care, then why \nwould you object to a statement saying: ``Ensure that essential \nbenefits coverage does not lead to rationing of health care.'' Why \nwouldn't that be in the bill if that is what you believe?\n  So under these pending bills, you have the Federal Government telling \nprivate plans how much they can charge and deciding what benefits they \nhave to cover. Then the Federal Government is going to tell them--\nagain, a Federal intervention in health care and a step toward more \nnationalization--they are not only going to tell them what benefits \nthey have to cover, but then the Federal Government is going to tell \nyou that you have to buy it.\n  Understand, as far as I know, in the 225-year history of our great \ncountry, the Federal Government has never said you had to buy \nanything--buy or not buy anything. They do not tell you.\n  Somebody is going to say: Well, the States make you buy car \ninsurance. Well, under the 10th amendment, the States can do anything \nthey want to that is not prohibited by the Federal Government. But the \nFederal Government is a government of limited power.\n  So you have the Federal Government saying you have to buy health \ninsurance. But the government takeover does not stop there. The \nproposed bills also include the biggest expansion of the Medicaid \nProgram since it was created in 1965. The bills force 14 million more \nAmericans into Medicaid, even though many doctors will not see Medicaid \npatients. Under current law, the government already pays for about 50 \npercent of health care. But with the new subsidies and massive Medicaid \nexpansion, the Federal Government will eclipse the private market when \nit comes to paying for health care services.\n  I am sure some of my colleagues saw recently released data from the \ninspector general showing that about 12 percent of Medicare payments \nwere payment errors that could be the result of fraud, waste, and \nabuse. It is no wonder then that Medicare is scheduled to be insolvent \nwithin the next 10 years.\n  Clearly, the government cannot afford or even manage the programs it\n\n[[Page S12549]]\n\nhas now. But here we are debating the single largest expansion of \ngovernment health care in history embodied in this 2,074-page bill.\n  So I would like to review why I see the current bill as a government \ntakeover of our health care system.\n  First, there is a government-run plan that will drive private health \nplans out of business. In fact, some Democratic legislators have said \npublicly they see it as a first step toward a single-payer system.\n  Second, States will no longer be in charge of their own insurance \nmarkets. The Federal Government is going to take over the \nresponsibility of setting premiums and defining benefits. So regardless \nof whether you are getting your health insurance through an employer or \non your own, when you go to buy a new policy, the Federal Government is \ngoing to tell you what you can and cannot buy. If you do not buy the \ncoverage the government has chosen for you, you could end up paying a \nnew tax or even end up in jail under this new intrusive health \ninsurance mandate that is going to be enforced by the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Interestingly, an analysis of similar health reform legislation said \nthe IRS would have to grow by 25 percent in order to manage all the new \ntaxes, fees, and mandates.\n  By the way, I have written a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury \ntrying to get exactly some estimate of how much money it is going to \ntake for the IRS to administer this program, and we do not have an \nanswer yet.\n  Finally, we have the single largest expansion of Medicaid since its \ninception. Current proposals plan to add 14 million people to the \nMedicaid Program--a program that States already cannot afford.\n  All of this begs the question then: At more than 2,000 pages, and \nabout $2.5 trillion in spending when fully implemented, how can anyone \nsay the pending bills do not represent a government takeover of health \ncare? From the government-run plan, to a Federal takeover of private \nhealth insurance, to a massive expansion of Medicaid, I find it hard to \ncall the pending bills anything else.\n  The American people want lower costs, higher quality, and better \naccess. That is clear. I share these goals, but I cannot support any \nbill that I believe hands our private system of medicine over to a \nbunch of Washington bureaucrats. That is not what my constituents want, \nand it is not what this country needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I am going to share some facts and fictions that are relevant to this \nbill. I think it will explain to anybody who looks at it carefully why \nSenator Grassley and others who hoped to be able to support this \nlegislation are not able to support it. It is why I am not able to \nsupport it.\n  Supporters of this legislation promise that it will do a number of \nthings. We are being told we should support it and vote for it. But it \ndoes not do those things that are advertised of it. I wish it did. I \nwish we could create something for nothing. I wish we could make these \nnumbers balance, but they do not.\n  Earlier today, one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsaid: We would not do anything about hurting Medicare. We Democrats, 45 \nyears ago, created the program, and we would not do anything to hurt \nit.\n  Well, then, we are going to have a vote. We are going to have a \nserious vote coming up, probably tomorrow, on the Gregg amendment. \nSenator Judd Gregg is one of the most knowledgeable persons in the \nSenate on Medicare. He has worked hard on it for a number of years. He \nchaired the Budget Committee when Republicans were in the majority, and \nnow he is the ranking Republican. Everybody respects him. He has \noffered an amendment that would make sure we do not raid Medicare--and \nthat is exactly what this bill would do. If this bill does not raid \nMedicare, then why wouldn't everybody vote for the Gregg amendment?\n  We are entering a time in which we will have a defining moment. Some \nof my colleagues will say they voted for the Bennet amendment. As we \nsaid then, the amendment meant nothing. It did not do what they said it \nwould do because it did not prohibit the raiding of the Medicare trust \nfund. But my colleagues wanted to adopt it. This is why people are \nangry with Congress--it was a cover amendment.\n  For a day or two it seemed as if the cover may have worked; that by \nvoting for this amendment, my colleagues who are supporting this \nlegislation could say they voted to not hurt Medicare. They could go \nback home and say: I voted for the Bennet amendment.\n  Well, the New York Times--along with anybody who takes the time to \nlook at the amendment--said it was meaningless. And the New York Times \nsupports the legislation. It is meaningless. It was absolutely \nmeaningless. The amendment does not do anything, and will not protect \nthe Medicare program.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to deal with that tomorrow. The \nnumbers in this bill are not adding up. The way this bill is being \nfinanced in part is by a $465 billion raid on Medicare. Well, I am \ngoing to raise a number of issues, but I will not do them all today, so \nyou can rest with some relaxation.\n  As to some of the things that are critical to whether a person can \nsupport this kind of reform, the fiction that has been stated is that \nthe bill's net total cost is $848 billion. Well, in truth, when the \nbill is fully implemented, the first 10 years of full implementation \ncosts $2.5 trillion, three times the number that their supporters \nclaim.\n  How can this happen? Well, Senator Reid and whomever he selected met \ndown the hall in secret, and they talked about the numbers, and they \nwere worried about how to meet the president's claim that their bill \nwould not cost more than $900 billion. They were trying to promise it \nwould be only $848 billion, but the numbers were not adding up.\n  So what did they do? They delayed the implementation of the \nexpenditures the bill promises for 5 years. So they delay the \nexpenditures, the benefits they promised, for 5 years, but the taxes \nstart now. That way, you can take the first 10 years of the bill, and \nit looks pretty good because you only have expenditures--the big \nexpenditures--for 5 years, and you have revenue for 10. Well, this is \nflimflammery. It is not honest. The numbers do not add up.\n  If you examine the bill's costs when it is fully implemented for 10 \nyears, it is $2.5 trillion, $2,500 billion.\n  So I would say, first of all, that is a fiction. The fact is that \nthese numbers are not accurate. They did not do what they said they \nwere going to do. The bill does not do what it promises.\n  No. 2, the President told us in a joint session of Congress that he \nwill not sign a bill that adds one dime to the deficit. Well, that is \npretty good. In fact, they produced this $848 billion bill, they say, \nthat it is going to only cost $848 billion. They say, boy, give us a \npat on the back. Not only is it going to be deficit neutral and not add \nto the debt, it is going to increase revenues by $130 billion, and we \nwill pay down the debt. Have you heard that? We are going to pay down \nthe debt.\n  But they had a number of problems. One of them was they promised to \npay the doctors a reasonable fee. Under the existing law, the way it \nwas passed in one of the budget balancing acts, doctors are set to take \na 23-percent reduction in their payments in 2011 for doing Medicare \nwork--23 percent--which we know we cannot allow to occur. Doctors will \nquit doing Medicare. Many of them are having difficulty continuing to \nsee Medicare patients now. We cannot cut them 23 percent. So what did \nthe writers of this bill do? They increased the doctors' reimbursement \nfor 1 year. Next year, they give them a one-half-percent increase. But \nin the next 9 years, their budget assumptions assume the doctors will \ntake a 23-percent cut. That is absolutely bogus. We are not going to \ncut the doctors 23 percent. We cannot do so and maintain health care in \nAmerica for our seniors. And yet, that is one of the major problems \nwith Medicare today: we are not on a sound financial basis. This bill \nassumes that Medicare expenditures for physicians is going to drop 23 \npercent in 2011 and remain at that rate--and that amounts to a $250 \nbillion shortfall from 2011 through 2019.\n\n  So, they ask: how can we figure out how to do this, how to make this \nbill\n\n[[Page S12550]]\n\ndeficit-neutral and less than $900 billion? We don't want to admit that \nour bill is not a $130 billion surplus over 10 years if we have to pay \nthe doctors, which we are going to pay one way or the other. If we pay \nthe doctors, it will actually be a $120 billion deficit on that issue \nalone. So what can they do? They came up with a budgetary gimmick. They \njust took physician pay out of the health care reform package, and \ndecided to try to pass it on the floor of the Senate, with every penny \nof it, $250 billion, going to the deficit--not a penny of it paid for.\n  So if you bring the physician pay issue back up, and add it to the \nhealth care reform bill that we are supposed to be passing, you end up \nat the beginning of the whole thing with a $120 billion deficit. So, to \navoid that, supporters of this bill moved physician pay out of the bill \nand tried to pass it. A lot of the Democratic colleagues wouldn't vote \nfor that. It failed because, out in the open before the whole world, \npeople did not want to vote, after all of this deficit that we are \nimposing on our children and grandchildren, for another $250 billion \nhit to the debt. How can we continue to do that? So it was voted down, \nthank goodness. But the problem is still there. You have to raise $494 \nbillion in taxes to make this bill deficit-neutral. Instead of using \nthat money to fund new entitlement programs, maybe we ought to use that \ntax revenue to pay for the program we have: Medicare, the one that is \nslipping into serious default, one in which we are not paying the \ndoctors what we should be paying them for the work they do. If we are \ngoing to raise taxes, maybe that is what we ought to do with the \nmoney--and not create a new entitlement benefit that is going to grow \nand far exceed costs projections in the years to come and further \njeopardize our spending. As I think most of my colleagues are pretty \nwell informed, under the present spending program we will double the \nentire debt of the United States of America in 5 years. Then, in 10 \nyears, we will triple it. It will go from $5.7 trillion to over $17 \ntrillion in 10 years. We cannot keep doing this. It is unsustainable \nand the American people know it.\n  So, the cost promises of the bill are not being met. There are a lot \nof other points too. I would just first mention the fact that it was \ncontended at the beginning that this reform bill ought to be able to \nkeep us from spending so much of our gross domestic product on health \ncare. It is a serious matter. We definitely need to wrestle with the \ncost of health care. It is not an easy thing to deal with. But what \ndoes this bill do? It promised it was going to do something about that. \nIt was going to bend the cost curve. Our cost curve on health care is \ncurrently going up, and this bill was going to bend it downward, \ncontain the growth of health care as a percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct in America, and free up money for economic growth and jobs and \nother important items.\n  Well, does the bill do that? No, it doesn't. As Senator Thune has \npointed out, and others have, health care currently is about 17 percent \nof our gross domestic product. Of the total wealth of America, its \nproductivity, 17 percent goes to providing health care. If this bill is \npassed, it will increase to 21 percent, and that is a faster rate of \nincrease than if we didn't pass this bill at all. That is a big deal. I \nthought we had a promise and a commitment that the bill would reduce \nthe percentage of growth there. Indeed, it will not.\n  There are a number of other issues that I will be talking about, \nincluding how the actual premiums for average families for insurance \nwill be going up instead of going down as has been promised by the \nPresident and how this bill will increase the deficit and not reduce \nit; how it will increase the percentage of GDP to health care and not \ndecrease it; how it will increase taxes and how it will raid Medicare, \nbut not shore up the program. I am just going to repeat this again, \nbecause it is important: This bill is a raid on Medicare. It cannot be \ndisputed, in my view. The idea that we could take $465 billion out of \nMedicare and put it into an entirely new program without having any \nadverse effect on Medicare is something I don't think anybody can \nimagine to be true.\n  How did they do that, you might ask. Well, Senator Sessions, surely \nthey thought this through. How can they say that? This is the gimmick. \nThis is how they do it: We are not denying any ``guaranteed'' benefits \nunder Medicare, they say. Don't worry, seniors. All your guaranteed \nbenefits are going to be provided. Where does the $465 billion come \nfrom? Well, we are just going to cut the providers, not your benefits. \nWe are going to cut hospitals. We are going to cut hospice. We are \ngoing to cut home health care. We are going to cut nursing homes. We \nare going to cut disproportionate share hospitals that treat the poor, \nall of these things. We are going to cut all of these institutions and \ngroups that provide health care, but don't worry. You will still get \nall of the benefits you had before. Study after study indicates that \nthe health care providers are already operating on the margin. Health \ncare will be savaged under this bill.\n  Second, if, indeed, we could save money in Medicare--and I think \nthere are some savings there, and we need to work at it and see what we \ncan do without breaching the promise we made to our seniors--if we \ncould save money there, let me ask my colleagues: What would you do \nwith the money that is saved? Would you use it to try to keep Medicare \nhealthy, or would you create a new entitlement program with it and raid \nthe seniors' money?\n  Well, that is what has happened. The savings that are from Medicare \nneed to be kept in Medicare so that we can keep the program from going \ninsolvent in 2017. We should use that money, those savings to help the \nseniors.\n  Remember, Medicare is funded and has been funded by people such as \nBill Eberle from Huntsville, AL, who wrote me about it. He said he paid \ninto the fund for 40 years and now he is ready to draw down benefits. \nHe didn't get any benefit from his years of Medicare taxes until he hit \n65. But now he is ready to draw, and we are considering taking his \nmoney and spending it on somebody else. He doesn't like that. He \ndoesn't think that is right, and he is correct.\n  That is why I am not able to support the legislation. It doesn't do \nwhat it promised. It is going to make our health care situation worse. \nIt is going to create greater debt at a time when our spending is \nalready out of control.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I hope as this debate goes \nforward that we can make some improvements, although I am not confident \nof the direction that we are headed right now. It seems as though any \nsignificant attempt to make real progress with the bill is failing. But \nSenator Gregg's amendment is important. I hope my colleagues will study \nup on it and vote to preserve Medicare and to keep the savings that can \nbe obtained in Medicare in the program, and not create a new \nentitlement.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Judd Gregg's \namendment, which would prevent the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill from \nbeing used to pay to create a new entitlement program to cover the \nuninsured.\n  I do not oppose covering the uninsured. Nor do I oppose reforming the \nMedicare Program. We should do those things.\n  What I oppose is the Reid bill. This is the wrong approach to solve \nthese problems.\n  The amendment offered by my friend from New Hampshire highlights the \nmain problems with the Reid bill and suggests a better approach.\n  His amendment would protect the savings from the Medicare Program, \nand prevent them from being used to create a new entitlement.\n  This would mean that this new program would not have to rely on cuts \nto Medicare to fund its operation. It would also reserve all of the \nmoney taken from Medicare so that it could be used to fix the problems \nin the Medicare Program.\n  Some Democrats have argued that we are not creating a new entitlement \nprogram. They are simply wrong. Just like Social Security, Medicare and \nMedicaid, this bill will commit the Federal Treasury to paying for \nthese new subsidies for the uninsured forever.\n  That means that, as Federal spending continues to grow, this new \nprogram will continue to grow. It will crowd out other federal spending \npriorities, like education and national defense.\n  Any future attempts to modify or restrain its growth will be met by \ncries\n\n[[Page S12551]]\n\nof indignation, arguing that cuts would devastate access to health \ncare. If anyone has any doubts, they should look at the transcripts \nfrom our debate on the Deficit Reduction Act.\n  In 2005, Congress tried to reduce Medicare spending by about $20 \nbillion and enact modest reforms to the Medicaid Program. These \nprograms would have strengthened the long-term solvency of these \nprograms and helped reduce the Federal deficit.\n  In response, Senator Reid called that bill an ``immoral document.'' \nThe junior Senator from California said she strongly opposed the cuts \nin the bill, because they would ``cut Medicare and Medicaid by $27 \nbillion.''\n  Yet today, these same Members and the rest of my Democratic \ncolleagues want to create a new entitlement program that will spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars. And they would pay for it by cutting \n$464 billion from the Medicare Program.\n  I believe these facts highlight why we need to adopt the Gregg \namendment. I don't believe we should create a new entitlement program, \nwhich will permanently obligate our children and grandchildren to pay \nits costs. If my colleagues insist on doing it, however, at a minimum \nwe need to guarantee that any new program has a stable and reliable \nsource of funding.\n  The Medicare cuts in this bill are neither stable nor reliable.\n  My Democratic colleagues have spoken at length about how the Medicare \nprovisions in this bill will bend the growth of heath care spending. \nThat is unfortunately far from accurate.\n  If you don't believe me, listen to what other nationally recognized \nexperts have to say.\n  According to the New York Times, the CEO of the world renowned Mayo \nClinic dismissed the reforms in the bill. Dennis Cortese said the Reid \nbill only took baby steps towards revamping the current fee-for-service \nsystem.\n  The dean of the Harvard Medical School, Jeffery Flier, said that the \nbills being considered in Congress would accelerate national health \ncare spending.\n  I wish there were more actual reforms in this bill. I applaud some of \nthe efforts that Senator Baucus included that will create incentives \nfor coordinated care and rewarding providers who provide higher \nquality. I believe those are exactly the types of things that we should \nbe doing to improve the Medicare Program.\n  Unfortunately, the savings from these actual reforms are a few \npennies compared to the dollars of arbitrary payment cuts included in \nthis bill.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, all of the savings from \nthe various policies to link Medicare payments to quality and encourage \nbetter coordination of care in the Reid bill provide less than $20 \nbillion in total savings.\n  In contrast, the Reid bill includes over $220 billion in arbitrary \npayment cuts to health care providers, including hospitals, nursing \nhomes, home health agencies and hospice providers. The Reid bill also \nincludes an additional $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage \nplans.\n  Those are not reforms. Instead they represent the best efforts of \nfolks in Washington to guess how much it actually costs real doctors \nand nurses to provide health care services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  These cuts are an excellent example of how government price controls \nwork.\n  Medicare does not negotiate payment rates with providers, like \nprivate insurers. Medicare uses price controls to set payment rates. \nExperts in Washington then look at various reported costs, revenues and \nprofits of health care providers and then decide how much we should pay \nhealth care providers.\n  I have often said that everyone thinks they know everything about a \nbusiness, until they actually have to run it. As a former small \nbusiness owner, I want to assure them, it is actually a lot harder than \nit looks.\n  The Medicare cuts in this bill are based on the efforts of folks in \nWashington to decide how much it costs to run a nursing home in \nCheyenne or a home health agency in Gillette. Based on their past track \nrecord, I don't have much confidence in their abilities.\n  In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. It contained over \n$434 billion in Medicare payment cuts. Lots of really smart folks in \nWashington made arguments similar to those we are hearing today about \nhow these cuts would not harm providers or beneficiaries.\n  What happened after these cuts went into effect? Within two years, \nthese cuts had driven four of the largest nursing home chains in the \nNation into bankruptcy.\n  Vencor, Sun Healthcare, Integrated Health Services and Mariner Post-\nAcute Network all filed for bankruptcy. Between them, they operated \n1,400 nursing homes that provided care for hundreds of thousands of \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Similarly, the bill also included cuts in payments to Medicare + \nChoice plans. After these cuts went into effect, one out of every four \nplans pulled out of the Medicare Program. Millions of beneficiaries \nthen lost the extra benefits that these plans had provided.\n  Given this track record, I have grave concerns about what the \nMedicare cuts in the Reid bill would do to Medicare beneficiaries and \nthe doctors, hospitals and other providers who treat them.\n  I have even greater concerns about using any estimated savings from \nthese cuts to fund this new entitlement program for the uninsured.\n  That is why we should pass the Gregg amendment. Rather than relying \non cuts that could devastate the Medicare Program, let's find a stable \nand reliable funding source that we could use to pay for health care \nreform.\n  The Gregg amendment says that savings from any Medicare cuts should \nbe reserved for the Medicare Program. That way, if the Washington \nexperts again got it wrong, we will not have already spent all the \nsavings on another program.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate voted on two \nmeasures, one by the Senator from Massachusetts and one by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska relating to home health benefits. I was unable to attend \nyesterday's session of the Senate but had I voted, I would have voted \nfor both measures.\n  Home health and hospice benefits are very important to Oklahomans. In \nfact, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice reported that \nOklahomans alone may receive a cut of over $1 billion in home health \nand hospice benefits under this bill. I understand the value of home \nhealth and hospice very well. In March 2007, I introduced legislation \nwith Senators Thad Cochran, Roger Wicker, Pete Domenici, and Richard \nShelby, the Preserving Access to Hospice Act, to ensure America's \nterminally ill seniors have access to hospice care, by providing \nimmediate relief for hospices impacted by the Medicare hospice cap and \nauthorizing a MedPAC study on the cap issue. Identical legislation was \nintroduced in the House led by Congressman John Sullivan with many \ncosponsors. I introduced this legislation because of a flawed provision \nin Federal law which required hospices to repay the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, for serving eligible patients in \nprior years. Many small, family, and community-owned hospices faced \nclosure, and patients faced losing access to hospice care. In Oklahoma \nespecially, hospice care companies of all sizes service a large number \nof Oklahomans. However, in 2005, 41 percent of the hospices providing \ncare in Oklahoma received letters from CMS demanding repayment. Since \nthen, I have been working to help small, community hospices in Oklahoma \nas they face repayment letters from CMS for millions of dollars. \nWithout help, hospices face closure and the discharge of significant \nnumbers of terminally ill patients, possibly into more expensive care. \nIn fact, during last summer's contentious debate on physician Medicare \nreimbursements, I argued at the very least for a MedPAC study on \npayment methodology for hospice care to evaluate if there is a problem \nwith payments and whether cap amount revisions are needed.\n  I understand and greatly appreciate the value of good home health \ncare and hospice benefits.\n  Admittedly, one of the measures considered yesterday would have been \nbetter than the other. The amendment from the Senator from \nMassachusetts simply said that nothing in the bill should result in the \nreduction of guaranteed home health benefits. The problem is that \naccess to home health is\n\n[[Page S12552]]\n\nnot a ``guaranteed'' Medicare benefit. So even though the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts passed 96 to 0, will it have a real \nimpact on protecting seniors from the loss of access to home health \ncare? No. The better approach was offered by the Senator from Nebraska. \nUnfortunately, the better approaches are failing by party line votes. \nHowever, I compliment the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, for his \nsupport of the motion by the Senator from Nebraska. This motion would \nhave recommitted this entire legislation to the appropriate Senate \ncommittee to remove the cuts to home health benefits. I think that is \nthe best and most direct approach. I think that is the most honest \napproach. Simply remove the cuts. For the past several days we have \nbeen discussing the cuts to Medicare and especially the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage. In each case, the Republicans have offered motions \nand amendments to recommit this massive 2,000-page health bill back to \ncommittee to improve it, namely, to remove the cuts to programs seniors \nand the disabled use. I was disappointed to see this most recent \nattempt to send this massive bill back to committee to improve it fail \n41 to 53.\n  I look forward to today's debate. One scheduled for a vote is on \nmedical malpractice reform. It will be very interesting to see just how \nserious the Democrats are about health care reform. Currently, the bill \nonly has a ``sense of the Senate'' recognizing medical malpractice \ncosts are a problem. We'll see if they think it is important to really \ndo anything about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/06/senate-section/article/S12552-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.
