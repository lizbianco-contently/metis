Mr. President, with Americans now really focusing in \non the health care debate, it is important to take a step back and \nrecall where we started because somewhere along the way, Democratic \nleaders took their eyes off the ball.\n  It is a good time to remember what this reform debate was all about. \nThe goal of this legislation, by all accounts--everyone agreed--the \ngoal was to lower the cost of health care. This is what the President \nhad to say. It is a direct quote:\n\n       The bill I sign--\n\n  According to the President--\n\n     must . . . slow the growth of health care costs in the long \n     run.\n\n  That was on July 22 of this year. Yet here we are, nearly 5 months \nlater, and the administration's own scorekeeper, the CMS Actuary--the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services Actuary--says the Democratic \nbill will actually drive costs up, exactly the opposite of what the \ndebate was all about in the beginning, and exactly opposed to what the \nPresident indicated on July 22, that he would not sign such a bill.\n  Now, remember, the purpose of reform was to lower people's insurance \npremiums as well. Here is what the President had to say about that, a \ndirect quote:\n\n       I have made a solemn pledge--\n\n  Said the President--\n\n     that I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the \n     end of my first term as President that will . . . cut the \n     cost of a typical family's premiums by up to $2500 a year.\n\n  That was the President campaigning for President on June 24, 2007, \n``a solemn pledge that I will sign a universal health care bill into \nlaw . . . that will . . . cut the cost of a typical family's premiums \nby up to $2500 a year.''\n  Yet now we are being told by the administration's own nonpartisan \nscorekeeper--again the CMS Actuary--that new fees for drugs, devices, \nand insurance plans will drive up insurance premiums.\n  The purpose of reform was also to ease the burden on taxpayers. Here \nis what the President had to say about that:\n\n       No family making less than $250,000 a year will see any \n     form of tax increase.\n\n  That was the President on September 12, 2008: ``No family''--not a \none--``no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of \ntax increase.''\n  Yet now we are told by the independent analysts, such as the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, that taxes will actually go up on those same \ntaxpayers, those making under $250,000 a year.\n  People who like the plans they have were told they would be able to \nkeep them. Here is what the President had to say about that:\n\n       If you like your current plan--\n\n  ``If you like your current plan''--\n\n     you will be able to keep it.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       Let me repeat that: If you like your plan, you'll be able \n     to keep it.\n\n  That was July 21, 2009, just this summer. Yet now we are told by the \nindependent analysts, such as the Congressional Budget Office, that \nmillions of Americans will lose their employer-based coverage and that \nmillions of seniors will see their extra benefits cut by about half.\n  Americans are looking at this, and they are truly outraged. The \nAmerican people are outraged at what is happening. They cannot \nunderstand what we are doing. The latest CNN poll says 61 percent of \nAmericans oppose this bill; 61 percent of the American people are \nsaying don't pass this bill.\n  This bill is completely out of touch with the American public. Think \nabout it: 1 out of 10 working Americans is looking for a job, and \nDemocratic leaders in Washington want to spend $2.5 trillion on a bill \nthat makes existing problems worse. Mr. President, 1 out of 10 \nAmericans is out of work, and yet the majority seeks to pass a bill \nthat makes the existing problems worse. Yet Democratic leaders in \nWashington are still insisting that we pass this bill.\n  Even as opposition grows, supporters of the bill are drafting plans \nand cutting deals to make this bill the law of the land by Christmas--\nignoring the wishes of the American people, off in a room somewhere, \ncutting plans and making deals, trying to figure out some way to jam \nthe American people when they are asking us, overwhelmingly: Please \ndon't pass this bill.\n  You get the impression that the supporters of this bill think it is \nabout them, about them and their legacies. Well, this is not about \nthem. This is about the American people. This is not about making \nhistory. This is about doing the right thing for every single \nAmerican's health care.\n  Americans have a message: Higher premiums, higher taxes, higher \nhealth care costs are not what they signed up for. This is not what \nthey were promised. This is not reform. Yes, doing nothing is not an \noption, but making current problems worse is worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13204-5", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13204-S13205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACKIE HAYS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to wish a fond farewell to one \nof the Nation's finest television news anchors, Louisville's own Jackie \nHays. After more than three decades in broadcasting, most of it spent \nin Louisville, Jackie will be retiring, and people throughout \nLouisville and across Kentucky are sorry to see her go.\n  The level of respect Jackie has earned in the community is reflected \nin the many awards she has won over the years. She has received 16--\n16--Best of Louisville awards, including numerous honors as Best Female \nNews Anchor.\n  In 2005, she was named ``Best of the Best'' by Louisville Magazine. \nShe has also received the Star Awards from the Women in Radio and \nTelevision, and Emmy nominations for her work both in Louisville and \nPhiladelphia.\n  Jackie has had a lot of wonderful experiences in her career, all in \npursuit of getting the best story for her viewers. She reported live \nfrom the scene of the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. \nShe interviewed two Presidents; one of them was Ronald Reagan over \nlunch. And, of course, she has been a fixture in many Louisville homes \non the first Saturday of every May, as she has anchored coverage of the \nKentucky Derby 25 times.\n  Once she went up in an F/A-18 Hornet with the Blue Angels, a U.S. \nNavy flying acrobatic team that has performed in the Kentucky Derby \nFestival. She flew at 600 knots--that is nearly 700 miles an hour--and \nwas subjected to seven times the normal force of gravity. She may have \nblacked out briefly with all that force--as the instructor told her \nmost people do--but for the thrill of the ride, and to better tell the \nstory to her viewers, she says it was worth it.\n  Jackie was born in Paris, TN, right over the border from Murray, KY, \nand she attended Murray State University on a special Presidential \nacademic scholarship. She was named the outstanding senior in radio and \ntelevision and began her broadcasting career at a Paducah station while \nstill a senior in college.\n  After graduating with highest honors, she went on to a full-time \nposition, until moving to Louisville in 1980 to work for WHAS \nTelevision. After 5 years, she briefly went to work in Philadelphia, \nbut in 1988 she returned to Kentucky and River City where she has \nstayed ever since.\n  For the last 21 years, since returning to Louisville, Jackie has been \nwith WAVE-3 News. She is currently the anchor of that channel's 5 p.m. \nand 6 p.m. newscasts.\n\n[[Page S13205]]\n\n  After 32 years in broadcasting, Jackie has earned a well-deserved \nrest, and I know she is looking forward to spending more time with her \nhusband Paul, their two daughters, and their dogs. Jackie and Paul are \navid horse riders, and I hear they just got a new horse named Chipper.\n  But Jackie will be greatly missed by the people of Louisville and the \nsurrounding area. Every day, through the television, viewers have \nwelcomed her into their homes. Now we should stop and recognize that we \nhave welcomed her into our community and our lives as well. So I just \nwanted to take this moment to thank her for her incredible career on \nbehalf of Kentuckians everywhere.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13205-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13205-S13219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SERVICE MEMBERS HOME OWNERSHIP TAX ACT OF 2009\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 5 hours for debate, with 2 hours equally divided between the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCrapo, or their designees, 2 hours equally divided between the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, or their designees, and 1 hour under the control of the \nRepublican leader or his designee.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, let me \nlay out today's program.\n  It has been more than 3\\1/2\\ weeks since the majority leader moved to \nproceed to the health care reform bill. This is the 14th day the Senate \nhas considered it. The Senate has considered 18 amendments and motions. \nWe have conducted 14 rollcall votes.\n  Today, the Senate will continue debating the Dorgan amendment on \nprescription drug reimportation and the Lautenberg alternative \namendment to that amendment and we will continue debating the Crapo \nmotion on taxes, for which I have filed a side-by-side amendment as \nwell.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 5 hours of debate, with each \nof the following Senators controlling 1 hour: The Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Crapo; the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan; the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg; the Republican leader and this Senator.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:45 to 3:15 for party conferences.\n  Upon the use or yielding back of the 5 hours of debate, which is \nlikely to be between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock this evening, the Senate \nwill proceed to vote in relation to four amendments in this order: \nFirst, my side-by-side amendment on tax cuts; second, the Crapo motion \nto commit on taxes; third, the Dorgan amendment No. 2793 on drug \nreimportation; and the Lautenberg side-by-side amendment No. 3156 on \ndrug reimportation.\n  Each amendment will need to get 60 votes or else be withdrawn.\n  Upon disposition of these amendments and the motion, the next two \nSenators to be recognized to offer a motion and an amendment will be, \nfirst, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, to offer a motion to \ncommit regarding taxes; and, second, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders, to offer amendment No. 2837 on single payer.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3183 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. President, under the previous order, it is in order for this \nSenator to offer a side-by-side amendment to the motion to commit, \noffered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, and pursuant to that \norder, I call up my amendment No. 3183.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3183.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To protect middle class families from tax increases)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES FROM TAX INCREASES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should reject \n     any procedural maneuver that would raise taxes on middle \n     class families, such as a motion to commit the pending \n     legislation to the Committee on Finance, which is designed to \n     kill legislation that provides tax cuts for American workers \n     and families, including the affordability tax credit and the \n     small business tax credit.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, during the Presidential campaign, \nPresident Obama promised not to raise taxes on Americans who earn less \nthan $200,000 a year or American families who earn less than $250,000 a \nyear. That was his promise. This bill keeps his promise.\n  This bill will provide tax credits to help American families, \nworkers, and small businesses to buy quality health insurance plans \nthrough new fair and competitive marketplaces called insurance \nexchanges.\n  The Congressional Budget Office expects that by the year 2019, 25 \nmillion Americans will buy health insurance plans through the new \nexchanges. The vast majority of those Americans--about 19 million--will \nreceive tax credits; that is, tax reductions, or help paying their \ncopays and other out-of-pocket costs. These tax credits will reduce \ntheir health insurance costs by nearly 60 percent.\n  This bill does not raise taxes on the middle class. This bill is a \ntax cut for Americans.\n  Over the next 10 years, the health care reform bill will provide $441 \nbillion in tax credits to buy health insurance for American families, \nworkers, and small businesses--$441 billion in tax credits. Americans \naffected by the major tax provisions of this bill will receive an \noverall tax cut of 1.3 percent in the year 2017. That is a total of $40 \nbillion. That is an average of almost $450 for every taxpayer affected. \nThat same year, 2017, low- and middle-income taxpayers who earn between \n$20,000 and $30,000 a year will see an average Federal tax decrease of \nnearly 37 percent. I will repeat that. I think it is astounding. People \nwith incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 a year will receive an average \nFederal tax decrease of nearly 37 percent. In that same year, 2017, the \naverage taxpayer making less than $75,000 a year will receive a tax \ncredit of more than $1,300. In 2019, 2 years later, that tax credit \nwill grow to more than $1,500.\n  Without this tax cut, many individuals and families will continue to \nforgo health care because it costs too much. We make it easier for \npeople to buy health care with those tax cuts.\n  In addition to a tax cut, this bill also represents increased wages \nin the pockets of millions of Americans. Even my colleague from Idaho \nagrees that as a result of this bill, Americans will see increased \nwages. He said that exact thing on the floor last week. As a result of \nthis bill, many Americans will see increased wages.\n  Senator Crapo gave the example of an employee, the value of whose \nhealth insurance decreased but whose overall compensation did not \ndecrease. As a result, the employee would receive additional wages.\n  Why are workers going to complain that they are paying more in wages \nbecause they have more money in their pocket? If incomes are going up, \ntheir wages are going up. Clearly, their taxes are going to go up \ncorrespondingly, but obviously the taxes are not going to go up by as \nmuch as the wages.\n  I have a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, dated November \n18, that states just that. On page 18, the Congressional Budget Office \nsays:\n\n       If employers increase or decrease the amount of \n     compensation they provide in the form of health insurance \n     (relative to current law projection), the Congressional \n     Budget\n\n[[Page S13206]]\n\n     Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation assume that \n     offsetting changes will occur in wages and other forms of \n     compensation--which are generally taxable--to hold total \n     compensation roughly the same.\n\n  I have a chart behind me that shows that very point for each of the \nyears this bill is in effect. Looking, first, over to the left--the \nchart shows from 2013 up to 2019, but on the far left, the green is the \npercent of total tax revenue due to increased wages. That is wages \nincreasing. The white is the percent of total tax revenue due to excise \ntaxes, the increased taxes the person will have to pay. Wages far \noutstrip the taxes. The increase in wages is far greater, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Just to repeat, as that chart illustrates, the overwhelming majority \nof revenue raised from the high-cost insurance excise tax will come \nfrom increased wages. Only 17.5 percent of the revenue will be \nattributable to the excise tax. The rest, more than 82 percent, will \ncome from employees getting more than their compensation wages and less \nin inefficient health coverage.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the Crapo motion to commit for what \nit is--and what is that? It is an attempt to kill health care reform. \nThat is all it is all about, nothing more, nothing less. Senator \nGrassley said as much last week. Senator Grassley asked us to vote in \nfavor of the motion to commit ``to stop this process right now.'' That \nis a direct quote.\n  We must not stop this process. We must not stop moving forward in our \nefforts to reform health care. Indeed, we must move forward \naggressively. Every day we delay, 14,000 Americans lose their health \ninsurance. Every day we delay, 14,000 Americans lose their health \ninsurance. In just a 2-week period, one in three Americans will go \nwithout health care coverage at some point. We cannot afford to stop \nworking toward reform. We must reject any attempt to eliminate the very \nprovisions from this bill that provide Americans with a tax cut in an \nattempt to stop health care reform. Despite Republican claims that they \nare trying to protect Americans from tax increases in this bill, the \nfacts are this bill is a tax cut for most Americans.\n  On a related matter, there has been some discussion about the Office \nof the Actuary analysis of the Senate bill. Let me cover two very key \npoints from that letter.\n  The Actuary at HHS concludes that this legislation extends the life \nof the Medicare trust fund by 9 years--9 years. We know the Medicare \ntrust fund is in a precarious position until, roughly, 2017. There are \nsome estimates that this underlying bill would increase the solvency of \nthe trust fund for 4 to 5 more years, say to 2022, roughly. The \nActuary, the person who number crunches over at HHS, concluded this \nlegislation will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by 9 years. \nThat is no small matter. Seniors, near seniors, are very concerned \nabout the solvency of the health care trust fund. This legislation \nextends the solvency of the health care trust fund by 9 years.\n  So just think, if this legislation is not passed, the solvency of the \nhealth care trust fund will not be extended by 9 years. The Actuary \nsays, the Medicare trustees say it will probably start to become \ninsolvent, the Medicare trust fund, the Medicare trust fund will become \ninsolvent in just a few years--2017. Clearly, it is very important to \nextend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. How does this \nlegislation extend the solvency of the trust fund? It is very simple. \nWe cut out a lot of the waste. We cut out a lot of the inefficiency. We \nmake the system work better so the fund is extended for 9 more years.\n  In addition, the Actuary says this legislation, by the year 2019, \nwill result in about a $300-per-couple reduction in Part B premiums. In \naddition to that, the Actuary concludes the legislation will result in \nabout a $400-per-couple deduction in cost sharing. If you add the two \ntogether, that is about $700. So by the year 2019, as a result of this \nlegislation, according to the Actuary--it is in black and white there--\nit says right there, in print, there will be about a $700 reduction in \npremium Part B and out-of-pocket costs for seniors. That is no small \nmatter. It is a reduction.\n  On the other side of the floor, we sometimes hear all this rhetoric \nabout increases. It is just that--it is rhetoric. The actual analysis \nshows a reduction.\n  I also hear rhetoric on the other side about this legislation \nresulting in increased premiums for people. Not true. The Congressional \nBudget Office has concluded that for 93 percent of Americans, there \nwill be a reduction in premiums--a reduction in premiums. To be fair, \nfor those who are already employed, the reduction is not huge, but it \nis a reduction, nevertheless. It is about a 3-percent reduction in \npremiums. That is a reduction. We have to keep working to make it an \neven greater reduction. I daresay--in fact, I know as sure as I am \nstanding here--the reduction will be greater. Why will it be greater? \nBecause a lot of the provisions in this legislation--in my view, the \nCongressional Budget Office hasn't fully analyzed provisions such as \ndelivery system reforms. We start to bundle competent care \norganizations. We start pilot projects. The result of that will be a \nreduction in costs and therefore a reduction in premiums.\n  Also not calculated is the Commission which will look at \nproductivity. That is not included in the CBO analysis. If that were \nincluded in the CBO analysis, the reduction would be even greater. We \nare talking about the remaining 7 percent--remember, I said 93 percent \nwould get a reduction in premiums according to CBO. The remaining 7 \npercent don't get a reduction, but what do they get in return? They get \nmuch better insurance because we have insurance market reform in this \nlegislation. No more preexisting conditions. No more rescissions. No \nmore denial based on health status. No more company limitations on \nannual losses. No more limitations on lifetime losses. So for the same \npremium, they are going to get a lot better quality. Instead of buying \na used car, they are going to get a new car for roughly the same price.\n  So the analysis of this legislation is very clear: Reduction of \npremiums, CBO says so; extension of solvency of the trust fund, CBO and \nthe Actuary say so; a reduction in premiums and out-of-pocket costs for \na couple by $700 by the year 2019. That is what the Actuary says.\n  So this legislation lives up to the promise we made earlier. It does \nnot raise taxes for people making under $200,000. I think the \nlegislation should clearly be passed.\n  Let me say this too. Someone once said--and I will conclude here--\nthat the status quo is really not the status quo. If this legislation \nis not passed, the result is not the status quo; the result is we move \nbackward. We have two choices. Either we move forward as a country and \nseize this opportunity to tackle health care reform and do our very \nbest to get it right or we don't; we do nothing, and we keep sliding \nbackward. Think of the repercussions of not passing this legislation. \nThink of it. First of all, tens of millions of people will not have \nhealth insurance. That, in itself, is pretty profound. Second, we will \nnot have health insurance market reform. We will still have denial \nbased on preexisting conditions, which is basically what the other side \nis arguing for.\n  We would not cut down health care costs, which our businesses need so \nmuch, and families need so much, and our budgets need so much. \nRemember, I mentioned the legislation extends the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  That is emblematic of some of the savings that we have in other \ngovernment programs, too, because health care costs are rising so much. \nMedicare is in tough shape, and so is Medicaid because health care \ncosts are rising so much. The CBO and the Actuary say we are \ncontrolling health care costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n40 minutes and to use that time in a colloquy with other colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I also ask to be notified when there are 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am going to engage in a colloquy about \nthe pending motion on which we will vote later this afternoon or early \nthis\n\n[[Page S13207]]\n\nevening. It is a motion to commit the bill to the Finance Committee and \nhave the Finance Committee make the bill comply with the President's \npledge. Here is the pledge:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains tax, not \n     any of your taxes.\n       . . . you will not see any of your taxes increase one \n     single dime.\n\n  I heard my colleague from Montana say the bill complies with this \npledge. If that were true, then there would be no harm in having the \nFinance Committee scour through it and make sure it does and refer the \nbill back to make sure it doesn't tax the middle class.\n  The reality is, it is very clear this legislation violates this \npledge of the President. As a matter of fact, there are over $493 \nbillion of new taxes in this bill meant to offset the $2.5 trillion \nduring the first full 10 years of implementation of spending in the \nbill.\n  If you will look at the next chart, at the graph on taxes, the first \n10 years--this includes the fees also imposed that CBO and Joint Tax \nsaid will be passed right on through to the consumer. There are $704 \nbillion of taxes and fees in the first 10 years of the bill. If you \nlook at the 10 years of full implementation, meaning when the spending \nactually starts, the taxes and fees are actually $1.28 trillion.\n  My colleague says this is a net tax cut bill, and it complies with \nthe President's pledge because when you take all of the refundable tax \ncredits in the bill and offset against the tax increases, there is a \nnet reduction in tax. In the first place, that is not true when you \ntake into account the fees. I don't think that is what the President \nwas talking about. He didn't mean, did he, that you will not see your \ntaxes go up more than someone else's taxes go down? No, he told people \nin America they would not see their taxes go up.\n  Yet what this bill does, according to the Joint Tax analysis, is, by \n2019, at least 73 million American households earning below $200,000 \nwill face a tax increase.\n  If that is not violating the President's pledge, I don't know what \nis--even if you take the numbers that the majority is trying to use and \nclaim that those are tax cuts.\n  Here is the next chart. What my colleague from Montana is talking \nabout is about $400 billion of what are called refundable tax credits. \nHe wants to offset these tax credits in the bill against the hundreds \nof billions of dollars of tax increases, and then say there is a net \ntax cut and, therefore, no problem.\n  First of all, that is a problem. Secondly, what is a refundable tax \ncredit? The $288 billion, or 73 percent of the so-called tax credit--or \ntax cuts that my colleague from Montana is talking about--are payments \nby the Federal Government to individuals or families who do not have \ntax liability. It is a direct government subsidy. The CBO scores these \npayments as a Federal outlay, as spending, not as tax relief, and that \nis exactly what it is. I think it is a little bit less than credible to \nsay that we have a tax cut bill when three-fourths of the so-called tax \ncuts don't even go to reduce tax liability for taxpayers.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Would the CBO--which is nonpartisan--score a welfare \npayment the same as these so-called tax credits?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes, that is right. A payment of a subsidy to an \nindividual in the United States would be scored as a Federal outlay, or \nspending, as is a refundable tax credit paid to an individual who has \nno tax liability.\n  Let's assume we even accept the argument that is a tax cut. Even if \nyou offset all of that, remember the chart a minute ago that said 73 \nmillion people would pay taxes. Even if you give them credit for that \nargument, there are still going to be 42 million people making less \nthan $200,000 a year who will face a net tax increase. That is a \nviolation of the President's pledge.\n  All this motion does is send the bill back to the Finance Committee, \nwhich writes tax policy, to correct that. The motion helps this bill \ncomply with the President's pledge.\n  The Senator from Montana also used another example, trying to say \nsome of these people who are paying more taxes are getting higher \nwages. This is the game that is going on. The employer of these people \nthe Senator was talking about today provides a salary and health care \nto that employee. In this example, it is $50,000 of wages and $10,000 \nof health care benefits. This bill will now impose a hefty 40- or 45-\npercent tax on this health care plan because it is too good of a health \ncare plan.\n  What CBO and Joint Tax tell us is that because of that immense tax--\n40- to 45-percent tax--the employer is just going to cut the health \ncare plan down to where it is not taxed anymore and provide those \ndollars with an increased wage. So this young lady will get maybe \n$53,000 in wages instead of $50,000 and only $7,000 of health \ninsurance, and her net employment compensation will still be the same, \n$60,000--except she will pay taxes on an extra $3,000. So her net \nemployment package will go down not up, and 73 million Americans like \nher will end up with a smaller employment package, less health care \nbenefits, and increased Federal tax liability. That is the way the bill \nworks.\n  For issue after issue, there are taxes after taxes in this bill that \nwill be paid by the people in this country who earn less than those on \nthe threshold the President identified. That is why we simply ask that \nthe bill be sent to the Finance Committee to have this violation of the \nPresident's pledge, this bad policy of increasing taxes on the middle \nclass in America to pay for a huge new government entitlement program, \nbe removed from the bill.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask my colleague this: I was reading a \nnational publication yesterday, and the headline is ``Making Nightmare \nOut Of Health Care.'' It says taxes will go up. This also says the \nproposed overhaul contains, at last count, 13 different tax hikes. It \ngoes on to say the Joint Tax Committee said that for any one person who \nmay end up paying lower taxes, there will be nearly four times as \nmany--close to 70 million people--who will pay higher taxes.\n  That is why I have been waiting for a week now to vote for the Crapo \nmotion. This was introduced last Tuesday. A whole week has passed, and \nthe Democrats have been filibustering and preventing us from voting on \nthis very important amendment, which the American people agree with--\nthat we ought to eliminate these taxes and stick with what the \nPresident promised the American people.\n  As a result of the President's promises, I read a recent CNN poll. It \nsays that 61 percent of Americans oppose this bill the Democrats are \nproposing. It gets to the specific question of tax increases and the \nPresident's promise. It says:\n\n       Do you think your taxes would or would not increase if this \n     bill passes?\n\n  And 85 percent of the Americans polled said they believe their taxes \nwill go up.\n  I ask my friend from Idaho--it seems to me the American people get \nit; they realize they are going to be hit hard with this $500 billion \nof tax increases, 13 different taxes, which will get put on the backs \nof the hard-working people of our country.\n  Why is it that we are not allowed to vote on this motion? I will vote \nfor it. I appreciate the Senator from Idaho bringing this motion \nforward because, clearly, the support of the American people is behind \nhim.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my colleague. I will give some statistics on the \npoint. The Joint Tax Committee analyzed just the four biggest tax \nprovisions--not all of them--and they concluded that only 7 percent of \nAmericans would be receiving these so-called tax cuts, which are really \nspending subsidies but have been characterized as a tax cut in order to \nargue that the bill doesn't increase taxes. Only 7 percent of Americans \nwill receive those, which represents about 19 million people, but 157 \nmillion people--almost 8 times that amount--who get health insurance \nthrough their employer will not be eligible for these credits. They \nwill pay, on average, somewhere between $593 to $670 a year, depending \non their income categories, in new taxes that are put on their \nshoulders in this bill.\n  I notice that my colleague from Tennessee wants to say something.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Idaho\n\n[[Page S13208]]\n\nfor his amendment to help the President keep his commitment. That is \nbasically what it is. I would think our friends on the other side would \nall want to join us in that. The President said he would not raise \ntaxes on people making less than $250,000 a year.\n  It is amazing to hear the comments that I have just heard. The whole \nconstruction of the bill--when we think about it, regardless of \nwhatever the Democrats decide to do about the so-called public option, \nthey still seem determined--at least the majority leadership seems \ndetermined--to engage in this political kamikaze mission toward a \nhistoric mistake. There is all this talk about history. But there are \nlots of different kinds of history.\n  A lot of historic mistakes have been made about taxes. For example, \nthere was the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which was a big tax. It \nsounded like a good idea. President Hoover, a Republican, recommended \nit to protect American jobs by keeping out cheaper foreign products. \nThat led us into the Great Depression. It was a historic mistake. More \nrecently, there was the boat luxury tax. This sounds good. It was part \nof the budget deal of 1990. Congress put a 10-percent luxury tax on \nboats costing more than $100,000. Sound familiar? We were going to hit \nthe rich people. But it got the working people, not the rich people. \nThe unintended consequence was that it sank the boat industry, costing \n7,600 jobs, according to the Joint Economic Commission, and Congress \nrepealed that historic mistake. There was also the Medicare \nCatastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, another good-sounding goal, to help \nolder people reduce the risk for illness-related catastrophic financial \nlosses. But a lot of our senior Americans resented the idea of paying \nadditional taxes for that coverage, and they revolted. Congress, less \nthan a year and a half later, repealed it.\n  We all remember the millionaires tax. That is a matter of history. In \nthe late 1960s, there were 155 high-income Americans who weren't paying \nany Federal income taxes, so Congress imposed something called the \nalternative minimum tax. Last year, that affected 28 million American \ntaxpayers.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, I think he is doing the country and \nthe President a great service by offering this amendment to help keep \nthe promise because whatever the majority leader decides to do about \nthe government option, this legislation--when fully implemented--still \ncontains $1 million in Medicare cuts 5 years before Medicare is \nscheduled to go broke, according to their trustees.\n  It is nearly $1 trillion in new taxes over 10 years when fully \nimplemented, as the Senator from Idaho has pointed out. There is no \nquestion about that, it is an increase in premiums for most Americans, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. And yesterday on this \nfloor, we talked about the huge bill we are about to send to States to \nhelp pay for this in the Medicaid Program.\n  It is important to support the Crapo motion. It is important for our \ncountry not to have this historic mistake thrust upon them.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would like to jump in here and ask the Senator from \nIdaho a question. From what I understand, the taxes go into effect--\nactually, this is from yesterday, so I think it would be in 17 days \nfrom now based on the current bill before us. All of these taxes the \nSenator from Idaho has on his chart are all the taxes the President \nsaid he would not violate. The article yesterday said 13 taxes. We know \nof at least nine absolute taxes that would go into effect. But the tax \nsubsidies, these payments to folks who do not have a tax liability, \nthose are not received for 1,479 days; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Nevada is correct. The fact is, the taxes \nstart on day one of the bill. The spending, which is what these alleged \ntax cuts are that my colleague from the other side was talking about, \ndoes not start until the fourth year or 2014. And that is just one of \nthe gimmicks in the bill in order to claim it does not drive up the \nbudget--have 10 years of tax increases and only 6 years of spending to \noffset against it. I think that is how they started the spending days. \nThey figured out how long they had to delay it so they could claim it \nwould not drive up the deficit.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I want to address one of these taxes, the so-called \nCadillac tax that the Democrats have put into this bill. The problem \nis, they did not index it for inflation. As time goes forward, with the \nred line as the threshold, the Democrats indexed it for what is called \nthe consumer price index plus 1 percent. That goes up a little bit. The \nproblem is, medical inflation is going up much faster. What happens \nis--the blue line is the average plan in the United States--that is how \nfast it is going up. We can see that is much higher. At this point, it \nstarts catching most of the plans in the United States.\n  This 40-percent tax the unions are running ads against right now is \ngoing to start getting almost all Americans' plans in the future. That \nis the reason a lot of people do not realize this is a tax. It may not \nget them today, but it is going to get them eventually. What is going \nto happen is this tax will be passed on to them in lower benefits.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Before I toss the floor to the Senator from Texas who wants to make \nsome comments, I point out that the point the Senator from Nevada made \nis statistically made by Joint Tax:\n\n       By 2019, at least 73 million American households--\n\n  That is not 73 million Americans, that is 73 million American \nhouseholds--\n\n     earning below $200,000 are going to face these tax increases.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I may respond to the Senator from Idaho. I was \nthinking, when the Senator from Tennessee was talking, about the luxury \ntaxes and how everyone thought that felt so good to have a tax against \nluxury boats. And who suffered? The workers. Then there was the \ncatastrophic Medicare coverage which resulted in a tax on seniors who \nhad that coverage. Seniors erupted, and that was repealed. Then that is \nfollowed on by what the Senator from Nevada talks about--the Cadillac \nplan, which is the high-end plan of coverage.\n  I thought, maybe Congress has learned something. Maybe the Democrats \nare on to something. They have listened to the history of all of these \ngood-sounding taxes on rich people or people who buy expensive things. \nAs the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, they have now learned they \nprobably ought to go ahead and tax both ends instead of just the high \nend because in this bill, you have a tax on the high-end plans. You \nhave a tax on employers who provide too much coverage. Oh, but we also \ntax the people who do not have any coverage. If it is too small, you \nget taxed, and if it is too big, you get taxed. It seems that maybe the \nDemocrats learned the wrong lesson. It is not that you tax just the \nrich or the people who buy expensive things, it is that you tax both \nends to make sure you get every little drop of taxpayer dollars.\n  I think we have shown on this floor from the endless hours of debate \nthat everyone in America is going to be taxed because the taxes that \ntake effect in 3 weeks' time under this bill, January of 2010--the \nmajor tax increase takes place, and that is the tax increase on \nprescription drugs; on insurance companies that are going to have to \nraise their premiums; the drug costs are going to go up; and medical \nequipment, which is essential for seniors, especially for everyone who \nneeds some form of equipment, the equipment manufacturers are going to \nhave a tax. Mr. President, $100 billion in new taxes starts next \nJanuary, 3 weeks from now. Every person in America is going to pay \ntaxes in the form of higher prices starting in 3 weeks.\n  The Senator from South Dakota and I are sponsoring legislation \nbecause the next question will be: Oh, my goodness, if we are going to \nbe taxed in 3 weeks, surely we are going to have some sort of benefit \noffered in 3 weeks, some sort of low-cost health plan or option. Three \nweeks, surely. Oh, no, we are not going to have any of the plan that \nwould offer options to people--not in 2010, not in 2011, no, not in \n2012, not in 2013, but 2014.\n  So all these higher prices are going to start kicking in in January, \nand then we are going to have the Cadillac plan that the Senator from \nNevada mentioned in 2013, all being paid before one supposed benefit \nwould be available. If this is not a bait-and-switch, I have never seen \none.\n  The Senator from South Dakota and I are going to offer the next \namendment after the ones that are in the\n\n[[Page S13209]]\n\ntranche right now to very simply say: Whatever the bill is in the end, \nthere will be no taxes until there is a plan. Not one dime of taxes \ncould take effect until there is actually some sort of plan available \nthat would, hopefully, give some sort of benefit to people, which is \nwhat is being promised.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota if that is his understanding, \nthat we would at least draw a line. Whereas Senator Crapo's motion, \nwhich I support and I know everyone on the floor talking this morning \nsupports, is to say there will be no taxes to anyone who makes under \n$200,000. But even if there are taxes in the end, they will not take \neffect until there is some sort of plan available for people that is \ngoing to help Americans who do not have coverage and for whom we are \nnot able to lower the cost, which is what the Republicans are trying to \ndo. At least we would set that deadline.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota what he has been hearing about \nthis bill.\n  Mr. THUNE. My colleague from Texas is exactly right. Her motion and \nthe motion I am cosponsoring, which we hope to vote on next, will be a \nfollow-on motion to the motion the Senator from Idaho is offering.\n  It seems a basic principle and a matter of fairness to the American \npeople that if you are going to create public policy, that you do it in \na way that treats people fairly and does not raise their taxes before a \nsingle dollar of the premium tax credits and the exchanges that are \ndesigned to create the new insurance product for people would take \neffect. That is what this bill does.\n  The motion of the Senator from Idaho commits all of the tax \nincreases--and I will support that wholeheartedly, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will do the same because these tax increases \nare the absolute worst thing we can do at a time when we have an \neconomy in recession and we are asking small businesses to lead us out \nof the recession. Seventy percent of jobs in the country are created by \nsmall businesses. It is much higher in my State of South Dakota. These \ntax increases could not be more poorly timed in terms of getting the \neconomy restarted and creating jobs for Americans and getting them back \nto work. Since most people get their insurance--at least currently--\nthrough their employer, one of the best things you can do to provide \ninsurance is to put people back to work. This bill has the opposite \neffect. It is a job killer because of all of the tax increases. Every \nsmall business organization has said that. That is why it is so \nimportant we support the motion of the Senator from Idaho.\n\n  Senator Hutchison and I will also offer a motion--hopefully, we will \nget a vote on it later--that at least will delay the tax increases \nuntil such time as the benefits begin. It essentially aligns the \nrevenue increases and the benefits so they are synchronized and you do \nnot have this period of 10 years where you are taxing people for 10 but \nonly delivering a benefit for 6. Again, I think that violates a basic \nprinciple of fairness most Americans should expect when it comes to \ntheir elected leaders making public policy which will have a profound \nimpact on them and their lives. I certainly hope we get a vote on that \nmotion, and I hope our colleagues will support it. To me, it is \nunconscionable that you would raise taxes by $72 billion, which is what \nthis does, up until the year 2014 before the premium subsidies and the \nexchanges kick in which would deliver the benefits that are supposed to \nbe delivered under this bill. The Senator from Texas and I look forward \nto getting a vote on that motion.\n  I hope we can win on the Crapo motion later today.\n  I appreciate my colleagues being here to point out how important it \nis that we have public policy that is fair and also that we not do \nthings that are counter to job creation at a time when we are asking \nsmall businesses to get out there and create jobs and make investments.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The Senator from Idaho had a picture of a woman making \n$50,000 and the health benefits that resulted. My concern is not just \nher taxes; my concern is also her job. It is also a fact that she would \nstill have a job.\n  What I hear from the people of Wyoming is: Don't raise my taxes, \ndon't cut my Medicare, don't make matters worse than they are right now \nin this economy where we have 10-percent unemployment.\n  Like the Senator from South Dakota, I am a member of the National \nFederation of Independent Business. I have been a member for years. \nThey are telling us that as these taxes are raised and collected in \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, in 2010 we are going to lose 400,000 jobs in \nAmerica, and in 2011 another 400,000, and another 400,000 after that, \nand another 400,000, as the taxes continue to be collected. So we would \nbe losing in this country 1.6 million jobs as a result of these \nincreased taxes all Americans are going to have to pay.\n  I ask the Senator from Idaho, isn't it even more critical that we \npass his motion in addition to the fact that we do not want these \ntaxes? They are going to hurt our economy across the board.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Wyoming is exactly right. It is the wrong \nthing to do when our economy needs to be strengthened and restarted, if \nyou will, to apply a huge amount of new taxes.\n  Let's take the example we talked about earlier. This young lady, \nunder the bill in the Senate right now, will not only see her health \nbenefits go down, but the net value of her compensation package will go \ndown. She will get a little extra wages in order to offset the \nreduction of her health care benefits, but those will be taxed and her \nnet compensation package will go down.\n  The point here is this--and it is a little bit ironic that today the \nDemocratic caucus is going to be meeting with the President at the \nWhite House in yet one more closed-door meeting where they are going to \nbe trying to redraft the bill in order to get around some of the \nproblems, which I hope they will let the American people see to debate \nbefore they try to vote on it again.\n  It is ironic, as Democrats come out of that caucus, if they do not \nsupport this motion, they will be violating two of the President's \npledges. One, after meeting with him, they will be violating his pledge \nnot to tax Americans who make less than $200,000--$250,000 for a \nfamily--as well as his pledge: If you like it, you can keep it.\n  This young lady, if she likes her package, cannot keep it. She will \nnot have that option. Her $10,000 health care package will be reduced \nat least $2,000 to the minimum new government-designed acceptable \npolicy and probably a little more than that. She will see a 20- to 30-\npercent reduction in her health care package against her will. I would \nbe willing to bet she would prefer to keep the one she has now. Most \nAmericans like the insurance they are getting through their employers.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would like to ask the Senator from Idaho a question. \nThese are the nine taxes we know for sure that are being raised: 40 \npercent Cadillac plan, a separate insurance tax, an employer tax, a \ndrug tax, a lab tax, a medical device tax, a failure to buy insurance \ntax, the cosmetic surgery tax, and the increased employee Medicare tax.\n  In our States, people think we will pass a sales tax, and the \nbusiness will just pay the sales tax. I ask the Senator from Idaho, who \nactually pays the sales tax? Who have the Congressional Budget Office \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation, which are both nonpartisan, said \nare going to pay these taxes?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator was there when the Joint Tax and CBO experts \nwere asked this question. They squarely and directly said these taxes \nand fees will be passed on, virtually 100 percent, to consumers, which \nmeans two things. First, the ones that are taxes will just be taxes \npassed on to the consumer, as shown in the example of the young lady we \nlooked at. The ones that are fees will simply be passed on in the form \nof higher costs for medical services or higher premiums, which is one \nof the reasons why, contrary to the assertions by the other side, this \nbill will drive up the cost of health care and will drive up the cost \nof premiums, not down.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The last thing I would like to point out goes along with \nthe Senator's chart. This is what the Joint Committee on Taxation has \nsaid: 84 percent of all the taxes being paid in this bill are being \npaid by those making less than $200,000 a year. If this is\n\n[[Page S13210]]\n\nnot a direct violation of the President's promise not to raise one dime \nof their taxes, I don't know what is. I don't understand how the \nPresident can sign this bill and keep to the promise he made during the \ncampaign.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. It is disturbing to \nsee the responses. First, the response that this bill actually doesn't \nincrease taxes; it cuts taxes. That flies right in the face of the \nreports and analysis by Joint Tax and CBO. I encourage everybody to \nread this bill. It is available on my Web site and on the Republican \nWeb site and on the C-SPAN Web site. In addition, we will put up a \nreference to where you can find the bill to read it if you want to \nparse through it to determine who is telling the truth. The bottom line \nis, this bill increases taxes in the first 10 years by $493 billion. \nWhen you add fees to that, it is more like $700 billion. If you counted \nthe first full 10 years of implementation, it is over $1 trillion of \nnew taxes. The only response to that is to try to say that the \nsubsidies for health insurance for those who are not able to purchase \ntheir own insurance are tax cuts, even though three-fourths of them go \nto those who are not, at this point, at a level where they are \nincurring a tax liability.\n  Mr. THUNE. My understanding is, those premium tax credits actually go \nto the taxpayer. When you say this is a tax cut for people, does it end \nup in the pockets of the average taxpayer?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from South Dakota is correct. In fact, this \nsubsidy is not paid to the individual. It is paid directly to the \ninsurance company. Of the one-quarter of people receiving this subsidy \nwho do actually pay income taxes, their income taxes will, in fact, \nstay the same. They are not actually getting a tax cut. What they are \ngetting is a subsidy for the purchase of insurance that is managed \nthrough the Tax Code but is paid directly to the insurance company.\n  Mr. THUNE. That is precisely why the arguments made by the other side \nthat somehow this is a tax cut sort of defy what I think most Americans \nhave come to expect when they get a tax cut; that is, that they get to \nkeep more of what they earn. What we are talking about is a payment \nthat will be made to an insurance company, a tax credit for premium \nsubsidies that will go to an insurance company. There will be very few \nAmericans, as a percentage of the total population, who will actually \nderive any sort of benefit. My understanding is, about 10 percent of \nall Americans will get some benefit from the premium subsidies that \nwill go to the insurance company, not directly to the taxpayer; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CRAPO. It is actually 7 percent.\n  Mr. THUNE. So we have a very small number of Americans who will \nderive a benefit. But you have a whole lot of Americans who will \nactually be paying the freight. The Senator mentioned earlier--I saw \nhis chart--that 73 million Americans are going to end up with higher \ntaxes as a result. Many of the premium tax credits, if you could give \ncredit to the taxpayers receiving this, which you can't because it goes \nto the insurance company, but if you could, three-quarters of that will \ngo to people who currently have no income tax liability. It seems as if \nthe advertising on this is very inconsistent with reality and the \nfacts. The fact is, most Americans will see taxes and premiums go up. \nVery few Americans are going to get some premium tax credit to help \nsubsidize their premium cost, and that will go directly to the \ninsurance company. I understand the Senator from Idaho and the Senator \nfrom Nevada are both members of the Finance Committee. They have been \ninvolved with this from the beginning. That is my understanding of \nthis, which is hard to fathom how that constitutes a tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Idaho has \nconsumed 35 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I agree with the Senator from South Dakota. People who \nmight be watching this must be thinking: Wait a minute. Let me ask the \ntwo members of the Finance Committee: What the Democrats are trying to \nsay is, a Medicare cut is not a Medicare cut and that a tax increase is \nnot a tax increase and that a premium increase is not a premium \nincrease. Isn't it true that when the bill is fully implemented, there \nwill be nearly $1 trillion in Medicare cuts, and isn't it true that \nthere will be nearly about $1 trillion, when fully implemented, in new \ntaxes? Isn't it true the Congressional Budget Office has said that will \nall be passed on to people? Isn't it true that all the taxes start in \nJanuary, if the bill passes? Isn't it also true the Congressional \nBudget Office has said premiums are going to continue to go up and, for \npeople in the individual market, they will go up even more? Isn't that \nall true?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will respond first. The Senator from Tennessee is \nexactly right. Again, on this chart, these are the tax increases for \nthe first 10 years of the bill, and this chart includes the fees and \npenalties that are charged as well. The total there is $704 billion. If \nyou start when the bill becomes implemented or is started to be \nimplemented, in 2014, to compare taxes to spending, the actual taxes \nand fees that will be collected are almost $1.3 trillion.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. There is no question. I can answer the Senator's \nquestion: True, true, true, and true. The old saying, if it walks like \na duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck. These taxes sometimes \nare called fees. The Supreme Court has ruled that a fee that acts like \na tax is, in fact, a tax. Most of the provisions we talked about \nbefore, we call them a tax, and that is what they are. These nine new \ntaxes are a tax. You are exactly right. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nand the CBO have said these are going to be passed on to the consumer. \nWhat they have also said--and I thought this was significant--is that \n84 percent of all these taxes are going to be passed on to people who \nmake less than $200,000 a year. That is what we have been saying. The \nother side says: We are just going to tax the rich. When 84 percent of \nthat tax burden is paid by people making less than $200,000 a year and \nthe vast majority is also paid by people making less than $100,000, the \nvast majority is being paid by people who make less than $100,000 a \nyear, the same as sales taxes. The sales tax has been called a \nregressive tax. These are regressive taxes the Democrats are passing on \nto the American people.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my colleagues for coming over and speaking today \nand discussing this issue with me. I would like to conclude by pointing \nout, once again, the President said he could make a firm pledge, no \nfamily making less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase, not \nyour income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains \ntaxes, not any of your taxes. You will not see any of your taxes \nincrease one single dime. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars \nin tax increases in this bill that are going to fall squarely to the \nbacks of the middle class.\n  Our motion simply says: Let's fix that and take it out. The bottom \nline is, those who are saying that is not the case are trying in the \nfirst case to say there are subsidies in the bill that almost equal the \namount of these taxes and, therefore, it is a net tax cut. First, \nsubsidies are not tax cuts. Three-quarters of them go to individuals \nwho have no tax liability. The other one-quarter does not reduce the \ntax liability of the individuals who are getting the insurance subsidy. \nEven if you accept all of that argument, the President was not saying \nyou will not see net taxes go up in America. The President was not \nsaying: We will not cut or not increase your taxes by more than we will \ncut someone else's taxes. I don't think anybody expected that was what \nhe was saying. The President was saying he would not raise taxes in \nthis bill. This bill violates that pledge.\n  Therefore, Members should support the motion to send this bill back \nto the Finance Committee to fix that glaring problem.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the\n\n[[Page S13211]]\n\ntime allotted to the chairman of the Finance Committee relative to his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about taxes \nand health care. What we are discussing is this bill. It is a large \nbill, over 2,000 pages, but we needed all these pages because we are \ntackling one of the biggest problems facing America. How can we take a \nhealth care system that consumes $1 out of every $6 or $7 in our \neconomy and change it for the better, keeping what is good but changing \nthose things that are not so good? One of the things that concerns most \nof us is the cost of health insurance premiums. Ten years ago, an \naverage family of four paid $6,000 a year for health insurance. Now \nthat is up to $12,000. If we are not careful, in 8 years it is \nprojected to double again to $24,000 a year for health care premiums. \nThink about that, trying to earn $2,000 a month in 8 years just to pay \nfor your health insurance, nothing else. That is beyond the reach of \nindividuals and beyond the reach of a lot of businesses. Even today, \nbusinesses are dropping people from coverage.\n  We now have some 50 million Americans without health insurance, and \nmore and more businesses are just putting their hands up and saying: We \ncan't go any further in paying higher premiums.\n  Individuals who go out on the open market know what they run into. \nYou know you will run into the highest possible premiums and rank \ndiscrimination. Try to buy a health insurance policy if you have any \nhistory of illness. They will tell you: We are not covering that. \nCancer in your background; we will not cover it. That is what people \nface. This current system is unsustainable. We have tackled it, and we \nsaid we are going to put the time in to change it for the better. This \nis our bill.\n  I would like to hold up in my other hand the Republican plan for \nhealth care reform, but it doesn't exist. They don't have a plan. They \nhave speeches. They have press releases. They have charts. But they \ndon't have a plan. I am talking about a plan that has gone through the \nrigors of being carefully reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office, \na plan that is comprehensive, something that addresses all the problems \nin this system in a responsible way.\n  They have bills. They have ideas. I don't want to say anything \nnegative about them, though I may disagree with them. But they don't \neven come close to being a comprehensive plan. Many of the critics on \nthe other side come to the floor every day and give speeches about what \nis wrong with the Democratic health care plan because they don't have \none. If they did, we would have heard about it. You would have thought \nit would have been the first amendment offered by the Republican side, \nif they truly have such a plan. Of course, they don't.\n  What does this plan do? First, it makes health insurance more \naffordable. We have the Congressional Budget Office telling us: Yes, \nthe projected increase in health insurance premiums is going to \nflatten; it is going to come down a little. It doesn't mean that \nautomatically people are going to see their premiums coming down next \nyear, but they may not go up as fast. And over time, we won't see them \ndoubling as quickly as had been predicted.\n\n  Secondly, this is a plan which is going to mean that 31 million \nAmericans who currently have no health insurance will have health \ninsurance. That is pretty important. In all the criticism I have heard \nfrom the other side of the aisle, there has not been a single proposal \nfrom the Republican side that would expand in any significant way the \namount of coverage for Americans when it comes to health insurance. But \nhere are 31 million Americans who will at least have the peace of mind \nof knowing when they go to bed in the evening that if tomorrow there is \na bad diagnosis or a terrible accident, they will be covered; they will \nhave peace of mind they can go to the best doctors and hospitals in \nAmerica. That is significant.\n  There is another element too. We know that right now the health \ninsurance companies really have the upper hand when it comes to \nnegotiating for coverage. You know what I am talking about. Your doctor \nsays: I think you need the following procedure, but I have to check \nwith your insurance company. Think about that. We may be the only \nNation on Earth where a clerk working for an insurance company has the \nlast word about life-or-death medical care. That is what is going on \ntoday.\n  This bill makes significant changes when it comes to health \ninsurance. It protects individuals from being discriminated against \nbecause of preexisting conditions, makes sure the companies can't run \naway from coverage when you need them the most, and extends the \ncoverage and protection for children and families. These are important \nthings that are going to mean a lot to people across America.\n  But now comes the Republican side of the aisle and says: Oh, but they \ndidn't tell you the real story. It is all about your taxes going up. \nWell, I am afraid that is not quite right. The criticism I have heard \non the floor about this bill ignores the obvious: this bill provides \nthe most significant tax cuts in the history of this country--$440 \nbillion in cuts over the next 10 years. What kind of tax cuts? If you \nare making less than $80,000 a year, this bill says: We will be there \nto help you pay the premiums. That doesn't exist today. If you don't \nhave coverage under Medicaid and you are buying health insurance and \nyour income is below $80,000 a year--we are providing tax cuts to \nmillions of Americans so they can afford their health insurance, the \nbiggest tax cut, I think, in the last 20 years or more. In addition, \nthere are tax breaks for smaller businesses. If you have 25 or fewer \nemployees, we will help you and your business provide health insurance \nfor your employees. That is significant.\n  In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation takes a look at the new \ntaxes charged and the tax cuts that are in the bill, and they say \nAmericans will pay 1.3 percent less in taxes in 2017 as a result of the \nbill. So the tax burden on Americans starts to come down while \ninsurance coverage goes up.\n  But don't forget the hidden tax we pay today. When people show up at \nthe hospital without health insurance, they get care. They see a \ndoctor, they may have x rays and all the procedures and all the \nmedicines. But if they can't pay, the hospital charges the other \npatients. We all pay. About $1,000 a year is paid by families now for \nthose who have no health insurance. As more and more Americans are \ncovered, that burden stops shifting over to those who have insurance, \nand that is a good thing. That hidden tax is largely ignored by the \nother side of the aisle, but we know it is a reality.\n  We also think these tax credits will make insurance more affordable. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation says that by 2017, these tax credits in \nthe bill will reduce taxes by $40 billion a year for millions of \nAmericans.\n  We also hear a lot said about the excise tax on insurance policies at \nthe higher levels. That is a tax not on individuals but on the \ninsurance companies as a disincentive to keep running up the cost of \npremiums and instead try to bring efficiency and cost-effectiveness \ninto quality care.\n  Health reform is good for our economy too. A lot of businesses that \nare trying to offer health insurance find that they lose their \ncompetitive edge as the cost goes up. So as we start bringing cost \ndown, it means more competition, more job creation, and a greater \neconomy.\n  I can understand why the other side of the aisle has spent most of \ntheir time finding fault with this bill. In fact, that is part of their \nresponsibility in the Senate. But I had hoped, at the end of the day, \nthey would have offered their substitute, their idea on how we can \ntruly achieve health care reform. The fact they have not reflects one \nof two things: It is a very tough job to do. This is a big bill, it \ntook a lot of work, and perhaps they couldn't come up with a bill \nthemselves. As an alternative, maybe they like the current system. They \nmay like the health insurance companies and the way they treat \nAmericans. They may think it is okay that the cost of premiums will \ncontinue to skyrocket beyond our reach. Most Americans disagree, and I \ndo too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S13212]]\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on time \nunder the control of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me follow up on some of the comments \nof my colleague from Illinois.\n  I am always struck, when I am back home--and I addressed the \nhomebuilders in our State yesterday--by the extent of the \nmisinformation and confusion. When I actually talk to people about the \nunderlying legislation before us, as our deputy leader has done here \nagain today, there is a lot to like about the legislation--a lot to \nlike about the legislation.\n  One of the pieces that hasn't been focused on a whole lot and that I \nwant to mention deals with how do we better ensure that people who are \nsick get well and people who are not sick don't become sick as it \napplies to the use of pharmaceutical medicines.\n  Our legislation calls for doing a number of things.\n  First, if people could actually be healthy, stay healthy, or get well \nby taking certain pharmaceuticals, we would all save money in the end. \nBut under the current system, unfortunately, too many people in this \ncountry who would be helped by pharmaceuticals don't actually get to \nsee a primary care doctor. We don't do a very good job in primary care \nin this country.\n  One of the things that will flow from our legislation is better \naccess to primary care for everybody. Let me give one example of that. \nCurrently, if you are Medicare eligible, you have one lifetime physical \nfrom Medicare. That is it, and that occurs when you sign up for \nMedicare. You don't get a physical every 5 years or 10 years or 20 \nyears; you get one physical in your life that is paid for by Medicare. \nThat will change in the legislation we will be voting on in the days \nahead. We will provide annual physicals as a benefit under Medicare.\n  When we have more regular doctor visits from the primary care doctor, \none of the things that will come about is a better understanding of the \nhealth conditions of people in this country and the notion that some of \nus might actually be healthier, if we have a high blood pressure \nreading, if we take medicine for it or if we have high cholesterol, if \nwe take medicine for that. So the idea is to identify problems that can \nbe treated with medicine. Not everyone can be helped but some can.\n  So the first key is, let's make sure folks who will benefit from \nhaving access to a primary care doctor have that access.\n  Secondly, if there are medicines a person can be taking that will \nhelp them, let's hope the primary care doctor will do his job, refer \nthe patient to a specialist, if needed, in order to identify the \nmedicines needed.\n  The third point would be to make sure that when those medicines are \nidentified, they are actually prescribed and made available to the \nperson.\n  As we all know, we have the Medicare prescription drug program, the \nPart D Program, which is a pretty good program, and about 85 percent of \nthe people who use it actually like it. The program has been \nunderbudget now for each of the 4 years it has been in existence. That \nis pretty good. But when the drug costs of a senior citizen who \nparticipates in the Medicare drug program exceed I think about $2,200 a \nyear, instead of Medicare paying for 75 percent of the medicine and the \nindividual paying 25 percent--which is the case from zero to about \n$2,200 over the course of the year--Medicare basically says: We are out \nof this, and so from $2,200 to $5,200, it is all on the individual \nunless they happen to be very low income.\n\n  So the challenge is to make sure more folks who need access to \nprimary care get that; if they need medicines, make sure they are \navailable, which can be determined by the doctor or doctors as to what \npeople should be taking; No. 3, make certain people get the medicines \nthey are prescribed, that they can afford them, and that they actually \ntake them; No. 4, make sure that once we have the access to primary \ncare, we have made a determination as to what medicines can be helpful \nto a person and that those medicines are prescribed; and then we want \nto make certain the person for whom they are prescribed can actually \nafford them. Part of that is making sure, as we are trying to do in our \nlegislation, we take that hole, if you will, that exists from the \nroughly $2,200 to $5,200 and begin to fill it in so that Medicare \ncovers more and more of the cost.\n  There has been an agreement with the pharmaceutical industry to cover \na portion of that hole, which will take care of about half of it, and I \nunderstand from our leadership in the House and in the Senate and the \nPresident that there is a firm commitment to close it entirely. So the \nrange from $2,200 to $5,200 per year would actually be treated just as \nthe first $2,200 is: Medicare would cover 75 percent of the cost, and \nfor most people, unless they are very poor, will be responsible for \npaying the other 25 percent. That will help a lot of people, and that \nwill make sure folks who were doing OK taking their medicines until \nthey hit that $2,200 gap and stopped will keep taking their medicines \nand they will stay out of emergency rooms and hospitals and they will \nbe healthier as a result.\n  The last piece involves something new. It is called personalized \nmedicine. I had not heard the term before, although I have been \ninterested in the issue for a while. As it turns out, there are some \nmedicines for certain conditions that will help one group of people--\nbecause of the way God made them, because of their genetic makeup--and \nthere is another group of people with a different genetic makeup that \nwill not be helped by the same medicine even though they have the same \ncondition.\n  Part of what flows from our legislation will be an ever-improving \nability to determine who will be helped by a particular medicine given \na certain condition and who will not be, with the same condition, \nsimply because of their genetic makeup. So the idea of making medicines \navailable to people who will be helped, we want to do that, and we are \ngaining the knowledge to be able to say this group will be helped but \nthis group will not, and we can then spend the money where it is going \nto make a difference but stop spending the money where it will not make \na difference. We are close to being able to do that, and we need to do \nthat.\n  All this flows from this legislation, and when you put it together, I \nthink it is actually a very attractive and very smart policy.\n  So overall, how do we provide better health care, better outcomes for \nless money? There is real potential for doing it in the ways I have \njust described.\n  I want to stay on the issue of pharmaceuticals, if I can, but I want \nto pivot and take a somewhat different tack now.\n  I wrote a letter to the administration a week or so ago, maybe 2 \nweeks ago, and I asked the administration for some clarification on the \nissue of reimportation. That is the issue before us today. We have been \ndebating it for some time, and we will be voting later today on a \nproposal by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and then we will \nbe voting on an alternative to that offered by the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg, which I support. If that amendment were \nactually incorporated into the Dorgan amendment, I would support the \nunderlying Dorgan amendment.\n  Anyway, I wrote to the administration, and I got a letter back dated \nDecember 8. I don't think I have ever stood on the floor and read a \nletter, but this is one I am going to read. I want my colleagues and \ntheir staff and anyone else who is listening to actually hear what I am \nabout to say and what the administration had to say on this subject of \nreimportation. It is a little--well, ``awkward'' may be the wrong word, \nbut it has to be a little awkward for the administration because the \nPresident, when he was then-Senator Obama, was a cosponsor of the \nDorgan amendment. When he campaigned for Presidency, on the campaign \ntrail he spoke favorably of the reimportation legislation offered by \nSenator Dorgan. Now that he is President and he leads an \nadministration, he is asked: What is the position of your \nadministration on that legislation you cosponsored as a Senator and \nspoke in favor of as a candidate? Now that you are running the country \nand you are the Chief Executive of the country and you have a whole \nDepartment--the Department of Health and Human Services--whose job it \nis to look out for our safety and health, how do you feel about it?\n\n[[Page S13213]]\n\n  So I wrote a letter basically asking the question, and here is what I \nreceived in response, dated December 8. This is from the head of the \nFDA, the Food and Drug Administration:\n\n       Dear Senator Carper: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     our views on the amendment filed by Senator Dorgan to allow \n     for the importation of prescription drugs. The administration \n     supports a program to allow Americans to buy safe and \n     effective drugs from other countries and included $5 million \n     in its 2010 budget request for the Food and Drug \n     Administration to begin working with various stakeholders to \n     develop policy options relating to drug importation.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Importing non-FDA approved prescription drugs presents four \n     potential risks to patients that must be addressed:\n       (1) the drug may not be safe and effective because it was \n     not subject to a rigorous regulatory review prior to \n     approval;\n       (2) the drug may not be a consistently made, high quality \n     product because it was not manufactured in a facility that \n     complies with appropriate good manufacturing practices;\n       (3) the drug may not be substitutable with the FDA-approved \n     product because of differences in composition or \n     manufacturing; and\n       (4) the drug may not be what it purports to be, because it \n     has been contaminated or is a counterfeit due to inadequate \n     safeguards in the supply chain.\n       In establishing an infrastructure for the importation of \n     prescription drugs, there are two critical challenges in \n     addressing these risks. First, FDA does not have clear \n     authority over foreign supply chains. One reason the U.S. \n     drug supply is one of the safest in the world is because it \n     is a closed system under which all the participants are \n     subject to FDA oversight and to strong penalties for failure \n     to comply with U.S. law.\n       Second, FDA review of both the drugs and the facilities \n     would be very costly. FDA would have to review data to \n     determine whether or not the non-FDA approved drug is safe, \n     effective, and substitutable with the FDA-approved version. \n     In addition, the FDA would need to review drug facilities to \n     determine whether or not they manufacture high quality \n     products consistently.\n       The Dorgan importation amendment seeks to address these \n     risks. It would establish an infrastructure governing the \n     importation of qualifying drugs that are different from U.S. \n     label drugs, by registered importers and by individuals for \n     their personal use. The amendment also sets out registration \n     conditions for importers and exporters as well as inspection \n     requirements and other regulatory compliance activities, \n     among other provisions.\n       We commend [``We'' being the FDA on behalf of the \n     administration] the sponsors for their efforts to include \n     numerous protective measures in the bill that address the \n     inherent risks of importing foreign products and other safety \n     concerns relating to the distribution system for drugs within \n     the U.S. However, as currently written, the resulting \n     structure would be logistically challenging to implement and \n     resource intensive. In addition, there are significant safety \n     concerns related to allowing the importation of non-\n     bioequivalent products, and safety issues related to \n     confusion in distribution and labeling of foreign products \n     and the domestic product that remain to be fully addressed in \n     the amendment.\n\n  The letter concludes by saying:\n\n       We appreciate your strong leadership on this important \n     issue and would look forward to working with you as we \n     continue to explore policy options to develop an avenue for \n     the importation of safe and effective prescription drugs from \n     other countries:\n\n  It is signed ``Sincerely, Margaret Hamburg.'' She is the Commissioner \nof Food and Drug.\n  I suspect this was not an easy letter for Ms. Hamburg to write or an \neasy letter for the administration to sign off on. Given the position \nof the President in the past on this issue and now being confronted \nwith the actual possibility that this legislation would become law, it \nhas to be a struggle. I commend Senator Dorgan and others who have \nworked with him--I think Senator Snowe and, I believe, Senator McCain--\nover the years to try to address the earlier criticisms of the \nlegislation.\n  What the FDA says in this letter to me, and really to us, is that \nprogress has been made. Some of the concerns have been addressed. \nUnfortunately, some have not been.\n  What I hope we do when we vote later today is accept the offer of the \nadministration. They have been willing to put their money where their \nmouth is, to actually put money in their budget request to say before \nwe go down this road as proposed in the Dorgan amendment, let's see if \nwe can't work this out in a way that addresses some of the remaining \nsafety and soundness concerns. I am not sure, if I were the author of \nthe amendment, if I would have accepted that offer from maybe an \nearlier administration whose motives were not maybe as pure--frankly, \nwhose Chief Executive was not committed to addressing this issue.\n  Our President is committed to addressing this issue. The Department \nof Health and Human Services and the FDA are committed to addressing \nthis issue. They are anxious, I believe, to work it out. Not only that, \nthey are anxious and willing to provide some of the funding needed to \ncome to an acceptable resolution and compromise. I hope by our votes \nlater today we will accept that offer from the administration, and I \nhope in the weeks and months ahead we will actually take the steps, not \nnecessarily proposed exactly by Senator Dorgan, that will allow us to \nmove in that direction and do so in a way that does not unduly harm or \nput at risk the citizens of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand I will be yielded time off the leader's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak a little today about this \nissue of the tax burden the Reid bill is putting on people with incomes \nunder $250,000, $200,000. We all know the President said he was not \ngoing to allow taxes to increase for people who have incomes under \nthose numbers. We know there are all sorts of proposals in the Reid \nbill which significantly increase taxes. We also know there are a lot \nof proposals in the Reid bill that significantly increase fees. We also \nknow there are a lot of proposals in the Reid bill which will \nsignificantly increase premiums--all of which people under $200,000 \npay.\n  Why is this? Primarily it is because, if you look at the Reid bill, \nit exponentially increases spending and grows the size of government. \nGovernment is increased by $2.5 trillion under the Reid bill when it is \nfully phased in. It goes from 20 percent of our gross national \nproduct--that is what government takes out today in spending--up to \nabout 24 percent of our gross national product, a huge increase in the \nsize of government.\n  When spending increases like this, at this type of explosive rate, \nthere are a couple of things that occur. One of them is that taxes also \ngo up. It is like day following night. If you are going to increase the \nsize of the government at this rate, you are going to have to \nsignificantly increase taxes--whether you call them fees or whether you \ncall them premium increases or whether you call them outright taxes. \nThat is what is happening. That is because the goal is to grow the \ngovernment dramatically. That is the goal. When you grow the \ngovernment, you inevitably increase the taxes. In fact, in this bill it \nis estimated, when it is fully put into place, that there will be about \n$1.6 or $1.7 trillion in new taxes.\n  There is also, when it is fully phased in, about $1 trillion of \nreduction in Medicare spending. We have had a lot of discussion on that \nmatter on the Senate floor. I have been here a number of times talking \nabout that. But the burden of taxation goes up in order to allegedly \npay for these new entitlements.\n  Why do the taxes have to go up? Because when you increase spending \nthis way you have to pay for it--or you should pay for it. This bill \nattempts to do that by raising taxes dramatically. But the presentation \nthat you can get all this tax revenue out of people who are making more \nthan $200,000 a year simply doesn't fly. It doesn't pass the \ncommonsense test. It is like saying when you cut Medicare $1 trillion \nyou are not going to affect benefits.\n  We heard for a week from the other side of the aisle that no Medicare \nbenefit cuts would occur with $1 trillion of Medicare cuts. Of course, \nthat is not true. We just heard yesterday from the Actuary--the \nPresident's Actuary, by the way, the Actuary of CMS--that when you make \nthese significant reductions in provider payments under Medicare, which \nis where most of the savings occur, that means there are fewer \nproviders who are going to be able to be profitable. In fact, 20 \npercent of providers will be unprofitable under the Reid bill as scored \nby the Actuary for CMS, and, as a result, providers will drop out of \nthe system. Clearly, that will affect benefits to seniors because they \nwill not be able to see providers because they will not exist anymore.\n\n[[Page S13214]]\n\n  It is like telling somebody--someone said; the Senator from Nebraska, \nI think, said--you can have keys to the car, but there is no car. In \nthis instance there will be no providers or many fewer providers.\n  Along with that problem there is this claim--along with that claim \nthat was totally inaccurate, which is that Medicare benefits will not \nbe cut--there is this claim that these new revenues to pay for this \nmassive expansion in spending are going to come from just the wealthy.\n  Again, we have independent sources that have taken a look at this, in \nthis case the Joint Tax Committee. They have concluded that is not the \ncase. That is not the case at all. The argument from the other side of \nthe aisle is we have all these tax credits in here which, when you \nbalance them out against the tax increases, meaning that people earning \nunder $200,000--because some will get tax credits, some will get tax \nincreases, but they balance out so there is virtual evenness, so that \nthe tax credits in the bill to subsidize people who do not have \ninsurance today mostly are balanced by the tax increases on people \nearning under $200,000.\n  Of course, if you are one of the people earning under $200,000 who \ndoesn't get the tax credit, that doesn't mean a whole lot. Your taxes \nare going up. But more importantly, Joint Tax has taken a look at this, \nand by our estimate, what Joint Tax has said is essentially this: 73 \nmillion families, or about 43 percent of all returns under the number \nof $200,000, people with incomes of under $200,000, will, in 2019, have \ntheir taxes go up.\n  So there is a tax increase in this bill, and it is very significant \non people earning under $200,000. In fact, if you compare that to those \npeople who will benefit from the tax credit, what it amounts to is for \nevery one person who is going to benefit from the tax credit, three \npeople earning under the income of $200,000 will see their taxes go up. \nThat is a real problem, first, because it significantly violates the \npledge of the President when he said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gain taxes--\n     not any of your taxes.\n\n  That is what the President said. That pledge is violated by the Reid \nbill, violated very fundamentally for the 73 million people whose \nincomes are under $200,000 and whose taxes go up.\n  So it clearly is not a tax-neutral event for middle-income people. It \nis a tax increase event for a large number of middle-income people. \nForty-three percent of all people paying taxes whose income is under \n$200,000 will have their taxes increased.\n  What is the thought process behind this? The thought process \nessentially seems to be we are going to explode the size of government, \nwe are going to dramatically increase the taxes on the American people, \nand somehow that is going to make life better for Americans. I do not \nsee that happening. I don't see that happening. We know from our \nexperience as a government that growing the government in this \nexponential way probably is going to lead to people having a tougher \ntime making ends meet because their tax burden is going to go up.\n  Discretionary dollars they might have used to send their kids to \ncollege or they might have used to buy a new house or they might have \nused to buy a new car or they might have just simply saved--those \ndiscretionary dollars they don't have anymore because they come to the \ngovernment to fund this massive explosion in programs and this increase \nin the size of government.\n  I think we do not need to look too far to see how this model does not \nwork. All we have to do is look at our European neighbors.\n  This idea that you can Europeanize the economy, that somehow if you \ngrow the government you create prosperity, that is what is basically \nbehind this philosophy: You grow the government, you create prosperity. \nThat does not work. We know that does not work. All we have to do is \nlook at our neighbors in Europe who have used that model to find out \nand conclude that does not work.\n  It would make much more sense to put in place an affordable plan, one \nwhich did not raise the taxes of 73 million people who file income \ntaxes under the income of $200,000, 43 percent of the people paying \ntaxes. It would make much more sense not to grow the government in this \nextraordinary way that we know we cannot afford and that we know ends \nup passing on to our kids a country which has less of a standard of \nliving than we received from our parents.\n  So I hope we take another look at all the taxes in the bill, \nrecognizing that the commitment the President made on the issue of \ntaxes is not being fulfilled by this bill, and go back to the drawing \nboard and reorganize it so we can come closer to what the President \nwanted, which was a bill that did not raise taxes; which was a bill \nthat did insure everyone; which was a bill that did create an \natmosphere where if you wanted to keep your present insurance, you \ncould keep it; and which was a bill that turns the curve of health care \ncosts down.\n  None of those four goals of the President are now met in the bill. In \nfact, according to his own Actuary and according to Joint Tax, for all \nfour of those goals, just the opposite occurs. The number of people \nuninsured remains at 24 million people, the cost curve goes up by $235 \nbillion, taxes go up for 73 million people, and we end up with 17 \nmillion people who have insurance today in the private sector losing \nthat insurance. So I believe we should take another look at this bill \nand try to do a better job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama out of the leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in disbelief. The American \npublic is searching for commonsense answers from its leaders on health \ncare, and yet they are poised to receive an expensive, wholly \ninadequate, and simply illogical so-called solution.\n  After weeks behind closed doors--including now--the majority has \nproduced a bill thus far that raises taxes, makes drastic cuts in \nMedicare, and increases premiums to create a new government program, \nthe so-called public option.\n  I believe the public option is nothing more than socialized medicine \nand expanded government disguised as greater choice. Thus, I am \nadamantly opposed to this bill as it is written.\n  I believe any legislation seeking to effectively address health care \nreform should have as its dual aims cutting costs and increasing access \nto quality care. But, amazingly, this bill just does the opposite on \nboth counts.\n  This proposed legislation is not going to solve our Nation's health \ncare problems and yet likely will exacerbate them. The administration, \nit seems to me, seems to be determined to force the health care bill on \nthe American people, which the majority of citizens do not want or \nneed.\n  I believe we have the best health care system in the world in the \nUnited States of America. While many have scoffed at such a suggestion, \nthe United States, as we know, has the finest doctors, first-rate \ntreatments, cutting-edge innovation, and low wait times.\n  Think about it. People come from all over the world to take advantage \nof our revolutionary medicine and state-of-the-art treatments. The \nUnited States develops new drugs and medical devices years before the \nrest of the world, and American doctors are usually pioneers of new \ntechniques in surgery and anesthesia.\n  As a cancer survivor myself, I am especially proud of the great \nstrides the United States has made in screening and treating cancer. \nThe United States has one of the highest survival rates for cancer in \nthe world and dwarfs survival statistics in Europe. In 2007, U.S. \ncancer survival was 66.3 percent, while Europe's was 47.3 percent. I \nbelieve the answer as to where to receive treatment in the world is \nclear: the United States of America.\n  However, our current system, I would admit, is not perfect, and I \nhave never said it was. But I believe we must seek to build upon rather \nthan tear down these strengths we have. We need a bill that reduces \ncosts and improves quality and level of care for the American people.\n\n[[Page S13215]]\n\n  Here, I believe, we get the exact opposite: a bill that grows big \ngovernment by creating a costly new entitlement program, drives up \nprivate health care costs, and subsequently lowers overall quality and \naccess to care.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's Long Term Budget \nOutlook, the coming tsunami of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \ncosts is projected to push the Federal public debt to 320 percent of \nGDP by 2050 and over 750 percent by 2083.\n  Does anyone truly believe this new legislation will not further add \nto our Nation's debt? When has history proven that our government can \nregulate more effectively than private industry or the marketplace, \nmuch less doing so without adding to the deficit? The reason: we simply \noverspend and overpromise.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate Democrats' \nhealth care proposal, as now written, will cost $849 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  While Americans will be hit immediately with new taxes and government \nmandates, the actual services and coverage promised in this legislation \nwill not be implemented until 2014--a clear attempt to mask the true \ncost of reform. The proposal before us delays government subsidies for \nyet an additional year to hide the real cost of the bill and show so-\ncalled additional savings.\n  Stalling implementation on a program set to run for an indefinite \ntime horizon and calling it ``savings'' is nothing more than fiscal \nsleight of hand. Therefore, the Senate Budget Committee estimates the \ntrue 10-year cost of the proposal to be $2.5 trillion once fully \nimplemented--$2.5 trillion once fully implemented. Let me say that \nagain: $2.5 trillion--a lot of money.\n  To pay for this $2.5 trillion worth of legislation, the government, I \nbelieve, will have no choice but to raise taxes to European welfare \nstate levels or impose drastic restrictions on patient care or, most \nlikely, both.\n  The bill includes over $493 billion in new tax increases, as written, \nand probably another $464 billion in Medicare cuts, placing the burden \nof reform squarely on the shoulders of the middle class, small \nbusinesses, and the elderly.\n  For the middle class, the proposal is a direct hit. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates that in 2019, 73 percent of the so-\ncalled wealthy taxpayers paying the proposed excise tax on high \npremiums will earn less than $200,000 a year. I think the time is now \nto stop heaping debt obligations on the backs of the able bodied.\n  The proposed tax on the so-called Cadillac plans--plans with high \nannual premiums--will not only be passed on to the consumer through \nhigher premiums but will creep its way into the lives of many middle-\nclass Americans.\n  I have a little story. Mrs. Melanie Howard, of Pelham, AL, raised \nthis point when discussing the idea of who actually receives Cadillac \nhealth care. Mrs. Howard spoke to me of the small nonprofit where she \nworked, which had to raise premium prices to offset a few workers who \nwere battling cancer. In effect, she was paying for a Cadillac but \nstill just getting a basic car. Because the tax is based on cost of \ncoverage and not quality and breadth of coverage, many Americans could \nfall into this category.\n  I believe it is a simple actuarial fact that smaller risk pools \nresult in higher premiums. Thus, small businesses, such as Mrs. \nHoward's employer, are naturally going to bear the brunt of this ill-\nconceived Cadillac health insurance tax.\n\n  As taxes increase to pay for the public option, so does the cost of \npremiums on health care plans. The Congressional Budget Office analysis \non premium impacts estimates that family premiums would increase 28 \npercent--from $11,000 per family to over $14,000 per family by 2019. \nThis is more than a $3,000 increase per family.\n  The bill also imposes $28 billion in new taxes on employers who do \nnot provide government-approved health plans, and it charges a penalty \nof $750 per uninsured individual--a form of double taxation.\n  Furthermore, any opportunity to allow individuals to self-manage \ntheir care and plan for future health care costs has been eradicated \nfrom this proposal as now written. Flexible spending accounts help \nindividuals and families pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses that \nare not covered by their health insurance plans with tax-free dollars. \nThese are particularly important for individuals and families who have \nhigh medical expenses, such as seniors and those with chronic health \nconditions or disabilities.\n  The current proposal before us will not only limit allowable flexible \nspending account contributions, but the limit is not indexed for \ninflation, which means the inflation-adjusted or real value of a \nflexible spending account will decline steadily over time until \nvirtually worthless.\n  What is also truly concerning about the current legislation is a \nmassive reduction in care our seniors will face under this legislation. \nThe proposal includes $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, \nnearly $135 billion in Medicare cuts for hospitals that care for \nseniors, more than $42 billion in cuts from home health agencies, and \nnearly $8 billion in cuts from hospices, of all places. I believe this \nnearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare reductions simply must result--has \nto result--in vast reductions in the quality of our seniors' care.\n  I do not believe massive tax increases, a rise in the cost of health \ncare premiums, reduced flexibility in self-management of care, and cuts \nto seniors' health care is what the American people have in mind as a \nway to improve access and create affordable quality health care.\n  We have already seen how this legislation will significantly increase \ncosts and reduce coverage of care. But let's, for a minute, turn our \nattention to the quality of care because there is, indeed, a big \ndifference between government-run health care coverage and actual \naccess to medical care.\n  As Margaret Thatcher once said:\n\n       The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out \n     of other people's money to spend.\n\n  Medical rationing is inevitable under government-run health care. It \nhas to be. Supporters of government-run medicine often cite Canada or \nGreat Britain as models for the United States to follow. Yet medical \nrationing, such as is common in those countries, is inevitable under a \ngovernment-run health care system as now proposed. These countries are \nforced to ration care or, in the alternative, have long waiting lists \nfor medical treatments that lead to the same result.\n  More than 750,000 Britons are currently awaiting admission to the \nNational Health Service hospitals. Last year, over half of Britons were \nforced to wait more than 18 weeks for care or treatment. The Fraser \nInstitute, an independent Canadian research organization, reported in \n2008 that the average wait time for a Canadian awaiting surgery or \nother medical treatment was 17 weeks, an increase of 86 percent since \n1983.\n  Access to a waiting list is not access to health care.\n  A study by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development \nshowed that the number of CT scanners per million in population was 7.5 \nin Britain, 11.2 in Canada, and 32.2 in the United States.\n  For magnetic resonance imaging--MRIs--there was an average of 5.4 MRI \nmachines per million in population in Britain, 5.5 in Canada, and 26.6 \nin the United States.\n  Government-run health care will undermine patients' choice of care.\n  Citizens in those countries are told by government bureaucrats what \nhealth care treatments they are eligible to receive and when they can \nreceive them. I believe Americans need to understand that all countries \nwith socialized medicine ration health care by forcing their citizens \nto wait in lines to receive scarce treatments. Simply put, government \nfinancing means government control, and government control means less \npersonal freedom.\n\n  While we need to enact reforms to our health care system that will \nreduce cost and improve access, our Nation cannot withstand the deep \ndeficits this colossal health care entitlement program, I believe, \nwould create. Instead, we need a system that restores the patients and \ndoctors as the center of every health care decision, rather than the \ngovernment and insurance companies.\n  By making insurance portable, expanding health care savings accounts, \nreducing frivolous lawsuits, emphasizing preventive care, reducing \nadministrative costs, and making insurance\n\n[[Page S13216]]\n\nmore affordable to small business and individuals, I believe we can \nefficiently decrease the costs that currently burden Americans while \nexpanding coverage. The result would be improved quality and affordable \ncare.\n  It appears that no matter how many thousands of letters my office \nreceives in the Senate asking Congress to stop this legislation, this \nadministration is determined to pass something--anything--no matter \nwhat the cost or how damaging the result. The latest CNN poll shows 64 \npercent of Americans oppose this health care reform as now written. The \nAssociated Press reports that over 60 percent of Americans are against \nthis type of reform.\n  It has been said we would be committing Senatorial malpractice to \npass legislation such as this. I agree. I simply do not believe the \nAmerican people desire or deserve what government-run health care would \nresult in: higher taxes, larger deficits, and rationed lower quality \ncare.\n  While we need to enact reforms to our health care system that will \nreduce costs and improve access to all Americans, our Nation cannot \nwithstand the massive cost this colossal health care entitlement \nprogram will create.\n  The health of this Nation will not be helped by risking our Nation's \nfinancial well-being. It has been said if you think health care is \nexpensive now, wait until it is free.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2793\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nunder the hour I control.\n  We are going to have people trotting onto the floor of the Senate \nthis afternoon--and some have this morning--talking about this issue of \nprescription drug reimportation and saying there are safety problems \nwith it--safety problems. I wish to talk about one small piece of \nhealth care reform without which you can't call it health care reform, \nbecause at least with respect to the issue of pricing of prescription \ndrugs, there will be no reform unless my amendment is passed.\n  My amendment is bipartisan. It includes support from Senator Snowe, \nSenator McCain, Senator Grassley on that side and many Democratic \nSenators as well and it says: Let's put the brakes on these \nunbelievable increases in the price of prescription drugs; a 9-percent \nincrease this year alone in brand-name prescription drugs.\n  Why is this an important issue? How about let's talk about the price \nof Nexium--the price of Nexium. You buy it, if you need it: $424 for an \nequivalent quantity in the United States. If you want to buy it \nelsewhere, not $424; you pay $37 in Germany, $36 in Spain, $41 in Great \nBritain. We are charged the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs.\n  We are going to have a lot of people come out and say: Well, there \nwill be safety problems if we reimport FDA-approved drugs from other \ncountries--absolute rubbish.\n  Here is Dr. Rost, a former vice president for marketing for Pfizer \nCorporation, and this is what he said:\n\n       During my time I was responsible for a region in northern \n     Europe. I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, \n     regulatory agencies, the government, or anyone else saying \n     that this practice was unsafe. Personally, I think it is \n     outright derogatory to claim that Americans would not be able \n     to handle reimportation of drugs when the rest of the \n     educated world can do it.\n\n  They have been doing this in Europe for 20 years, reimporting lower \npriced prescription drugs from other countries, and they do it safely. \nOur consumers pay the highest prices in the world because there is no \ncompetition for prescription drugs. When a drug is sold for a fraction \nof the price elsewhere--one-tenth the price for Nexium in Germany and \nGreat Britain--the American people can't access it. Even though it is \nmade in the same plant, the same pill put in the same bottle, the \nAmerican people are told: It is off-limits to you.\n  Dr. Rost also said this: Right now, drug companies are testifying \nthat imported drugs are unsafe. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. This from a former executive of Pfizer Corporation.\n  When the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hill today and tells \nyou that importing medicine is going to be unsafe--and by the way, our \nbill only allows the importation from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, \nand the European countries, where they have an identical chain of \ncustody and where we require pedigree and we require batch lots that \nwill make the entire drug supply much safer, including the domestic \ndrug supply--when the pharmaceutical industry goes around the Hill \ntoday saying: If you vote for the Dorgan-Snowe-McCain, et al. \namendment, you are voting for less safety, ask the pharmaceutical \nindustry this: What about the fact that you get 40 percent of your \nactive ingredients for drugs from India and China and from places in \nIndia and China in many circumstances that have never been investigated \nor inspected by anyone? Answer that, and then tell us that reimporting \nFDA-approved prescription drugs from other countries is unsafe. What a \nbunch of rubbish.\n  My understanding is, sometime yesterday--maybe late last night--\nsomebody made a deal. I don't know what the deal is, but I guess the \ndeal is to say we are going to have this amendment--it has been 7 days \nsince we started debating this amendment--we are going to have this \namendment vote and then we are going to have another vote on another \namendment that nullifies it. It is the amendment I call: I stand up for \nthe American people paying the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs.\n  If you want to support that amendment, go right ahead. What you are \ndoing is nullifying any ability of the American people to have the \nfreedom to access lower priced drugs where they are sold elsewhere in \nthe world. I am talking about FDA-approved drugs made in FDA-approved \nplants. It doesn't matter what the fancy wrapping and the bright \nribbons are on this package.\n  This package to nullify what we are trying to do is a package that \ncomes directly from the pharmaceutical industry. Why? To protect their \ninterests. This year they will sell $290 billion worth of drugs, 80 \npercent brand-name prescription drugs. On brand-name drugs, the price \nincreased 9 percent this year and on generic drugs it fell by 9 \npercent. Now I understand why they want to protect those interests.\n  Here are two pill bottles, both contain Lipitor, both made in a plant \nin Ireland by an American corporation. This sent to Canada, this sent \nto the United States. The American consumer gets the same pill made in \nthe same bottle made in the same plant by the same company. The \nAmerican consumer also gets the privilege of paying nearly triple the \nprice and can't do a thing about it because this Congress, vote after \nvote after vote, has said: We stand with the pharmaceutical industry \nand against competition and against freedom for the American worker.\n  If I sound a bit sick and tired of it, I am. We have been going after \nthis for 8 to 10 years, to give the American people the freedom to \naccess the identical FDA-approved drugs for a fraction of the price \nwhere they are sold everywhere else in the world, and we are told again \nand again and again there is this phony excuse about safety, completely \nphony.\n  I will have more to say about it later, but I did want to say we are \ngoing to see a lot of people trotting out here with such a shop-worn, \ntired, pathetic argument to try to keep things as they are and try to \nkeep saying to the American people: You pay the highest prices in the \nworld for brand-name drugs and that is OK. That is the way we are going \nto leave it. We will call it health care reform, and at the end of the \nday, that is what you end up with: The highest prices in the world, a \n9-percent increase just this year alone. Over the next 10 years, that \n9-percent increase, just this year, nets the pharmaceutical industry \n$220 billion, but that is OK. That is the way you are going to end up, \nAmerican consumer, because we don't want to give you the freedom to \naccess those lower priced drugs where they are sold for a fraction of \nthe price.\n\n  One final point. I have mentioned often an old codger who sat on a \nstraw bale at a farm once where I had a meeting, and he said: I am 80 \nyears old. Every 3 months we have to drive to Canada across the border \nbecause my wife has been fighting breast cancer. Why do we drive to \nCanada? To buy Tamoxifen. Why do we have to go there to buy it? We \npaid--I think he said--\n\n[[Page S13217]]\n\none-tenth the price in Canada. We couldn't have afforded it otherwise.\n  Is that what we want the American people to have to do? Most people \ncan't drive across the border someplace. Why not establish a system \nlike they have had in Europe for 20 years, to allow the American people \nthe freedom to access reasonably priced drugs, FDA-approved drugs.\n  So this is a day in which we will vote on my amendment and then we \nwill vote on an amendment that nullifies it and we will see whether \nenough of a deal has been made so the fix is in. So, once again, the \nAmerican people end this day having to pay the highest prices in the \nworld. Pay, pay, pay, pay, soak the American consumer, keep doing it. \nThat has been the message here for 10 years.\n  A group of us, Republicans and Democrats, 30 who have cosponsored \nthis legislation, have said, you know what. We are sick and tired of \nit. Give the American people the freedom. If this is a global economy, \nhow about a global economy for real people? How about let them have the \nadvantages of a global economy?\n  Once again, I will have a lot more to say this afternoon. It is \napparently a day for deal-making and we will see who made what deals, \nbut we are going to have votes. I know one thing. I know the \npharmaceutical industry has a lot of clout. I know that. I hope the \nAmerican people have the ability to expect some clout on their behalf \nin the Chamber of the Senate this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is there is a desire by \nsome to have a quorum call in which the quorum call time is charged \nagainst all sides. My understanding is, there are, I think, 5 hours \nallocated with respect to today: 1 hour for the Baucus amendment, 1 \nhour for the Crapo amendment, and 3 hours distributed as follows: 1 \nhour for me, 1 more Mr. Lautenberg, and 1 hour for the Republican \nleader on the prescription drug reimportation; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nallocated against the 4 hours and not against the hour I control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, we have had constant \nspeakers over here, so we have used a lot of our time. If we had known \nthere was more vacant time, and if we could have had some of the \nmajority's time, we could have had a steady stream of speakers over \nhere the whole time. So we would reluctantly agree to the time being \ndivided between the two sides, as we have done that in all the times in \nthe past, but we want to reserve some time for our speakers as well. We \ncould have easily had people over here to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, did the Senator object?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think he reserved his right to object.\n  Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, the Senator objects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is I will put in a quorum \ncall, the time is equally divided, apparently, between the sides, in a \ncircumstance where the other side has 3 hours and our side has 2 hours \nand especially on the subject I have just discussed, the other side has \n2 hours and I have 1 hour.\n  I will put us into a quorum call, and I guess it will be equally \ndivided between the two sides.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak in favor of the Crapo motion, \nwhich we will be voting on in a few hours.\n  The Crapo motion would essentially protect the American middle class \nfrom tax increases in this bill. The President promised that nobody \nmaking under $200,000 a year, or families making under $250,000 a year, \nwould see tax increases under the bill. But they do.\n  The Crapo motion would simply send the bill back to the Finance \nCommittee and make sure that they don't. It is a fairly straightforward \namendment, and we should support it.\n  In supporting the motion, I will discuss other things related to it. \nThere is this notion that somehow or other the health care bill will \nsave money for the government and for taxpayers and patients. That is \nwhere it is wrong. That is why we need things such as the Crapo motion.\n  How does the expenditure of trillions of dollars in new spending save \nanybody money? That is counterintuitive. The answer is, of course, that \nit doesn't.\n  Jeffrey Flier, dean of the Harvard Medical School, gives this bill a \nfailing grade. He wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The Democrats' health care bill wouldn't control the growth \n     of costs or raise the quality of care.\n\n  I think that is the fact. So let me point out a couple of the bill's \nprovisions that undermine this savings argument, one of which is the \nnew taxes, which the Crapo motion would explicitly address, The new \nsubsidies that fail to address costs, and finally this inclusion of the \nCLASS Act, which is a massive new expenditure and entitlement that \nwould grow out of control over time.\n\n  First, though, let me focus on these new taxes, 12 in total. They go \ninto effect immediately. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service \nestimates it would need between $5 billion and $10 billion over the \nnext 10 years just to oversee the collection of these new taxes. Think \nabout that.\n  These new taxes include, but are not limited to, a new payroll tax on \nsmall businesses. What better way to kill job creation. We will impose \nanother \\1/2\\ percent tax if you hire somebody or all the people you \nretain on the payroll. That is crazy at a time when we are trying to \ncreate new jobs. There is a tax on seniors and the chronically ill. I \ndiscussed that yesterday. There are new limits on health savings \naccounts which will increase taxable income for middle-class families, \nand a new medical device tax which will be paid for by American \nfamilies, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In other words, \nif you need a health or lifesaving device, such as a diabetes pump or \nstent for your heart, why do you want to tax that if it provides better \nhealth care for you and your family? The reason is they need more \nrevenue to pay for the expenses of the bill. They increase the taxes. \nCBO says they will be passed right through to the patients which are \nthen passed through in the form of higher premium costs.\n  As I said, most of these taxes would start immediately and many would \nhit middle-income families despite the President's famous campaign \npledge.\n  Washington, for a period of 4 years, piles up the money before it \npays any of the money out. That is supposed to lower costs because for \nthe first 4 years there are not any expenses. We are collecting all \nthis revenue and somehow or another that is portrayed as a savings for \nthe Federal Government.\n  Over the next 10 years that money is spent out, it is $2.5 trillion \nin spending, and that is not sustainable. This is part of the bill's \ngimmickry to create this idea that somehow the bill is deficit neutral. \nAs I said, when you take a look at the true 10-year cost beginning in \n2014 once the bill is fully implemented, you have a whopping $2.5 \ntrillion pricetag.\n  Colleagues on the other side say: It is necessary to raise all this \nmoney to subsidize the increased cost of health care. I get it. We are \ngoing to raise premiums under the bill and then we are going to need to \nraise taxes to subsidize so people can afford those increased premiums. \nWhat sense does that make? I ask, do Americans want to pay more taxes \nin order to get a subsidy because of the increase in costs that are the \nresult of this legislation?\n\n[[Page S13218]]\n\nWould they rather not have the premiums go up in the first place, as \nthe ideas that Republicans have proposed would ensure? But that is what \nthe bill does. It raises premiums so then you have to raise taxes to \nsubsidize the cost of insurance.\n  What the Crapo motion would do is to say the President needs to keep \nhis promise. Those making less than $200,000 a year should be relieved \nof this tax burden.\n  Secondly, if the government subsidizes insurance for 30 million more \nAmericans, obviously costs have to rise. As the respected columnist \nRobert Samuelson wrote in a recent Washington Post column--by the way, \nthe title was ``The Savings Mirage on Health Care'':\n\n       The logic is simple. . . . Greater demand will press on \n     limited supply; prices will increase. The best policy: \n     Control spending first, then expand coverage.\n\n  That is what Republicans have been proposing. We would like to target \nspecific solutions to the problems of cost which would then allow more \nAmericans to gain access to affordable health care and, thus, avoid a \nhugely expensive Washington takeover of the entire system.\n  Our solution includes medical liability reform--that does not cost \nanything; it saves money--allowing Americans to purchase insurance \npolicies across State lines, allowing small businesses to pool their \nrisks and purchase insurance at the same rates corporations do. These \nsolutions would bring down costs and, at the same time, enhance \naccessibility.\n  Third--and the reason I raise this is because several colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have made pretty firm statements about not \nbeing able to support this legislation as long as it included what is \ncalled the CLASS Act. This is a new government-run, government-funded \nprogram for long-term care. It is intended to compete with private \ninsurers' long-term care plans. Notice the pattern of government \nwanting to compete with private entities. That is what the CLASS Act \ndoes.\n  Participants would pay into this new government system for 5 years \nbefore they would be allowed to collect any benefits. Naturally, you \nhave some increased revenues for a while, and that is what the bill \ncounts on in order to allegedly be in balance. Of course, the payouts \noccur later, and then it is not in balance. Participants would have to \nbe active workers. So this new entitlement would not benefit either \nseniors or the disabled.\n  We are talking about a brandnew entitlement. If a worker begins \nmaking payments in 2011, he or she could not collect benefits until the \nyear 2016. That is why supporters of the CLASS Act say this would \nreduce the deficits in between 2010 and 2019. Sure, if you don't spend \nmoney in those years and you collect a lot of tax revenues, of course \nyou are going to have more of a surplus of revenues. What happens, \nthough, when the claims on that money occur? It is like Medicare today: \nIt is very soon out of money and then broke and then in a hole and then \nyou have a big debt on your hands. That is precisely what happens here. \nNo government program has ever reduced budget deficits, we know that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office confirms that this program will, \nindeed, add--add--to future budget deficits. Here is what the CBO \nwrites:\n\n       The program would add to future federal budget deficits in \n     large and growing fashion.\n\n  It does not get any simpler than that. The CLASS Act would add to \nfuture deficits. That is why several of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have said they cannot support the bill as long as the \nCLASS Act is in it. But the last time I checked, it is still in it.\n  I want to also refer to the chairman of the Budget Committee who has \nobviously spoken out on this issue because he understands the effect. I \nspeak of Senator Conrad. He said it is like a Ponzi scheme because it \noffers returns that payments made into the system cannot cover in the \nlong run.\n  As I said, it would generate generous surpluses for the government \nwhile Americans pay in and are not collecting benefits. And then later \non, it reaches a point where payments made into the program cannot \nsustain the promised benefits.\n  Here is what CBO tells us about the program:\n\n       It would lead to net outlays when benefits exceed premiums. \n     . . .\n\n  ``Net outlays'' means you are spending more than you are taking in.\n\n       [By 2030] the net increase in federal outlays is estimated \n     to be ``on the order of tens of billions of dollars for each \n     [succeeding] ten-year period.''\n\n  Over time, this program adds substantially to the deficit and to the \ndebt. It is an entitlement that is not self-sustaining but has to be \npropped up in some fashion by additional revenues. It is another way, \nin addition to the first two ways I mentioned, of how costs go up in \nthis legislation, how savings do not result, and how the American \npublic has to end up making up the difference. You have new taxes to \ncover subsidies for increased premiums, government subsidies for 30 \nmillion Americans that increased demand without addressing costs, and \nfinally, the inclusion of the CLASS Act.\n  As I said, I support the Crapo motion because it would assure that \nnone of these burdensome new taxes would hit middle-income families as \nthey are set to do. This amendment must pass if President Obama is \ngoing to keep his campaign pledge to not raise taxes ``one dime'' on \nmiddle-income Americans.\n\n  I also support the soon-to-be-pending Hutchison-Thune motion which \nsays that no taxes at all should be levied until Americans see some \nbenefits. This addresses that problem I noted where you collect the \ntaxes up front and then you start paying benefits at a later date. This \nis an expression of disapproval for the budget gimmickry contained in \nthe bill.\n  Americans want us to bring costs down. They could not be more clear \nabout that. But the provisions of this bill disobey the wishes of the \nAmerican people. That is why in public opinion surveys--it does not \nmatter who takes them--they are increasingly showing that the American \npeople are opposed to this legislation. The latest one by CNN just a \nfew days ago--and CNN is not noted to be a big conservative \norganization--shows that 61 percent of the American public oppose the \nhealth care plan. And now only 36 percent support it. That is getting \nclose to two to one in opposition.\n  An earlier poll showed that among Independent voters, by more than \nthree to one, they oppose what is in this legislation. The point here \nis not some peripheral issue--and I do not mean to demean the \nimportance of the issue when I talk about, for example, the public \noption for the government-run insurance plan. The abortion language \ncertainly is a key issue to many. Even if you could somehow fix those \nproblems, you still have the core of the bill that the American people \nobject to: the $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts in Medicare, the $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin increases in taxes that are meant to be addressed by the motion I am \nspeaking of, the requirement that because premiums go up under the \nlegislation, you have to raise taxes to create a subsidy so you can \ngive it to people so they can afford the increased premiums.\n  Something we are going to be talking about in the future and have \nhardly addressed but to me is probably the most pernicious thing of \nall--you can talk about the government takeover, you can talk about the \nadditions to the debt, the taxes, the increased premiums, all of these \nthings, the cuts in Medicare--to me the most pernicious thing of all is \nthe fact that it is unsustainable. The promises exceed the revenues \nwith the net result that over time, care will have to be rationed.\n  This is what I think the American people fear most of all because \nthey know you cannot sustain a program this costly and not have to at \nsome point begin to delay care, delay appointments so they do not occur \nas rapidly and gradually begin to denying care. That is why this big \nkerfuffle about the commission that made recommendations on breast \ncancer screening and mammograms was so frightening to people. They \ncould see this was the way rationing begins. Some panel says we don't \nthink people need as much medical care as they have been getting, never \nmind what has been recommended in the past. Yes, by the way, it will \nsave money.\n  Of course, when politicians have to find a way to reduce benefits, \nthey do not go to their constituents and say: We are going to cut your \nbenefits. What they do is reduce the payments to people who provide the \nhealth care--\n\n[[Page S13219]]\n\nthe doctors, hospitals, home health care, hospice care, these folks. \nThey reduce payments so that the providers have no choice but to reduce \nthe amount of their care.\n  They have to see more patients, there are not as many of them, and \nthey are getting paid less. So naturally they cannot provide the same \nlevel and quality of care. That is how rationing begins. Ask people in \nCanada, ask people in Great Britain how long it takes to get in to see \nthe doctor. Eventually even that does not cut it. So they set a budget \nand say: We cannot afford to pay any more than that.\n  You better hope you get sick early in the year. That is, \nunfortunately, what you can see to an extent in our veterans care but \neven more in our care for our Native Americans. I did not make this up. \nOthers have said in the Indian Health Care Service, get sick early in \nthe year because they run out of money if you get sick late in the \nyear.\n  Our first obligation ought to be to ensure our Native American \npopulation receives the care we have promised them. I personally have \ngone throughout Indian reservations in Arizona. We have more than any \nother State. I made a tour of the Navajo reservations, including a lot \nof the health care clinics and facilities that try to take care of \nfolks under the Indian Health Service. None has enough money to do what \nthey are supposed to. They are understaffed. The people who are there \nare wonderful, dedicated health care providers. They are doing their \nbest. But you ask any of the Native Americans whether they believe they \nare getting the care they are supposed to get under the program, and \nthe answer is uniformly no. They have to wait forever. The care is not \nthere when they need it.\n  This is the perfect example of rationing of care, what happens when \nyou have a government-run system. That is what I fear most of all will \nresult from this because we have taken on much more than we can afford.\n  The end result of that inevitably is the reduction in the amount of \ncare that is provided and the quality of care that is provided.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about what we are \ngetting our constituents into. We can start to turn this back by \nsupporting the Crapo motion which at least says that folks who are \nmiddle-class families, who the President promised would not see a tax \nincrease, will not see a tax increase under the legislation. That is \nwhat the Crapo motion would provide, and I certainly hope my colleagues \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13219-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support and urge all of \nmy colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support the upcoming \nDorgan reimportation amendment which we will be voting on later today \nand, just as important, to oppose the Lautenberg amendment which, as \neveryone knows, is a poison pill to reimportation and is simply and \nsurely a way to absolutely kill for all practical purposes the real \nDorgan reimportation language.\n  To me, this is a crystal-clear choice, and it is the sort of choice \nthe American people are really interested in and really watching. It is \na choice between doing something that can make a difference in people's \nlives, something that can help people, that can solve a real problem in \nhealth care by doing something in a focused way or we can choose to \nkeep to the big political deal that was made inside the beltway, inside \nthe White House with the pharmaceutical industry. That is the choice. \nThis is really a choice between voting for the American people or \nvoting for politics as usual in Washington. That is what it all comes \ndown to.\n  On the positive side, reimportation is a very real and very effective \nsolution to a real problem. The problem is obvious. The problem is sky-\nhigh prescription drug prices--the highest in the world--that we as \nAmericans pay. These same drugs are sold around the world, and in many \ndifferent cases--in virtually every case--we pay the highest prices in \nthe world right here in the United States even though we have the \nbiggest marketplace for prescription drugs. That is the system we are \ntrying to break up. So I want and supporters of this amendment want a \ntrue free market in prescription drugs, a world price that will lower \nthe U.S. price and dramatically help U.S. consumers.\n  It is not just supporters of this amendment and this concept who are \nmaking these arguments; it is unbiased sources such as the \nCongressional Budget Office and others. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays this amendment--this reimportation concept will save the Federal \nGovernment money, significant money, some $18 billion or more. And \nbesides the savings to the Federal Government, the savings to the U.S. \nconsumer are much greater--$80 billion or more.\n  So that is the positive choice--doing something real about a real \nproblem. That is what the American people want us to do. They want us \nto focus on the real problems that exist in health care and attack \nthose real problems in a focused way.\n  The other alternative is to keep the political deal, to vote yes for \npolitics as usual in Washington. Tragically, that is what is \nrepresented by the political deal that was struck on this global health \ncare bill between the White House and the White House's allies here in \nthe Senate and the big pharmaceutical industry. It has been widely \nreported--it is no secret--that there was a deal between these bodies. \nThe pharmaceutical industry agreed to support the President's \ninitiative, putting as much as $150 million of TV advertising cash \nbehind that support, if the White House would completely change its \nposition on reimportation and other key points.\n  The record is clear: When President Obama served right here with us \nin the U.S. Senate, he was completely for reimportation. As a \nPresidential candidate, he campaigned vigorously for reimportation. \nRahm Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff, when he served in the \nU.S. House, was strongly for reimportation. But now, all that is off \nbecause Washington politics as usual has stepped in the way. They have \nreversed their position through this deal with PhRMA. Tragically, that \nhas crept into the Senate Chamber as well. Key Senators on the \nDemocratic side--Max Baucus and Jay Rockefeller and others--have \nreversed their position and apparently now are urging ``no'' votes for \na policy they have long supported.\n  Well, we will know in a few hours who will be the winner--the \nAmerican people, being given lower prescription prices, or PhRMA and \npolitics as usual in Washington. Make no mistake about it, that is the \nchoice. It couldn't be laid out in a clearer way. And to choose for the \nAmerican people, to make real progress for lower prescription drug \nprices, we need to do not one but two things: first, to pass the Dorgan \namendment, and second, and just as important, to defeat the Lautenberg \namendment side-by-side, which would clearly, by all acknowledged \nsources, be a poison pill to reimportation--an easy way for the \nadministration to ensure reimportation never happens.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote for \nlower prescription drug prices, to vote for the American people, and \ncertainly to vote against Washington politics as usual, which the \nAmerican people are so completely disgusted and fed up with. I urge \nthat vote. Americans all around the country, in all our home States, \nwill remember it and will thank us for it because we will actually be \nproviding a real solution to a real problem and bringing them \nsignificantly lower prescription drug prices.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S13220]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I believe I have 20 minutes remaining; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 17\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair notify me when I have \n2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Later today, Mr. President, we are going to vote on my \nmotion to refer the bill to the Finance Committee and have the Finance \nCommittee simply make the bill comply with the President's promise with \nregard to taxes.\n  As I have said a number of times on the floor, this bill does not \ncorrect so many of the problems we need to deal with in health care. It \ndrives the cost of health care in premiums up, not down; it raises \nhundreds of billions in taxes; it cuts Medicare by hundreds of billions \nof dollars; it grows the Federal Government by over $2.5 trillion in \nthe first 10 years of full implementation; it forces the needy \nuninsured into a failing Medicaid system and does not give them access \nto insurance; it imposes damaging unfunded mandates on our struggling \nStates; it still leaves millions of Americans uninsured; and it \nestablishes massive government control over our health care. Frankly, \neven if the so-called government option or government health care \ninsurance company that is created by the bill were to be removed, there \nwould still be massive government intrusion into the control and \nmanagement of our health care system.\n  Well, as we were facing the prospect of dealing with this bill, the \nPresident made a pledge to the American people, and in his terms the \npledge was:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge, no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase; not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes. You will not see any of your taxes \n     increased one single dime.\n\n  Yet what we have in this legislation is a whole array of new taxes--\nabout $493 billion in new taxes to start with. And that is assuming you \njust start with the beginning of the bill and go for the first 10 \nyears. If you actually compare the number of taxes that will be charged \nby this bill to the American people with that first full 10-year \nimplementation period, that is $1.28 trillion in new taxes.\n  This chart shows taxes and fees, not just the specific taxes but \ntaxes and fees--fees which our Congressional Budget Office and our \nJoint Tax Committee have said repeatedly will be passed on to the \nAmerican consumer. Yet the President said nobody's taxes will be \nincreased.\n  Let's see the next chart. Here we have further analysis of just four \nof the major tax provisions in the bill. There are many more, but if \nyou look at the four major tax provisions in the bill, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has said that by 2019 at least 73 million \nAmerican households earning below $200,000 will face a tax increase, \nand when you break these numbers down further, it is not just the \npeople making between $100,000 and $200,000, or the upper income \nearners, but massive tax increases falling upon people who are making \nwell under $100,000 a year.\n  The response has been: Wait a minute, this bill also has some tax \ncuts in it, and when you offset the tax cuts against the tax increases, \nthere are more tax cuts than there are tax increases.\n  I dispute that in a couple ways. First of all, even if you accept as \nfact that there are tax cuts in this bill, which is arguable and I will \npoint that out in a minute, they do not offset all the taxes and fees, \nso it is still a net increase in taxes. But there is a subsidy in this \nbill to provide insurance to a group of Americans who do not have the \nfinancial capacity today to purchase their own insurance. As I \nmentioned earlier, the most needy of this group did not get access to \ninsurance. They got put on Medicaid. But some in America will get some \naccess to insurance and that subsidy will be provided by the Federal \nGovernment. The other side is saying that is a tax cut.\n  I disagree with that for a couple reasons. First of all, it is \ncalled, in the bill, a refundable tax credit and it is administered by \nthe Internal Revenue Service--which, by the way, is going to need to \ngrow by 40 to 50 percent in order to accommodate these new roles in \nmanaging the health care system. But it is a refundable tax credit in \nonly the way Congress could put it together. It is nothing other than a \ngovernment payment to individuals, most of whom pay no taxes. In fact, \nbetween 2014 and 2019, 73 percent of the people receiving the subsidy, \nor $288 billion of the subsidy, goes to taxpayers who pay no taxes. You \ncan call that a tax cut if you want, but CBO, our Congressional Budget \nOffice, does not call it a tax cut. The Congressional Budget Office \nscores it as Federal spending, as exactly what it is, spending by the \nFederal Government. It is a subsidy being provided by the Federal \nGovernment. You can argue about whether it should be provided, but to \ncall it a tax cut is a stretch.\n  Even if you accept that is a tax cut, there are still 42 million \nAmerican households earning below $200,000 per year who will pay more \ntaxes. No matter how you cut it and no matter how you define tax cut, \nthe reality is this bill imposes hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars of new taxes squarely on the middle class in violation of the \nPresident's promise that nobody in America who makes less than $250,000 \nas a family or $200,000 as an individual, in order to fund this bill, \nwould be required to pay more taxes.\n  Some of those who have responded to this have said this is our \nopportunity and, if we support this amendment, we will be killing a \nbill that provides tax relief to the American people. As I have pointed \nout, the amendment does not do anything to the subsidy that is called a \ntax cut. The amendment leaves the subsidy in place. So it is simply \nwrong to say the motion I have asked to have passed would do anything \nto remove this so-called tax relief--or properly called subsidy--from \nthe bill. What my motion does is simply to say the bill should be \nreferred to the Finance Committee so the Finance Committee can make \nsure it complies with the President's pledge that it does not raise \ntaxes on those who are in what the President has described as the \nmiddle class. It is very simple and straightforward. If there are no \nsuch taxes, then the motion is irrelevant. But we all know there are--\nJoint Tax, Congressional Budget Office, many private organizations have \nsquarely pointed it out. In fact, we are still studying it. If we get \npast the first four big taxes in the bill, these numbers I have talked \nabout, the 42 million net or the 73 million in reality, in America--and \nthose are households, not individuals, who will be paying more taxes--\nare squarely going to be hit by this bill.\n  Let me give a different perspective on it. If you take all those who \nare supposedly getting tax relief but are really getting a direct \nsubsidy, accept the fact that this is truly a tax cut, they represent 7 \npercent of the American public. The rest of the American public does \nnot get a subsidy. The rest of the American public pays the taxes for \nthe establishment of a huge $2.5 trillion new entitlement program that \nwill bring that much more of the Federal Government into control of the \nhealth care economy.\n  We are coming back now from a 2\\1/2\\-hour break because the Democrats \nwere at the White House meeting with the President. We do not know what \nwas said there. There was apparently a negotiation behind closed doors, \nyet once again, of some other new changes in the legislation, some \nother new portions of the bill. No C-SPAN cameras were there, to my \nknowledge. But we now have an opportunity to talk in the next few hours \nabout what will happen with regard to this amendment.\n  The President could have asked his friends in the Democratic caucus \nto support this amendment, which simply requires that the bill comply \nwith his pledge. I hope he did. I hope it can be accepted. But the \nreality is, this legislation violates not only this pledge but a number \nof the President's other pledges--for example, the pledge that if you \nlike what you have, you can keep it. Americans all over this country \nhave heard that pledge repeated a number of times. If you are one of \nthe employees who has employer-provided insurance and that insurance \nhappens to fit in the so-called higher insurance packages that are \ntaxed 45 percent by this plan, you are not going to get to keep it. \nBoth CBO and Joint Tax have\n\n[[Page S13221]]\n\nmade it very clear that you are going to see your health care cut by \nyour employer in order to avoid this tax. Then what is going to happen \nis your employer might--probably will--give you a little bit more wages \nto compensate for the cut in your employment benefits. Your net package \nof compensation will not change in value, but you will get at more of \nit in wages and a little less in health care. But the kicker is, the \nwage portion is taxed but the health portion is not so your taxes are \ngoing to go up and your net package is going to go down. You are going \nto have a less-robust health care plan and you will have a lower \noverall compensation package. Does that comply with the President's \npromise that if you like what you have, you can keep it? What about the \n11 million Americans, I believe it is, who have Medicare Advantage \npolicies today who clearly are going to lose about half of that extra \nMedicare Advantage benefit under the Medicare cuts in the bill? If they \nlike what they have, can they keep it? No.\n  What I am asking is simply that the Senate vote to require that the \nPresident's pledge in this one case be honored; namely, let's send the \nbill to the Finance Committee, it can be turned around in the Finance \nCommittee overnight, take out the provisions that impose taxes on \npeople in America earning less than $250,000 as a family or $200,000 as \nan individual and bring it back to the floor.\n  You will hear it said this is a killer amendment, that it will kill \nthe bill. It will not kill the bill unless it is necessary in the bill \nto tax Americans to the tune of the hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat are included in this bill. What it will do is expose that this \nbill cannot be claimed to be deficit neutral or to even reduce the \ndeficit unless three things happen: the Medicare cuts of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars are imposed; the tax increases of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars are imposed, and the budget gimmicks are \nimplemented.\n  Let me tell you about the most significant of those budget gimmicks. \nIn order to make it so they could say this bill does not increase taxes \nor does not increase the deficit, the crafters of the bill have had the \ntaxes go into effect on day one, the Medicare cuts go into effect by \nday one, but the subsidy program or the spending part of the bill is \ndelayed for 4 years. So we have 10 years of revenue and 6 years of \nspending.\n  I, personally, think the way they picked 2014 to be the year in which \nthey implement the spending part of the bill is they said: How many \nyears do we have to delay the spending impact until we can claim there \nis a deficit-neutral bill? It turned out they had to delay it for 4 \nyears out of the 10. If it took 5, they would have delayed it 5 years. \nThat is a budget gimmick. The reality is we all know if you have the \nspending go into place on day one and the taxes go into place on day \none and the Medicare cuts go into place on day one and took the \ngimmicks out, this bill would generate a deficit, another promise the \nPresident pledged not to do.\n  There are so many problems with this bill. But most important today, \nas we will have an opportunity around 6 o'clock, is to vote to at least \nhave the bill comply with the President's pledge.\n  I ask how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder of my \ntime, and I will hold that until later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes \nout of Senator Baucus's time to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Cantwell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a point. I know my \ncolleague from Arizona wishes to engage in a brief colloquy on this \npoint. The amendment we are offering, a bipartisan amendment dealing \nwith the price of prescription drugs, is a very important amendment. We \nare going to get our vote on that, but then there is also going to be a \nvote on a poison pill amendment that nullifies it. It says if you pass \nthe second amendment, it means nothing happens and prescription drug \nprices keep going through the roof.\n  I wish to say quickly there have been very few bipartisan amendments \non the floor of the Senate during this health care debate. That is \nregrettable. This, in fact, is bipartisan. A wide range of 30 Senators, \nincluding Republicans John McCain, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe and \nso on support this effort and the effort is simple, trying to put the \nbrakes on prescription drug prices by giving the American people \nfreedom and the ability to find competition among drug prices where \nthey are sold in other parts of the world for a fraction of what we are \ncharged as American consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is important for us to recognize what the \nDorgan amendment is all about. It is about an estimated--according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, and we love to quote the Congressional \nBudget Office around here--$100 billion or more in consumer savings. \nThat is what the Dorgan amendment does.\n  It cuts the cost of the legislation before us as much as $19.4 \nbillion over 10 years. We are always talking about bending the cost \ncurve, saving money, particularly for seniors who use more prescription \ndrugs than younger Americans, and yet there is opposition.\n  I would like to ask my colleague from North Dakota, one, how long has \nhe been fighting this issue; and, two, why in the world do we think \nanybody would be opposed to an amendment that would save $100 billion \nfor consumers?\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have been working on this for 10 years--myself, the \nSenator from Arizona, and others. He knows because he was chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee. We held hearings on this in the committee. The \nfact is, we have gotten votes on it before. In each case, the \npharmaceutical industry, which has a lot of muscle around here, \nprevailed on those votes with an amendment that is a poison pill \namendment saying somebody has to certify with respect to no additional \nsafety risk and so on.\n  These safety issues are completely bogus, absolutely bogus. They have \ndone in Europe for 20 years what we are proposing to do in this \ncountry, parallel trading between countries. What we are trying to do \nis save the American people $100 billion in the next 10 years because \nwe are charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, \nand there is no justification for it.\n  I want to show the Senator from Arizona one chart. This is \nrepresentative. If you happen to take Nexium, for the same quantity you \npay $424 in the United States, if you were in Spain, you would pay $36; \nFrance, $67; Great Britain, $41; Germany, $37. Why is it the American \nconsumer has the privilege of paying 10 times the cost for exactly the \nsame drug put in the same bottle made by the same company in the same \nplant? Justify that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I also ask my friend, has he seen this chart? This \nchart shows that the pharmaceutical companies in America increased \nwholesale drug costs, which doesn't reflect the retail drug cost, by \nsome 8.7 percent just this year, while the Consumer Price Index--this \nlittle line here, inflation--has been minus 1.3 percent.\n  How in the world do you justify doing that? These are lists of the \nincreases over a year in the cost of some of the most popular or much \nneeded prescription drugs. Why would pharmaceutical companies raise \ncosts by some 9 percent unless they were anticipating some kind of deal \nthey went into?\n  I don't want to embarrass the Senator from North Dakota, but isn't it \ntrue that the President, as a Member of this body, cosponsored this \namendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the case. The President was a cosponsor of this \nlegislation when he served last year. I do\n\n[[Page S13222]]\n\nwant to say as well the American consumer gets to pay 10 times the cost \nfor Nexium. Nexium is for acid reflux, probably a condition that will \nexist with some after this vote because my understanding is, after 7 \ndays on the floor of the Senate, there is now an arrangement by which \nthe pharmaceutical industry will probably have sufficient votes to beat \nus, once again, which means the American people lose.\n  I also want to make this point. Anyone who stands up and cites safety \nand reads the stuff that has come out of a copying machine for 10 \nyears, understand this: Dr. Peter Rost, former vice president of \nmarketing for Pfizer, formerly worked in Europe on the parallel trading \nsystem, said:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in \n     Europe reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 years.\n\n  It is an insult to the American people to say: You can make this work \nin Europe for the benefit of consumers to get lower prices, but \nAmericans don't have the capability to make this happen, don't have the \ncapability to manage it. That is absurd. This safety issue is \nunbelievably bogus.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Haven't we seen this movie before? The movie I am talking \nabout is that we have an amendment or legislation pending before the \nbody or in committee that will allow for drug reimportation, as the \nSenator pointed out from that previous chart, in a totally safe manner. \nThen there is always, thanks to the pharmaceutical lobbyists--of which \nthere are, I believe, 635 pharmaceutical industry lobbyists, a lobbyist \nand a half for every Member of Congress--an amendment that then \nbasically prohibits the reimportation of drugs.\n  Haven't we seen this movie before? Apparently another deal was made \nso that they are now going to have sufficient votes to again cost the \nconsumers $100 billion more in cost for the pharmaceutical drugs. Their \nrepresentatives are here on the Senate floor ready to tout the virtues \nof an amendment which, as we all know, is a killer amendment. Let's \nhave no doubt about that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is right. If this \nis ``Groundhog Day'' for pharmaceutical drugs, the clock strikes 6 and \nthe pharmaceutical industry wins. They have been doing it for 10 years. \nWe just repeat the day over and over again. My hope is that we will not \nhave to repeat it today. My hope is that after a lot of work on a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, the American people will have \nsufficient support on the floor of the Senate to say it is not fair for \nus to be paying double, triple and 10 times the cost of prescription \ndrugs that others in the world are paying.\n  I wonder if we might be able to yield some time to the Senator from \nIowa, 5 minutes, unless the Senator from Arizona wishes to conclude.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My only conclusion is that what we are seeing is really \nwhat contributes to the enormous cynicism on the part of the American \npeople about the way we do business. This is a pretty clear-cut issue. \nAs the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, it has been around for 10 \nyears. For 10 years we have been trying to ensure the consumers of \nAmerica would be able to get lifesaving prescription drugs at a lower \ncost. And the power of the special interests, the power of the \nlobbyists, the power of campaign contributions is now being manifest in \nthe passage of a killer amendment which will then prohibit--there is no \nobjective observer who will attest to any other fact than the passage \nof the follow-on amendment, the side-by-side amendment, will prohibit \nthe reimportation of prescription drugs into this country which we all \nknow can be done in a safe fashion and could save Americans who are \nhurting so badly $100 billion a year or more and cut the cost of the \nlegislation before us by $19.4 billion. To scare people, to say that \nthese drugs that are being reimported are not done in a safe manner to \nensure that the American people's health is not endangered is, of \ncourse, an old saw and an old movie we have seen before. It is \nregrettable that the special interests again prevail at the power of \nthe pharmaceutical lobby.\n  Of the many traits the Senator from North Dakota has that I admire, \none of them is tenacity. I want to assure him that I will be by his \nside as we go back again and again on this issue until justice and \nfairness is done and we defeat the special interests of the \npharmaceutical industry which have taken over the White House and will \ntake over this vote that will go at 6 o'clock. It is not one of the \nmost admirable chapters in the history of the Senate or the United \nStates Government.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have two key votes this afternoon on \ndrug reimportation. These votes mean that today is the day we can show \nthe American people whether we can pass drug importation or whether the \nSenate will give it lipservice and nothing else.\n  We have heard on the Senate floor the concerns that some have about \ndrug importation and whether it can be safe. Everyone who knows me \nknows I care deeply about drug safety. The fact is, an unsafe situation \nis what we have today. Today consumers are ordering drugs over the \nInternet from who knows where, and the FDA does not have the resources, \nin fact, to do much of anything about it. The fact is, legislation to \nlegalize importation would not only help to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs for all Americans but also should shut down the \nunregulated importation of drugs from foreign pharmacies, the situation \nwe have today. The Dorgan amendment, in fact, would improve drug \nsafety, not threaten it. It would open trade to lower cost drugs.\n\n  In 2004, my staff was briefed about an investigation that the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee conducted. That subcommittee conducted this \ninvestigation into what we would call going on right now, current drug \nimportation. They found about 40,000 parcels containing prescription \ndrugs come through the JFK mail facility every single day of the year, \n40,000 packages each day.\n  Now the JFK airport houses the largest international mail branch in \nthe United States, but even then that is the tip of the iceberg. \nAccording to this subcommittee, each day 30,000 packages of drugs enter \nthe U.S. through Miami, 20,000 enter through Chicago. That is another \n50,000 more packages each and every day.\n  What is worse, about 28 percent of the drugs coming in are controlled \nsubstances. So we have a situation where we need the basic approach in \nthis amendment to assure that imported drugs are safe. That is what the \nDorgan amendment is all about, to give FDA the ability to verify the \ndrug pedigree back to the manufacturer, to require FDA to inspect \nfrequently, and to require fees to give the FDA the resources to do \nthat.\n  The bottom line is, the Dorgan amendment gives the FDA the authority \nand the resources it needs to implement drug importation safely.\n  Certainly, the President knows that a great way to hold drug \ncompanies accountable is to allow safe, legal drug importation. I would \nlike to quote this President not when he was a candidate for President \nbut a candidate for the Senate. This is what President Obama said then:\n\n       I urge my opponent to stop siding with the drug \n     manufacturers and put aside his opposition to the \n     reimportation of lower priced prescription drugs.\n\n  Now we are hearing about the secret deal with big PhRMA. That was \nrevised just this week to solidify support with PhRMA's allies for \nkilling this very important Dorgan amendment. The drug companies will \nstop at nothing to keep the United States closed to other markets in \norder to charge higher prices.\n  With the Dorgan amendment, we are working to get the job done. What \nwe need is to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable \naccess to wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition in \nthe global pharmaceutical industry.\n  Americans are waiting. Too often this thing has been stymied, and it \nlooks like there is another chance to stymie it. Only I am surprised. \nMost of the time in the past that I have been for the importation of \ndrugs, it was my colleagues over here who were trying to stymie it. But \nnow it looks as though it is the other side. We ought to\n\n[[Page S13223]]\n\nhave a vast majority for this amendment. I would be surprised. It would \nbe a crime, if we didn't.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about prescription \ndrug importation and patient safety. Senator Dorgan's amendment to \nallow for the importation of prescription drugs into the United States \ncould have grave consequences for patient safety in America.\n  In a recent letter to my good friend and home State colleague Senator \nBrownback, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. \nMargaret Hamburg, identified the four risks to patient safety that drug \nimportation schemes pose: No. 1, the drug may not be safe or effective; \nNo. 2, the drug may not be a consistently made, high quality product; \nNo. 3, the drug may not be substitutable with an FDA-approved product; \nand No. 4, the drug may be contaminated or counterfeit.\n  That is a lot of risk to expose already-vulnerable patients to. And \nthink about this: Malta. Cyprus. Latvia. Estonia. Slovakia. Greece. \nHungary. Romania. These are just a few of the countries that could be \nexporting prescription drugs to the United States if the Dorgan \namendment passes. As a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I have grave concerns about the ability of these countries \nto adequately protect their drug supplies.\n  Our Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is the gold standard for \ndrug and product safety in the world, and even it has not been one \nhundred percent effective in preventing contaminated and counterfeit \nproducts from entering our supply chain. The recent scandals involving \nimported heparin, infant formula, and toothpaste have demonstrated the \nunfortunate limitations of the FDA's ability to conduct foreign \ninspections of food, drugs and cosmetics manufacturers abroad. If our \nown safety watchdog can't guarantee our protection, how can we expect \nthat protection from Malta or Slovakia?\n  There is a real risk that these countries will be vulnerable to \nimporting drugs from countries that are known for high rates of \ncounterfeiting. In the European Union last year, 34 million counterfeit \ndrugs were seized at border crossings in just 2 months. The World \nHealth Organization estimates that drug counterfeiting rates in Africa \nand parts of Asia and Latin America are 30 percent or more. And up to \n50 percent of medicines purchased from Internet sites that conceal \ntheir address are found to be counterfeit. Do we really want an HIV or \ncancer patient in Ohio, or Arizona or Kansas to rely on imported \nmedicines that may have zero effectiveness, or which may even be \nharmful?\n  According to FDA Commissioner Hamburg, the Dorgan amendment does not \nadequately address these potential risks. In fact, the Commissioner \nsays that the amendment ``would be logistically challenging to \nimplement and resource intensive'' and that ``significant safety \nconcerns . . . and safety issues'' remain.\n  Senator Lautenberg has introduced a side-by-side amendment to Senator \nDorgan's, requiring that, before any law allowing the importation of \nprescription drugs into the United States can become effective, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services must certify that such a scheme \nwill both pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety, \nAND result in a significant reduction in costs for consumers.\n  I think that this amendment just makes sense. We must protect the \nprescription drug supply in America.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, making medicine affordable is part of what \nhealth reform should be. Today we have the opportunity to include a \nmeasure long-championed by Senator Dorgan, which makes affordable \nprescription drugs more widely available to Americans.\n  Americans pay some of the highest prices for prescription drugs of \nany country in the world despite the fact that many of these drugs are \nmade right here, and they are often made with the benefit of taxpayer \nsupported research. Prescription drugs are a lifeline, not a luxury. \nThe issue boils down to access: A prescription drug is neither safe nor \neffective if you cannot afford to buy it.\n  We have to recognize that this imposes real dangers on American \nconsumers when they cannot follow their doctor's treatment plan because \nthey can't afford their medicine. While we must do more to bring \naffordable healthcare to the millions of Americans who are currently \nuninsured or who do not have good coverage, we cannot continue to deny \nthem this immediate market-based solution.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Dorgan-Snowe amendment to allow \npharmacies and drug wholesalers in the United States to import the very \nsame medications that are FDA-approved in the United States from \nCanada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan where prices are 35-\n55 percent lower than in the United States. Consumers will be able to \npurchase the very same prescription medications from their local \npharmacies at a third or half of the cost. Additionally, the \nlegislation would also allow individuals to purchase prescription drugs \nfrom FDA-inspected Canadian pharmacies--something Vermonters have \ncrossed the border to do many times before.\n  For many Vermonters today, purchasing drugs from Canada literally \nmeans the difference between following their doctors' orders and having \nto throw the dice with their health and sometimes even with their lives \nby doing without their prescription medicines. It makes the difference \nfor the woman who has maxed out her health plan's annual prescription \ndrug benefit only three months into the year and is then faced with \npurchasing the other nine months worth of medicine at U.S. prices on \nher own. It makes the difference for the elderly man on a fixed income \nwho is unable to afford both the heart medicine he needs to live, and \nthe gas bill he needs to keep warm. Are we prepared to tell those in \ndire need that they must go back to choosing between paying gas, food, \nand heating bills, or their medicine?\n  Of course not, and I urge my fellow Senators to support the Dorgan-\nSnowe amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about prescription drug \nimportation. As my colleagues know, I oppose this proposal.\n  It is our job as Senators to debate the issues, put forward our \nideas, and show where we stand. I was disappointed that Democratic \nleadership chose to prevent the Senate from voting on amendments to \nimprove this bill for the past 6 days. I am, however, glad the impasse \nhas finally been resolved.\n  I am not afraid to show where I stand on this issue. Some of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle support importation. Some, like \nme, oppose it. But my position is clear, and does not change with the \npolitical winds.\n  The winds I am referring to include the arrangement that was \nreportedly negotiated with the drug manufacturers. Under the terms of \nthis backroom deal, the drug manufacturers have reportedly agreed to \n$80 billion in price cuts and provided a commitment to spend $150 \nmillion in ads supporting the Reid bill.\n  In exchange, Senate Democratic leadership and President Obama have \nreportedly agreed to block efforts to enact drug importation from \nCanada.\n  According to one Wall Street analyst's report, the Reid bill is \nexpected to increase drug company profits by more than $137 billion \nover the next 4 years. Let's do the math on that: $80 billion in cuts, \nleading to $137 billion in increased profits.\n  While this may be a good deal from the drug manufacturers and Senate \nDemocrats, it certainly is not a good deal for the American people. \nPart of the reported deal will actually increase Medicare costs to the \ntaxpayer, because it creates an incentive for Medicare beneficiaries to \ncontinue using brand-name drugs.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, Federal Medicare costs \nwill be increased by $15 billion over the next decade as a result of \nthis deal. In the last few days, there have been new press reports \nhighlighting how the drug manufacturers may have agreed to provide even \ndeeper discounts on their brand-name drugs. No one knows how much more \nthis deal will cost the taxpayers.\n  In addition to increasing the price Americans will pay for the Reid \nbill, this deal appears to have also undermined Democratic support for \na drug importation amendment.\n  My colleagues who believe importation is the right way to lower drug\n\n[[Page S13224]]\n\ncosts say that it will save the government $19 billion and consumers \n$80 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The majority leader has previously voted for drug importation. \nPresident Obama supported drug importation when he was in the Senate. \nThe supporters of drug importation should be able to easily pass this \namendment without any limitations.\n  Yet it looks like the supporters of drug importation will not succeed \ntoday. It appears likely that safety certification language, similar to \nlanguage included in prior years, will be added to this proposal.\n  My colleagues each know where they stand on the issue. But the deal \nwith the drug manufacturers is apparently so important that supporters \nof drug importation are going to vote against the proposal.\n  It is important for the American people to understand why there has \nbeen this change of heart on this issue. The drug manufacturers are one \nof the few remaining health care groups that still support the Reid \nbill. They have committed to spend $150 million to buy television ads \nto support the Democrats efforts on health reform.\n  If my Democratic colleagues fail to adopt drug importation without \nthe safety language, it is because the Senate Democratic leadership and \nthe White House have decided they will do whatever it takes to keep the \nsupport of the drug manufacturers. They believe that the money these \ncompanies will spend will be enough to convince the American people to \nsupport their efforts.\n  The American people already understand that the Reid bill is not a \ngood deal for them. They understand how this bill will raise their \ntaxes, increase their insurance premiums and cut Medicare benefits for \nmillions of seniors.\n  That is why over 60 percent of Americans now oppose the Democratic \nhealth reform proposals. No amount of advertising, funded by the drug \ncompanies or anyone else, is going to change that reality.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has become apparent that passage of this \nDorgan amendment relative to importation of prescription drugs, an \namendment which I have long supported, could threaten passage of \nbroader health care reform. If so, the perfect would become the enemy \nof the good. For that reason, I will vote ``no'' on the Dorgan \namendment on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3156 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for the importation of prescription drugs)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer time to my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Menendez--up to 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished senior \ncolleague from New Jersey yielding time. I know he is going to call up \nhis amendment shortly, and that is what I want to speak to.\n  Mr. President, before I get to the core of my remarks, I want to tell \nmy colleague who left the floor, I was tempted to rise under rule XIX \nthat says:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any \n     form or words impute to another Senator or to other Senators \n     any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n\n  I could impute, if I wanted to, I guess, that maybe there are some \nwho really do not care about this plan as much as they care about \nkilling health care reform, but I would not do that. I would not do \nthat. So I hope in the context of the debate I am not forced to rise \nunder rule XIX.\n  Mr. President, I rise in favor of the amendment of Senator \nLautenberg, who is going to offer it shortly, because it does two \nthings that underscore the entire debate about health care reform: It \nprotects the American people by putting the safety of families first--\nand there is a lot of brushing aside of safety here; safety is \nparamount; safety is paramount--and it lowers costs. At its core, that \nis what this health care debate is all about.\n  I appreciate the intentions of the amendment that has been offered on \nthe floor, but in my view it is regressive. It harkens back to a time \nwhen the lack of sufficient drug regulation allowed people to sell \nsnake oil and magic elixirs that promised everything and did nothing. \nTo allow the importation of untested, unregulated drugs made from \nuntested and unregulated ingredients from 32 countries into the \nmedicine cabinets of American families without serious safety \nprecautions flies in the face of protecting the American people, and it \nis contrary to the context of health care reform.\n  The amendment by Senator Lautenberg brings us around to the real \npurpose of why we have been here on the floor, which is to create the \ntype of reform that ultimately gives greater health insurance and \ngreater safety to the American people.\n  They care about honest, real reform that makes health care affordable \nand protects American families, protects them from the potential of \ncounterfeit drugs that promise to cure but do absolutely nothing, just \nas we are here to protect them from insurance policies that promise to \nprovide health care for a premium and then deny coverage and provide no \nhealth care at all.\n  Basically, what Senator Lautenberg's amendment is going to do is \nmodify the Dorgan amendment to allow reimportation but to do it when \nbasic safety concerns to keep our prescription medications safe are \ncomplied with. It includes the Dorgan importation amendment but adds \none fundamental element of broader health care reform: It protects the \nAmerican people from those who would game the system for profits at the \nexpense of the health and safety of American families. That is what \nthis reform is all about. Specifically, when it comes to the \nimportation of prescription medication, this amendment will help us be \nsure that what we think we are buying in the bottle is, in fact, what \nis in that bottle.\n  I want to make reference to a letter. We talk about safety, and there \nis a lot of pooh-poohing that, oh, there are no safety concerns. Well, \nthere is one entity in this country that is responsible for safety when \nit comes to food and drugs, and it is called the FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration. In a letter from FDA Commissioner Hamburg, she mentions \nfour potential risks to patients that, in her opinion, must be \naddressed:\n  First, she is concerned that some imported drugs may not be safe and \neffective because they were not subject to a rigorous regulatory review \nprior to approval.\n  Second, the drugs ``may not be a consistently made, high quality \nproduct because they were not manufactured in a facility that complied \nwith appropriate good manufacturing practices.''\n  Third, the drugs ``may not be substitutable with the FDA approved \nproducts because of differences in composition or manufacturing . . . \n''\n  Fourth, the drugs simply ``may not be what they purport to be'' \nbecause inadequate safeguards in the supply chain may have allowed \ncontamination or, worse, counterfeiting.\n  It addresses FDA Commissioner Hamburg's statement about the amendment \nof my colleague from North Dakota:\n\n     that there are significant safety concerns related to \n     allowing the importation of non-bioequivalent products, and \n     safety issues--\n\n  ``Safety issues''--\n\n     related to confusion in distribution and labeling of foreign \n     products and the domestic product that remain to be fully \n     addressed in the amendment.\n\n  Senator Lautenberg's amendment addresses this concern. It allows \nimportation, but it protects the American people by requiring that \nbefore any drug is imported to the United States, it must be certified \nto be safe and to reduce costs. So it does what the FDA Commissioner is \ntalking about here, the agency responsible for protecting the American \npeople. People may just want to not believe it, they may want to ignore \nit, but the fact is, this is the entity responsible in this country to \nprotect the food supply and the drug supply.\n  We want to be as certain as we possibly can be of the conditions \nunder which imported drugs are manufactured, that they are safe to use \nand we know where their ingredients originated before they are \nimported. We want to be absolutely certain patients are getting the \nprescription medications that are the same in substance, quality, and \nquantity that their doctor has prescribed. This amendment requires the \nSecretary of Health and\n\n[[Page S13225]]\n\nHuman Services to certify that all imported drugs are safe and will \nreduce costs before they are allowed into America's medicine cabinets.\n  I have heard a lot about the European Union here. Well, let's look at \nwhat the European Union is now saying. They are constantly being \noffered on the floor for the reason why, in fact, we should follow what \nthe European Union is saying. Well, let's see what happens if we allow \nunregulated importation. Let's look at the European Union.\n  Last week, the European Union Commissioner in charge of this issue \nsaid:\n\n       The number of counterfeit medicines arriving in Europe . . \n     . is constantly growing. The European Commission is extremely \n     worried.\n       In just two months, the EU seized 34 million--\n\n  Hear me: ``million''--\n\n     fake tablets at customs points in all member countries. This \n     exceeded our worst fears.\n\n  I do not want American families to see those fears come to life here. \nI believe that if we do not pass the Lautenberg amendment and if we \nwere to pass the Dorgan amendment, we would open the floodgates. The \nEuropean Union's experience only proves my concerns, not alleviates \nthem as the other side would suggest.\n  Here is the problem: a $75 counterfeit cancer drug that contains half \nof the dosage the doctor told you you needed to combat your disease \ndoes not save Americans' money and certainly is not worth the price in \nterms of dollars or risk to life.\n  Let's not now open our national borders to insufficiently regulated \ndrugs from around the world. It seems to me real health reform--\nparticularly for our seniors and those who are qualified under the \nMedicare Program who receive their prescription coverage under that--\ncomes by filling the doughnut hole in its entirety, which we have \ndeclared we will do in the conference, as we are committed to do, that \nprovides for the coverage of prescription drugs that AARP talks about \non behalf of its millions of members. That is what we want to see--not \nby unregulated reimportation.\n  We should have no illusions, keeping our drug supply safe in a global \neconomy, in which we cannot affect the motives and willingness of \nothers to game the system for greed and profit, will be a monumental \nbut essential task. It will require a global reach, extraordinary \nvigilance to enforce the highest standards in parts of the world that \nhave minimum standards now, so we do not have to ask which drug is real \nand which is counterfeit.\n  Let me just show some examples of those. People say: Oh, no, this \nsafety issue is not really the case.\n  Tamiflu. We saw a rush, when the H1N1 virus came. People wanted to \nbuy Tamiflu. As shown on this chart, which is the real one and which is \nthe counterfeit one? There actually is one that is approved and one \nthat is counterfeit, but the average person would not know the \ndifference. Or if it is Aricept, a drug to slow the progression of \nAlzheimer's disease, which one is the real one and which one is the \ncounterfeit one? If I did not tell you from the labels, you probably \nwould not know, but there is an approved one and there is a counterfeit \none. As someone who lost his mother to Alzheimer's, I can tell you that \nhaving the wrong drug in the wrong dosage would not have helped her \nslow the progression of her illness. It makes a difference.\n  Let's look at others. Lipitor; very important. You are walking around \nwith a real problem with cholesterol, and you think you are taking the \nappropriate dosage and the appropriate drug. But, as shown on this \nchart, which is the real one and which is the counterfeit one? There is \na counterfeit one and there is an approved one, a real one, but if you \nare taking the counterfeit one and you think you are meeting your \nchallenges, you might have a heart attack as a result of not having the \nreal one. By the time you figure it out, it could be too late to \nreverse the damage. That is the problem. That is the global economy \nopening up possibilities at the end of the day.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Jersey for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 1 more minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Finally, this is a gamble we cannot afford to take: To \nopen up the potential for these drugs--or the ingredients used in these \ndrugs--to find their way from nation to nation, from Southeast Asia, \nwhere the problem is epidemic, to one of the 32 nations listed in this \namendment and then into the homes of American families. That is a \ngamble we cannot take. That is not about protecting our citizens. That \nis not about providing prescription drugs that ultimately meet the \nchallenge of a person's illness. Filling the doughnut hole totally, \nwhich is what we are going to do, is the way to achieve it.\n  So I do hope that is what we will do. I do hope we will adopt Senator \nLautenberg's amendment and defeat the Dorgan amendment, for I fear for \nthe safety of our citizens, and I fear as to whether we can ultimately \nachieve filling that doughnut hole if this amendment, ultimately, gets \nadopted, and I fear what that means for health care reform at the end \nof the day.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nthank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3156--it is at \nthe desk--and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Carper, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3156 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, December 10, \n2009, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today because one thing we have \nto do as we progress with this health care reform bill is to make sure \nprescription medicine in our country is safe and affordable. I thank my \ncolleague from New Jersey for his excellent review of the conditions \nthat cause us to add this amendment to Senator Dorgan's amendment that \nwould allow potentially unsafe prescription drugs to be shipped across \nour borders and directly into the medicine cabinets of homes throughout \nAmerica.\n  I want to be clear, the effect of this plan Senator Dorgan has \noffered could be catastrophic. That is why President Obama's \nadministration has written to the Congress expressing its serious \nconcerns with the Dorgan amendment.\n  I appreciate the efforts to try to lower prescription drug prices. \nAfter all, that is what we are doing with the whole health reform \nreview--trying to get costs reduced so everyone can have safe and \naffordable health care. We want to make sure people do not harm their \nhealth with any shortcuts.\n  We all want Americans to stay healthy and still have some money left \nin their pockets. But as much as we want to cut costs for consumers, we \ncannot afford to cut corners and risk exposing Americans to drugs that \nare ineffective or unsafe.\n  The fact is, this is a matter of life and death. The European \nCommission just discovered that counterfeit drugs in Europe are worse \nthan they feared. In just 2 months--and I know Senator Menendez made \nreference to this as well--the EU seized 34 million fake tablets, \nincluding antibiotics, cancer treatments, and anticholesterol medicine.\n  As the industry commissioner of the EU said:\n\n       Every faked drug is a potential massacre. Even when a \n     medicine only contains an ineffective substance, this can \n     lead to people dying because they think they are fighting \n     their illnesses with a real drug.\n\n  Americans buy medicine to lower their cholesterol, fight cancer, and \nprevent heart disease. Imagine what would happen to a mother or a child \nif they start relying on medicine imported from another country only to \nfind out years later that the drug was a fake. Imagine the heartbreak \nthat might ensue if the medicine Americans were taking was found to be \nharmful. The fact is that drugs from other countries have dangerously \nhigh counterfeit rates and importation could expose Americans to those \ndrugs.\n  Under the Dorgan amendment, drugs would be imported from former \nSoviet Union countries where the World Health Organization estimates \nthat\n\n[[Page S13226]]\n\nover 20 percent of the drugs are counterfeit. Under the Dorgan \namendment, drugs that originate in China could find their way into our \nhomes. We know that China has been the source of many dangerous \nproducts in recent years, from toys laced with lead to toothpaste made \nwith antifreeze.\n  If we are going to trust drugs from other countries, we need to be \nabsolutely certain we are not putting Americans' lives at risk. That is \nwhy the Food and Drug Administration went on record to express its \nconcerns with the Dorgan amendment. They say:\n\n       There are significant safety concerns related to allowing \n     the importation of non-bioequivalent products, and safety \n     issues related to confusion in distribution and labeling of \n     foreign products and the domestic product that remain to be \n     fully addressed in the amendment.\n\n  That is from the FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg.\n  There are problems associated with the possibility of drugs coming to \nthis country that are way different than that which is expected to be \nused in the treatment of sickness.\n  President Obama's FDA Commissioner also wrote and said that importing \ndrugs presents a risk to patients because the drug may not be safe and \neffective, may not have been made in a facility with good manufacturing \npractices, and may not be the drug it claims to be.\n  In light of the serious concerns raised by the Obama administration, \nI am offering an amendment to require that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services certify that the drugs are safe and will reduce costs \nbefore they are imported. My amendment is a commonsense bipartisan \nalternative to the Dorgan amendment. In fact, it is the exact same \nlanguage as the Dorgan importation amendment, but with the \ncertification requirement that is so important to ensure safety.\n  If we are going to allow the importation of drugs from other \ncountries, we have to be certain they are safe and affordable. With \nthis amendment, I would be in support of the Dorgan amendment. Only \ncertification by health experts will provide that assurance. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment and oppose the Dorgan amendment.\n  We have no way of knowing what the working conditions might be like \nin a plant or a facility, or the sanitary conditions, in other \ncountries, or whether in the process of packing and shipping \ntemperatures might not be appropriate for the product to arrive without \ndeterioration. Thusly, again, I stress--bring in what you want, just \nmake sure it is safe for the people. There is no moment in the \ndiscussion we have had about the health care reform bill that says, \nLook, you can save money by taking a chance on a shortcut here or a \nshortcut there. Absolutely not. We wouldn't think of proposing anything \nsuch as that, and we ought not to be proposing it here now.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about drug \nreimportation. With millions of seniors balancing drug regimens that \nentail taking several medicines per day on a fixed income, I believe we \nneed to find a way to ensure that they have access to affordable drugs. \nIf we could reduce the cost of drugs with reimportation and guarantee \nthe safety of those drugs, I would be very supportive. However, I have \nserious doubts that we can adequately ensure the safety of our drug \nsupply with the drug reimportation amendment proposed by my colleague \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Even without reimportation, the United States has had trouble with \ncounterfeit drugs. At the height of the H1N1 epidemic this fall, the \nFDA was warning consumers to be wary of counterfeit H1N1 treatments. \nThese counterfeits came from foreign online pharmacies. In one \ninstance, the FDA seized so-called H1N1 treatment tablets from India \nand found them to contain talc and acetaminophen. Last month, the \nWashington Post reported on a coordinated global raid of counterfeit \ndrugs from the United States to Europe to Singapore. The United States \ndiscovered about 800 alleged packages of fake or suspicious \nprescription drugs, including Viagra, Vicodin, and Claritin, and shut \ndown 68 alleged rogue online pharmacies.\n  Counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs are appearing on the market at \nincreasingly alarming rates. In 2007, drugs comprised 6 percent of the \ntotal counterfeit product seizures. In 1 year, they have now jumped to \n10 percent of all counterfeit product seizures.\n  This growing problem is all about unscrupulous criminals preying on \nthe sick and the elderly who are in desperate need of cheaper drugs. \nBut the consequences are harmful and, in some cases, deadly.\n  Officials estimate that some of these counterfeit drugs contain \neither a dangerous amount of active ingredients or were placebos. Some \ncounterfeits include toxic chemicals such as drywall material, \nantifreeze, and even yellow highway paint.\n  According to a recent Washington Post article, tracing the origins of \ndrugs such as Cialis and Viagra took investigators across the globe and \nback again. Supposedly these drugs came from a warehouse in New Delhi, \nthough the online company selling the drug was headquartered in Canada \nand was licensed to sell medicine in Minnesota. However, when Federal \nofficials investigated the drug origins further, they actually found \nthat the online Web site was registered in China, its server was hosted \nin Russia, and its headquarters had previously been listed in \nLouisiana.\n  On a local level near our capital, the Baltimore Sun yesterday \nreported on the death of a University of Maryland pharmacologist, \nCarrie John. Ms. John suffered an allergic reaction to a counterfeit \nversion of a legal drug in the United States but purchased illegally \nfrom the Philippines. Apparently, the counterfeit drug so closely \nresembled the legal version that two pharmacologists conducting the \nanalysis after Ms. John's death could not tell the difference. Local \npolice have yet to identify the contents of the counterfeit drug.\n  A few of my colleagues have already mentioned the letter sent last \nweek by FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg outlining the safety concerns \nthe FDA has about reimportation. Specifically, the FDA stated that \nimporting non-FDA-approved prescription drugs posed four potential \nrisks to patients. Let me go over those four risks.\n\n  No. 1: The drug may not be safe and effective because it did not \nundergo the rigorous FDA regulatory review process.\n  No. 2: The drug may not be a consistently made, high quality product \nbecause the facility in which it was manufactured was not reviewed by \nthe FDA.\n  No. 3: The drug may not be substitutable with the FDA-approved \nproduct because of differences in composition or manufacturing.\n  No. 4: The drug could be contaminated or counterfeit as a result of \ninadequate safeguards in the supply chain.\n  If the agency that oversees drug safety is saying it would have \ndifficulty guaranteeing the safety of our Nation's drug supply with \nreimportation, I have grave concerns, particularly since the FDA is \nalready underfunded and understaffed.\n  But let's take a moment to examine how Europe, which does allow \nreimportation, has fared in terms of safety.\n  British authorities say counterfeit drugs often exchange hands \nbetween middlemen and are repackaged multiple times before reaching a \nlegitimate hospital or pharmacist. This creates opportunities for \ncounterfeit products, often produced in China and shipped through the \nMiddle East, to penetrate the European market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. In 2008, British authorities identified 40,000 doses of \ncounterfeit Casodex, a hormone treatment for men with advanced prostate \ncancer, and Plavix, a blood thinner.\n  More recently, the European Union seized 34 million fake tablets at \ncustoms points in all member countries. In other countries around the \nworld, the World Health Organization estimates that up to 30 percent of \nthe medicines on sale may be counterfeit. As a result, numerous people \nhave died.\n\n[[Page S13227]]\n\n  Earlier this year, 80 infants in Nigeria died from teething medicine \nthat contained a toxic coolant. In July, 24 children in Bangladesh died \nfrom the consumption of poisonous acetaminophen syrup.\n  The Dorgan amendment does not require imported drugs to be FDA \napproved or meet FDA misbranding standards. Furthermore, it does not \nprevent criminals in other countries from repackaging imported drugs.\n  Although our safety system is not perfect, we have a thorough FDA \nreview system for drug safety that actively involves physicians, \npharmacists, and patients. As a result, Americans can be generally \nconfident that our medications are safe and contain the ingredients on \nthe bottle.\n  Supporters of reimportation argue that the sick and elderly need an \nalternative way to obtain affordable drugs. However, a study by the \nLondon School of Economics found that in the European Union, middlemen \nreaped most of the profits with relatively little savings passed down \nto the consumer. Nothing in the Dorgan amendment requires the savings \nto be passed on to the consumer, leaving the door wide open for \nunscrupulous, profit-seeking third parties to get into the \nreimportation game.\n  In the United States, we are already trying to reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs through the use of generics. This is one of the most \neffective ways for customers to reap savings, and the generic \ndispensing rate at retail pharmacies is close to 65 percent. The FDA is \nalready working with stakeholders to develop drug reimportation policy. \nWith the FDA looking into this and significant outstanding safety \nconcerns, I cannot in good conscience support the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from North Dakota. Instead, I will support the amendment \noffered by my colleague from New Jersey. The Lautenberg amendment will \nallow the importation of drugs only if the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services certifies that doing so would save money for Americans \nand would not adversely affect the safety of our drug supply.\n  While it is critical that all Americans, especially our Nation's \nseniors, have access to affordable drugs, it is imperative that we not \ncompromise the safety of U.S. drugs on the market. After all, what good \nare cheap drugs if they are toxic or ineffective?\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I believe my colleague from North \nDakota intends to make further remarks. How much time do we have on our \nside, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey controls 13 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. President, if Senator Dorgan is here, then we are trying to \naccommodate a colleague who wishes to speak on this. How much time is \nleft on the Dorgan side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 28 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we heard about what is happening in \nthe EU having to do with the question of whether drugs are counterfeit \nand the serious consequences of having people take medication that is \nnot what it is supposed to be--the consequences of something like that, \nespecially interfaced with other products.\n  There was a news report last week that was printed in Yahoo News. \nThey quote the Industry Commissioner of the European Union--the program \nin Europe that controls drug safety or at least attempts to. We see \nthat the European Union has expressed concern about the situation they \nsee there. The Commissioner, Mr. Verheugen, said he expected the EU to \ntake action to fight the menace of fake pharmaceuticals. Then he said \nhe thought the EU would agree, in 2010, that a drug's journey from \nmanufacture to sale should be scrutinized carefully and there will be \nspecial markings on the packages.\n  There is a lot of concern about this, and we ought not to dash willy-\nnilly through here without understanding what the consequences of fake \nmedication might be. I wish to see our people pay as little as they can \nto get the medicines they need. Part of that has to include a safety \nfactor. As I said earlier, we would not suggest anything in the health \nreform bill that would take a shortcut and disregard safety. I have a \nletter that was sent from the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwhich I quoted a little bit ago. They say the letter is being sent on \nthe amendment filed by Senator Dorgan. The administration supports this \nprogram, which I agree to, to buy safe and effective drugs from other \ncountries and included $5 million in our 2010 budget.\n  They go on to say--and this is from the Commissioner of Food and \nDrugs--that:\n\n       Importing non-FDA-approved prescription drugs presents four \n     potential risks to patients that must be addressed: (1) the \n     drug may not be safe and effective because it was not subject \n     to a rigorous regulatory review prior to approval; (2) the \n     drug may not be consistently made, high quality product \n     because it was not manufactured in a facility that complies \n     with appropriate good manufacturing practices; (3) the drug \n     may not be substitutable with the FDA-approved product \n     because of differences in composition or manufacturing; and \n     (4) the drug may not be what it purports to be, because it \n     has been contaminated or is a counterfeit due to inadequate \n     safeguards in the supply chain.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, sent to Senator Tom Carper, \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n           Administration,\n                              Silver Spring, MD, December 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Carper,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carper: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     our views on the amendment filed by Senator Dorgan to allow \n     for the importation of prescription drugs. The Administration \n     supports a program to allow Americans to buy safe and \n     effective drugs from other countries and included $5 million \n     in our FY 2010 budget request for the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the Agency) to begin working with \n     various stakeholders to develop policy options related to \n     drug importation.\n       Importing non-FDA approved prescription drugs presents four \n     potential risks to patients that must be addressed: (1) the \n     drug may not be safe and effective because it was not subject \n     to a rigorous regulatory review prior to approval; (2) the \n     drug may not be a consistently made, high quality product \n     because it was not manufactured in a facility that complies \n     with appropriate good manufacturing practices; (3) the drug \n     may not be substitutable with the FDA-approved product \n     because of differences in composition or manufacturing; and \n     (4) the drug may not be what it purports to be, because it \n     has been contaminated or is a counterfeit due to inadequate \n     safeguards in the supply chain.\n       In establishing an infrastructure for the importation of \n     prescription drugs, there are two critical challenges in \n     addressing these risks. First, FDA does not have clear \n     authority over foreign supply chains. One reason the U.S. \n     drug supply is one of the safest in the world is because it \n     is a closed system under which all the participants are \n     subject to FDA oversight and to strong penalties for failure \n     to comply with U.S. law. Second, FDA review of both the drugs \n     and the facilities would be very costly. FDA would have to \n     review data to determine whether or not the non-FDA approved \n     drug is safe, effective, and substitutable with the FDA-\n     approved version. In addition, the FDA would need to review \n     drug facilities to determine whether or not they manufacture \n     high quality products consistently.\n       The Dorgan importation amendment seeks to address these \n     risks. It would establish an infrastructure governing the \n     importation of qualifying drugs that are different from U.S. \n     label drugs, by registered importers and by individuals for \n     their personal use. The amendment also sets out registration \n     conditions for importers and exporters as well as inspection \n     requirements and other regulatory compliance activities, \n     among other provisions.\n       We commend the sponsors for their efforts to include \n     numerous protective measures in the bill that address the \n     inherent risks of importing foreign products and other safety \n     concerns relating to the distribution system for drugs within \n     the U.S. However, as currently written, the resulting \n     structure would be logistically challenging to implement and \n     resource intensive. In addition, there are significant safety \n     concerns related to allowing the importation of non-\n     bioequivalent products, and safety issues related to \n     confusion in distribution and labeling of foreign products \n     and the domestic product that remain to be fully addressed in \n     the amendment.\n       We appreciate your strong leadership on this important \n     issue and would look forward to working with you as we \n     continue to explore policy options to develop an avenue for \n     the importation of safe and effective prescription drugs from \n     other countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Margaret A. Hamburg,\n                                   Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n\n\n[[Page S13228]]\n\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will now suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. You can't \ndo that to us because we only have 8\\1/2\\ minutes left on our side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You have considerably more based on--\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We only have 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to withhold his request \nfor a quorum.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, back in the mid-1800s, when Lincoln and \nDouglas were having their famous debates, at one point Lincoln was \nexasperated because he could not get Douglas to understand something he \nwas saying. He said to Douglas: Listen, how many legs does a horse \nhave? Douglas said: Four, of course. Lincoln said: If you call the tail \na leg, how many legs would he have? Douglas said: Five. Lincoln said: \nThere is where you are wrong. Simply calling a tail a leg doesn't make \nit a leg at all.\n  Yes, that is exactly what my colleagues have done, suggesting the \namendment we are offering is for untested, unregulated drugs. It is not \ntrue. The only drugs we are talking about are FDA-approved drugs that \nare made at an FDA-inspected plant, part of a chain of custody equal to \nthe U.S. chain of custody. It is simply not true that we are talking \nabout untested, unregulated drugs. That is not true. Simply saying that \ndoesn't make it true.\n  Here is why we are on the floor of the Senate. We are reforming \nhealth care. That is what the bill is. Part of health care is \nprescription drugs. A lot of people take prescription drugs to keep \nthem out of a hospital bed. It manages their disease. Prescription \ndrugs are very important.\n  Here is what happened to the prices year after year. As you can see \non this chart, the rate of inflation is in yellow and the prescription \ndrug prices are in red. This year alone, it is up 9 percent, at a time \nwhen inflation is below zero.\n  Well, why do we want to be able to access the same FDA-approved drug \nwhere it is sold elsewhere at a fraction of the price? Because the \nAmerican people will pay in the next decade--if we don't pass this \nlegislation--$100 billion in excess prescription drug prices. If you \nneed to take Nexium for acid reflux--maybe after this vote we will all \nneed it. But if you are going to buy Nexium, it costs $424 for an \nequivalent quantity in the United States. You can buy it for $41 in the \nUK, $36 in Spain--but it is $424 here. Sound fair? Not to me.\n  Lipitor is the most popular cholesterol-lowering drug in the world. \nIt is $125 in the United States for an equivalent quantity. You get the \nsame thing for $40 in the UK or one-third of the price. It is $32 in \nSpain, one-fourth the price. It is $33 in Canada. The American people \nget to pay triple or quadruple the price. By the way, it comes in these \nbottles. I ask unanimous consent to use the bottles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They both contained Lipitor that is made in Ireland by an \nAmerican corporation. They have different colored labels, but they are \nmade in the same plant, FDA approved, and they are sent to different \nplaces--this one to Canada and this one to the United States. But we \nhave the privilege of paying triple the price. Sound fair? Not to me it \ndoesn't.\n  Here is a sample. Boniva, for osteoporosis, is up 18 percent this \nyear. Singulair, for asthma, is up 12 percent. Enbrel, for arthritis, \nis up 12 percent. Here is Plavix--the list goes on.\n  The question is, Is there something we ought to do about this or \nshould we say let's pass health care reform and ignore what is \nhappening to the price of prescription drugs? This amendment I offered, \nalong with Senators McCain and Grassley and other colleagues on this \nside--30 cosponsors--is all about freedom for the American people. If \nthis is a global economy, how about giving the American people the \nfreedom to access identical prescription drugs, which we know are \nidentical because we require safety if it doesn't even exist in our own \nsupply. Those who talk about safety, I remind them 40 percent of the \nactive ingredients in prescription drugs of the United States come from \nIndia and China--from places that have never been inspected.\n  The Wall Street Journal did terrific expose about this. There were \nover 60 people who died from Heparin in this country. It was \ncontaminated. Here is where they were making it. This picture was in \nthe investigation. Here is a rusty old pot being stirred with a limb \nfrom a tree. Those are active ingredients for American drugs. This guy \nis working with pig intestines--guts from a hog. This old man here, \nwith a wooden stick--it looks unsanitary doesn't it? That is the source \nof Heparin. These are the photographs by the Wall Street Journal \ninvestigative reporter. They are telling us FDA-approved drugs coming \nfrom other countries, with a chain of custody identical to ours, would \npose some sort of threat. Are you kidding? You can make that charge \nwithout laughing out loud?\n  Let's talk about the existing drug supply for a moment. This is a \nyoung man named Tim Fagan. He was a victim of counterfeit domestic \ndrugs in this country--not imported FDA-approved drugs. Do you know \nwhere this guy's drug came from? Here is the report done on that. It is \nmade by Amgen. It went through all these places. It ended up at a place \ncalled Playpen, which is a south Florida strip club--in a cooler in the \nback room of a south Florida strip club. At one point it was stored in \ncar trunks. Finally, it was prescribed and administered to this young \nman named Tim Fagan. He survived, but he was getting medicine with one-\ntwentieth the necessary strength for a serious disease that his doctor \nintended for him.\n  Don't talk to me about the issue of prescription drug safety. We are \ntalking about safety that doesn't now exist in the domestic drug \nsupply, but safety standards are included in this amendment. Every drug \nshould have a pedigree to track where it came from and, in every \nrespect, between manufacture and consumption. There ought to be batch \nlots and tracers for every drug. There ought to be pedigree for the \ndomestic drug supply as well.\n  I wish to quote a former vice president of Pfizer Corporation, a \nprescription drug manufacturer, Dr. Peter Rost:\n\n       Right now, drug companies are testifying that imported \n     drugs are unsafe. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n  This is from a vice president of one of the major drug companies--\n``nothing can be further from the truth.'' He was fired, to be sure. \nYou can't say that if you are working for a drug company. Their \nbusiness is to try to keep the pricing strategy the way it is.\n  I might say, I don't have a beef with the drug industry. I have a \nbeef with their pricing policy that says we will sell the same drug \neverywhere in the world at a fraction of the price we charge the \nAmerican consumer. How do you make that stick? By a sweetheart deal in \nlaw that says the American consumer cannot import the drug. The Spanish \ncan import drugs from Germany. The French can import drugs from Italy. \nBut the American consumer is told you don't have the freedom to shop \nfor that same FDA-approved drug--approved because the place where it is \nproduced is inspected by the FDA, in a country with an identical chain \nof custody, but the U.S. consumer doesn't have the freedom to make that \npurchase.\n  If I might, Dr. Peter Rost, the same guy just I quoted, said:\n\n       During my time responsible for a region in northeastern \n     Europe, I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, \n     regulatory agencies, the government, or anyone else say this \n     practice was unsafe, and I personally think it is outright \n     derogatory to claim that the Americans would not be able to \n     handle the reimportation of drugs, when the rest of the \n     educated world can do this.\n\n  Dr. Peter Rost also said:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that, in \n     Europe, reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 \n     years.\n\n  Hank McKinnell, a former Pfizer CEO, said:\n\n       Name an industry in which competition is allowed to \n     flourish--computers, telecommunications, small package \n     shipping, retailing, entertainment, and I'll show you lower \n     prices, higher quality, more innovation, and better customer \n     service. There is\n\n[[Page S13229]]\n\n     nary an exception. OK, there is one. So far, the health care \n     industry seems immune to the discipline of competition.\n\n  Nowhere is that more evident with respect to pharmaceutical drugs.\n  The question today is, Will we once again offer a prescription drug \nimportation bill that will save consumers and the Federal Government \n$100 billion; that contains safety standards that do not exist even in \nthe domestic drug supply; that will not pose risk but, in fact, reduces \nrisk, reduces prices for the American people, provides fair pricing for \nAmerican consumers? Will we be able to vote for that legislation that I \nand Senator McCain, Senator Grassley, Senator Stabenow, Senator \nKlobuchar, and so many others have brought to the floor of the Senate? \nThe answer is, yes; we are going to vote on that.\n  The question is, In the 7 days since I have offered this amendment, \nhas the pharmaceutical industry been able to pry enough people away \nfrom this amendment because they are raising all kinds of issues of \nsafety?\n  How many votes will we get? By the way, the side-by-side amendment is \na killer amendment. We will have a second vote. A lot of people will \nsay: We will vote for the Dorgan amendment and then vote to nullify it \nby voting for the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Let me read the AARP letter which was sent yesterday:\n\n       On behalf of the AARP's nearly 40 million members, we urge \n     you to support the Dorgan-Snowe importation amendment to . . \n     . H.R. 3590, the Senate health care reform legislation. This \n     amendment provides for the safe, legal importation of lower-\n     priced prescription drugs from abroad. CBO has scored the \n     amendment as saving taxpayers more than $19 billion.\n\n  That is just for the Federal Government. There is much more for \nconsumers.\n\n       We also urge you to vote against an alternative importation \n     amendment proposed by Senators Lautenberg, Carper, and \n     Menendez. AARP strongly opposes this amendment because it \n     includes the unnecessary addition of a certification \n     requirement which is simply a thinly veiled effort to \n     undermine importation and preserve the status quo of high \n     drug prices.\n\n  So there it is. We are always told this bill is a finely crafted \npiece; it is like embroidering with some sophisticated colors. This is \na finely crafted piece and don't mess with it because if you adopt your \namendment, somehow the whole thing is going to come apart. It is like \npulling a thread on a cheap suit. You pull the thread and an arm falls \noff. God forbid anybody should adopt an amendment such as this.\n  Here we are 7 days after I offered this amendment, and we have a \ncircumstance where we now have a side-by-side in order to try to \nnullify it. We have had all kinds of dealing going on. I have not been \na part of it. I don't know what the deals are. I don't know what time \nthey were consummated. Somebody told me late last night. I am like an \nold Senator who served long ago. I am not part of any deal. I am not \npart of it. This deal is for the American people.\n  We are going to pass some health care legislation, and then we are \ngoing to shuffle around with our hands in our pockets, maybe thumbing \nour suspenders, sticking out our shined shoes, and say: We did this all \nright. We feel really good about it, but we couldn't do a thing about \nprescription drug prices. We couldn't do that. We didn't have the \nsupport because the pharmaceutical industry wouldn't let us. Oh, \nreally? Maybe at last--at long, long last--there will be sufficient \nfriends on this vote on behalf of the American people to say: We stand \nwith the consumer. We are standing with the American consumers today. \nWe like the pharmaceutical industry. We want them to produce \nprescription drugs. We want them to make profits. We just don't want \nthem to charge us 10 times, 5 times, 3 times, or double what is being \ncharged others in the world for the identical prescription drug because \nwe don't think it is fair to the American people.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me at this point yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. I don't know whether the Senator from \nNew Jersey has other speakers. I believe we have a couple other \nspeakers who will be here. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there was an objection to having the \ntime equally divided expressed by the Senator from Iowa before.\n  How much time is available on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Seven?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, too, have people who want to speak \nto the issue. If we can equally divide the quorum call, that is all \nright with me. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe the quorum call will be momentary. We have \npeople coming to speak. If not, I will take some additional time, as \nperhaps will the Senator from New Jersey. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged to all sides \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I did not speak about the letter from the \nFood and Drug Administration. My colleagues have described this letter, \nwhich I said could have come out of a copying machine. A similar letter \nhas come each time we consider this legislation. It is interesting to \nme that we export a lot of American jobs. All kinds of jobs are leaving \nour country. Then we import contaminated wallboard, children's toys \nthat kill kids. And, yes, that has happened. We import contaminated pet \nfood and contaminated toothpaste. We import 85 percent of the seafood \ninto this country every day--85 percent of the seafood--and 1 percent \nis inspected, by the way. One percent of that seafood is inspected. The \nrest is not.\n  We import fruits and vegetables. I am wondering if the Food and Drug \nAdministration is sending letters around with concern about the risk to \nhealth of fruits and vegetables and seafoods that are not inspected.\n  In many places, these products are produced with insecticides and \nvarious things that would not be permitted in this country. I am \nwondering where the FDA's letter is with respect to that.\n  I called the Food and Drug Administration. I talked with the head of \nthe FDA. I said: I understand there are rumors around that you are \ngoing to send a letter here. This was 24 hours before the letter came.\n  The head of the FDA said: I know nothing of such a letter.\n  My question is, Where did the letter come from? Who prompted the \nletter? I think I know.\n  I find it interesting, I don't see anybody at the FDA sending letters \nhere about the issue of safety on fruits, vegetables, and fish. They \nraise the issue of safety with respect to a drug importation bill which \nhas the most specific and the most rigorous safety standards not only \nfor imported drugs but for the existing domestic drug supply, the kind \nof safety standards that the pharmaceutical industry has objected to \nfor many years.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know Senator Dorgan very well. He is a man of great \nprinciple and skill, I might say. But I say the list of aberrations, \nthe lack of care about the various products--the toys, wallboards, and \nfood--I have had a great interest in those items. It is interesting \nthat it is being suggested by the Senator from North Dakota that is an \nacceptable standard and we ought to go ahead and continue it.\n\n[[Page S13230]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is not asking a question. I yielded to the \nSenator for a question. If he would truncate it, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The question is whether, if you think that casual \nstandard for bringing in food and other products is acceptable--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.--therefore, we ought to do the same with drugs?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, the answer is self-evident by the \nquestion. Of course, we would benefit from stricter standards for fish, \nvegetables, and fruits. That was the point I was making. But what we \nhave done with respect to importation of prescription drugs is we have \nincluded batch lots and pedigrees and tracers that do not exist in the \nexisting drug supply. Why? The existing drug supply does not have those \nprovisions because they have been objected to over the years by the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  We have put in place procedures that will make this safe. You cannot \nsay the same thing about fruits, vegetables, and seafood, \nunfortunately. A lot of work needs to be done there. But we do not \nbring a bill to the floor of the Senate, a bipartisan group of \nlegislators, a bill that would in any way injure or provide problems \nwith respect to safety.\n  What we do is bring to the floor of the Senate legislation that \ndramatically enhances the margin of safety for prescription drugs. But \nI understand, I understand completely. If I were trying to protect, and \nI were the drug industry trying to protect billions, boy, I understand \nthe exertion of effort to try to protect that.\n  My only point is this: I have a beef with an industry that decides \nthey are going to overcharge the American people, in some cases 10 \ntimes more, in some cases 5, double the price that is paid in other \nparts of the world for the identical drug. I don't think that is fair, \nand I don't think we should allow it to continue. The way to prevent it \nis to give the American people the freedom--every European has that \nfreedom.\n  Let me end with how I began. For somebody to come out here and say \nthis is about unregulated, untested drugs is absolute sheer nonsense. \nIt is not. We do not have to debate what words mean and what words say. \nThat is not a debate we ought to take time to have. All we have to do \nis read it and then represent it accurately, which has not been the \ncase on the floor of the Senate, regrettably.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is it the case when a quorum call is \nrequested it is equally charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be equally charged on both sides. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to remind us why we are \nhere--health care reform--and why health care reform is so important. I \nwould like to go through the costs of inaction, what the consequences \nare if we do not pass health care reform.\n  First of all, rising health care costs are wrecking the lives of \nAmericans. In 2007, 62 percent of bankruptcies were due to medical \ncosts. This legislation will help reduce the rate of growth of health \ncare costs. In fact, the President's Council on Economic Advisers and \nthe President just announced today or yesterday there will be a 1-\npercent reduction in national health care costs. CBO basically said \nthis bill is deficit neutral, and it will have an effect on reducing \nhealth care costs. This bill will reduce health care costs.\n  A Harvard study found, in addition, when people do not have health \ninsurance, they are more likely to be much more ill.\n  Harvard found every year in America lack of health insurance leads to \n45,000 deaths. If Americans do not have health insurance, it leads to \n45,000 deaths in our country. That is intolerable. How can we in the \nUnited States of America--we pride ourselves as the biggest, the \nstrongest, the most moral country on the globe. How can we allow 45,000 \ndeaths just because somebody does not have health insurance? People \nwithout health insurance have a 40-percent higher risk of death than \nthose with private health insurance.\n  How does this bill affect Medicare? According to the CMS Actuary, \nMedicare is projected to go broke in about the year 2017. CMS has \nestimated this will actually extend solvency to the year 2026.\n  That is very important, Mr. President. It is an important message to \nseniors--that the Medicare trust fund solvency will be extended under \nthis legislation for at least 9 more years, beyond 2017. I wish it were \nfurther, but that is a lot better than not extending solvency--\nextending solvency for that period of time.\n  The bill also would increase the percentage of people who have health \ninsurance from about 83 percent to 94 percent. That, too, is no small \nmatter.\n  Our legislation would reform the insurance market to protect those \nwith preexisting conditions. It would prevent insurance companies from \ndiscriminating and capping coverage, and it would require insurance \ncompanies to renew policies as long as policyholders pay their \npremiums.\n  Let me just say a bit more, with a little more precision, about \npremium costs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Office \nof the Actuary, confirmed this. They confirmed that this legislation \nwill cover 33 million Americans who are currently uninsured and will do \nso while significantly reducing Medicare costs and Medicaid spending. \nThink of that. This legislation will cover 33 million Americans who are \ncurrently not covered at the same time reducing Medicare and Medicaid \ncosts.\n  Don't take my word for it. That is the projection of the Chief \nActuary of CMS. In addition, as I mentioned, the Chief Actuary says \nthis will extend the life of the trust fund for 9 years.\n  Moreover, this legislation reduces the cost to seniors, to a family, \nby $300 by 2019. Medicare Part B premiums, according to the Actuary, \nwill be $300 lower than it otherwise would be. The out-of-pocket costs \nwould be, for a couple--I think it is roughly $400. That is a total of \nabout a $700 reduction for a couple in 2019. So a reduction in Medicare \nPart B premium costs and a reduction in out-of-pocket costs.\n  Essentially, the Actuary concludes, and I will read the quote:\n\n       The proposed reductions in Medicare payment updates for \n     providers, the actions of the Independent Medicare Advisory \n     Board, and the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored \n     health insurance would have a significant downward impact on \n     future health care cost growth rates.\n\n  Again, a ``significant downward impact on future health care cost \ngrowth rates.'' The Actuary says the bend in the cost curve is evident. \nThe Actuary also concludes that in 2019 health expenditures are \nprojected to rise by 7.2 percent with no change but 6.9 percent under \nthe proposal. That is, under the proposal, health care costs will rise \nat a lower rate than they will if this legislation does not pass.\n  In addition, this report shows how health insurance costs for \nmillions of Americans will reduce premiums by 14 to 20 percent for \npeople in the individual market. Actually, that was the Congressional \nBudget Office that reached that conclusion and not the Actuary. The \nCongressional Budget Office has basically concluded that for 93 percent \nof Americans premiums will be lowered. For 93 percent of Americans \npremiums will be lower.\n  It is true that for those who are employed--the five-sixths of \npersons who now have health insurance--their premiums would not go down \na heck of a lot, but they will start going down due to this \nlegislation. For the 7 percent whose premiums are not reduced, they get \na better deal. That 7 percent will have much higher quality health \ninsurance than they now have, basically because of no more denial of \ncare for preexisting conditions, market reform,\n\n[[Page S13231]]\n\nrating reform, no more rescissions, et cetera. So this is a very good \ndeal.\n  I would like to say one word, too, on health care cost reduction. A \nlot of Senators have quoted an article by Dr. Gawande from The New \nYorker magazine--I think it was dated June 2--explaining the phenomenon \nof geographic variations in this country and why health care costs are \nmuch higher in some parts of America and much lower in other parts of \nAmerica, which is due mostly to the way we pay health care providers \nand doctors in the system, therefore explaining the basic reason there \nis so much waste in the American health care system.\n  Dr. Gawande published another article in The New Yorker a week or 2 \nago, and in that article he basically says of all the ideas that have \nbeen suggested by economists, by practitioners, by providers, and \npeople worried about the rise of health care costs in America, all of \nthe ideas are in this legislation. They are all in here. All the ways \nto work to start to lower health care costs are in this legislation.\n  He also says the pilot projects and the demonstration projects in \nthis legislation are good because you have to work a little bit, you \nhave to experiment a little, you have to try this and try that to see \nwhere bundling works and see where it does not work. But the provisions \nare there.\n  We can all be quite confident that this administration is going to do \nits level best to make sure these projects work--that is the bundling, \nthe moving toward quality as a basic reimbursement in the way of \nquantity. The administration is going to work very hard to make sure \nthey work. I will say, too, as chairman of the Finance Committee, the \ncommittee of primary jurisdiction over these subjects, that we are \ngoing to have a lot of oversight hearings next year because it is very \nmuch in the interest of the American people to make sure this \nlegislation works and works very well. Clearly, with aggressive \noversight hearings next year we can help make sure that happens.\n  One other point. This bill represents a net tax cut, not a tax \nincrease--a net tax cut for individuals, not a tax increase. Why do I \nsay that? I say that because that is what the Joint Committee on \nTaxation says. What is the Joint Committee on Taxation? It is a \ncommittee, an organization in Washington that serves both the House and \nthe Senate. It serves Republicans and Democrats. There is not one iota \nof partisanship in it. It is totally objective, very solid, very \nconfident. They are the outfit we rely on when we write tax \nlegislation.\n  Basically, they say by the year 2019, Americans will see a net tax \ncut of $40 billion, and that tax cut is equal to an average tax \ndecrease of more than $440 per affected taxpayer. And for low- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers making less than $200,000, this cut is even \ngreater. The average tax credit is equal to more than $640 per affected \ntaxpayer in the year 2019.\n  To repeat: This bill, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nis a net tax cut for individuals--a cut, not an increase but a cut--\nalmost as great as the 2001 tax cut. Many of us know how great that \nwas. This is the biggest tax cut since 2001--this legislation.\n  I also want to discuss a couple other points. A lot of people say: \nWell, gee, some of this does not take effect for several years. Let's \ngo through what takes effect right away, in 2010. What are the \nprovisions that take effect right away? I will read the list.\n  The first is--the fancy term is ``pools''--to help people with \npreexisting conditions get access to health insurance even before the \nactual denial of preexisting conditions kicks in. There is $5 billion \nof Federal support for higher risk pools providing affordable coverage \nto uninsured persons with preexisting conditions. That takes effect \nright away.\n  Second, reinsurance for retiree health benefit plans. Basically, that \nmeans there is immediate access to Federal reinsurance for employer \nplans providing coverage for early retirees--for ages between 55 and \n64. Essentially, that means extra dollars are available for the \noutliers. That is a fancy term for saying the high-cost people in that \nage group--55 to 64.\n  In addition, we extend dependent coverage for young adults. Today, a \nyoung couple buys health insurance for themselves and their kids, and \nonce the child is 21 there is no more health insurance. We raise that \nlevel to the age of 26 so that person can stay with the family and have \nthe family's health insurance.\n  Moreover, this legislation requires that health insurers must provide \nprevention and wellness benefits but no deductibles and no cost-sharing \nrequirements. That, too, will help quite a bit. That takes effect right \naway.\n  Moreover, right away, in 2010, the legislation prohibits insurers \nfrom imposing annual and lifetime caps. Not later but right away there \nis a prohibition against insurers from imposing annual lifetime dollar \nlimits--a big problem today.\n  Moreover, right away, this legislation will stop insurers from \nnullifying or rescinding health insurance policies when claims are \nfiled. Rescissions are a big problem today. In 2010, when this \nlegislation passes, no more rescissions of health care policies.\n  Moreover, this legislation sets minimum standards for insurance \noverhead costs to ensure that most premium dollars are spent on health \nbenefits, not costly administration or executive compensation and \nprofits. We also require public disclosure of overhead and benefit \nspending and premium rebates. That is right away.\n  What about small business persons--small businessmen? This \nlegislation offers tax credits to small businesses with low wages to \nmake covering their workers more affordable. It takes effect in 2010, \nand credits of up to 50 percent of insurance premiums will be available \nto firms that choose to offer coverage.\n  I might also say there are stronger small business provisions, too, \nthat I am quite certain will be in the managers' amendment. Greater \nincentives to the tune of about $12 billion to $13 billion for small \nbusinesses will be in this legislation and will also be in the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  Moreover, what will take effect next year, not later, is we have \nclosed the coverage gap for the Medicare drug benefit. Basically, that \nmeans we have closed the doughnut hole--we are starting to close the \ndoughnut hole. Seniors pay very high prices for brand-name drugs if \nthey are in that so-called doughnut hole. We close it so that seniors \ndon't have to pay those high prices anymore.\n  There is public access to comparable information, more transparency, \nand I could go on and on and on. There are many provisions which take \neffect right away and not at a later date.\n  Mr. President, I believe that debate is drawing to a conclusion on \nthe four matters under consideration. We may be able to have votes as \nsoon as 5:30.\n  I see my colleagues from Kansas and Iowa on the Senate floor, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 5 \nminutes of Senator McConnell's time--the Republican leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \nopportunity to address the Lautenberg amendment and speak in favor of \nthe Lautenberg amendment.\n  I oppose the base bill. I oppose the bill overall. I have spoken a \nnumber of times in opposition to the overall bill. It is way too \nexpensive, it cuts Medicare, raises taxes, and inserts the funding of \nabortion, which is something we haven't looked at in 30 years. The Hyde \nlanguage has not allowed funding of abortion, and instead this does and \nputs it in, and I think it will result in poorer health care for a \nnumber of Americans.\n  But the issue I rise on today is on the Lautenberg amendment, and in \nsupport of the Lautenberg amendment. This is an amendment we have seen \nin this body four times previously over the last 10 years. Each time \nthe Lautenberg amendment has passed overwhelmingly, and that is because \nof the safety concerns for drugs coming into the United States.\n  I would note that Secretary Sebelius, Secretary of HHS--Health and \nHuman Services--who before being named to this position was the \nGovernor of the State of Kansas for 6 years, with whom I worked over \nthe years, through her office has stated they cannot basically certify \nthe safety of these drugs.\n\n[[Page S13232]]\n\n  There is a letter that has been gone over in some depth and length \nfrom the Food and Drug Commissioner saying that it is going to be very \ndifficult for them to certify the safety of these drugs. Yet what the \nLautenberg amendment does is it says: OK, if you can certify safety, \nand this is going to reduce the price, then they can be admitted.\n  That seems to make sense. That is why 4 times over the last 10 years \nthis body has passed the Lautenberg amendment, or an equivalent, and I \nthink that is appropriate.\n  I would also note there is a huge industry in the United States--the \npharmaceutical industry--that is quite concerned about the safety and \nefficacy of what this bill would do in not allowing the safety of the \ndrugs if you don't pass a Lautenberg amendment. They are very concerned \nabout that. And toward that regard, I will read pieces of a letter sent \nto me by Kansas Bio. It is the Kansas Biosciences Organization. They \nsent this letter to me saying:\n\n       On behalf of the members of Kansas Bio, please accept this \n     letter in opposition to Senator Dorgan's drug importation \n     amendment to the health care reform legislation which may be \n     voted on by the Senate. We believe that the promotion of drug \n     importation is an extremely risky endeavor which threatens \n     the livelihood of one of Kansas' fastest growing bioscience \n     industry sectors--the service providers to our Nation's and \n     our world's drug development and delivery companies.\n       KansasBio is an industry organization representing over 150 \n     bioscience companies, academic institutions, State \n     affiliates, and related economic development organizations in \n     the State of Kansas, throughout the Kansas City region. . . . \n     Senator Dorgan's amendment opens up the risk of allowing \n     foreign drugs that do not have FDA approval into the United \n     States and thereby posing significant health and safety risks \n     to the patients.\n\n  It is signed by the president and CEO, Angela Kreps, of KansasBio.\n  I am ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and the Food and Drug Administration, \nso I am keenly interested in the committee structure in this issue.\n  In addition, the University of Kansas in my State, in addition to \nhaving the top-ranked basketball team in the country, has the top-\nranked pharmaceutical school in the country. They are a part of \nKansasBio and concerned about the Dorgan amendment in place. That is \nwhy they support things like the Lautenberg amendment which assure two \nthings: that you have safety and that any value in this proposal is \npassed along to the consumer.\n  The FDA has been tasked with the responsibility of safeguarding this \ncountry's prescription drug supply and has executed that \nresponsibility, I believe, quite well. It would be unwise for this \nbody, then, to not value their opinions in regard to this matter. The \nLautenberg amendment counts on the FDA expertise and proven track \nrecord and permits legal importation of prescription drugs into the \nUnited States only if Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary \nSebelius in this administration, as head of the FDA, can certify to \nCongress that prescription drug importation will do two things: No. 1, \npose no additional risk to the public health and safety; and, No. 2, \nresult in a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to \nthe American consumer. The safety and cost savings certification \namendment would restore this language.\n  The Lautenberg amendment does that. This Congress must require a \nsafety and cost savings certification from the Secretary of HHS before \nopening the floodgates of drug importation. Requiring this \ncertification is the responsible way to ensure that American citizens \nwill be protected from potentially life-threatening counterfeit, \ncontaminated, or diluted prescription drugs.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate has voted on this previously four times, \neach time overwhelmingly adopting something like the Lautenberg \namendment. As many of my colleagues may remember, the safety and cost \nsavings certification was first signed into law when the Senate passed \nthe Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000. During that debate, \nconcerns were raised by many in this body that drug importation would \nexpose Americans to counterfeit and polluted prescription drugs. To \nalleviate these well-documented fears, the Senate passed this second-\ndegree amendment then unanimously.\n  To date, as noted earlier, no HHS Secretary has been able to certify \nthat drug importation will not pose a significant health and safety \nthreat. For those reasons, I support the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think we have some time available. I \nwish to continue with some remarks. I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nhis remarks and his concern also about the efficacy and the safety of \ndrugs that might reach our citizens.\n  I listened carefully to the remarks of my colleague from North \nDakota. He said the principal focus of our amendment is to protect the \nprofits of the drug companies. No, I want to protect the health and \nwell-being of American citizens. I look at an industry that has \nprolonged life expectancy, has made life more productive and pleasant \nfor many whose disabilities may have them imprisoned in their homes.\n  We look at what has happened over the years, where treatment for \nconditions such as malaria, polio, smallpox were discovered, and \nantibiotics and chemotherapy have continued to be developed, primarily \nby American drug companies. Those are the companies that have the \nreputation for bringing the best products to market, the most carefully \nscrutinized, and most effective. What I want is for those companies to \ncontinue to be developing drugs that will extend wellness and will \ncontinue to improve longevity. I want these products to be available \nmore reasonably, more cheaply--more affordably.\n  I had an experience in my life--people have heard me talk about this \nat times--whereby my father got cancer, was disabled with cancer when \nhe was 42 years old. Our family was virtually bankrupt as a result of \nthe cost for drugs and hospital services and physicians, so I know how \ncostly they are. My father had cancer then, and I have seen what has \nhappened now, with the opportunities for some optimism in situations \nwhere cancer develops. We are looking to make these drugs more \navailable, more affordable.\n  The thing that strikes me, as we review where we are in the \ndevelopment of a new health plan or a reform of the existing health \nprograms, and I hear the criticism coming from people who have \nindicated they do not support more available health products, I think \nabout what happens when votes come about that move the health care bill \nalong. There is absolute obstinacy that prevails with many of our \nfriends on the Republican side.\n  I look at what good, proper products can do and the hope we have for \nchildhood diseases that are so painful to see. We look for improvements \nin those--whether it is autism or diabetes or other conditions. We want \ndesperately for companies in this country of ours to continue to \ndevelop drugs to treat them--or companies anywhere. But when they come \nto this country we have to know they are safe because there is nothing \nthat can excuse the sacrifice of safety, for whatever discounts you \nmight get on the product, products that, as has been noted, can kill \nyou if they are the wrong formula or contaminated product.\n  Our differences between the Dorgan and Lautenberg amendments boil \ndown to one word: safety. Knowing that when you open the bottle, that \nwhen you take the liquid, you are not doing something or your children \nor your loved ones are not doing something that harms their health. We \nowe them that feeling of security and comfort as they try to cure \nthemselves from sickness or disease. That is what we are looking at \nhere. I hope my colleagues will stand up and say no, don't let these \nproducts come in without the tightest scrutiny that can be developed; \nwithout the most secure process of production and shipment that can be \nexercised.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask how many minutes I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to my good friend from Iowa who I think \nis\n\n[[Page S13233]]\n\ngoing to be speaking against my position but he is a good fellow so I \nthink he should have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is typical of the comity of the Senate. I thank my \ngood friend for doing that. I have a little different view on some of \nthe things he said about taxes here. I respect him giving me some time \nbecause we don't have time on this side. It is nice, his doing that.\n  Republicans and Democrats are working off of the same data provided \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation. For some reason my friends on the \nother side of the aisle seem to want to read this data selectively, so \nI wish to look at this data. I want to stress this data is from the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. They are experts. They are \nnonpolitical people who tell it like it is.\n  My friends on the other side are correct in one thing: This bill \nprovides a tax benefit to a small group of Americans. You can see right \nhere that this benefit is to the people here where the minus sign is in \nfront of the numbers. These numbers are in white.\n  As I pointed out previously, when you see a negative number on this \nchart, the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us these people are \nreceiving a tax benefit. This income category--the income categories \nwhere you see these negative numbers begin at zero and stretch to \n$50,000 for individuals and $75,000 for families. That will be $50,000 \nto $75,000. I give my Democratic friends credit for being right on this \npart of the data. But I want to show you where I disagree with them and \ntheir choosing to overlook other parts of the data, the data I will \nsoon refer to here on this chart.\n\n  When we see negative numbers on this chart, as I have said, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation is telling us that there is a tax benefit. So, \nconversely, where there are positive numbers--this will be an example \nof positive numbers--the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us \nthese taxpayers are seeing a tax increase. Those numbers I have already \npointed to begin at $50,000 for an individual and go up to $200,000 for \nan individual.\n  When we see a positive number, then, it is the reverse. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are in fact seeing \ntax increases. So if we see positive numbers for individuals making \nmore than $50,000 and we see positive numbers for families making more \nthan $75,000, it is just this simple: We know these people's taxes are \ngoing to go up.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us that taxes for these \nindividuals, once again, for a third time, will go up under this 2,074-\npage Reid bill.\n  These individuals and families are making less than $200,000. What is \nsignificant about less than $200,000 is that this violates what the \nPresident promised in his campaign, that individuals who are middle \nclass, under $200,000, are not going to see one dime of tax increase.\n  To come to any different conclusion is saying that the data on this \nchart--and of course the professionals at the Joint Committee on \nTaxation--both are wrong. To come to any different conclusion is saying \nthe chart produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On this side? Does anyone have remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 3 minutes. The \nRepublican leader has 3\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from North Dakota has \n7\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from New Jersey has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to make it clear, essentially this \nlegislation does several things. This is the core part of this \nlegislation. What is it? First, this legislation very significantly \nreforms the health insurance industry, especially for people who \nindividually buy insurance and also for people who buy for a small \ncompany and even buy insurance for a large company. It is insurance \nmarket reform. It stops insurance companies from, frankly, undertaking \npractices which are un-American; that is, denying people coverage based \non preexisting conditions, denying them health insurance because they \nhave some kind of preexisting something--that is ridiculous--or saying: \nYou can't have health insurance because you have some other health care \nstatus or saying: Sure, we will give you a policy, then a month, 2 \nmonths later, rescind it willy-nilly or putting in restrictive limits \non what the company will pay during your lifetime or what the company \nmight pay in health insurance benefits for a year.\n  In addition, this legislation reforms what are called rating \nprovisions that States have. States basically allow companies to charge \nwhatever they want, if you are a little older compared to if you are \nyounger, if you are a woman compared to a man. There are lots of \ndifferent ways States allow insurance companies to charge based upon \ndifferent categories. So, No. 1, insurance market reform. This \nlegislation stops some outrageous practices that insurance companies \npractice today.\n  No. 2, this legislation begins to get control over health care costs. \nWe have to start to get control over health care costs. This \nlegislation does so. It also is deficit neutral. It does not cost one \nthin dime for us to enact this legislation. It is all paid for. It \nprovides health insurance coverage. About 31 million Americans who \ncurrently do not have health insurance will have health insurance, if \nthis legislation passes. I don't have to remind my colleagues of the \nimportance of health insurance. Insurance market reform that lowers the \ncost of health care in this country, provides full coverage and, \nequally important, begins to put in place delivery system reforms. That \nis kind of wonkish, but it is one of the most important parts of this \nbill, starting to change the way we pay doctors and hospitals, pay \nbased more on quality rather than quantity, start putting into effect \ndifferent systems that sound kind of wonkish but will be important over \n3, 4, 5 years. It is bundling, group homes. It is lowering the practice \nof hospitals that readmit too quickly after a patient is discharged.\n  There are so many reforms here. I strongly urge everyone to keep \ntheir eye on the ball. Insurance market reform in this legislation, \nlowering costs in this legislation, lowering taxes in this legislation, \ninsurance coverage for 31 million Americans who today do not have it, \nand starting to put in place payment reforms which will help get this \ncountry on the right path so, after several years, we have a health \ncare system we are all proud of, one that gets rid of all the waste we \nhave in the country today. We pay $2.5 trillion a year in health care, \nabout half public and half private. People who study this say we waste \nas much as $800 billion a year--not million, billion--in fraud, waste, \ndollars that don't go directly to health care. This legislation starts \nto get a handle on that. It stops all the waste. You get a better \nhandle on fraud so after 2 or 3 years, we will have something we are \nvery proud of. Let us remind ourselves, again, if we don't pass this \nlegislation, we will rue the day we didn't because we will have to \nstart all over again, 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years from now, and the problem \nwill be much worse. The cost for families is going to be much greater, \nthe cost to American businesses much greater. Our budgets are going to \nbe in much worse shape, Medicare and Medicaid. This legislation extends \nthe solvency of the Medicare trust fund for another 9 years.\n  Remember the bottom line, remember the basics. Let's not get too \ncaught up in the details of the weeds and get distracted by a lot of \nstuff that is not the core of this bill. The provisions I outlined are \ncompelling reasons why this legislation must pass and why it would be \nso good for America.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent to use the remainder of my time as \nwell as that of the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a couple of the \npoints made about whether this bill truly does address what the \nAmerican people are asking it to address. If you ask most people in \nAmerica what they want out of health care reform--and\n\n[[Page S13234]]\n\nthey do want reform--they will tell you they want to see control of the \nskyrocketing cost of health care, particularly the cost of insurance \npremiums. They would like to see increased access to quality medical \ncare. It has been said a number of times by the proponents of this \nlegislation that this bill accomplishes those objectives, but let's \nlook at exactly what the Congressional Budget Office has told us on the \ncore issue; namely, what is going to happen to your insurance premiums \nif this bill is passed.\n  What the Congressional Budget Office very clearly said, which is also \nbacked by 7, 8, 9 or 10 other studies from the private sector as well \nas the Joint Committee on Taxation and backed by the Chief Actuary for \nthe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is that for at least 30 \npercent and the most vulnerable people in America, if you are looking \nat whether your insurance premiums are going to go up or down, they are \ngoing to go up, not down. If you are a member of the 17 percent of \nAmericans who get your insurance in the individual market, your \ninsurance is going to go way up. In fact, it is going to go up by as \nmuch as 10 to 13 percent in addition to what it would have gone up \nwithout the bill. If you are someone who gets your business from small \ngroups, from a small group market, your insurance costs are going to go \nup from 1 to 3 percent. If you are one of the Americans who is able to \nget your insurance in the large group market, then you can basically \nexpect that the bill will have no significant impact on you. There is a \npossibility of a slight reduction, but the potential is, it is going to \nhave no impact at all.\n  What does the bill do? For 17 percent of Americans in the individual \nmarket and for 13 percent of Americans in the small group market, it \nclearly makes your health care premiums go up. For those who are in the \nremainder of the market, it basically doesn't achieve the objective of \nhealth care reform--and at what price? We often hear we need to bend \ndown the cost curve. As I have indicated, this legislation doesn't bend \ndown the cost curve Americans are talking about; namely, the price of \ntheir health care or their health insurance. What does it do with \nregard to the Federal Government? It is going to increase the cost to \nthe Federal Government on health care by $2.5 trillion in a massive new \nentitlement program. So that price curve is not bent down.\n  Then what are we left with? Some say the deficit will go down under \nthis bill. There is only one way the deficit can go down under this \nbill; that is, if you take away the budget gimmicks, massive tax \nincreases, and massive Medicare cuts. But I will just talk about the \nbudget gimmicks because of a lack of time. The spending side of this \nbill is delayed for 4 years. The taxing and cutting Medicare side of \nthe bill is implemented on day one. So we have 10 years of tax \nincreases to offset 6 years of spending. I think that is the way the \nnumber was reached. You have to figure out how many years to delay the \nspending start before you can say there was a deficit-neutral bill. The \nreality is, this bill doesn't deal with any of those spending curves.\n  The matter we will be voting on in a few minutes is my motion that \nwould address the tax side of the bill. All it says is: Let's change \nthe bill to comply with the President's promise; namely, that people \nmaking less than $200,000 a year or $250,000 as a couple would not pay \nmore taxes. What we found from the Joint Tax Committee is, 73 million \nAmericans in that category will pay more taxes. In fact, it is not 73 \nmillion Americans, it is 73 million American households who will pay \nmore taxes and see a tax increase under this bill and not just a small \none. It is massive, hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes that \nwill be imposed by this bill.\n  In response, the proponents of this bill say: But this bill is a tax \ncut. The only way they can say this bill is a tax cut is by looking at \nthe subsidy that is going to be provided as a tax cut. It is called a \nrefundable tax credit, although three-fourths of it, 73 percent to be \naccurate, goes to people who do not pay taxes. Yet it is called tax \nrelief because it is administered through the Tax Code and is described \nas a refundable tax credit. The CBO gets this and Americans get it. The \nCongressional Budget Office says these aren't tax cuts. This is \nspending, and it is scored that way by the CBO as it analyzes the bill. \nThe only way you can say this bill involves these kinds of tax cuts is \nif you say that a provision that will simply result in the payment of a \ncheck by the Federal Government to an individual who has no tax \nliability to assist them with their health care costs is a tax cut. \nLet's accept that.\n  Even in that case, only 7 percent of Americans qualify for that \nsubsidy, and the rest qualify for the tax increases. To say the \nPresident's promise was that I will not cut your taxes more or I will \nnot increase your taxes more than I will cut someone else's taxes and, \nby the way, I will call a direct subsidy a tax cut, is not exactly what \nI think the President meant. It is not what the American people thought \nhe meant when he said Americans making less than $200,000 or $250,000 \nas a family would not pay more taxes under this bill.\n  My proposal simply says send this bill back to the Finance Committee. \nThey can turn it around quickly, if they want to. Have them take out \nthe provisions that violate the President's pledge on taxes.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan amendment \non reimportation. This is not about importing drugs from China or India \nor Mexico, where drug safety standards are not up to par. Although \nAmerican companies have outsourced a lot of their manufacturing to \nthose countries and found a lot of problems with the ingredients they \nimport into American drugs, that is not the issue. That underscores the \nhypocrisy of U.S. drug companies in opposing the Dorgan amendment.\n  This is about importing drugs from countries such as Canada and \nGermany and Australia and New Zealand and Japan, countries with highly \ndeveloped drug safety regimes. Patients in England and France and \nGermany and New Zealand and Canada have the same protections we do. I \nhave been in drugstores in Canada just 2 hours from Toledo, less than \nthat, and you see the same drug and the same dosage, the same \npackaging, the same company making them. In Canada, it is 35 to 55 \npercent lower than in the United States. One drug, the cholesterol-\nlowering drug Lipitor, is $33 in Canada, $53 in France, $48 in Germany, \n$63 in the Netherlands, $32 in Spain, $40 in the United Kingdom. Same \npackaging, same company, same dosage, same drug is $125 in the United \nStates We pay more, even though, in most cases, these drugs are either \nmanufactured in the United States or developed, in some cases, by U.S. \ntaxpayers, developed certainly in the United States for Americans, but \nwe pay two and three times more.\n  A 2009 Consumer Reports survey found that due to high drug prices, \none out of six consumers failed to fill a prescription, one out of six \nconsumers skipped doses.\n  Mr. President, 23 percent of consumers cut back on groceries. They \nchoose between do I get my groceries or pay for this drug? Consumer \nafter consumer will cut their pill in half and take one part today and \none part the next day, which is not what their doctor says they should \ndo. We know this is not good for Americans' health. We know this is not \ngood for Americans' pocketbooks. We know this is not good for \ntaxpayers. It is not good for small business. It is not good for big \nbusiness, large American companies that are paying the freight, that \nare paying these costs. American consumers and taxpayers and businesses \nare suffering from these high costs.\n  Pharmaceutical companies hike up prices, rake in massive profits. \nThey are one of the three most profitable industries in this Nation and \nhave been for decades. The pharmaceutical industry, in 2008, recorded \nsales in excess of $300 billion, with a 19-percent profit margin. This \nis in a bad year--a bad year for most of us in this country, in 2008. \nIn the last year alone, the brand-name prescription drug industry \nraised their prices by more than 9 percent.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S13235]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments and \nmotion specified in the order of December 14 regarding H.R. 3590; that \nprior to each vote, there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that after the first vote in the \nsequence, the succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes each; further, \nthat all provisions of the December 14 order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some issues we deal with here in the \nSenate are unbelievably complicated. This one is not. This is painfully \nsimple, the question of whether the American people should be charged \nand continue paying the highest prices in the world for brand-name \nprescription drugs--my amendment says no--from other countries in which \nthere is a safe chain of custody that is identical to ours. The \nAmerican people ought to have the freedom to shop for those lower \npriced FDA-approved drugs that are sold there at a fraction of the \nprice.\n  I especially wish to thank Senator Begich from Alaska for his work. \nThis is bipartisan, with a broad number of Democrats and Republicans \nworking on this importation of prescription drugs bill, giving the \nAmerican people the freedom to acquire lower priced drugs. Senator \nBegich has been a significant part of that effort. I want to say thanks \nto him for his work on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, if I could ask a question of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  I say to the Senator, I appreciate his comments, and I think he is \nright. Of all the complexity of this bill, this seems so simple. I know \nwhen I was mayor, we worked on this issue. It seems logical for Alaska. \nSince we border so much of Canada, it seems logical to do what we can \nin this arena.\n  I know the Senator stated these comments before, but I think it is \nimportant for especially my viewers who are now watching from Alaska, \nwith the 4-hour difference. But the Senator talked about the savings. \nThere are savings to the taxpayers that are very clear, and there are \nsavings to the consumer, which is even more significant. Can the \nSenator remind me what those numbers are? I think I have them. I want \nto be sure, as I talk about this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment will save $100 billion in \n10 years, nearly $20 billion for the Federal Government and nearly $80 \nbillion for the American consumers.\n  Mr. BEGICH. That is what this health care bill is about, not only \ngetting good-quality care but also finding those opportunities, as we \njust heard one Senator talk about, bending that cost curve--I hate that \nterm--but it is impacting the consumers in a positive way by $80 \nbillion.\n  The other thing I have heard a lot about on the floor--and the \nSenator talked quickly about it--is the chain of control, which I drove \nhere for 19 days with my family through Canada, and 5 days we bought \nsome drugs when I had a cold, but I am still here. I am standing. I am \nhealthy. Remind me of that chain of control for these drugs and where \nthey are produced.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator from Alaska, these \nprescription drugs would be able to be reimported from Australia, New \nZealand, Japan, and the European countries that have identical chains \nof custody to our chain of custody so that there is safety.\n  It is also the case that we are in politics, so the floor of the \nSenate is the place of a lot of tall tales. I understand that. I have \nbeen in politics for a long time.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Yes, I have learned that as a new Member.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But early on, one of my colleagues said this is about \nuntested, unregulated drugs coming from, oh, parts of the Soviet Union. \nThat is so unbelievable. It is not describing the amendment I have \noffered. We are talking about a chain of custody that is identical to \nthe United States. When that is the case--if it is the case--why would \nthe American people not have the freedom to acquire that same drug when \nit is sold at one-tenth the price, one-fifth, one-third, or one-half \nthe price? Why not give the American people that freedom?\n  Mr. BEGICH. The Senator from North Dakota and I have just one last \nquestion. Even though we did not ask for a colloquy, this is kind of a \ncolloquy, and I appreciate the back-and-forth.\n  This is one reason I support this bill--not only today but many \nmonths ago--for all the reasons the Senator just laid out. The control \nis there. The protection to the consumer is there. The savings to the \nconsumer and the taxpayer are enormous, as we deal with these issues. \nIf there is one thing I have heard over and over through e-mails and \ncorrespondence to my office, it is: Help us save on prescription drugs.\n  To emphasize that point once more, to make sure I have the numbers \nright, over 10 years, between the Federal Government and the consumer, \nit is over $100 billion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the savings is over $100 billion. Look, I \nwant the pharmaceutical industry to do well, to make profits, to make \nprescription drugs. I just want fair pricing for the American people. I \ndo not have a beef with the industry. I want them to do well. I want \nthem, however, to give the American people a fair price because we are \npaying the highest prices in the world for brand-name prescription \ndrugs, and I think it is flat out unfair. This amendment will fix that.\n  There is a competing amendment that nullifies it, that simply says \nall this is going to go away and we are done with this bill and nothing \nhas happened to put the brakes on prescription drug prices.\n  I hope my colleagues will stand with me and with the American people \nsaying: We support fair drug prices for the American people. That is \nwhat we are going to vote on in a few minutes.\n  I appreciate the questions from the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for allowing me these questions and again clarifying for \nmy residents in Alaska how important this bill is. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The order that was \njust entered provided for 2 minutes, equally divided, before, I \nsuppose, the vote on each of the amendments. Is that in addition to or \nis that a part of the time that has been allocated to Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In addition to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So, Mr. President, if the Senator from Montana wishes to \nspeak on his amendment, he has 5 minutes, plus 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes plus 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Excuse me. The time is equally divided. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make it as clear as I can that the \nCongressional Budget Office essentially says that premiums will go down \nfor about 93 percent of Americans. I say that because I think my good \nfriend from Idaho was leaving a different impression.\n  But let me just summarize what CBO says. I would put a chart that CBO \nprovided in the Record, but under the Senate rules we cannot put charts \nin the Record. So I am just going to summarize what this chart says.\n  OK. Seventy percent of Americans will get their health insurance in \nwhat is called the large group market. That is people who work for \nlarger employers--70 percent. CBO said for that 70 percent of \nAmericans, premiums will go down a little bit. It will be about a 3-\npercent reduction in premiums.\n  The next group of Americans getting health insurance are in what is \ncalled the small group market. Those are people in small companies, \nsmall businesses, primarily. That is where 13 percent of Americans get \ntheir insurance. CBO says for that 13 percent, maybe the premiums will \ngo up between 1 percent or down 2 percentage points overall. But for \nthose folks, those small businesspeople who get tax credits--\n\n[[Page S13236]]\n\nand there are some very significant tax credits in this bill, and I \nthink it will be even more significant when the managers' amendment is \nout--CBO says, even with modest tax credits, those premiums will go \ndown 8 to 11 percent.\n  That is, for 13 percent of Americans who have insurance, their \npremiums will go down 8 to 11 percent, among those who have credits.\n  Let's look at what is called the nongroup market, the individual \nmarket. That is 17 percent of Americans. For those folks, if you \ncompare their current insurance with what they will have in the future, \nthose premiums will go down 14 to 20 percent--down 14 to 20 percent--\naccording to CBO.\n  In addition, though, CBO says that persons who have tax credits--we \nare talking now about the individual market--those people will find, on \naverage, their premiums will go down 56 to 59 percent. Remember, 17 \npercent of Americans buy insurance individually. Of that 17 percent, 10 \npercent, because of tax credits in this bill, will find their premiums \ngo down 56 to 59 percent.\n  The 7 percent that are remaining--remember I started off by saying \nfor 93 percent, there will be a reduction. The 7 percent remaining will \nfind that because of better benefits, their premiums will go up 10 to \n13 percent, but they will have a lot better benefits. They will have a \nlot higher quality insurance than they have today. Frankly, my judgment \nis, the higher quality insurance they have, because of this \nlegislation, will outweigh the increase in the premiums.\n  But anyway, for 93 percent, premiums will go down.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3183\n\n  Mr. President, let me speak a little bit on my amendment which, as I \nunderstand it, is going to be the first amendment voted on.\n  I remind my colleagues that the underlying legislation is a tax cut \nbill. It cuts taxes. It cuts taxes very significantly. Over the next 10 \nyears, for example, this bill will provide Americans with a $441 \nbillion tax cut to buy health insurance--$441 billion in tax credits to \nbuy health insurance. Credits are tax reductions.\n  In the year 2017, taxpayers who earn between $20,000 and $30,000 a \nyear will see an average tax cut of nearly 37 percent. These are people \nwho have a hard time making ends meet. People who earn between $20,000 \nand $30,000 will see an average tax cut of 37 percent. That is \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  In addition, 2 years later, the average taxpayer making less than \n$75,000 a year will receive a tax credit of $1,500. Just to repeat, the \naverage taxpayer making less than $75,000 a year will receive a tax \nreduction--a tax credit--of more than $1,500.\n  The Crapo motion to commit is really an attempt to kill health care \nreform. It is, thus, a plan to keep Americans from getting these tax \ncuts. I think we want Americans to get these tax cuts. If the Crapo \nmotion is successful, Americans will not get any of these tax cuts. We \nwant them to. The underlying bill gives Americans these tax cuts. \nTherefore, I think we should reject this procedural maneuver designed \nto kill the tax cuts in this health care bill.\n  That is what my side-by-side amendment says--that is going to be the \nfirst amendment voted on--and that is, let's vote to keep our current \ntax cuts. I urge a positive vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on \nthe Crapo motion, which eliminates the tax cuts, which is not what I \nthink most Americans want. So I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nside-by-side amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Baucus \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the legislation that we are discussing \ntoday, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, could have a \nprofound impact on the United States for decades to come. I am \nespecially concerned about the tax implications of the legislation. We \nneed to take a thorough look at these tax provisions before approving \nthis legislation.\n  It is plain to see that if you have insurance, you get taxed; if you \ndon't have insurance, you get taxed; if you need prescription drugs, \nyou get taxed; if you need a medical device, you get taxed; if you have \nhigh out-of-pocket health expenses, you get taxed. Everyone gets taxed \nunder this proposal.\n  This legislation also changes the core principle of Social Security \nand Medicare financing, a model called ``social insurance.'' Since \nSocial Security was created in the 1930s and the Medicare Program in \n1965, payroll tax revenues have been dedicated to financing these \nprograms. In current tax law, all funding from the Medicare payroll tax \nfinances the Medicare Program. This legislation proposes to increase \nthe hospital insurance portion of the payroll tax on wages from 1.45 \npercent to 1.95 percent and uses the revenues to fund programs outside \nof Medicare. If this proposal becomes law, future Congresses will have \nthe ability to take payroll tax revenues and use them for highways or \ndefense or other nonsocial insurance spending. This will be a serious \nprecedent, a long-term game-changer in how we finance our government, \nand I do not think it is wise to do this today.\n  Additionally, individuals who fail to maintain government-approved \nhealth insurance coverage would be subject to a penalty of up to $2,250 \nin 2016. This individual mandate tax is regressive and will largely be \nstrapped on the backs of those who can least afford such a penalty.\n  Analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation reveals that while a \nrelatively small group of middle-class individuals, families, and \nsingle parents may benefit under this bill, a much larger group of \nmiddle-class individuals, families and single parents will be \ndisadvantaged. According to the analysis by the Joint Committee on Tax, \nthis legislation increases taxes by a 3 to 1 ratio on people making \nless than $200,000 a year, in other words for every one individual or \nfamily that gets the tax credit, three middle-income individuals and \nfamilies are taxed. Roughly 42 million individuals and families, or 25 \npercent of all tax returns under $200,000 will, on average, pay higher \ntaxes under this bill, even with the tax credits factored in.\n  There are only about 17,000 Mississippi tax filers who earn more than \n$200,000, so we are looking at over 2.5 million people who earn less \nthan $200,000 and could easily be forced to pay higher taxes. This \nlegislation will affect a large majority of our tax base.\n  Tax spending as proposed in the legislation before us provides \ncredits for health insurance to individuals and families between 100 \npercent and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, FPL. For example, \na family at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level can pay no more \nthan 2 percent of their income on premiums, and the government would \npick up the rest of the cost. Although this furthers the goal of trying \nto get everyone insured, only 7 percent of Americans will be eligible \nfor a tax credit and 91 percent of Americans will experience an \nincrease in taxes. This hardly seems like a solution.\n  The health care industry, including many small businesses in my \nstate, would be subject to fees imposed by this legislation. Health \ninsurance companies that administer a self-insured policy on behalf of \nemployers would be subject to fees imposed on the industry. This $6.7 \nbillion annual fee will undoubtedly be passed on to consumers.\n  This legislation imposes a nondeductible $2.3 billion fee on \nmanufacturers of prescription drugs, which is an example of yet another \nfee that will be passed on to consumers.\n  Medical device manufacturers will be on the hook for $2 billion in \nannual fees. Again, this will be passed on to consumers.\n  Of additional concern is the ``free-rider'' penalty for employers \nwith more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance \ncoverage. These employers would be required to pay a fee for each \nemployee. Businesses that pay any amount greater than $600 to corporate \nproviders of services would have to file an information report with the \nIRS, adding further regulatory burdens on business and on an agency \nthat does not traditionally deal in health care.\n  According to a recent study, taxes in this proposal will place \napproximately 5.2 million low-income workers at risk of losing their \njobs or having their hours reduced. An additional 10.2 million workers \ncould see lower wages and\n\n[[Page S13237]]\n\nreduced benefits. Why would we want to put people at risk of losing \ntheir jobs? A small business owner in my State told me that 8 percent \nof his income goes to pay for health insurance for his employees. If \nthis amount is increased, he will be forced to reduce the size of his \nstaff. Why would we want to hurt small businesses at a time like this?\n  We all remember President Obama's campaign promise that he would not \nraise taxes on families earning less than $250,000 a year. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation conducted an analysis that shows that in 2019--\nwhen the bill is in full effect--on average individuals making over \n$50,000 and families making over $75,000 would have seen their taxes go \nup under this legislation. In other words, 42 million individuals and \nfamilies earning less than $200,000 would pay higher taxes.\n  Arguably millions more middle-class families and individuals could be \nhit with a tax increase from the health care industry ``fees'' or taxes \nproposed. According to testimony of the Congressional Budget Office \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee, these fees would be passed through \nto health care consumers and would increase health insurance premiums \nand prices for health care-related products. If the President signs \nthis legislation in its current form, he would break his pledge not to \nraise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year.\n  My distinguished friend from Idaho, Senator Crapo, offered an \namendment in the Senate Finance Committee markup providing that ``no \ntax, fee or penalty imposed by this legislation shall be applied to any \nindividual earning less than $200,000 per year or any couple earning \nless than $250,000 per year.'' The amendment was rejected.\n  Small businesses in my State do not support this legislation. With \nunemployment at a 26-year high and small business owners struggling to \nsimply keep their doors open, this kind of reform is not what we need \nto encourage small businesses to thrive. Small businesses need reform \nthat will lower insurance costs. They need a bill that will decrease \nthe overall cost of doing business. If a bill increases the cost of \ndoing business or fails to reduce costs, then the bill fails to meet \nits intended goal of reigning in health care costs.\n  I would submit that the bill fails to lower national health \nexpenditures; it fails to lower the amount of money the federal \ngovernment spends on health care; and it does not bend the cost curve \nof rapidly increasing national health care costs. If we were running a \nlarge company, this would be an unsuccessful business proposal.\n  In Mississippi, we could insure a majority of the uninsured if we \nenrolled all eligible children in the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram: If more small businesses offered health insurance, and if \npeople who could afford health insurance purchased health insurance, \nthis would be reform.\n  Mr. President, I would like to see our Nation's health system \nreformed, but these reforms cannot be on the backs of individuals and \nbusinesses that we need to succeed. Reform should not add to the \nalready high costs of doing business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I will just take 1 minute on this, and then \nI think we will probably be ready to vote.\n  Again, I think there are two contrasting amendments here. The Senator \nfrom Montana has indicated that my motion, which would simply ask the \nFinance Committee to make this bill comply with the President's pledge, \nwould somehow kill the bill--that is not at all true--and, secondly, \nthat it would stop the tax relief in the bill that the Senator from \nMontana has identified, the refundable tax credits. The bottom line is, \nmy amendment does not even address the refundable tax credits. They \nremain in the bill.\n  All my amendment does is say: Let's have the President's pledge to \nthe American people honored in this legislation. Let's take out the \ntaxes that 73 million American households will pay under this \nlegislation--hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, essentially, the Crapo motion to commit \nthe underlying bill, the pending bill, is to the Finance Committee to \ntake out all the tax cuts. That is what it is, so I oppose it.\n  I urge Senators to vote for my amendment, which is a sense of the \nSenate that the Senate should reject such procedural motions, \nbasically, because we want to keep the tax cuts that are in this bill.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S13237, December 15, 2009, the Record reads: The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nCrapo motion to commit.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, this is a very simple vote we are going \nto have. This is a vote that will correct the bill to comply with the \nPresident's promise not to tax anyone who makes under $200,000 as an \nindividual or $250,000 as a family.\n  I think the vote we just had was a unanimous vote for it. It said not \nto take tax relief out of the bill. We have had plenty of debate about \ntax relief--whether it is in the bill or not in the bill. This motion \nsays let's fix the bill and take out the hundreds of billions of \ndollars of taxes that will fall squarely on the middle class.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Crapo motion to commit is an attempt \nto kill health care reform. If it succeeds, we will keep 31 million \nAmericans from getting health care coverage. If it succeeds, it will \nkeep Americans from getting the tax cuts in the bill. If the motion \nsucceeds, over the next 10 years, Americans will get $441 billion less \nin tax credits to buy health insurance.\n  I urge that we not vote in favor of the Crapo motion, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relationship to \namendment No. 2793, as modified, offered by the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this amendment is about fair pricing for \nprescription drugs for the American people. A colleague of mine just \ncame up to me and said: My daughter takes Nexium. It costs her $1,000 a \nmonth. I said: I happen to have a chart about Nexium here. This \nillustrates better than I know how to illustrate the difference in \npricing.\n  Here is what Nexium costs: $424 worth of Nexium in the United States \nis sold for $40 in Great Britain, $36 in Spain, $37 in Germany, $67 in \nFrance. If you like this kind of pricing where the American people pay \nthe highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, if you like \nthis kind of pricing, then you ought to vote against this amendment. \nBut this amendment is bipartisan--Republicans and Democrats. Over 30 \nMembers of this Senate have supported this approach, saying let's \nprovide fair pricing for a change for the American people.\n  We should not be paying the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. All I ask is that you support this amendment to \ngive the American people the opportunity for fair pricing for a change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to oppose the Dorgan amendment. \nLet's be clear, there are those who want to deminimize safety. But the \none entity in this country that is responsible for the food and drugs \nis the FDA, and Commissioner Hamburg has mentioned in her letter all of \nthe potential risks of the Dorgan amendment.\n  Secondly, we have heard about the European Union as an example why we \nshould permit reimportation. What did we hear from the European \nCommunity last week? In 2 months, they seized 34 million fake tablets \nat customs points in all member countries, and this was beyond their \ngreatest fears.\n  Thirdly, how do we create affordability? By closing the doughnut \nhole. And this amendment will not do that, it will undermine that.\n  And finally, Senator Lautenberg's amendment, which comes up after \nthis amendment, is the one that permits reimportation but takes care of \nthe safety issues that the FDA has said are critical.\n  We want to make sure when you buy Nexium that what you get is the \nsubstance and the quality and the quantity that you want, not something \nless that can undermine your health care. Vote against the Dorgan \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n48. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3156\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3156, \noffered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this is a simple solution to a \ncomplicated problem. My amendment contains the Dorgan amendment. The \nwork done by our friend from North Dakota is significant. But what it \ndid not have is a guarantee, as much as possible, that the product was \nsafe; that there were no counterfeits, that there were no mixtures of \nthings that might not work well with other drugs.\n  My amendment adds a simple requirement that imported drugs be \ncertified as safe by the Health and Human Services Secretary. I hope we \nwill be able to pass this, which will include the Dorgan amendment, to \nmake sure the products that get here are safe, no matter what the price \nwill be. If it is not safe, it is worthless. We want to be sure every \nproduct that reaches our shore is safe to take and will be sold at a \nmore reasonable cost.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have long supported measures that \nallow Montanans to buy safe and effective drugs from foreign countries. \nThis is why I support the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Currently, the Food and Drug Administration is required to review the \nsafety and effectiveness of domestically produced drugs. FDA is also \nrequired to ensure the safety and effectiveness of legally imported \ndrugs. Through FDA's robust inspection and other regulatory compliance \nactivities, consumers can have a high degree of confidence in the \nquality of the drugs.\n  The Lautenberg amendment allows importation of drugs manufactured \noutside the United States and includes\n\n[[Page S13239]]\n\nnumerous protective measures in addition to these activities. These \nmeasures address the health and safety risks of importing foreign \ndrugs.\n  Most importantly, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to certify that the imported drugs do not pose any additional \nrisk to the public's health and safety and create savings for American \nconsumers.\n  With recent increased awareness of potentially dangerous food and \ndrug products, it is more important than ever to protect American \nconsumers.\n  This amendment ensures that consumers are protected from the risk of \nunsafe drugs. And it ensures Americans have access to consistent, \nreliable medicines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we have all seen this movie before. We \nhave had these votes before. All I say is this: The pharmaceutical \nindustry flexes its muscles and defeats an attempt for fair \nprescription drug prices for the American people so we can keep paying \nthe highest prices in the world. And then there is another amendment \noffered that makes it seem like something is being done when, in fact, \nnothing is going to be done, nothing will change.\n  Do not vote for this amendment and go home and say you have done \nsomething about the price of prescription drugs because your \nconstituents will know better. This amendment does nothing. If you \nbelieve, at the end of the evening, we should do nothing, by all means \nvote for it. Don't count me in on that vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

On this vote the yeas are 56, the nays are 43. \nUnder the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this \namendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President I have a motion at the desk, and I ask \nthat it be brought forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 3590 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with \n     changes to align the effective dates of all taxes, fees, \n     and tax increases levied by such bill so that no such tax, \n     fee, or increase take effect until such time as the major \n     insurance coverage provisions of the bill, including the \n     insurance exchanges, have begun. The Committee is further \n     instructed to maintain the deficit neutrality of the bill \n     over the 10-year budget window.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a motion that Senator Thune \nand I are putting forward. It is a very simple motion. A lot of people \ndon't realize that the taxes in the bill we are discussing actually \nstart in about 3 weeks. They start in January of 2010. The effect of \nthe bill, whatever the proposals are going to be in the bill, whatever \nprograms are available, will not come into play until 2014. The taxes \nwill start this next year, and they will be paid for 4 years before any \nof the programs the bill is supposed to put forward will be there. The \nmotion Senator Thune and I put forward merely says that taxes start \nbeing collected when the bill is implemented. So whatever programs are \nbeing offered to the people, whatever insurance programs, whatever \nkinds of benefits there might be in the bill would start at the same \ntime as the taxes start. So you are not going to be paying taxes before \nyou have any options that you would be able to take in this bill.\n  It is simple. It is clear. We believe that if you pay taxes for 4 \nyears before you see any of the programs in this bill, the American \npeople can't be sure there will ever be a program, because there will \nbe intervening Congresses and intervening Presidential elections that \nwill occur before this bill is designed to start in 2014. We have \ncongressional elections in 2010. We have a Presidential election plus \ncongressional elections in 2012. And 2 years following that, 2014, is \nwhen this bill will be implemented.\n  I hope everyone will look at this motion and support the amendment we \nare putting forward. It is a motion to commit the bill to fix this \nissue, that America should not be looking at higher drug prices, higher \nmedical device prices, and higher costs of insurance, all of which are \nthe first taxes that will take effect.\n  Let's walk through it. Starting next year in January, 3 weeks from \ntoday, there will be $22 billion in taxes on prescription drug \nmanufacturers that will start. The price of prescription drugs, \naspirin, anything that people take will go up because the drug \nmanufacturers are going to start paying a tax. There is $19 billion in \ntaxes on medical device manufacturers. So medical devices we use, \nhearing aids, things we use to treat ailments will be taxed to the tune \nof $19 billion next January. There is $60 billion on insurance \ncompanies starting next month. That is about $100 billion in taxes that \nstart in about 3 weeks. So the insurance companies have probably \nalready priced in the negotiations that they are having now with people \nabout their insurance premiums. I am sure they realize that they are \ngoing to have to be locked in for a year or two or three and, \ntherefore, these rises in insurance premiums are probably part of this \nbill we are dealing with right now. And $60 billion will be passed on \nto every person who has health care coverage right now.\n  Here we are, health care reform that is supposed to bring down the \nprice of health care so that more people can afford it. And what is the \nfirst thing we do? It is not to offer a plan. It is not to offer any \nkind of program that would help people who are struggling right now \nbecause they don't have insurance. It is certainly not going to help \npeople struggling to pay their prescription drug prices. We are going \nto raise the price by taxing the manufacturers of drugs, of medical \ndevices, and the companies that are giving insurance today.\n  It is time that we talk about the high taxes in this bill. What we \nare going to talk about in the Hutchison-Thune proposal, the motion to \ncommit, is to say at the very least, the least we can do is not ask \npeople to pay taxes for 4 years when you are going to have three \nintervening congressional elections before this bill takes effect. \nThings could change mightily. All these taxes that are going to go into \nplace might never bring forward the proposals that are in the \nunderlying bill.\n  In 2013, 1 year before the bill is to take effect, the taxes on high \nbenefit plans go into effect. What is a high benefit plan? A high \nbenefit plan is one that is a good plan. Many unions have these, and \nmany people who work for\n\n[[Page S13240]]\n\nbig corporations have everything paid for. They have all of the \nemployer regular, in the order that most companies do, payments, but \nthey also allow in these plans to have most of the deductibles also \npaid for. They are very good plans. This bill will excise for those \nplans $149 billion, cut it right out and have an excise tax on those \ngood plans, $149 billion. That starts in 2013. That is 1 year before \nthe bill takes effect.\n\n  In 2013, 1 year before there is any new plan put forward, those who \nhave very good coverage--whether it be someone who works for a big \ncompany or whether it is a union member--will start getting a 40-\npercent tax on that benefit. So all of the things that have been \nnegotiated are going to have a big 40-percent tax. That starts in 2013.\n  In addition, in 2013, 1 year before the bill takes effect, there is a \nlimitation put on itemized deductions for medical expenses. Today, if \nyou spend more than 7.5 percent of your income on medical expenses, you \nget to deduct everything over that. So if you have a catastrophic \naccident or you have a very expensive disease to treat or you are in a \nclinical trial--something that is expensive--if you go above 7.5 \npercent of your income, you can deduct that. In 2013, under the bill \nthat is before us, you would have to spend 10 percent of your income \nbefore you could deduct those expenses. That is another $15 billion \nthat will be collected in taxes that are not collected today.\n  The new Medicare payroll tax, which impacts individuals who earn over \n$200,000 or couples who earn $125,000 each, would take effect in 2013. \nThat is $54 billion in taxes.\n  These are all the taxes that take effect before the bill does, before \nthere is any plan offered. You would have the tax that starts next \nmonth on insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and medical \ndevice companies. Then, in 2013, you would have a tax on high-benefit \nplans, a 40-percent tax on that plan. Then, in 2013, the itemized \ndeductions will not be allowed until you have paid 10 percent of your \nsalary in medical expenses. Then there is the Medicare payroll tax, \nwhich is going to impact individuals. All of this is before there is a \nprogram in place.\n  In 2014, when the bill does come forward so there are plans to be \noffered to people, then you start the mandates on employers and the \ntaxes if people are not covered. So you have $28 billion in taxes on \nemployers that start in 2014. These are the employers who cannot afford \nto give health care to their employees or they do not give the right \nkind of health care to their employees, so it is not the right \npercentage, and if it is not the right percentage, then the employer \npays a fee of $750 to $3,000 per employee. That is their fine.\n  Then there is the tax on individuals who do not have health \ninsurance, and that is $750 per adult.\n  My colleague from South Dakota and I will certainly want to spend \nmore time talking about this and hope very much that our colleagues \nwill also. I do not think this is what the American people thought they \nwould be getting in health care reform. Of course, what we would hope \nthe American people would get in health care reform would be lower cost \noptions that do not require a big government plan. They would not \nrequire big taxes. They would not require big fees. If we had a \nlowering of the cost, by allowing small businesses to have bigger risk \npools, that would not cost anything. It would allow bigger risk pools \nthat would provide lower premiums and employers would be able to offer \nmore to their employees.\n  Most employers want to offer health care to their employees. It is \njust a matter of the expense. The bill we are debating now is going to \nput more expenses and burdens on employers, at the time when we are \nasking them to hire more people to get us out of this recession.\n  Everywhere I go in Texas, when I am on an airplane, when I am in a \nstore, a grocery store--I have not been able to do any Christmas \nshopping, I must admit, so I have not been in a department store, but \nnevertheless I do go to the grocery store--everyone who I am talking to \nis saying: I can't afford this. What are you all doing? And I am \nsaying, of course: Well, we are trying to stop this because we agree \nwith you that small businesspeople cannot afford this.\n  I was a small businessperson. I know how hard it is because we do not \nhave the margins of big business, and it is very hard to make ends meet \nwhen you have all the mandates and the taxes, and when you are trying \nto increase your business and hire people, which is what we want them \nto do. You cannot do it if you are burdened with more and more \nexpenses, as this bill will do.\n  What Senator Thune and I are doing is making a motion to commit this \nbill back with instructions, to come back with the changes that will \nassure that when the implementation of this bill starts, that will \ntrigger whatever programs are in the bill at the same time as whatever \ntaxes and fees are going to be in this bill.\n  I would hope there would be fewer taxes and fees. But whatever your \nview is on that issue, it is a matter of simple fairness that you would \nnot start the taxes before you start the implementation of the program. \nIt would be like saying: I want to buy a house, and the realtor says: \nWell, fine, you can start paying for the house right now, and in 4 \nyears you will be able to move in. The house might be stricken by \nlightning. It might fall apart. It might blow up. It might have a fire. \nAnd that is exactly what could happen in this bill.\n  This bill may not make it for 4 years, when people see what is in it. \nThere will be elections, and I cannot imagine we would establish a \npolicy of taxing people for 4 years, raising costs, leading down this \npath that will eventually go to a public plan that will end up doing \nwhat was originally introduced in the bill; and that is, to end up with \none public plan. It will take a little longer the way the bill is being \nreconfigured, but it is going to end up in the same place, unless we \ncan stop it by showing people that the mandates and the taxes are not \ngood for our economy and they are not good for the health care system \nwe know in this country.\n  We have choices in this country. We have the ability to decide who \nour doctor is and what insurance coverage we want, whether we want a \nhigh deductible or a low deductible. That is not a choice that should \nbe taxed. We should not have someone tell us what procedures we can \nhave. We should have the option of deciding that for ourselves with our \ndoctors. That is what we want in health care reform. But that is not \nwhat is in the bill before us.\n  I hope we can discuss the Hutchison-Thune motion to commit. We are \ngoing to work to try to make sure everyone knows we want fairness in \nthis bill and that people know what is in it. I hope we will get \nwhatever the new version of the bill is very soon so we will have a \nchance to see if maybe there are some changes that are being made. But \nin the bill before us, the taxes start next month, and the bill is \nimplemented in 2014. On its face, that is fundamentally unfair. I hope \nour motion is adopted so we can change it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about health care \ncosts. We began this endeavor to fix our broken health care system a \nyear ago for two reasons: to move toward universal coverage, and to \nreduce the unacceptably high cost of health care that is threatening to \nruin our country.\n  It is vital that in our quest to cut costs, we do not leave money on \nthe table that could be going back into the pockets of the American \npeople. This process is not over and while we still have time, we need \nto more strongly address the rising costs of prescription drugs. The \ncost of brand-name drugs rose nine percent last year. That is an \nunprecedented, unacceptable hike. In contrast, the cost of generic \ndrugs fell by nearly nine percent over the same time period.\n  For years, we have tried to make it easier for Americans to have \naccess to affordable drugs. We have worked to ease the backlog of \ngeneric drug applications at the FDA. We support comparative \neffectiveness studies and academic detailing to diminish the influence \nof brand-name drug manufacturers. And we must continue to break down \nthe barriers to help generic drug companies get their products on the \nmarket.\n  Therefore it is imperative that we pass legislation to fight the \nbackroom deals between brand name drug companies and generic drug \ncompanies that keep generics off the market and out of reach for \nconsumers. The Kohl-Grassley amendment to stop what we call\n\n[[Page S13241]]\n\nthese ``reverse payments'' is based on a bill that was passed with \nbipartisan support by the Judiciary Committee last month, and I thank \nSenator Grassley for working together with me on it.\n  Let me be clear about what these deals are: brandname drug companies \npay generic drug companies--their competition to not sell their \nproducts. The brandname drug companies win because they get rid of the \ncompetition. Generic drug companies win because they get paid without \nhaving to manufacture a product. And consumers lose because they have \nbeen robbed of a competitive marketplace.\n  How much do American consumers lose in these backroom deals? Thirty-\nfive billion dollars over 10 years, according to the Federal Trade \nCommission. And the Congressional Budget Office estimates these \nanticompetitive deals cost the Federal Government nearly $2 billion on \ntop of that, because we end up paying more for branded drugs through \nMedicare and Medicaid. We cannot afford to leave this money on the \ntable, and our bill--which we hope will be included in the final health \nreform legislation--will make sure we do not.\n  We are pleased that the current bill includes a provision that \nSenator Grassley and I hope will slow the rising cost of drugs and \nmedical devices. Our policy aims to make transparent the influence that \nindustry gifts and payments to doctors may have on medical care. As we \nlook to reform the health system, it is imperative that every dollar is \nspent wisely.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to end these \ncollusive drug company settlements and to find additional ways to \nreduce the cost of this bill. This proposal would save billions of \ndollars and reduce consumer costs by billions more. This is what we \nsaid we would do, and this is what we must do.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize that the rising \nhealth care costs plaguing our health care system are \ndisproportionately harming small business in South Dakota and across \nthe Nation. Over the last decade, health care costs have been rising \nfour times faster than wages, eating into the profits of small \nbusinesses and the pocketbooks of families. Many small businesses avoid \nhiring new employees because the cost of providing benefits is too \ngreat, and in some cases are forced to lay off employees or drop health \ncare coverage entirely.\n  A small business owner in northeastern South Dakota shared with me \nthe impact of rising health care costs on his business. He cited a \nstrong conviction and moral obligation to provide his employees and \ntheir families with benefits, including quality, affordable health \ninsurance. Despite his best intentions, rising health care costs are \nthreatening his ability to maintain those benefits.\n  As the employees of this small business aged and used more of their \nhealth benefits, the insurance company steadily raised rates 10 to 20 \npercent each year. When the rates were affordable the small business \nowner paid the full cost of premiums, but has since been forced to \nshift more and more of the costs onto his employees. If rates continue \nto rise, he is worried he will no longer be able to afford to offer any \ncoverage.\n  And he has concrete cause for concern. Current trends paint a bleak \npicture of future health care costs for all Americans, but they have \nparticular implications for small businesses. In 2000, employer-\nsponsored health insurance in the large group market for a family in \nSouth Dakota cost on average $6,760. In 2006, the same family health \ninsurance plan cost $9,875. That is a 72-percent increase in 6 years \nand, unless action is taken to alter this unsustainable course, it is \nprojected this same coverage will cost $16,971 in 2016. Because they \nlack bargaining leverage, small businesses pay on average 18 percent \nmore than larger businesses for the same health insurance. Despite \ntheir best intentions to provide quality, affordable benefits to their \nemployees, the unsustainable trends in our current health care system \nhave already forced many small businesses to make tough decisions.\n  The Senate health care reform bill addresses the main challenges \nfacing small businesses--affordability and choice. The Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act will increase quality, affordable \noptions in the small group market. The Small Business Health Options \nProgram, SHOP, Exchange will give small businesses the buying power \nthey need to get better deals and reduce administrative burdens. And \nsmall businesses providing health insurance to their employees will be \neligible for a tax credit to improve affordability. The bill will also \nend the discriminatory insurance industry practices in the small group \nmarket of jacking up premiums by up to 200 percent because an employee \ngets sick or older, or because the business hired a woman.\n  The Senate health reform bill will give a new measure of security to \nthose with health insurance and extend this security to more than 30 \nmillion Americans who are currently uninsured. It will lower premiums, \nprotect jobs and benefits, and help small businesses grow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, a few of my friends \non the other side made some assertions about congressional history, \nfiscal policy, and the role of bipartisan tax relief for the period of \n2001-2006. The speakers were the distinguished junior Senators from \nVermont, Ohio, and Minnesota. They are all passionate Members. They are \narticulate voices of the progressive, as they term it, or very liberal \nwing, as those of us on this side term it, portion of the Senate \nDemocratic Caucus.\n  I respect the passion they bring to their views. But, as one of them \nhas said frequently in his early months of Senate service, we are \nentitled to our opinions, but not entitled to our own facts. I couldn't \nagree more with that notion. In order to insure an intellectually \nhonest standard of debate, both sides need to correct the record when \nthey feel the other side has misstated the facts. It is in that spirit \nthat I respond today.\n  I won't take this time to debate the merits of the surtax that they \npropose as a substitute revenue raiser in this bill. That can wait till \nwe debate their amendment. I am going to focus on their assertions \nabout recent fiscal history and the role of bipartisan tax relief.\n  Before I address the revisionist fiscal history we heard, I would \nlike to set the record straight on congressional history.\n  It was said yesterday afternoon that there were 8 years of a George \nW. Bush administration and Republican Congress. If the Members making \nthese assertions would go back and check the records of the Senate, \nthey would find that during that 8-year period Republicans controlled \nthe Senate when it was evenly divided for a little over 5 months. For \nalmost half the month of January 2001, Democrats held the majority \nbecause outgoing Vice President Gore broke ties. For the balance of the \nperiod from January 20, 2001, through June 6, 2001, the Senate was \nevenly divided, but Republicans held because of Vice President Cheney's \ntie breaking vote.\n  On June 6, 2001, the Democrats regained the majority when Senator \nJeffords, previously a Republican, began caucusing with Senate \nDemocrats. For the balance of 2001, 2002, and in early 2003, Democrats \nheld the majority.\n  For two Congresses, half of President Bush's term, Republicans held a \nmajority. For the last 2 years of the George W. Bush Presidency, \nDemocrats controlled both Houses of Congress.\n  When you add it up, with the exception of a little over 4 months when \nthe Senate was equally divided, Democrats controlled the Senate for \nabout half the period of the George W. Bush administration.\n  When you hear some of our friends on the other side debate recent \nfiscal history, these basic facts regarding political power and \naccountability are obscured. Perhaps it is their opinion that Democrats \nwere not exercising majority power during that period, but the fact is \nthat Democrats controlled the Senate for almost half the period of the \nGeorge W. bush administration.\n  Now let's turn to the fiscal history assertions from my friends on \nthe other side. The revisionist history basically boils down to two \nconclusions:\n  1. That all of the bipartisan tax relief enacted during that period \nwas skewed to the top 1 percent or top two-tenths of 1 percent of \ntaxpayers; and\n  2. That all of the ``bad'' fiscal history of this decade to date is \nattributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans.\n\n[[Page S13242]]\n\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally \noppose tax relief and support tax increases. The same crew generally \nsupport spending increases and oppose spending cuts.\n  On the first point, two of the three speakers from the other side \nvoted for the conference report for fiscal year 2010 budget resolution. \nThe third speaker was not a Member of this body at that time the \nconference report was adopted. I am not aware, however, of his \nopposition to that budget which was drawn up by the Senate Democratic \nCaucus.\n  That budget was similar to President Obama's first budget. A core \nportion of that budget, much ballyhooed by the Democratic leadership, \nwas an extension of the major portion of the bipartisan tax relief \nenacted during the period of 2001-2006. As a matter of fact, roughly 80 \npercent of the revenue loss from that legislation, much criticized by \nthe three speakers yesterday afternoon, is contained in the budget that \ntwo of them voted for. Eighty percent is usually a pretty fair \nendorsement of any policy. Again, I have not heard the third speaker, \nthe junior Senator from Minnesota, indicate that he doesn't support the \ntax relief included in the Democratic budget. Perhaps I missed \nsomething. In addition, the three speakers need to pay attention to \nanalyses from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  If they did examine those analyses, they would find that, in terms of \nthe burden of taxation, the 2001 legislation redistributed the burden \nfrom lower income taxpayers to higher income taxpayers.\n  Now, I turn to the second fiscal revisionist history point. That \npoint is that all of the ``bad'' fiscal history of this decade to date \nis attributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans.\n  In the debate so far, many on this side have pointed out some key, \nundeniable facts. We agree with the President on one key fact. The \nPresident inherited a big deficit and a lot of debt.\n  The antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts, and \nthe TARP activities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.2 \ntrillion. That was on the President's desk when he took over the Oval \nOffice on January 20, 2009. That is the highest deficit, as a \npercentage of the economy, in Post World War II history.\n  Not a pretty fiscal picture. And, as predicted several months ago, \nthat fiscal picture got a lot uglier with the $787 billion stimulus \nbill. So for the folks who saw that bill as an opportunity to \n``recover'' America with government taking a larger share of the \neconomy over the long term, I say congratulations.\n  For those who voted for the stimulus bill, including two of the three \nspeakers to which I refer, they put us on the path to a bigger role for \nthe government. Over a trillion dollars of new deficit spending was \nhidden in that bill. The Congressional Budget Office concluded that the \npermanent fiscal impact of that bill totaled over $2.5 trillion over 10 \nyears. It caused some of the extra red ink. Supporters of that bill \nneed to own up to the fiscal course they charted.\n  Now, to be sure, after the other side pushed through the stimulus \nbill and the second half of the $700 billion of TARP money, CBO \nreestimated the baseline. A portion of this new red ink, upfront, is \ndue to that reestimate.\n  The bottom line, however, is that reestimate occurred several weeks \nafter the President and robust Democratic majorities took over the \ngovernment. Decisions were made and the fiscal consequences followed.\n  Some on the other side who raises this point about the March CBO \nreestimate. That is fine. But, if they were to be consistent and \nintellectually honest, then they would have to acknowledge the CBO \nreestimate that occurred in 2001 after President Bush took office. The \nsurplus went south because of economic conditions. The $5.6 trillion \nnumber so often quoted by those on the other side was illusory.\n  The three members should go back and take a look at what CBO said at \nthe time. According to CBO, for the first relevant fiscal year, the tax \ncut represented barely 14 percent of the total change in the budget. \nFor instance, for the same period, increased appropriations outranked \nthe tax cut by $6 billion. So, spending above baseline, together with \nlower projected revenues, accounted for 86 percent of the change in the \nbudget picture. Let me repeat that. Bipartisan tax relief was a \nminimal, 14-percent factor, in the change in the budget situation.\n  Over the long term, the tax cut was projected to account for 45 \npercent of the change in the budget picture. Stated another way, the \n10-year surplus declined from $5.6 trillion to $1.6 trillion. Of that \n$4.0 trillion change, the tax cut represented about $1.7 trillion of \nthe decline.\n  Let's take a look at the fiscal history before the financial meltdown \nhit. That conclusion is, again, in this decade, all fiscal problems are \nattributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001, 2003, 2004, \nand 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office. He inherited an economy \nthat was careening downhill. Investment started to go flat in 2000. The \ntech-fueled stock market bubble was bursting. Then came the economic \nshocks of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  Add in the corporate scandals to that economic environment. And it is \ntrue, as fiscal year 2001 came to close, the projected surplus turned \nto a deficit. I referred to the net effects of some of these unforeseen \nevents on the projected $5.6 trillion surplus.\n  Now, yesterday afternoon's three speakers may so oppose bipartisan \ntax relief that they want to attribute all fiscal problems to the tax \nrelief. The official scorekeepers show the facts to be different.\n  Those on this side of the aisle have a different view than the \nrevisionists. In just the right time, the 2001 tax relief plan started \nto kick in. The fiscal facts show as the tax relief hits its full force \nin 2003, the deficits grew smaller. They grew smaller in amount. They \ngrew smaller as a percentage of the economy. This pattern continued up \nthrough 2007.\n  If my comments were meant to be partisan shots, I could say this \nfavorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from \n6 months in 2001, where Republicans controlled the White House and the \nCongress.\n  But, unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying to make \nany partisan points. I am just trying to get to the fiscal facts.\n  So, let's get the fiscal history right.\n  In this decade, deficits went down after the tax relief plans were \nput in full effect. Deficits did start to trend back up after the \nfinancial meltdown hit. I doubt the fiscal history revisionists who \nspoke yesterday would say that bipartisan tax relief was the cause of \nthe financial meltdown. So, aside from that unrelated bad macroeconomic \ndevelopment, the trend line showed revenues on the way back up.\n  But that is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what \nis most important is the future. People in our States send us here to \ndeal with future policy. This budget debate should not be about \nDemocrats flogging Republicans and vice-versa. The people don't send us \nhere to flog one another, like partisan cartoon cut-out characters, \nover past policies. They don't send us here to endlessly point fingers \nof blame. Now, let's focus on the fiscal consequences of the budget \nthat is before the Senate.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring the campaign. I'd like to take a quote from the President's \nnomination acceptance speech:\n\n       We need a President who can face the threats of the future, \n     not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n\n  President Obama was right.\n  We need a President, and I would add Congressmen and Senators, who \ncan face the threats of the future. The legislation before us, as \ncurrently written, poses considerable threats to our fiscal future. It \nis too important to dodge. It is a bill that restructures one-sixth of \nthe economy. It affects all of us and, more importantly, all of our \nconstituents.\n  Grasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game will \nnot deal with the threats to our fiscal future. Let's face the honest \nfiscal facts. Let's not revise fiscal history as we start this critical \ndebate about the fiscal choices ahead of us. The people who send us \nhere have a right to expect nothing less of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13242-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13242-S13243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I know we are in the middle of a health \ncare debate and I know we are focused on health care and we will be \ntalking about that for several days, but I rise to congratulate the \npeople of Washington State and the country on the 787 Dreamliner flight \nthat took off from Paine Field, WA, just a few hours ago. Some people \nmight think of that as just going to YouTube and looking at the video \nand seeing a plane take off and what is the significance. I tell you, \nthere is great significance, not just for the State of Washington but \nfor the country because this plane is a unique plane. It is a game \nchanger as far as the market is concerned. But it is American \ninnovation at its best. This plane, built now with 50 percent composite \nmaterials, is going to be a 20-percent more fuel-efficient plane. That \nis significant for our country. It is significant because it means the \nUnited States can still be a leader in manufacturing and it can still \ndeal with something as complex as fuel efficiency in aviation.\n  What is prideful for us as Americans is, this is about American \ninnovation at its best. What would Bill Boeing say about today? He \nwould say we achieved another milestone, where we faced international \ncompetition. Yet the United States can still be a manufacturer. We can \nstill build a product, still compete, and still win because we are \ninnovating with aviation.\n  To the thousands of workers in the Boeing Company and in Puget Sound \nI say: Congratulations for your hard work--for the planning and \nimplementation of taking manufacturing from aerospace with aluminum \nthat had been the status quo for decades, to developing an entirely new \nplane, 50 percent with the new material.\n  I want the United States to continue to be a manufacturer, to still \nbuild products, to still say we can compete. So I applaud the name \nDreamliner. Somebody in that company had a dream, and today it got \nlaunched when it took off from that runway. I wish to say that is the \ninnovative spirit that has made this country great and that is the \ninnovative spirit in which we need to invest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13243-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13243-S13244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HUMAN RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nHuman Rights Enforcement Act of 2009, which the U.S. Senate approved \nunanimously on November 21, 2009, and which the House of \nRepresentatives will consider today. This narrowly tailored, bipartisan \nlegislation would make it easier for the Justice Department to hold \naccountable human rights abusers who seek safe haven in our country.\n  I would like to thank the lead Republican cosponsor of the Human \nRights Enforcement Act, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. This bill is a \nproduct of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Human Rights and \nthe Law. I am the Chairman of this Subcommittee and Senator Coburn is \nits ranking member. I also want to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman \nPat Leahy of Vermont and Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland for \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  For decades, the United States has led the fight for human rights \naround the world. Over 60 years ago, following the Holocaust, we led \nthe efforts to prosecute Nazi perpetrators at the Nuremberg trials. We \nhave also supported the prosecution of human rights crimes before the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the Special Court for \nSierra Leone.\n  The world watches our efforts to hold accountable perpetrators of \nmass atrocities closely. When we bring human rights violators to \njustice, foreign governments are spurred into action, victims take \nheart, and future perpetrators think twice. However, when human rights \nviolators are able to live freely in our country, America's credibility \nas a human rights leader is undermined.\n  Throughout our history, America has provided sanctuary to victims of \npersecution. Sadly, some refugees arrive from distant shores to begin a \nnew life, only to encounter those who tortured them or killed their \nloved ones.\n  Two years ago, the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee heard \ncompelling testimony from Dr. Juan Romagoza, who endured a 22-day \nordeal of torture at the hands of the National Guard in El Salvador. \nDr. Romagoza received asylum in our country but later learned that two \ngenerals who were responsible for his torture had also fled to the \nUnited States. We also learned that our government was investigating \nover 1,000 suspected human rights violators from almost 90 countries \nwho were in the United States.\n  The Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee has worked to ensure our \ngovernment has the necessary authority and resources to bring \nperpetrators to justice and to vindicate the rights of people like Dr. \nRomagoza.\n  In the last Congress, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law \nheld hearings which identified loopholes in the law that hinder \neffective human rights enforcement. In order to close some of these \nloopholes and make it easier to prosecute human rights abuses, Senator \nCoburn and I introduced the Genocide Accountability Act, the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act and the Trafficking in Persons \nAccountability Act, legislation passed unanimously by Congress and \nsigned into law by President George W. Bush that denies safe haven in \nthe United States to perpetrators of genocide, child soldier \nrecruitment and use, and human trafficking.\n  We also examined the U.S. government agencies which bear \nresponsibility for investigating human rights abusers and how to \nincrease the likelihood that human rights violators will be held \naccountable.\n  There are two offices in the Justice Department's Criminal Division \nwith jurisdiction over human rights violations. The first, the Office \nof Special Investigations, also known as OSI, which was established by \nAttorney General Richard Civiletti in 1979, has led the way in \ninvestigating, denaturalizing and removing World War II-era \nparticipants in genocide and other Nazi crimes. I want to commend OSI \nfor its outstanding work tracking down and bringing to justice Nazi war \ncriminals who have found safe haven in our country. Since 1979, OSI has \nsuccessfully prosecuted 107 Nazis.\n  Just this year, OSI deported John Demjanjuk to Germany, where he is \non trial for his involvement in the murder of more than 29,000 people \nat the Sobibor extermination camp in Nazi-\n\n[[Page S13244]]\n\noccupied Poland. Demjanjuk came to the United States in 1952 and lived \nin Seven Hills, OH. During World War II, Demjanjuk allegedly served as \na guard at a number of concentration camps. Lanny Breuer, the Assistant \nAttorney General of the Criminal Division, said, ``The removal to \nGermany of John Demjanjuk is an historic moment in the federal \ngovernment's efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. Mr. \nDemjanjuk, a confirmed former Nazi death camp guard, denied to \nthousands the very freedoms he enjoyed for far too long in the United \nStates.''\n  In 2004, Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy's Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act, enacted as part of the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act, further strengthened the Office of Special \nInvestigations by statutorily authorizing it and expanding its \njurisdiction to include serious human rights crimes committed after \nWorld War II.\n  The Domestic Security Section, which was established more recently, \nprosecutes major human rights violators and has jurisdiction over the \ncriminal laws relating to torture, genocide, war crimes, and the use or \nrecruitment of child soldiers. In 2008, the Domestic Security Section \nand the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of \nFlorida obtained the first federal conviction for a human rights \noffense against Chuckie Taylor, son of former Liberian president \nCharles Taylor, for committing torture in Liberia when he served as the \nhead of the Anti-Terrorist Unit. Taylor and other Anti-Terrorist Unit \nmembers engaged in horrific acts of torture, including shocking victims \nwith an electric device and burning victims with molten plastic, lit \ncigarettes, scalding water, candle wax and an iron. Then-Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey said, ``Today's conviction provides a measure \nof justice to those who were victimized by the reprehensible acts of \nCharles Taylor Jr. and his associates. It sends a powerful message to \nhuman rights violators around the world that, when we can, we will hold \nthem fully accountable for their crimes.''\n\n  The Human Rights Enforcement Act would seek to build on the important \nwork carried out by the Office of Special Investigations and the \nDomestic Security Section by creating a new streamlined human rights \nsection in the Criminal Division. My bill would combine the Office of \nSpecial Investigations, which has significant experience in \ninvestigating and denaturalizing human rights abusers, with the \nDomestic Security Section, which has broad jurisdiction over human \nrights crimes. Consolidating these two sections would allow limited law \nenforcement resources to be used more effectively and ensure that one \nsection in the Justice Department has the necessary expertise and \njurisdiction to prosecute or denaturalize perpetrators of serious human \nrights crimes.\n  This consolidation will also enable more effective collaboration \nbetween the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Immigration and Customs Enforcement in identifying, \nprosecuting, and removing human rights violators from the United \nStates. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been at the forefront \nof the federal government's efforts to bring war criminals to justice \nand is currently handling over 1,000 human rights removal cases \ninvolving suspects from about 95 countries.\n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department have \ncomplementary jurisdiction over human rights violations and partner \nclosely in their efforts to hold accountable human rights violators. In \nsome instances, where prosecution for a substantive human rights \ncriminal offense is not possible, Immigration and Customs Enforcement \ncan bring immigration charges. For example, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement recently filed administrative charges against the two El \nSalvadoran generals who are responsible for the torture of Dr. \nRomagoza, which took place before the enactment of legislation \nprohibiting torture in the United States.\n  With the creation of a new streamlined human rights section in the \nCriminal Division of the Justice Department, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement will have a stronger partner in the Justice Department to \ncollaborate with on human rights violator law enforcement issues. This \nbill would require the Attorney General to consult with the Secretary \nof Homeland Security as appropriate, which means the Attorney General \nshall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on cases that \nimplicate the Department of Homeland Security's jurisdiction and \ncompetencies.\n  The consolidation of the two sections in the Criminal Division of the \nJustice Department with jurisdiction over human rights violations would \nnot affect or change Immigration and Customs Enforcement's existing \njurisdiction over human rights violators. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement will continue to have primary authority for removing human \nrights violators from the United States through the immigration courts.\n  At a hearing of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee on October \n6, 2009, the Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nexpressed strong support for combining the Office of Special \nInvestigations and the Domestic Security Section. However, since the \nOffice of Special Investigations is statutorily authorized, the Justice \nDepartment needs Congressional authorization to move forward on merging \nthese two sections.\n  The Human Rights Enforcement Act also includes a number of technical \nand conforming amendments, including: 1) technical changes to the \ncriminal law on genocide (18 U.S.C. 1091) that the Justice Department \nrequested in 2007 to make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of \ngenocide; 2) clarifying that the immigration provisions of the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act apply to offenses committed before the \nbill's enactment; 3) a conforming amendment to the Immigration and \nNationality Act required by the enactment of the Genocide \nAccountability Act; and 4) a conforming amendment to the material \nsupport statute, made necessary by the enactment of the Genocide \nAccountability Act and the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, making it \nillegal to provide material support to genocide and the use or \nrecruitment of child soldiers. These technical changes will facilitate \nthe government's ability to prosecute perpetrators who commit genocide \nor use child soldiers.\n  Dr. Juan Romagoza survived horrible human rights abuses, and had the \ncourage to flee his home and find sanctuary in the United States, where \nhe became an American and made great contributions to our country. We \nowe it to Dr. Romagoza, and countless others like him, to ensure that \nAmerica does not provide safe haven to those who violate fundamental \nhuman rights. From John Demjanjuk, who helped massacre over 29,000 Jews \nduring World War II, to the Salvadoran generals responsible for \ntorturing Dr. Juan Romagoza, we have a responsibility to bring human \nrights violators to justice.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation and hope it \nwill be enacted into law soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13244-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13244-S13246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PENDING NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, two weeks ago, I challenged Senate \nRepublicans to do as well as Senate Democrats did in December 2001 when \nwe proceeded to confirm 10 of President Bush's nominees as Federal \njudges. Regrettably, my plea has been ignored. Senate Republicans are \nfailing the challenge. The Senate has been allowed to confirm only one \njudicial nominee all month. On December 1, after almost 6 weeks of \nunexplained delays, the Senate was allowed to consider the nomination \nof Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to fill a vacancy on the Federal Court for \nthe Central District of California. When finally considered, she was \nconfirmed unanimously by a vote of 97 to 0. Since then, not a single \njudicial nominee has been considered. It is now 2 weeks later, December \n15.\n  Judicial nominees have been and are available for consideration. This \nlack of action is no fault of the President. He has made quality \nnominations. They have had hearings and have been considered by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and favorably reported to the Senate. \nIndeed, the logjam has only grown over the last 2 weeks. Five \nadditional judicial nominations have been added to the Senate calendar \nsince December 1, bringing the total number of judicial nominations \nready for Senate action, yet delayed by Republican obstruction, to 12. \nOne has been ready for\n\n[[Page S13245]]\n\nSenate consideration for more than 13 weeks, another more than 10 \nweeks, and the list goes on. The majority leader and Democratic \nSenators have been ready to proceed. The Republican Senate leadership \nhas not.\n  There are now more judicial nominees awaiting confirmation on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar than have been confirmed since the \nbeginning of the Obama administration. Due to delays and obstruction by \nthe Republican minority, we have only been able to consider 10 judicial \nnominations to the Federal circuit and district courts all year, and \nfor one of them, although supported by the longest serving Republican \nin the Senate, we had to overcome a full-fledged filibuster led by the \nRepublican leadership. As a result, we will not only fall well short of \nthe total of 28 judicial confirmations the Democratic Senate majority \nworked to confirm in President Bush's first year in office, but we \nthreaten to achieve the lowest number of judicial confirmations in the \nfirst year of a new Presidency in modern history.\n  It is clear that the Republican leadership has returned to their \npractices in the 1990s, which resulted in more than doubling circuit \ncourt vacancies and led to the pocket filibuster of more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. The crisis they created eventually led \neven to public criticism of their actions by Chief Justice Rehnquist \nduring those years. Their delays this year may leave us well short even \nof their low point during President Clinton's first term, when the \nRepublican Senate majority would only allow 17 judicial confirmations \nduring the entire 1996 session. That was a Presidential election year \nand the end of President Clinton's first term. By contrast, this is \njust the first year of the Obama administration.\n  We need to act on the judicial nominees on the Senate Executive \nCalendar without further delay. This year, we have witnessed \nunprecedented delays in the consideration of qualified and \nnoncontroversial nominations. We have had to waste weeks seeking time \nagreements in order to consider nominations that were then confirmed \nunanimously. We have seen nominees strongly supported by their home \nState Senators, both Republican and Democratic, delayed for months and \nunsuccessfully filibustered.\n  The 12 judicial nominations that have been given hearings and \nfavorable consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee and that \nremain stalled before the Senate are Beverly Martin of Georgia, \nnominated to the Eleventh Circuit; Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey, \nnominated to the Third Circuit; Edward Chen, nominated to the District \nCourt for the Northern District of California; Dolly Gee, nominated to \nthe District Court for the Central District of California; Richard \nSeeborg, nominated to the District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia, Barbara Keenan of Virginia, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth Circuit; \nThomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third Circuit; Louis \nButler, nominated to the District Court for the Western District of \nWisconsin; Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second Circuit; \nRosanna Malouf Peterson, nominated to the District Court for the \nEastern District of Washington; and William Conley, nominated to the \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.\n  Acting on these nominations, we can confirm 13 nominees this month. \nIn December 2001, a Democratic Senate majority proceeded to confirm 10 \nof President Bush's nominees and ended that year having confirmed 28 \nnew judges nominated by a President of the other party. We achieved \nthose results with a controversial and confrontational Republican \nPresident after a midyear change to a Democratic majority in the \nSenate. We did so in spite of the attacks of September 11; despite the \nanthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate that closed our offices; and \nwhile working virtually around the clock on the PATRIOT Act for 6 \nweeks.\n  At the end of the Senate's 2001 session, only four judicial \nnominations were left on the Senate Executive Calendar, all of which \nwere confirmed soon after the Senate returned in 2002. At the end of \nthe first session of Congress during President Clinton's first term, \njust one judicial nominee was left on the Senate Executive Calendar. At \nthe end of the President George H.W. Bush's first year in office, a \nDemocratic Senate majority left just two judicial nominations pending \non the Senate Executive Calendar. At the end of the first year of \nPresident Reagan's first term--a year in which the Senate confirmed 41 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees--not a single \njudicial nomination was left on the Senate Executive Calendar.\n  In stark contrast, there are now 12 judicial nominees on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar and no agreement from Senate Republicans to consider \na single one. That is a significant change from our history and \ntradition of confirming judicial nominations that have been reported \nfavorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee by the end of a session.\n  The record of obstruction of the Senate Republicans is just as \ndisappointing when we consider the executive nominations that have been \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. There are currently 15 executive \nnominations that have been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, including \nnominations for Assistant Attorneys General to run three of the 11 \ndivisions at the Department of Justice. Each of these nominations has \nbeen pending 4 months or longer.\n  The President nominated Dawn Johnsen to lead the Office of Legal \nCounsel on February 11. Her nomination has been pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since March 19. That is the longest pending \nnomination on the calendar by over 2 months. We did not treat President \nBush's first nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel the same way. \nWe confirmed Jay Bybee to that post only 49 days after he was nominated \nby President Bush, and only 5 days after his nomination was reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mary Smith's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Tax Division has been pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar since June 11--more than 6 months. We confirmed President \nBush's first nomination to that position, Eileen O'Connor, only 57 days \nafter her nomination was made and 1 day after her nomination was \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her replacement, Nathan \nHochman, was confirmed without delay, just 34 days after his \nnomination.\n  Among the nominations still waiting for consideration is that of \nChristopher Schroeder, nominated on June 4 to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Legal Policy, OLP. Mr. Schroeder's nomination \nhas been pending before the Senate since July of this year when he was \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote and without \ndissent. There was no objection from the Republican members of the \ncommittee on his nomination, so it puzzles me why we cannot move to a \nvote.\n  President Bush appointed four Assistant Attorneys General for the \nOffice of Legal Policy. Each was confirmed expeditiously by the Senate. \nIn fact, his first nominee to that post, Viet Dinh, was confirmed by a \nvote of 96 to 1 just 1 month after he was nominated and only a week \nafter his nomination was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nProfessor Schroeder's nomination has been pending for over 4 months. \nPresident Bush's three subsequent nominees to head OLP--Daniel Bryant, \nRachel Brand, and Elisebeth Cook--were each confirmed by voice vote in \na shorter time than Professor Schroeder's nomination has been pending.\n  Senate Republicans should not further delay consideration of these \nimportant nominations.\n  Returning to judicial nominations, I hope that instead of withholding \nconsent and threatening filibusters of President Obama's nominees, \nSenate Republicans will treat President Obama's nominees fairly. I made \nsure that we treated President Bush's nominees more fairly than \nPresident Clinton's nominees had been treated. I want to continue that \nprogress, but we need Republican cooperation to do so. I urge them to \nturn away from their partisanship and begin to work with the President \nand the Senate majority leader.\n  President Obama has reached out and consulted with home State \nSenators\n\n[[Page S13246]]\n\nfrom both sides of the aisle regarding his judicial nominees. Instead \nof praising the President for consulting with Republican Senators, the \nSenate Republican leadership has doubled back on what they demanded \nwhen a Republican was in the White House. No more do they talk about \neach nominee being entitled to an up-or-down vote. That position is \nabandoned and forgotten. Instead, they now seek to filibuster and delay \njudicial nominations. When President Bush worked with Senators across \nthe aisle, I praised him and expedited consideration of his nominees. \nWhen President Obama reaches across the aisle, the Senate Republican \nleadership delays and obstructs his qualified nominees.\n  Although there have been nearly 110 judicial vacancies this year on \nour Federal circuit and district courts around the country, only 10 \nvacancies have been filled. That is wrong. The American people deserve \nbetter. As I have noted, there are 12 more qualified judicial \nnominations awaiting Senate action on the Senate Executive Calendar. \nAnother nomination should be considered by the Judiciary Committee this \nweek. I hope that with the session drawing to a close Judge Rogeriee \nThompson of Rhode Island will not be needlessly delayed. The Senate \nshould do better and could if Senate Republicans would remove their \nholds and stop the delaying tactics.\n  During President Bush's last year in office, we had reduced judicial \nvacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a Presidential election \nyear. As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked, and we \nwill start 2010 with the highest number of vacancies on article III \ncourts since 1994, when the vacancies created by the last comprehensive \njudgeship bill were still being filled. While it has been nearly 20 \nyears since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, judicial vacancies are \nnearing record levels, with 97 current vacancies and another 23 already \nannounced. If we had proceeded on the judgeship bill recommended by the \nU.S. Courts to address the growing burden on our Federal judiciary and \nprovide access to justice for all Americans, vacancies would stand at \n160, by far the highest on record. I know we can do better. Justice \nshould not be delayed or denied to any American because of overburdened \ncourts and the lack of Federal judges.\n  There is still time to act on these nominations before the Senate \nrecesses this year. I hope Senate Republicans will lift their \nobjections and allow us to proceed on the 27 nominations reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee. Absent cooperation to confirm nominations, \nthis Congress will be recorded in history as one of the least \nproductive in the confirmation of judicial nominations. I hope the New \nYear will bring a renewed spirit of cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13246-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECEIPT OF ASYLUM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to learn that, after 14 years \nof legal struggle, Ms. Rody Alvarado has finally received asylum in the \nUnited States. The details of Ms. Alvarado's case are shocking. She \nsuffered from horrific domestic violence in her home country of \nGuatemala and sought protection in the United States under our asylum \nlaws. Because persecution of this type had not previously been \nrecognized as a basis for refugee or asylum protection, Ms. Alvarado \nwas forced to fight a long legal battle to win her case.\n  The administrations of three different Presidents--Clinton, Bush and \nObama--have grappled with how to handle gender-based asylum claims, but \nthe resolution of this case brings us closer to the end of this \njourney. Ms. Alvarado can finally feel safe here in the United States \nbecause she is no longer at risk of being deported to Guatemala. The \nObama administration must now issue regulations to ensure that other \nvictims of domestic violence whose abuse rises to the level of \npersecution can obtain the same protection as refugees or asylees.\n  Ms. Alvarado fled Guatemala in 1995 after being beaten daily and \nraped repeatedly by her husband. When she became pregnant but refused \nto terminate her pregnancy, her husband kicked her repeatedly in the \nlower spine. Ms. Alvarado had previously tried to escape the abuse, \nseeking protection in another part of Guatemala, but her husband \ntracked her down and threatened to kill her if she left their home \nagain. We know that Ms. Alvarado notified Guatemalan police at least \nfive separate times, but the police refused to respond, telling her \nthat her desperate situation was a domestic dispute that needed to be \nsettled at home.\n  Over the past 14 years, Ms. Alvarado's case has been considered by \nimmigration judges, the Board of Immigration Appeals, BIA, five \ndifferent Attorneys General, and three Secretaries of Homeland \nSecurity. Throughout this extensive consideration, the core facts of \nher case have never been disputed. All parties have agreed that Ms. \nAlvarado suffered extreme abuse at the hands of her husband and that \nthe Guatemalan Government would not protect her. All parties agreed \nthat she has a well-founded fear that she would be abused again if she \nwas forced to return to Guatemala.\n  The dispute in Ms. Alvarado's case centered on whether the abuse she \nsuffered was persecution under the terms of the Refugee Convention and \napplicable U.S. law. To obtain protection in the United States, an \nasylum seeker must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of \npersecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or \nmembership in a particular social group.\n  I first wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno in December 1999, when \nthe BIA reversed Ms. Alvarado's grant of asylum, concluding that her \nabuse was not persecution on account of membership in a particular \nsocial group. This decision was particularly troubling because it left \nunclear what grounds, if any, could be applied to a victim of severe \ndomestic abuse who cannot obtain the protection of her country of \norigin. I wrote to Attorney General Reno again in February and \nSeptember 2000 asking her to exercise her authority to review the case, \ncalled Matter of \nR-A-, and to reverse the BIA's decision. Unfortunately, the case was \nnot reversed at that time, and it then languished for years. I wrote to \nAttorney General Ashcroft in June 2004 asking him to work with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, to issue regulations to govern \ncases such as Ms. Alvarado's and to then decide her case in accordance \nwith such rules. When he was a nominee to be Attorney General in \nJanuary 2005, I asked Mr. Alberto Gonzales to commit to taking up the \ncase and resolving it if he was confirmed. Mr. Gonzales promised to \nwork with DHS to finalize regulations but did not take any action \nduring his years as Attorney General.\n  Ten years after I and other Members of Congress first sought \nappropriate action and the fair resolution of this case, we celebrate \nthe long-overdue outcome. While I am dismayed at the length of time Ms. \nAlvarado has lived with fear and uncertainty, the final resolution of \nthis case gives me hope that abuse victims like Ms. Alvarado who meet \nthe other conditions of asylum will be able to find safety in the \nUnited States.\n  The Obama administration has laid out a welcomed, new policy in its \nlegal briefs in this case, and I thank the President, Secretary \nNapolitano, and Attorney General Holder for bringing this case to such \na positive resolution. Yet the administration's work is not done. It \nmust issue binding regulations so that asylum seekers whose cases have \nbeen held in limbo for years can also be resolved and that future cases \nare not delayed in adjudication. I urge the administration to \nimmediately initiate a process of notice and comment rulemaking so that \nasylum seekers, practitioners, and other experts can contribute to the \nformulation of new rules.\n  Today, I commend Ms. Alvarado on the courage she has demonstrated \nover many years while seeking protection in the United States. I \ncongratulate her and wish her all the best as she finally experiences \ntrue freedom from persecution and the full scope of liberties enjoyed \nby Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13246-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13246-S13247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO ROBERT B. HEMLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee \napproved the media shield bill in a bipartisan vote of 14 to 5. This \nlegislation would establish a qualified privilege for journalists to \nprotect their confidential sources and the public's right to\n\n[[Page S13247]]\n\nknow. At a time when the Senate is working to recognize the importance \nof protecting Americans' first amendment rights, I am proud to \nrecognize a Burlington lawyer who was recently recognized by the \nVermont Press Association for his lifetime commitment to the first \namendment and the public's right to know.\n  On December 3, 2009, Robert B. Hemley was awarded the Matthew Lyon \nAward during the Association's annual awards banquet in Montpelier, \nVermont. As a fellow Matthew Lyon Award recipient, I share with Robert \na passion about the need for each generation to defend the first \namendment rights that are so crucial to all Vermonters and to every \nAmerican. Robert has worked to bring greater transparency and \naccountability to our government by representing journalists and \nnewspapers in instances in which they were improperly forced to testify \nin violation of the first amendment, and by helping to create the \nVermont Coalition for Open Government.\n  In each era there will always be much to do to bring greater openness \nand accountability to government of, by, and for the people. I am \npleased to know Robert Hemley will continue to bring his expertise and \ndedication to this fight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe St. Albans Messenger.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the St. Albans Messenger, Dec. 1, 2009]\n\n  Burlington Lawyer Wins Recognition for Commitment to First Amendment\n\n       Montpelier.--Burlington lawyer Robert B. Hemley has been \n     selected to receive the Matthew Lyon Award for his lifetime \n     commitment to the First Amendment and public's right to know \n     the truth in Vermont.\n       The Vermont Press Association is scheduled to present the \n     award to Hemley during its annual awards banquet at noon \n     Thursday (Dec. 3) at the Capitol Plaza in Montpelier.\n       VPA President Bethany Dunbar, editor of the Chronicle in \n     Barton, said Hemley has been a First Amendment leader in the \n     fight against sealed public records, closed courtrooms and \n     improper attempts to force reporters to testify in violation \n     of the First Amendment. Hemley also has successfully defended \n     the media against defamation and invasion-of-privacy lawsuits \n     and other false claims.\n       The VPA created the award to honor people who have an \n     unwavering devotion to the five freedoms within the First \n     Amendment and to the belief that the public's right to know \n     the truth is essential in a self-governed democracy.\n       The First Amendment award is named for the former Vermont \n     congressman, who was jailed in 1798 under the Alien and \n     Sedition Act for sending a letter to the editor criticizing \n     President John Adams.\n       While Lyon was serving his federal sentence in a Vergennes \n     jail, Vermonters re-elected him to the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. Hemley, who is a shareholder in the Gravel \n     and Shea law firm, has been recruited to the write the \n     Vermont section of the national guides on libel, privacy, and \n     access for both the media Libel Resource Center and the \n     Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press for more than \n     20 years.\n       He has shared his expertise and participated in various \n     training sessions for judges, lawyers, the media and the \n     public. He helped create the Vermont Coalition for Open \n     Government and has been invited through the years by the \n     Vermont Legislature to offer testimony on several First \n     Amendment issues.\n       Hemley has represented: St. Albans Messenger, Burlington \n     Free Press, Rutland Herald, Times Argus, Valley news, \n     Bennington Banner, the Associated Press, United Press \n     International, USA Today, New York Times, New York Daily \n     News, along with WCAX-TV, Vermont Public Radio and several \n     weekly newspapers, including in Randolph, Stowe, Waitsfield \n     and Burlington.\n       Before arriving in Vermont in 1976, Hemley was an assistant \n     U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and also \n     worked for a Wall Street law firm. He earned degrees from \n     Amherst College and New York University Law School and is \n     listed in the Best Lawyers in America. Hemley has chaired the \n     District Court Advisory Committee for Vermont since 1993.\n       He lives in Burlington with his wife, Marcia, and they have \n     three children: Amanda, an assistant state's attorney for \n     Dade County, Fla.; Mark, who lives in Boston, and Ian, who \n     attends school in Atlanta.\n       Previous Matthew Lyon winners include Patrick J.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to \ncomment on recent events in Iran, the continuing protests against that \nnation's ruling regime, the brutal response of that regime to the \nlegitimate protests of Iran's people, and one small step the United \nStates can and should take to aid the people of Iran in exercising the \nbasic human right to protest and hold their own government accountable.\n  As my colleagues know well, student protests in Tehran and other \ncities took place on Dec. 7, Student Day, the anniversary of the 1953 \nattacks by the shah's security services that left three student \nprotesters dead. Just as those students sought to protest against an \nunjust and repressive government, so did today's students. And again, \nIran's government responded with intimidation, violence and repression.\n  Iranian security forces, and paramilitary militias allied with \ngovernment hard-liners, used teargas, batons and beatings to attack \nnonviolent protesters on the campus of Tehran University and at other \nuniversities. The government's chief prosecutor told the state-\ncontrolled news agency--apparently without irony--``So far we have \nshown restraint,'' and threatened even harsher methods to end the \nprotests.\n  Sadly, this is a recurring theme in Iran. Outraged by overwhelming \nevidence of fraud designed to keep President Ahmadinejad in power last \nJune, students and other Iranians took to the streets. These nonviolent \nprotests were met by the regime with escalating levels of brutality. \nAccording to a recent report from the human rights group Amnesty \nInternational, government-sponsored violence and repression in Iran \nsince the election has reached the highest level in 20 years. Hundreds \nof people have been rounded up and imprisoned, often under appalling \nconditions, without access to legal representation or indeed any \ncontact with the outside world. Iranian citizens, according to the \nreport, were charged with vague offenses unconnected to any \nrecognizable criminal charge under Iranian law.\n  More than 100 were paraded before cameras in show trials, with \nvisible signs of abuse. The Amnesty International report includes \nevidence that the pace of executions by the Iranian government has \nincreased, a clear and chilling message to the regime's critics. And \ncitizens released from detention made credible and horrific charges of \nabuse while in custody, including allegations of the widespread use of \nrape.\n  This deplorable record is why I and six colleagues introduced a \nresolution last month, approved by this body, expressing the sense of \nthe Senate that the government of Iran has routinely violated the human \nrights of its citizens, and calling on the Iranian government to \nfulfill its obligations under international law and its own \nconstitution to honor and protect the fundamental rights to which its \ncitizens, and all human beings, are entitled. We recognized the need \nfor a strong statement of condemnation of the regime's behavior, and of \nsolidarity with those Iranians seeking to exercise their right to \nprotest. The Iranian government must know that the world is watching.\n  Mr. President, there is more the United States can do. I draw my \ncolleagues' attention to a notice from the State Department that the \nadministration will waive certain provisions of the Iran-Iraq Arms \nNonproliferation Act of 1992 with respect to the export of personal, \nInternet-based communications tools to Iran. This is an important \nresponse to the Iranian government's crackdown on its people. The \nregime has sharply curtailed the actions of foreign media \nrepresentatives in Iran, making independent observations of the \nsituation there difficult or impossible to report. Much of what we know \nabout the regime's repression has come from first-hand accounts by \nIranian citizens, distributed via Internet tools such as YouTube and \nTwitter. These media outlets have become vital, not only to those of us \noutside Iran seeking information about events within the country, but \nto Iranian citizens seeking to communicate with one another. And they \nare especially important given the near total absence of independent \nnews media in Iran. The regime has undertaken, even before the June \nelection, a systematic effort to eliminate newspapers or broadcasters \nthat report critically on the government's activities. And Iran's \nRevolutionary Guards, closely connected to government hardliners, have \nsought to add media and communication companies to its growing \ncommercial empire,\n\n[[Page S13248]]\n\ntightening the regime's grip on communications within Iran.\n  The State Department recently notified Congress that it intends to \nwaive provisions of our sanctions against Iran to allow Iranians to \ndownload free, mass-market software used in activities such as e-mail, \ninstant messaging and social networking. According to the State \nDepartment, ``U.S. sanctions on Iran are having an unintended chilling \neffect on the ability of companies such as Microsoft and Google to \ncontinue providing essential communications tools to ordinary Iranians. \nThis waiver will authorize free downloads to Iran of certain nominally \ndual-use software (because of low-level encryption elements) classified \nas mass market software by the Department of Commerce and essential for \nthe exchange of personal communications and/or sharing of information \nover the internet.''\n  Granting of this waiver is an important step in ensuring that our \nactions here do not impede the attempts by Iranians to exercise their \nhuman rights. I applaud the administration for its decision, and hope \nthe people of Iran will view this as one more sign of the solidarity \nbetween them and the people of the United States. I ask that a letter \nto me from Richard R. Verma, assistant secretary of state for \nlegislative affairs, informing the Senate Armed Services Committee of \nthis waiver decision, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report is being provided \n     consistent with Section 1606 of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484) (the ``Act''). The \n     Under Secretary of State has determined that the issuance of \n     a license for a proposed export to Iran is ``essential to the \n     national interest of the United States.'' The attached report \n     provides a specific and detailed rationale for this \n     determination. The waiver authority under Section 1606 of the \n     Act will not be exercised until at least 15 days after this \n     report is transmitted to the Congress.\n       The Department of State is recommending that the Department \n     of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issue a \n     general license that would authorize downloads of free mass \n     market software by companies such as Microsoft and Google to \n     Iran necessary for the exchange of personal communications \n     and/or sharing of information over the Internet such as \n     instant messaging, chat and email, and social networking. \n     This software is necessary to foster and support the free \n     flow of information to individual Iranian citizens and is \n     therefore essential to the national interest of the United \n     States.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of \n     further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard R. Verma,\n                         Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n\n     Report under the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992\n\n       This report is being provided consistent with Section 1606 \n     of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. \n     102-484) (the ``Act''). Section 1603 of the Act applies with \n     respect to Iran certain sanctions specified in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) of Section 586G(a) of the Iraq Sanctions Act of \n     1990 (P.L. 101-513) (the ``ISA''). This includes the \n     requirement under Section 586G(a)(3) of the ISA to use the \n     authorities of Section 6 of the Export Administration Act of \n     1979 (``EAA'') to prohibit the export to Iran of any goods or \n     technology listed pursuant to Section 6 of the EAA or Section \n     5(c)(1) of the EAA on the control list provided for in \n     Section 4(b) of the EAA, unless such export is pursuant to a \n     contract in effect before the effective date of the Act \n     (October 23, 1992).\n       Pursuant to Section 1606 of the Act, the President may \n     waive the requirement to impose a sanction described in \n     Section 1603 of the Act by determining that it is essential \n     to the national interest of the United States to exercise \n     such waiver authority. On September 27, 1994, the President \n     delegated his authorities under the Act to the Secretary of \n     State. Subsequently, on January 12, 2007, the Secretary of \n     State delegated these authorities to the Under Secretary for \n     Arms Control and International Security (DA 293-1).\n       Personal Internet-based communications are a vital tool for \n     change in Iran as recent events have demonstrated. However, \n     U.S. sanctions on Iran are having an unintended chilling \n     effect on the ability of companies such as Microsoft and \n     Google to continue providing essential communications tools \n     to ordinary Iranians. This waiver will authorize free \n     downloads to Iran of certain nominally dual-use software \n     (because of low-level encryption elements) classified as mass \n     market software by the Department of Commerce and essential \n     for the exchange of personal communications and/or sharing of \n     information over the Internet. The waiver will enable \n     Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to issue a \n     broader general license covering these downloads and related \n     services. This general license will be comparable to \n     exemptions which already exist for the exchange of direct \n     mail and phone calls. The new general license will \n     specifically exclude from its authorization the direct or \n     indirect exportation of services or software with knowledge \n     or reason to know that such services or software are intended \n     for the Government of Iran.\n       The Under Secretary has determined that it is essential to \n     the national interest of the United States to exercise the \n     authority of Section 1606 of the Act not to impose the \n     sanction described in Section 1603 of the Act and Section \n     586(a)(3) of the ISA and to permit the issuance of a general \n     license for this kind of software.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13248-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13248-S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in 1991, then-Czechoslovak President \nVaclav Havel brought together his counterparts from Poland and Hungary. \nTaking inspiration from a 14th century meeting of Central European \nkings, these 20th century leaders returned to the same Danube town of \nVisegrad with a view to eliminating the remnants of the communist bloc \nin Central Europe; overcoming historic animosities between Central \nEuropean countries; and promoting European integration.\n  Today, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are together \nknown as the Visegrad Group, and all four have successfully joined NATO \nand the European Union. They are anchors in the Trans-Atlantic \nalliance, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to travel to all \nfour of these countries where I have met with public officials, non-\ngovernmental representatives and ethnic and religious community \nleaders.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that some additional work is necessary to \naddress one of the principal goals of the Visegrad Group; namely, \novercoming historic animosities. In recent months, relations between \nHungary and Slovakia have been strained. Having traveled in the region \nand having met with leaders from both countries during their recent \nvisits to Washington, I would like to share a few observations.\n  First, an amendment to the Slovak language law, which was adopted in \nJune and will enter into force in January, has caused a great deal of \nconcern that the use of the Hungarian language by the Hungarian \nminority in Slovakia will be unduly or unfairly restricted. \nUnfortunately, that anxiety has been whipped up, in part, by a number \nof inaccurate and exaggerated statements about the law.\n  The amendment to the state language law only governs the use of the \nstate language by official public bodies. These state entities may be \nfined if they fail to ensure that Slovak--the state language--is used \nin addition to the minority languages permitted by law. The amendment \ndoes not allow fines to be imposed on individuals, and certainly not \nfor speaking Hungarian or any other minority language in private, \ncontrary to what is sometimes implied.\n  The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities has been meeting \nwith officials from both countries and summarized the Slovak law in his \nmost recent report to the OSCE Permanent Council:\n\n       The adopted amendments to the State Language Law pursue a \n     legitimate aim, namely, to strengthen the position of the \n     State language, and, overall, are in line with international \n     standards. Some parts of the law, however, are ambiguous and \n     may be misinterpreted, leading to a negative impact on the \n     rights of persons belonging to national minorities.\n\n  Since the law has not yet come into effect, there is particular \nconcern that even if the law itself is consistent with international \nnorms, the implementation of the law may not be.\n  I am heartened that Slovakia and Hungary have continued to engage \nwith one of the OSCE's most respected institutions--the High \nCommissioner on National Minorities--on this sensitive issue, and I am \nconfident that their continued discussions will be constructive.\n  At the same time, I would flag a number of factors or developments \nthat have created the impression that the Slovak Government has some \nhostility toward the Hungarian minority.\n  Those factors include but are not limited to the participation of the \nextremist Slovak National Party, SNS,\n\n[[Page S13249]]\n\nin the government itself; the SNS control of the Ministry of Education, \none of the most sensitive ministries for ethnic minorities; the \nMinistry of Education's previous position that it would require Slovak-\nlanguage place names in Hungarian language textbooks; the handling of \nthe investigation into the 2006 Hedvig Malinova case in a manner that \nmakes it impossible to have confidence in the results of the \ninvestigation, and subsequent threats to charge Ms. Malinova with \nperjury; and the adoption of a resolution by the parliament honoring \nAndrei Hlinka, notwithstanding his notorious and noxious anti-\nHungarian, anti-Semitic, and anti-Roma positions.\n  All that said, developments in Hungary have done little to calm the \nwaters. Hungary itself has been gripped by a frightening rise in \nextremism, manifested by statements and actions of the Hungarian Guard, \nthe ``64 Counties'' movement, and the extremist party Jobbik, all of \nwhich are known for their irredentist, anti-Semitic, and anti-Roma \npostures. Murders and other violent attacks against Roma, repeated \nattacks by vandals on the Slovak Institute in Budapest, attacks on \nproperty in Budapest's Jewish quarter in September, and demonstrations \nwhich have blocked the border with Slovakia and where the Slovak flag \nis burned illustrate the extent to which the Hungarian social fabric is \nbeing tested.\n  Not coincidentally, both Hungary and Slovakia have parliamentary \nelections next year, in April and June respectively, and, under those \ncircumstances, it may suit extremist elements in both countries just \nfine to have these sorts of developments: nationalists in Slovakia can \npretend to be protecting Slovakia's language and culture--indeed, the \nvery state--from the dangerous overreach of Hungarians. Hungarian \nnationalists--on both sides of the border--can pretend that Hungarian \nminorities require their singular protection--best achieved by \nremembering them come election day. Meanwhile, the vast majority of \ngood-natured Slovaks and Hungarians, who have gotten along rather well \nfor most of the last decade, may find their better natures overshadowed \nby the words and deeds of a vocal few.\n  In meetings with Slovak and Hungarian officials alike, I have urged \nmy colleagues to be particularly mindful of the need for restraint in \nthis pre-election season, and I have welcomed the efforts of those \nindividuals who have chosen thoughtful engagement over mindless \nprovocation. I hope both countries will continue their engagement with \nthe OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, whom I believe can \nplay a constructive role in addressing minority and other bilateral \nconcerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13249-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING PIERRE PELHAM\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Pierre Pelham, a \nformer colleague of mine in the Alabama State Senate, who recently \npassed away. He was a personal friend and, along with his family, I \nmourn his passing.\n  A native of Chatom, AL, and a resident of Mobile, AL, Pierre was born \non July 20, 1929, to Judge and Mrs. Joe M. Pelham, Jr. An incredibly \nbright student, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of \nAlabama and received his J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School. During \nthe Korean war, Pierre served as a captain in the Army and received \nboth the Combat Infantryman Badge and Expert Infantryman Badge.\n  After his service in the Army, Pierre returned to Alabama and began \nto practice law. Described by many as brilliant, Pierre often took on \ncases that other lawyers did not want. One of his more interesting \ncases involved representing Aristotle Onassis' wife in her divorce from \nthe wealthy shipping magnate.\n  In the 1960s, Pierre began to pursue his interest in politics. He \nserved as the national campaign coordinator for Governor George Wallace \nand later as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from \nAlabama's 1st Congressional District in 1960 and 1964. In 1966, Pierre \nwas elected to serve in the Alabama State Senate. It was there that I \nhad the distinct pleasure of working with him.\n  In 1970, Pierre was elected to serve as president pro tempore of the \nSenate. Pierre was renowned by our colleagues as an excellent orator \nand an exceptionally persuasive State senator. When word would spread \naround the State capitol that Pierre was speaking on the senate floor, \nit was not uncommon for the gallery to fill with spectators and for \nmembers of the House to cross over to the Senate to watch what would \nsurely be an extraordinary speech. His articulation and command of the \nEnglish language were simply captivating.\n  Although Pierre eventually retired from public life, as a fellow of \nHarvard's Kennedy Institute of Politics, he remained interested in \nnational, State, and local affairs his entire life. Most people in \nMobile will remember Pierre for his many contributions as a State \nsenator to South Alabama, most notably his support for the creation of \nthe University of South Alabama College of Medicine. I knew him to be \nhonest, hardworking, and a committed State senator. He remained \ndedicated to his family and the people of Alabama throughout his life.\n  Pierre is loved and respected and will be missed by his wife Eva \nPelham; his sons Marc Pelham and Joseph Pelham, IV; his daughters \nPierrette Prestridge and Patrice Pelham; and 12 grandchildren. I ask \nthe entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my \nfriend, Pierre Pelham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13249-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13249-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13249-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker of \nthe House:\n\n       H.R. 3288.

     \n\n[Pages S13253-S13254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Menendez, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 2882. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rules relating to the treatment of individuals as independent \ncontractors or employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Taxpayer \nResponsibility, Accountability and Consistency Act of 2009 which will \nprovide a level playing field to America's workers to ensure they are \nafforded protections already in the law, such as workers' compensation, \nSocial Security, Medicare, payment of overtime, unemployment \ncompensation, and the minimum wage. This legislation is cosponsored by \nSenators Durbin, Harkin, Schumer, Brown, Menendez, and Kirk.\n  Under current law, employers are required to take certain actions on \nbehalf of their employees including withholding income taxes, paying \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes, paying for unemployment insurance, \nand providing a safe and nondiscriminatory workplace. Employers are not \nrequired to undertake these obligations for independent contractors. \nWhen workers are misclassified, businesses that play by the rules lose \nbusiness to competitors that do not play by the rules and workers lose \nvaluable rights and protections.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, IRS, currently uses a common law test \nto determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor. \nUnfortunately, a loophole exists which allows a business to escape \nliability for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. \nFurthermore, there is statutory prohibition on the IRS providing \nguidance through regulation on employee classification.\n  Federal and State revenue is lost when businesses misclassify their \nworkers as independent contractors. A study estimated that, between \n1996 and 2004, $34.7 billion of Federal tax revenues went uncollected \ndue to the misclassification of workers and the tax loopholes that \nallow it. Recent GAO and Treasury Inspector General reports have cited \nmisclassification as posing significant concerns for workers, their \nemployers, and government revenue.\n  A study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2000 found \nthat up to 30 percent of firms misclassify their employees as \nindependent contractors. State studies also show that misclassification \nis on the rise. In Massachusetts, the rate of misclassification has \ngrown from 8.4 percent in 1995 through 1997 to a rate of 13.4 percent \nin 2001 through 2003.\n  Misclassification is more rampant than studies indicate. Studies \ncannot adequately capture the ``underground economy,'' where workers \nare paid off the books, often in cash. Unreported cash is one aspect of \nthis problem and it is difficult for the IRS to discover because \nemployers have no record of pay.\n  States have been leading the way in documenting and recovering taxes \nrelated to the misclassification of workers. In the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, Governor Deval Patrick has\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\ntackled this issue head on and created an interagency task force on the \nunderground economy and employee misclassification. The purpose of the \ntask force is to gather information and assess current enforcement \nresources in an effort to improve current enforcement methods.\n  The Federal Government needs to follow the lead of the States by \naddressing the current safe harbor. The determination of whether an \nemployer-employee relationship exists for federal tax purposes is made \nunder a common-law test that has been incorporated into specific \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code or is required to be used \npursuant to Treasury regulations.\n  In 1987, based on an examination of cases and rulings, the Internal \nRevenue Service developed a list of 20 factors for determining whether \nan employer-employee relationship exists. The IRS recognizes that there \nmay be relevant factors in addition to the 20 factors. Most recently, \nthe IRS has structured its inquiry into three groupings: behavioral \ncontrol, financial control, and the relationship of the worker and \nfirm.\n  Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 generally allows taxpayers to \ntreat a worker as not being an employee for employment tax purposes, \nregardless of the worker's actual status under the common law test, \nunless the taxpayer has no reasonable basis for such treatment or fails \nto meet certain requirements. Section 530 is commonly referred to as a \n``safe harbor.'' This provision was initially enacted for a year to \ngive Congress time to resolve these complex issues. In 1982, the safe \nharbor provision was made permanent.\n  The Taxpayer Responsibility, Accountability and Consistency Act of \n2009 would address the current loophole by requiring information \nreporting and making changes to the safe harbor. It would require \nbusinesses that pay any amount greater than $600 during the year to \ncorporate providers of property and services to file an information \nreport with each provider and with the IRS. A similar provision has \nbeen proposed by both Presidents Obama and Bush. This provision will \nensure that contractor income is accurately reported in order to \nprevent fraudulent underpayment of taxes.\n  The Taxpayer Responsibility, Accountability and Consistency Act of \n2009 revises the safe harbor and makes it part of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986. The safe harbor would continue to be available to \nemployers for purposes of shielding them from liability, but it will be \nnarrowed to reduce abuses and to ensure they had a genuinely reasonable \nbasis for not treating such individual as an employee. Under the \nTaxpayer Responsibility, Accountability and Consistency Act of 2009, an \nemployer shall be treated as having a reasonable basis for treating an \nindividual as an independent contractor only if the decision was based \non a written determination by the IRS to the taxpayer addressing the \nemployment status of such individual or another individual holding a \nsubstantially similar position with the taxpayer, or a concluded \nemployment tax examination by the IRS.\n  The current safe harbor would continue to apply to services rendered \nup to one year after the date of enactment; after that, the new safe \nharbor would apply to services rendered more than one year after the \ndate of enactment.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Taxpayer Responsibility, \nAccountability and Consistency Act of 2009 which will provide valuable \nprotections to workers who are erroneously misclassified and help \ncombat the underground economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/15/senate-section/article/S13254-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13254-S13255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3219.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Advances in medicine depend on clinical trial research \n     conducted at public and private research institutions across \n     the United States.\n       (2) The challenges associated with enrolling participants \n     in clinical research studies are especially difficult for \n     studies that evaluate treatments for rare diseases and \n     conditions (defined by the Orphan Drug Act as a disease or \n     condition affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans), where the \n     available number of willing and able research participants \n     may be very small.\n       (3) In accordance with ethical standards established by the \n     National Institutes of Health, sponsors of clinical research \n     may provide payments to trial participants for out-of-pocket \n     costs associated with trial enrollment and for the time and \n     commitment demanded by those who participate in a study. When \n     offering compensation, clinical trial sponsors are required \n     to provide such payments to all participants.\n       (4) The offer of payment for research participation may \n     pose a barrier to trial enrollment when such payments \n     threaten the eligibility of clinical trial participants for \n     Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits.\n       (5) With a small number of potential trial participants and \n     the possible loss of Supplemental Security Income and \n     Medicaid benefits for many who wish to participate, clinical \n     trial research for rare diseases and conditions becomes \n     exceptionally difficult and may hinder research on new \n     treatments and potential cures for these rare diseases and \n     conditions.\n       (b) Exclusion for Compensation for Participation in \n     Clinical Trials for Rare Diseases or Conditions.--\n       (1) Exclusion from income.--Section 1612(b) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (24);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (25) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(26) the first $2,000 received during a calendar year by \n     such individual (or such spouse) as compensation for \n     participation in a clinical trial involving research and \n     testing of treatments for a rare disease or condition (as \n     defined in section 5(b)(2) of the Orphan Drug Act), but only \n     if the clinical trial--\n       ``(A) has been reviewed and approved by an institutional \n     review board that is established--\n       ``(i) to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects \n     participating in scientific research; and\n       ``(ii) in accord with the requirements under part 46 of \n     title 45, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n       ``(B) meets the standards for protection of human subjects \n     as provided under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.''.\n       (2) Exclusion from resources.--Section 1613(a) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382b(a)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (15);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (16) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following:\n       ``(17) any amount received by such individual (or such \n     spouse) which is excluded from income under section \n     1612(b)(26) (relating to compensation for participation in a \n     clinical trial involving research and testing of treatments \n     for a rare disease or condition).''.\n       (3) Medicaid exclusion.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 1902(e) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396a(e)), as amended by section 2002(a), is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(15) Exclusion of compensation for participation in a \n     clinical trial for testing of treatments for a rare disease \n     or condition.--The first $2,000 received by an individual \n     (who has attained 19 years of age) as compensation for \n     participation in a clinical trial meeting the requirements of \n     section 1612(b)(26) shall be disregarded for purposes of \n     determining the income eligibility of such individual for \n     medical assistance under the State plan or any waiver of such \n     plan.''.\n       (B) Conforming amendment.--Section 1902(a)(17) of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(17)), as amended by section 2002(b), is \n     amended by inserting ``(e)(15),'' before ``(l)(3)''.\n       (4) Effective date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date that is the earlier of--\n       (A) the effective date of final regulations promulgated by \n     the Commissioner of Social Security to carry out this section \n     and such amendments; or\n       (B) 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Sunset provision.--This section and the amendments made \n     by this section are repealed on the date that is 5 years \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--Not later than 36 months after the effective \n     date of this section, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a study to evaluate the impact of this \n     section on enrollment of individuals who receive Supplemental \n     Security Income benefits under title XVI of the Social \n     Security Act (referred to in this section as ``SSI \n     beneficiaries'') in clinical trials for rare diseases or \n     conditions. Such study shall include an analysis of the \n     following:\n       (A) The percentage of enrollees in clinical trials for rare \n     diseases or conditions who were SSI beneficiaries during the \n     3-year period prior to the effective date of this section as \n     compared to such percentage during the 3-year period after \n     the effective date of this section.\n       (B) The range and average amount of compensation provided \n     to SSI beneficiaries who participated in clinical trials for \n     rare diseases or conditions.\n       (C) The overall ability of SSI beneficiaries to participate \n     in clinical trials.\n       (D) Any additional related matters that the Comptroller \n     General determines appropriate.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 12 months after completion of \n     the study conducted under paragraph (1), the Comptroller \n     General shall submit to Congress a report containing the \n     results of such study, together with recommendations for such \n     legislation and administrative action as the Comptroller \n     General determines appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3222.

Such platform shall be secure and have (at a \n     minimum) data centers that comply with Federal and State \n     privacy laws.\n       (D) Data consortium.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     provide for the establishment of a centralized data file \n     (referred to as a ``consortium'') that accumulates data from \n     all government health insurance claims data sources. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal health \n     care payers shall provide to the consortium existing claims \n     data, such as Medicare's ``Common Working File'' and Medicaid \n     claims data, for the purpose of fraud and abuse prevention. \n     Such accumulated data shall be transmitted and stored in an \n     industry standard secure data environment that complies with \n     applicable Federal privacy laws for use in building medical \n     waste, fraud, and abuse prevention predictive models that \n     have a comprehensive view of provider activity across all \n     payers (and markets).\n       (E) Market view.--The fraud prevention system shall ensure \n     that claims data from Federal health programs and all markets \n     flows through a central source so the waste, fraud, and abuse \n     system can look across all markets and geographies in health \n     care to identify fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, the \n     State Children's Health Program, TRICARE, and the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs, holistically. Such cross-market \n     visibility shall identify unusual provider and patient \n     behavior patterns and fraud and abuse schemes that may not be \n     identified by looking independently at one Federal payer's \n     transactions.\n       (F) Behavior engine.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     ensure that the technology used provides real-time ability to \n     identify high-risk behavior patterns across markets, \n     geographies, and specialty group providers to detect waste, \n     fraud, and abuse, and to identify providers that exhibit \n     unusual behavior patterns. Behavior pattern technology that \n     provides the capability to compare a provider's current \n     behavior to their own past behavior and to compare a \n     provider's current behavior to that of other providers in the \n     same specialty group and geographic location shall be used in \n     order to provide a comprehensive waste, fraud, and abuse \n     prevention solution.\n       (G) Predictive model.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     involve the implementation of a statistically sound, \n     empirically derived predictive modeling technology that is \n     designed to prevent (versus post-payment detect) waste, \n     fraud, and abuse. Such prevention system shall utilize \n     historical transaction data, from across all Federal health \n     programs and markets, to build and re-develop scoring models, \n     have the capability to incorporate external data and external \n     models from other sources into the health care predictive \n     waste, fraud, and abuse model, and provide for a feedback \n     loop to provide outcome information on verified claims so \n     future system enhancements can be developed based on previous \n     claims experience.\n       (H) Change control.--The fraud prevention system platform \n     shall have the infrastructure to implement new models and \n     attributes in a test environment prior to moving into a \n     production environment. Capabilities shall be developed to \n     quickly make changes to models, attributes, or strategies to \n     react to changing patterns in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (I) Scoring engine.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     identify high-risk claims by scoring all such claims on a \n     real-time capacity prior to payment. Such scores shall then \n     be communicated to the fraud management system provided for \n     under subparagraph (J).\n       (J) Fraud management system.--The fraud prevention system \n     shall utilize a fraud management system, that contains \n     workflow management and workstation tools to provide the \n     ability to systematically present scores, reason codes, and \n     treatment actions for high-risk scored transactions. The \n     fraud prevention system shall ensure that analysts who review \n     claims have the capability to access, review, and research \n     claims efficiently, as well as decline or approve claims \n     (payments) in an automated manner. Workflow management under \n     this subparagraph shall be combined with the ability to \n     utilize principles of experimental design to compare and \n     measure prevention and detection rates between test and \n     control strategies. Such strategy testing shall allow for \n     continuous improvement and maximum effectiveness in keeping \n     up with ever changing fraud and abuse patterns. Such system \n     shall provide the capability to test different treatments or\n\n[[Page S13263]]\n\n     actions randomly (typically through use of random digit \n     assignments).\n       (K) Decision technology.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     have the capability to monitor consumer transactions in real-\n     time and monitor provider behavior at different stages within \n     the transaction flow based upon provider, transaction and \n     consumer trends. The fraud prevention system shall provide \n     for the identification of provider and claims excessive usage \n     patterns and trends that differ from similar peer groups, \n     have the capability to trigger on multiple criteria, such as \n     predictive model scores or custom attributes, and be able to \n     segment transaction waste, fraud, and abuse into multiple \n     types for health care categories and business types.\n       (L) Feedback loop.--The fraud prevention system shall have \n     a feedback loop where all Federal health payers provide pre-\n     payment and post-payment information about the eventual \n     status of a claim designated as ``Normal'', ``Waste'', \n     ``Fraud'', ``Abuse'', or ``Education Required''. Such \n     feedback loop shall enable Federal health agencies to measure \n     the actual amount of waste, fraud, and abuse as well as the \n     savings in the system and provide the ability to retrain \n     future, enhanced models. Such feedback loop shall be an \n     industry file that contains information on previous fraud and \n     abuse claims as well as abuse perpetrated by consumers, \n     providers, and fraud rings, to be used to alert other payers, \n     as well as for subsequent fraud and abuse solution \n     development.\n       (M) Tracking and reporting.--The fraud prevention system \n     shall ensure that the infrastructure exists to ascertain \n     system, strategy, and predictive model return on investment. \n     Dynamic model validation and strategy validation analysis and \n     reporting shall be made available to ensure a strategy or \n     predictive model has not degraded over time or is no longer \n     effective. Queue reporting shall be established and made \n     available for population estimates of what claims were \n     flagged, what claims received treatment, and ultimately what \n     results occurred. The capability shall exist to complete \n     tracking and reporting for prevention strategies and actions \n     residing farther upstream in the health care payment flow. \n     The fraud prevention system shall establish a reliable metric \n     to measure the dollars that are never paid due to \n     identification of fraud and abuse, as well as a capability to \n     effectively test and estimate the impact from different \n     actions and treatments utilized to detect and prevent fraud \n     and abuse for legitimate claims.
