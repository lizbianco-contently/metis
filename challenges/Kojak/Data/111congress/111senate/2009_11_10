Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, the day we \nset aside to honor the service and sacrifice of the heroic men and \nwomen who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. America remains a \nbeacon of freedom throughout the world today because of commitments and \nsacrifices they have made. Over the years, many brave Americans donned \ntheir country's uniform to ensure we would remain safe and free at \nhome. That effort continues today as our fighting forces courageously \ndefend freedom from threats in Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere \naround the world.\n  My own State of Kentucky has a proud military history, and today is \nhome both to Fort Knox and Fort Campbell, which together house \nthousands of soldiers. Many have gone from vital training at these two \nposts to protecting our Nation in the heart of the fight in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  So tomorrow, as America takes a moment to thank these brave men and \nwomen who fought to preserve our way of life and to remember the heroes \nwho did not return home, we will also give thanks for the men and women \nin uniform who are currently in harm's way.\n  I might say, every Veterans Day I remember my own father, who served \nin World War II. He arrived in Europe after the Battle of the Bulge and \nwas there until his unit met the Russians in Pilsen. One of my \ntreasured possessions is a letter he wrote to my mother on V-E Day. \nThey called it V-E Day at the time. He wrote ``V-E Day'' at the top of \nthe letter. That began a series of correspondence in that period right \nafter the cease-fire and the Germans' surrender in which he had at one \npoint prophetically--and this was just a foot soldier--prophetically \nmentioned to my mother after his experience interacting with the \nRussians in Pilsen that they were going to be a big problem down the \nroad. I thought it was quite noteworthy that a regular foot soldier \nsort of instinctively understood at the moment that the Russians were \nan ally of convenience in World War II and not a long-term ally.\n  Regretfully, both my mother and father are no longer living, but I do \nremember them fondly and reread their correspondence from time to time \nof that period when he was overseas.\n  Later today, the Fort Hood community will honor the victims of the \ntragic shootings there last week. We were all shocked by the assault on \nAmerican soldiers right in the heart of a post they call home. We mourn \ntheir loss, and we pray for the victims and their families.\n  In the midst of this terrible tragedy, we also saw the courage of \nmany troops and civilian law enforcement, and we thank these brave men \nand women for their dedication that they showed in putting themselves \nin harm's way.\n  So we honor every American who has fought for this country, and we \nrecognize this country was built on what they have sacrificed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11306-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, of course, the Nation will observe \nVeterans Day this week, as we have each year, in commemoration of the \n11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month with the end of World War \nI. This commemoration is one of special importance this year. We are in \nthe midst of two wars where literally tens of thousands of Americans \nrisk their lives each day in service of our country. It gives us a \nheightened awareness of our military and the men and women who show \nsuch extraordinary courage in serving.\n  Many of us have taken on the task of reaching out to the families in \nour States who have lost soldiers in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWhen I took on this responsibility a few years ago, I had no idea that \nby 2009, I would still be writing notes of condolence to families in \nIllinois. But it continues and, of course, other tragedies intervene.\n  Just last week, there was the tragedy at Fort Hood, claiming two \nlives of Illinois soldiers, as well as those of 11 others, and another \n28 seriously wounded. It is a reminder of the danger of this commitment \nthat each soldier makes. It is a reminder too that each of us needs to \nhave gratitude for their service, not only on this day when we \ncommemorate veterans and their service but around the calendar year.\n  We seem to be more focused on veterans issues in the midst of war, \nand that is no surprise. In my office last week, the major veterans \norganizations came in and talked about the fact that there seems to be \nmore interest in veterans hospitals and veterans benefits and the GI \nbill than ever before, and it has a lot to do with the fact that we are \nin the midst of a war.\n  We also understand this tragedy at Fort Hood has brought a sharpened \nawareness of the vulnerability and the commitment of our soldiers. All \nAmericans were saddened by this horrific outburst of violence. That the \nbrave men and women who are trained to defend our Nation at war should \nbe cut down on a U.S. Army post on American soil apparently at the \nhands of an Army doctor is deeply shocking and painful. We grieve for \nthese men and women who died in this despicable act. We pray for their \nfamilies and the recovery of all those who were injured.\n  We pray for the soldiers and families stationed at Fort Hood, for the \nsafety of all of our brave men and women in uniform wherever they are \nstationed. This horrendous attack touches us all deeply. But we know \nthe horror of this tragedy, like the burdens of wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, falls hardest on our servicemembers and their families. We want \nthem to know our entire Nation stands with them.\n  Among the fallen at Fort Hood were two young soldiers from Chicago: \nPFC Michael Pearson of Bolingbrook, IL, and PVT Francheska Velez from \nthe West Humboldt Park neighborhood in Chicago. Both of these fallen \nveterans were 21 years of age.\n  PFC Michael Pearson was an honor roll student in high school and a \ntalented musician who taught himself to play the piano and was \npassionate about playing guitar. He joined the Army a little over a \nyear ago. He has been training to defuse explosives and roadside bombs \nand was scheduled to be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan this January.\n  He was a devoted son. When his father was laid off from his job, \nMichael sent money home to buy new tires for the family car.\n  He leaves behind his mom and dad, Sheryll and Jeff, a sister and two \nbrothers, including one who serves in the Illinois National Guard.\n  PVT Francheska Velez joined the Army right out of high school. She \nhad already served a year in South Korea and 10 months in Iraq where \nshe drove fuel tankers and disarmed bombs.\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n  Friends say she wanted to make the military a career and hoped one \nday to be a psychologist and help soldiers cope with the stress of \nbattle.\n  Private Velez had just returned from Iraq 3 days earlier, 3 days \nbefore the shooting, to begin maternity leave. Her father, Juan \nGuillermo Velez, a Colombian immigrant who never realized his dream of \nserving in the U.S. military, said his daughter was living his dream \n``to be part of the military, part of the United States.''\n  In addition to her father, Private Velez leaves her mother Eileen and \ntwo older brothers.\n  Another young soldier from the Chicago area, PFC Najee Hull, of \nHomewood, IL, is among those wounded in the Fort Hood tragedy. Private \nHull is also 21 years old. He was shot three times, twice in the back, \nonce in the knee, as he was preparing to complete paperwork to be \ndeployed to Afghanistan. He remains hospitalized.\n  I was meeting with representatives of these veterans service groups \nand lawyers who donate their time to help veterans when the names of \nthe Fort Hood victims became known. There was a profound sense of \nsadness in the room.\n  The men and women who wear America's uniform are some of the finest \npeople our Nation has to offer. They are patriots who are willing to \nsacrifice to protect each and every one of us. They and their families \nhave endured great hardship during these wars. They are heroes, such as \nCAPT Russell Seager of Racine, WI. Captain Seager was a nurse \npractitioner who had worked at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Milwaukee \nwith soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He was 51 \nyears of age. His uncle said he had been a ``helper'' all his life. \nFour years ago, he joined the Army Reserve. Captain Seager was \nscheduled to go to Afghanistan in December. He had gone to Fort Hood \nfor training. He is among the 12 soldiers and one civilian who died \nthere. He leaves a wife and 20-year-old son.\n  A few months ago, in an interview with Milwaukee's public radio \nstation, Captain Seager explained his decision to enlist. He said:\n\n       I've always had a great deal of respect for the military \n     and for service, and I just felt it was time that I stepped \n     up and did it.\n\n  That is part of what defines America's military members and veterans. \nThis Wednesday, we will remember and honor all our veterans, from \nBunker Hill to Baghdad. We will remember, in particular, those brave \nmen and women who lost their lives at Fort Hood.\n  President Obama, Army Chief of Staff General Casey, and Secretary of \nthe Army John McHugh have ordered a thorough investigation into how \nthis tragedy at Fort Hood occurred. The inquiry must happen. We need \nanswers, and we need to do everything possible to ensure it never \nhappens again. While the authorities are investigating, we also need to \nbe thoughtful and reserve judgment about the proper response.\n  Consider this: One week before the gunman allegedly opened fire on \nhis fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, U.S. military investigators released \na report regarding another horrific incident. Last May, an army \nsergeant, with 15 years in the military, killed five of his fellow \nsoldiers on a military base in Baghdad. The soldiers, including an Army \npsychiatrist, were killed in a stress clinic where the gunman was being \ncounseled. The soldier who committed the killings was just weeks away \nfrom finishing his third tour of duty in Iraq and had served previously \nin Bosnia and Kosovo. Until the terrible events at Fort Hood, the \nshooting at Camp Liberty was the worst episode of soldier-on-soldier \nviolence.\n  The father of the soldier charged with the Camp Liberty killings said \nhis son's job in Iraq was defusing bombs and that he probably saw ``a \nlot of carnage and a lot of things he shouldn't have seen, that nobody \nshould see.'' The military investigators who looked into those deaths \nblamed a lack of adequate guidelines on how to handle soldiers under \nsuch severe distress.\n  To rush to judgment based on this new act of violence at Fort Hood is \npremature, certainly to the 3,500 Muslim Americans who proudly serve in \nour Nation's Armed Forces today. As you walk through the section of \nArlington Cemetery devoted to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, you \nwill find headstones with the crescent star alongside the crosses and \nStars of David.\n  As investigators search for answers to what happened last week, we \nowe it to the brave men and women serving at Fort Hood and throughout \nour military to think clearly and act thoughtfully. We need a better \nunderstanding of what took place. Let us honor those who demonstrated \nthe best our military has to offer when their lives were on the line at \nFort Hood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11307-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11307-S11310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have many times, \nwith Senator Whitehouse, my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Udall \nof New Mexico, and others to talk about health care and, in many cases, \nto share letters I have received from people in my State. These letters \nhave several things in common. Typically, they are letters from people \nwho thought they had good health care, if you asked them a year ago. \nThen they had a child with a preexisting condition and they lost their \nhealth insurance or maybe they got sick themselves and found that their \nhealth insurance was canceled because of a policy insurance companies \nuse called rescission. Often these are people who were middle class but \nbecause of health care expenses due to an illness, coupled with \ninsurance policies that were far less than adequate, it meant they no \nlonger were middle class.\n  I have read letters from families who were consistently denied care \nbecause of a loved one's cancer or asthma. I have read letters from \npeople who pointed out that if a woman is a victim of domestic \nviolence, some insurance companies call that a preexisting condition \nand they literally can't get insurance because they are deemed to be \nmore likely to again be a victim of domestic violence. I have read \nletters from small business owners who see double-digit premium \nincreases year after year, especially if 1 of their 15 or 20 employees \ngets very sick, with very expensive care, and the insurance company \nraises the rate so much that the small business owner can no longer \nafford the insurance.\n  Many of the letters I have read are from individuals in their late \nfifties or early sixties who have lost their jobs and, therefore, have \nalso lost their insurance. They write of the anxiety they feel and the \nhope that they can--in their words--make it to 65 so I can get on \nMedicare because I know Medicare will not deny me for a preexisting \ncondition. I know I can count on Medicare. I know Medicare will be \nstable.\n  Last Saturday night, as we all know, a historic vote in the House of \nRepresentatives brought us one step closer to passing a law that will \nfinally meet the promise of equality and affordable health care for the \nAmerican people. We have been trying for 75 years--the last 100 years. \nTheodore Roosevelt first tried--a Republican--to pass health care. Then \nFranklin Roosevelt tried, then Harry Truman tried. They were Democrats. \nLyndon Johnson was able to push Medicare through Congress, as we know. \nThat was very difficult because of some of the same interest groups--\ninsurance companies and others--that oppose this legislation now. \nRichard Nixon tried to build a catastrophic health insurance that would \nhave been a major step--a Republican. So we know how long this has been \nhappening, and that makes Saturday night's vote even more important.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to be with Ohioans who oppose these \nhealth care changes and who wanted to share their thoughts and \nconcerns. Some don't agree that article 1 of the Constitution permits \nhealth care reform. I spoke to a young man who said that all these \nhealth care reforms are unconstitutional because article 1 doesn't \nallow us to do that. I said: Does that mean we should eliminate \nMedicare? He said: Yes, because article 1 doesn't allow for Medicare. I \nam not a lawyer, but I certainly don't read the Constitution that way. \nI don't think many of my colleagues do and I think it is clear Medicare \nis constitutional and it is clear what we are doing today is equally \nso.\n  But I wished to run through the four things that were said with \nprobably the most frequency in my meetings last week with people who \nare opposed to\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nthis health care reform. I know a majority of my State supports it. I \nknow a strong majority in the State supports the public option--people \nfrom Findlay to Cleveland to Gallipolis to St. Clairsville to Vandalia \nsupport our efforts here. But I also note there is significant \nopposition.\n  I will never question the sincerity and genuineness of people who \ntalk to me in opposition, who take off from work to come on a bus to \ncome and protest or who want to talk to me individually. But I do \nquestion those who make millions of dollars a year--whether they are \ninsurance executives or radio and talk show people--and who are \nliterally benefiting from trying to kill this health care reform. Their \nefforts are less sincere and less genuine.\n  But let me run through several of these myths or the four things I \nhave heard most frequently that simply aren't true about this health \nplan.\n  First: If my employer drops my coverage, I will be forced into the \npublic plan.\n  As the Senator from Illinois knows and Senator Whitehouse and others \nknow, no one is forced into the public plan. If your employer drops \nyour coverage, you can choose private insurance or the public plan \nthrough the health insurance exchange. That is the whole point of the \npublic option. The word is ``option.'' It is a total option--the public \nplan. It means that, whether you have lost your insurance, if you are \nuninsured or if you have lost your insurance or you are a small \nbusinessperson who is looking for a better insurance option, you take \nyour employees or you go individually into the insurance exchange. You \ncan choose Aetna, you can choose WellPoint, you can choose a plan from \nan Ohio company, Medical Mutual, or you can choose the public option. \nAt no point is there anybody--anybody in this country--who is going to \nbe forced to go into the public plan. As I said, it is an option, and \nit will remain an option.\n\n  The second myth I hear a good deal about, of these four myths, is: \nAfter 5 years, I would not be allowed to purchase private insurance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure, I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. To go back to the first point about the public \noption, in fact, being an option, I think everybody here understands \nthe government is going to help pay the costs of health care, \nparticularly for low-income families who can't work to get the funds \ntogether to pay for the cost of health care. As the Senator from Ohio \nknows so well, wages have increased just a tiny bit and health \ninsurance costs have gone through the roof. The result has been that \nfamilies are getting clobbered, so they need some help.\n  So the health care reform bill we have before us will help those \nfamilies who are having such trouble affording their insurance. I think \nit is worth confirming the help that will come to American families \ndoes not require them to join the public option. They will get the same \nbenefit based on their income and their family's health care needs \nwhether they choose the public option or a private insurance carrier \nthat is offering a program through the exchange.\n  As long as you show up at the exchange, as I understand it--and I \nwould like to have the Senator from Ohio confirm this--you can take \nthat government subsidy that is yours and your family's and you can \nspend it at the public option, you can spend it with Blue Cross, you \ncan spend it with Aetna, you can spend it with any insurance company--\nprivate, for profit, nonprofit, public option--that is doing business \nin the exchange. You can take your subsidy and you can go there and \nspend it there. You are not tied to the public option by your subsidy.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right. Senator Whitehouse and I, his \nstaffers and mine, wrote the language in the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee on the public option, and the whole point was to \ncreate a level playing field.\n  As Senator Whitehouse said, if you are low income, if you are lower \nor medium income, making $30,000 or $40,000 a year, with a couple \nchildren, you and your spouse are required, under this bill, to buy \nhealth insurance or, if you obviously choose to, you will get a subsidy \nfrom the taxpayers--from the government--to help pay for this \ninsurance. You then take those subsidies, as Senator Whitehouse says, \nand you have a choice. You can go to WellPoint, you can go to Aetna or \nyou can go to the public option. The public dollars will follow you \ninto any one of these.\n  The public option gets no special treatment. The public option gets \nno special taxpayer subsidies. The public option gets no special \ngovernment infusion of dollars. The public option gets what any one of \nthe private companies do. As Senator Whitehouse said, it could be a \nprivate company, it could be a for profit, a not for profit, it could \nbe a co-op of some sort or it could be a public option. But it is all a \nlevel playing field, so people can decide which one of these they want \nto go into.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for his question.\n  The second myth: After 5 years I won't be allowed to purchase private \ninsurance.\n  This is not too different from the first myth we see out there that \nthere is going to be some forcing of people into public insurance and \ninto the public option. When Senator Whitehouse and I and our staffs \nwrote this language for the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, it was written in a way not just today for people going into \nthe insurance exchange but 5 years from now, 10 years from now, people \nwill have the option. You can choose a private for-profit or not-for-\nprofit insurance company or you can choose the public option. That is \nthe way this language will continue to be. That is another one of those \nmyths out there that has scared people.\n  Some people are very distrustful of government in this country. I \nunderstand. But I think the experience of Medicare has shown that, in \nterms of health care, government has been a pretty good delivery \nvehicle for people getting insurance. In 1965, half of American seniors \nhad no insurance. In health insurance today, 99 percent plus of \nAmericans have health insurance and it is because of Medicare.\n  We know government can deliver these plans efficiently but we also \nare not telling people they have to have the public option. In the \npublic plan they continue to have an option.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield again, we are approaching \nVeterans Day, a time when the Nation takes a moment from our busy lives \nto pay our respect and our honor to those who wear the uniform of the \nUnited States and are willing to put themselves in harm's way. I think \nthere is not a person in this body who does not feel a great loyalty \nand pride in our Armed Services. We want them to get nothing but the \nbest. What do we give them for health care? If they are active, they \nget a government plan called TRICARE. Once they retire from active \nservice and become veterans, they go into the Veterans' Administration. \nSo at least one measure of the quality of government health care, in \naddition to the success of Medicare in reaching a population that had \nbeen deprived of adequate care for generations until Medicare came \nalong, our seniors, is that those very people whom we are about to \nspend the week honoring, and for whom we insist on the very best, one \nof the ways we pay them honor and respect is by giving them among the \nvery best health care in the world, government health care, TRICARE and \nVeterans' Administration care.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right. TRICARE you rarely hear a complaint \nabout. The VA is a huge operation. Of course there are sometimes \ncomplaints about people having to wait or something that doesn't quite \ngo right all the time, but obviously by and large veterans in this \ncountry, soldiers and sailors and marines and active duty, understand \ntheir medical needs are taken care of, as they should be. It is one of \nthe things to be proud of in our country, that we have done a decent \njob of taking care of people who serve the country with TRICARE.\n  I sit on the Veterans' Committee and all the time we are wrestling \nwith problems in the VA. There has been a problem with people going \nfrom active duty in TRICARE into retired status, as Senator Whitehouse \nsaid, the VA. To make that transition is not always as smooth as it \nshould be, but it is clear people's medical care works and\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\nthat is another argument for the option.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest to the distinguished Senator from Ohio, who \nhas come to this floor so often to share the stories of Ohioans in our \nhealth care system, which are heartbreaking, which are tragic; which \ninvolve people being thrown completely out of the program when they \nhave the temerity to get sick, which involve families going broke who \nhad insurance, when they find out the insurance policy had holes in it \nthat they have fallen through, when they find out when they become sick \nthey not only have as their adversary the illness they are fighting but \nalso the insurance company they have to fight on the other side--over \nand over again you have come here with those stories.\n  If Senator Brown's experience is anything like mine in Rhode Island, \nI don't get those letters about the VA system. I don't get those \nletters about TRICARE. Sure, there are glitches now and then; any big \nsystem has its problems. But the massive cascade of human tragedy the \nSenator represents so effectively on this floor with the letters he \nbrings from home--that is not coming out of these systems. That is \ncoming out of the private health care system.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right. We don't see veterans or we don't \nsee active-duty soldiers or people on Medicare denied because of a \npreexisting condition. Soldiers who are injured in the line of duty, \nimagine if they have a preexisting condition if we don't take care of \nthem in Bethesda or Cleveland or Dayton or in Chillicothe in my State, \nin the Senator's State the same. It is absurd to think that would be \nthe case. But it is clear these endemic massive problems with people \nfighting their insurance companies, denied care, come out of the \nprivate insurance system.\n  One of these other myths was one Senator Whitehouse has talked about, \nthat health reform will lead to rationing of health care. It is such a \npeculiar charge to say about this bill, that health reform will lead to \nrationing of health care, because we see rationing of health care every \nday.\n  Senator Whitehouse pointed out on the floor several times, the model \nof the health insurance business is this: They hire a lot of \nbureaucrats to keep people from buying insurance if they are too sick. \nA large insurance company will have a bunch of employees, a bunch of \nbureaucrats. When people apply for health insurance, they will check \nand see is this person going to cost our company too much, so they will \ndeny them, they won't even get insurance with this company--a \npreexisting condition or something. Then they have bureaucrats on the \nother end to challenge the claims once one of their insured customers \ngets sick. So they have bureaucrats on both ends of this health \ninsurance model, stopping people from getting insurance at the \nbeginning and stopping them from receiving coverage. In fact, 30 \npercent of the claims on the first go-around are denied. Sometimes when \nyou appeal them you can win. But just the idea, when you are sick or \nyou are taking care of a very sick child or spouse or parent or sister \nor whatever, and you are fighting with the insurance companies to pay \nthe bill--we remember the President, President Obama, talking about \nthat with his mother, the fights she had with the insurance companies \nto pay for her cancer care as she was dying. We don't hear about that \nin the public plans. We don't hear about that in TRICARE or in \nMedicare.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It has happened in my family as well. A member of my \nfamily whom I loved very much went to the National Institutes of Health \nto get the best recommendations he could for a very terrible diagnosis \nhe had received. When he went back to New York, where he lived, and \nfiled his claim and began the treatment that the National Institutes of \nHealth top expert on his diagnosis had recommended, his insurance \ncompany came back and said I am sorry, no, that is not the indicated \ntreatment. They dropped--tried to, anyway--dropped a bureaucrat between \nhis doctor, a world expert, and the care he was entitled to.\n  The Senator and I hear these stories all the time. People are not \nmaking them up. They happen to us. They happen to people we know. \nUnfortunately, unlike my family member who fought back and was able to \nconvince the insurance company to honor what the expert at the National \nInstitutes of Health indicated was the standard and approved treatment \nfor that type of condition, many people are overwhelmed by the illness, \nthey are overwhelmed by the paperwork, they are overwhelmed by the \nbattle with the insurance company. They believe what they are told and \nthey allow themselves to get rolled over.\n  If an insurance company only gets 1 in 10, it still saves them money \nwhen they deny people that care. It is in their business model to deny \ntheir insureds the care that they paid for, once they have the nerve to \nget sick. That is a recurring and consistent problem that just plain \nnever comes up in the government programs. It is unique to our very \nunique position as being the one country in the world that turns over \nour health care to the profit-making private sector for things we \ncannot negotiate on, for things that are not elective.\n  If you do not want to buy a bicycle, you don't have to buy a bicycle. \nThey have to come to you on price. But if you need a heart transplant, \nthere is not a lot of negotiation. We turn that over to the profit \nsector and as a result we have higher costs and worse results than any \ncountry.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would point out when the Senator said the only country \nin the world--not every country in the world has a government health \ncare system; not that every country has, or even many of them that have \nsuccessful health care systems are necessarily socialized medicine or \npublic health care plans. But what they have, when they use private \ninsurance in other countries, they are private but they are not-for-\nprofit private insurance. So they don't have all the bureaucrats in \nthis business model at the beginning keeping people from getting \ncoverage and at the end denying payment for those plans.\n  The fourth myth we hear so much is related to rationing of care, the \nmyth about rationing of care, and that is that health reform will \ninterfere with decisions that should be between doctors and patients. \nThat is exactly what we are saying again with private insurance now. \nYou don't see that with Medicare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority for \nmorning business has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask to add an equal \namount of time, 2 minutes, to the Republican time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is the fourth myth, that health reform will interfere \nbetween doctors and patients. That is what we are seeing now. We are \nseeing so many cases where the doctor and the patient--the doctor puts \nhis or her secretary or nurse on the line or the doctor herself calls \nthe insurance company to beg them for coverage. I have heard doctors \nsay to a patient: I will pay it out of my own pocket if I can't get \nthis covered with the insurance company.\n  All these resources of the system, the patient's time, the family \ntime, the doctor time, the doctor hiring all these people, the \ninsurance companies hiring all these people to prevent you from getting \ncoverage, the insurance companies hiring all these people to prevent \nyou from getting reimbursed for your expenses--all this goes into what? \nIt is waste. Executive salaries, profits, but certainly doesn't go into \npatient care.\n  I ask Senator Whitehouse, why don't you wrap up.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It provides no health care value at all and it is \ngoing in the wrong direction. Insurance company administrative expense \nis up over 100 percent. I go to Rhode Island and I talk to doctors and \ncommunity health centers, for whom 50 percent of their personnel are \ndevoted not to providing any health care but to fighting with the \ninsurance company. So the notion that it is the Government that will \nget between you and your doctor is truly the big lie. It is the \ninsurance companies that are the ones that, day after day--a manner of \ntheir business model--get between Americans and their doctors. We are \ntrying to cure that and we will.\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Earlier today the assistant Democratic leader, who is \nnow presiding, delivered some eloquent remarks about the murders at \nFort Hood. I believe there were two soldiers from Illinois who were \nthere. One was from Tennessee, from Mountain City, TN, which is a \nbeautiful little part of our State, way up in the northeastern corner \nnear Virginia. Some people have said it looks like Switzerland and that \nthe people there talk in Elizabethan phrases and tones.\n  SPC Frederick Greene, according to an article in the Washington Post:\n\n       . . . was a Tennessee native so quiet and laid back that he \n     earned the nickname ``Silent Soldier'' while stationed at \n     Fort Hood preparing to go overseas.\n       He hoped to spend the months before his deployment to \n     Afghanistan with his wife of less than 2 years. She had made \n     arrangements to leave their home in Mountain City, TN, next \n     week and move to Fort Hood until January, when Greene was to \n     ship out.\n       Instead, [they] are planning his burial in the northeast \n     corner of the state where he grew up.\n\n  This is what Specialist Greene's family had to say about him, and I \nthink it speaks as eloquently about his life and service to our country \nas anything could. In their words:\n\n       Fred was a loved and loving son, husband and father, and \n     often acted as the protector of his family.\n       Even before joining the Army, he exemplified the Army \n     values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, \n     integrity and personal courage. Many of his fellow soldiers \n     told us he was the quiet professional of the unit, never \n     complaining about a job, and often volunteering when needed. \n     Our family is grateful for the thoughts and prayers from \n     people around the country. We would like to ask for privacy \n     during this emotional time because Fred, too, was a very \n     private person.\n\n  We will honor the request for privacy of the family, but we will also \nhonor Fred Greene for his service to our country.\n  Speaking just for myself, but I am sure most Tennesseans, most \nAmericans, feel the same way--for 8 years now, tens of thousands of men \nand women from Tennessee have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to keep \nterrorism from spreading here.\n  It is tragic enough when any one of them is wounded or killed in that \nfight; it is beyond belief when one of them is wounded or killed at \nhome in a terrorist act at Fort Hood. That is hard for us to accept. \nBut in accepting it and asking questions that we inevitably must ask \nabout how this could have happened, we certainly can honor each of \nthose who were killed, each of those who were wounded.\n  We can respect their service, and I especially want to show my \nrespect for the family of SPC Frederick Greene and for his service.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed following the remarks I just \nmade a brief article from the Washington Post and an article from the \nJohnson City, TN, Press of Tuesday, November 10.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 8, 2009]\n\n                       Spec.

Rural Mountain City offered \n     relatively few opportunities to advance, and he wanted to \n     build a career, perhaps in engineering.\n       Greene's mother died when he was a boy, and he was raised \n     by her twin sister Karen Nourse, and Karen's husband, Rob \n     Nourse. Family members are leaning on their Christian faith \n     as they grieve, said Howard Nourse, Rob's father. ``God is \n     still in control,'' he said. ``Even though we don't \n     understand why something happens, He's still in control.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Johnson City (TN) Press, Nov. 10, 2009]\n\n                 Local Soldier Remembered by Community\n\n                           (By Brian Bishop)\n\n       One of the 13 killed during Thursday's Fort Hood attack was \n     a local man--29-year-old Army Specialist Frederick Greene.\n       ``Fred was a loved and loving son, husband and father and \n     often acted as the protector of this family,'' Army Public \n     Affairs Cathy Gramling said in a prepared family statement \n     Sunday outside the Johnson City home of Greene's parents, \n     Karen and Rob Nourse.\n       ``Even before joining the Army, he exemplified the Army \n     values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, \n     integrity and personal courage.

We are in the middle of the health care debate. We \nhave different points of view. I am sure people are confused by what \nthey hear. I think that would be inevitable with a 2,000-page bill, \nwhich is the House-passed bill. That is all we have today while the \nDemocratic majority leader writes his version of whatever we are \nexpecting to act on, behind closed doors.\n  Earlier this week I talked to a woman in my home town. She expressed \nwhat I suppose many people believe. She said: I am very confused by \nwhat I hear, but I do not like what I hear. My husband lost his job. He \nwas one of the lucky ones; he got a new job. But it only pays 60 \npercent of what he was earning doing the same work, and he does not \nhave any benefits.\n  So, she said: I went back to work. I am a small business woman. We \nneeded the benefits, so I went back to work.\n  But she said: These proposals I am hearing about do not seem to be \nworking out the way they are supposed to. They are putting more costs \non us when we buy our insurance and when, as a small business person, I \nhave to buy insurance.\n  She said: I do not like what I hear.\n  I think she is expressing a real concern--it is a complicated bill. \nThere is a lot of concern on both sides. We heard the other side \ntalking about myths and reality. I see the Senator from South Dakota. \nIt looks as though he has the 2,000-page bill with him. It is good that \nhe is young and strong and can carry such things. His eyes are good, \nand he can read it. It will take a while to do that, which is why, when \nthis bill gets to the Senate floor, we want to make sure we read the \nbill, we\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\nknow what it costs, and we help the American people understand how it \naffects them.\n  I would ask the Chair if he would please let me know when I have 60 \nseconds remaining on my 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. What I would like to suggest this morning is that we \nought to focus on a forgotten word, and the word is ``cost.'' This is \nsupposed to be about reducing the cost of health care not increasing \nthe cost of health care; reducing the cost of our premiums, which 250 \nmillion of us have. We have health care plans upon which we or somebody \nelse pays premiums for us. We would like for those to go down or at \nleast stabilize. That is what this reform is supposed to be about--and \nreducing the cost of health care to our government because all of us, \nincluding our President, have seen that we are going to go broke if we \ndo not do that.\n  Here is the President speaking at the White House health summit on \nMarch 5 in words I thoroughly agree with:\n\n       If people think we simply can take everybody who is not \n     insured and load them up in a system where costs are out of \n     control, it is not going to happen. We will run out of money. \n     The Federal Government will be bankrupt. State governments \n     will be bankrupt.\n\n  That is President Obama using the B-word. Yet the bill we have coming \ntoward us is indeed historic. But it is historic in its combination of \nhigher premiums not lower premiums, of higher taxes, of Medicare cuts, \nand of more Federal debt.\n  Millions of Americans will be forced into government plans, perhaps \nincluding a new one, when their employers look at the option and say: \nWe are out of here. They will write their employees: Congratulations. \nWe are going to write a check to the government. That is better for us \nas a company, our bottom line, and you are in the government health \ncare plan.\n  That is going to come as a shock to millions of Americans. We do not \nhear as much about it here. But one way the House of Representatives \nplans to pay for this expensive bill, that's going to cost between $2 \ntrillion and $3 trillion, according to various estimates when it is \nfully implemented over 10 years, is to shift some of the cost to the \nStates.\n  The numbers we throw around here after a while do not have any \nreality to them, but if you are a Governor--and our Governor, a \nDemocratic Governor, has said that the House-passed bill--now that is \nnot the Senate bill because the Senate bill is still behind closed \ndoors; we have not seen it--but the House-passed bill will add about \n$1.3 billion cost to the State of Tennessee over the next 5 years for \nits share of the Medicaid costs, including reimbursement of physicians.\n  I have been the Governor of Tennessee. I know how much money that is, \nand I cannot see how the State of Tennessee can afford to pay for its \nshare of these proposed Medicaid costs unless it institutes a new State \nincome tax or seriously damages higher education or both.\n  So we should take a different approach. Instead of a 2,000-page bill \nwith higher premiums--people say: Well, that is a myth. Well, it is not \na myth. I mean, if you add $900 billion in taxes over 10 years to \ninsurance companies and medical devices, who do you think is going to \npay it? The people who pay for insurance premiums are going to pay it. \nIf you tax the oil companies, who do you think is going to pay the tax? \nThe people who buy gasoline. Taxes are not paid out of thin air; \ncompanies pass them on. So premiums are going to go up.\n  They are also going to go up because of government requirements for \nan ``approved government policy.'' Senator Collins of Maine said 87 \npercent of people in Maine would be paying more for the premiums they \nhave today if they had to buy them new under the House-passed plan. So \nwhy do we not take a different direction? Instead of these 2,000-page \nbills, that cost $2 or $3 trillion, and are full of surprises and \nconfusion, why do we not just set a goal of reducing costs? Why do we \nnot go step by step in reducing those costs? I bet we could agree on a \nlot of things. Going step by step in the right direction is one good \nway of getting where we want to go. It also provides bipartisan support \nwhich would provide bipartisan support of the country, which the \nPresident and the majority will need to sustain the program. We want \nthe President to succeed because we want our country to succeed. He is \nour President. But this bill will not help him succeed. It will not \nhelp our country succeed.\n  Just to conclude with one example of what a step would be is the \nsmall business health care plan, which we worked on for a long time. \nSenator Enzi from Wyoming has been the principal sponsor. It would \nallow small businesses to combine and offer insurance to a larger \nnumber of employees.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, such a plan, as I just \ndescribed, would add nearly 1 million, 750,000 people would become \ninsured. Three out of four people who are employees of small business \nwould have lower rates, and we would reduce the cost of Medicaid by \n$1.4 billion.\n  That is just a step, but it is a step in the right direction. So I \nwould hope we can focus on costs, reducing costs. Republicans have a \nseries of steps we would like to take in that direction. We reject \nthese 2,000-page bills that raise taxes and premiums and Medicare cuts. \nWe hope we can come to some agreement before we conclude the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nTennessee. I totally support his approach. I think handling health care \nreform in a way that reflects a more thoughtful step-by-step approach \nis the correct way to proceed.\n  The leadership, the Democratic leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives, wanted to pass a health care reform bill in the worst \npossible way. They succeeded on Saturday, passing it in the worse \npossible way. It is a 2,000-page bill which was debated for about 4 \nhours and passed on a party-line vote. It was a partisan bill, very \nlimited amount of debate, very few number of amendments that were \noffered. I think the Republicans were able to offer one substitute \nduring that entire debate.\n  They passed out a 2,000-page bill that expands the Federal Government \nby $3 trillion over 10 years when it is fully implemented. So you have \na 2,000-page bill coming out of the House of Representatives, a $3 \ntrillion expansion of the Federal Government, and I think what the \nAmerican people are probably asking in observing this process is, What \ndoes it all mean for me?\n  Well, let me tell you what it means. If you are a taxpayer in this \ncountry, if you are someone who currently does not have insurance in \nthis country, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are somebody \nwho has insurance, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are a \nmedical device manufacturer, you are going to pay higher takes. If you \nare a small business, you are going to pay higher taxes. If you are \nsomeone who has a flexible spending account, you are going to pay \nhigher taxes. If you are someone who has a health savings account, \nyou are going to pay higher taxes. If you are someone who itemizes on \nyour tax return and deducts your medical expenses, you are going to pay \nhigher taxes.\n\n  So pretty much that kind of covers the gamut. Everybody in this \ncountry is going to be hit with higher taxes to pay for this \nmonstrosity, this 2,000-page bill, which, according to the CBO, raises \ntaxes in the first 10 years by three-quarters of $1 trillion.\n  What is interesting about that, when I mention that people who do not \nhave insurance are going to pay higher taxes, there is, in this bill, \nwhat is called an ``individual mandate.'' Those who would pay the \nhigher tax under the individual mandate--it would raise taxes by about \n$33 billion--are people who currently do not have health insurance \ncoverage. What is interesting about that is that the CBO has looked at \nwho would be impacted by the individual mandate and found that almost \nhalf of that tax burden would fall on taxpayers who are making between \n$22,800 a year and $68,400 a year. So about half of the individual \nmandate, about half of that $33 billion tax increase, would fall on \nindividuals who, in their incomes, fall into the middle of that \ncategory, $22,800 a year to $68,400 a year. That is according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Now, it raises taxes by $135 billion on businesses through what is \ncalled a\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\n``pay-or-play mandate.'' In other words, if you do not offer health \ninsurance, you do not offer insurance that meets the government \nrequirement, then you pay a payroll tax starting at 2 percent, up to 8 \npercent of payroll. That raises $135 billion in this bill in additional \ntaxes and taxes that are going to hit small businesses.\n  There are also taxes on what they call ``high-income earners.'' That \nraises about $460 billion in the bill. It is designed to hit people who \nmake between $500,000 and up to $1 million a year, which is sort of the \ntraditional ``tax the rich and pay for this thing.''\n  The dirty little secret in all of that is that tax hits a lot of \nsmall businesses. In fact, about one-third of that tax is going to fall \non small businesses that file or are organized as subchapter S \ncorporations or LLCs and therefore file on the individual tax return.\n  So we are going to be faced with a situation where next year a small \nbusiness--when the tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003, the top \nmarginal income tax rate--goes from 35 percent to up to 39.6 percent. \nYou will add in this health care, this 2,000-page bill, a 5.4-percent \nsurtax on those high-income earners. So if you can believe this, the \ntop marginal income tax, Federal income tax rate in this country, will \ngo up to 45 percent--45 percent.\n  That is the highest rate we have seen in 25 years. As I said, it \nwould be one thing if it were just hitting high-income individuals who \nwere making more than $\\1/2\\ million a year, but it does not. It hits \nsmall businesses, small businesses that are organized as partnerships, \nsubchapter S corporations, LLCs, and, therefore, file an individual tax \nreturn.\n  So they have $460 billion of tax increases there, $135 billion in the \npay-or-play mandate, $33 billion in tax increases through the \nindividual mandate--all totaled, $752 billion in new taxes in this \n2,000-page bill that are going to be passed on and paid for by the \nAmerican public.\n  The Joint Tax Committee said of the Senate bill--by the way, this is \nthe Senate version of the bill. This is only 1,500 pages. We do not \nknow--as the Senator from Tennessee pointed out--what the final Senate \nbill is going to look like.\n  All we know is that this is the version that was reported out of the \nFinance Committee, 1,500 pages also filled with higher taxes on \nindividuals and small businesses.\n  The argument was made that we will make the people who are wealthy, \nthe affluent, pay for this. What the Joint Tax Committee found was that \n87 percent of the tax burden in the Senate Finance Committee bill would \nbe paid by wage earners making less than $200,000 a year and a little \nover 50 percent would be paid by those making under $100,000 a year. If \none fits into those categories, there are 46 million Americans who will \nbe hit with higher taxes under the 1,500-page Senate Finance Committee \nbill as opposed to the 2,000-page House bill that passed on Saturday.\n  I remind my colleagues that when we talk about a massive $3 trillion \nexpansion of the Federal Government, it has to be paid for somehow. Of \ncourse in this case, it is paid for in the form of higher taxes and by \nway of Medicare cuts that will hit very hard on seniors, $170 billion \nin cuts to Medicare Advantage, cuts to providers such as hospitals, \nhome health agencies, hospices. Everybody gets to have their \nreimbursements cut in order to finance this $3 trillion monstrosity of \nan expansion of the Federal Government.\n  Having said that, it would be one thing if, in fact, the goal was \naccomplished, which is to reduce health care costs. Ironically, after a \n$3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government and three-quarter \ntrillion dollars in additional taxes in the first 10 years, we don't \nsee any impact on insurance premiums. In fact, they will not go down; \nthey will actually go up.\n  I want to read what the Congressional Budget Office said about that:\n\n       On balance, during the decade following the 10-year budget \n     window, the bill would increase both federal outlays for \n     health care and the federal budgetary commitment to health \n     care, relative to the amounts under current law.\n\n  That is consistent with everything we have heard so far from the \nCongressional Budget Office about the impact this bill would have on \noverall health care costs and on the premiums average Americans would \nend up having to pay.\n  With respect to State governments, because something has been said in \nthis bill about the expansion of Medicaid, in fact, there is a massive \nexpansion of the Medicaid Program, to the point that a decade from now \none-quarter of the entire population would be on Medicaid. This was a \nprogram that at one time was designed to assist poor, disabled people \nwho really need assistance with health care. A decade from now, with \nthis expansion of Medicaid, we would see one-quarter of the population \non Medicaid.\n  The other component of that, the element I think should be so \ndisturbing to States--as we all know, Medicaid is a State-Federal \nshared responsibility. I see the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, a \nformer Governor, who knows full well about the cost of Medicaid to \nState budgets. What this bill would do is increase the amount of cost \npassed on to States by $34 billion. States are going to have to look at \nhow they are going to finance this thing, probably in the form of \nadditional and higher taxes.\n  We have a $3 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, cuts to \nMedicare that will affect not only seniors but also most providers, and \nmassive increases in taxes which will hit squarely small businesses and \nindividuals, in particular individuals who make less than $100,000 a \nyear. We need to do what the Senator from Tennessee suggested; that is, \nstart over and do this step by step rather than a massive expansion of \nthe government that raises taxes and increase health care costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, if I may start out today and use a \nportion of my time to ask if the Senator from South Dakota would answer \na question or two about Medicaid, the first question I have for the \nSenator from South Dakota is, when it comes to Medicaid, why would we \nbe putting a mandate on States at a time when every State in the \ncountry is going through a difficult budget cycle? In fact, Nebraska \nliterally, as I speak, is in special session to cut the budget by over \n$300 million. Why would we do that with this health care bill?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, that is exactly the point. Why would we \npass on $34 billion in additional cost to States when, as my colleague \nsuggested, in States such as Nebraska and South Dakota, it is on the \nfront page every day about decisions made at the State level, about \ncuts that will have to occur, looking at revenue increases, with the \neconomy in the difficult situation it is in? I can't imagine \ncomplicating that by passing on an additional $34 billion in cost that \nevery Governor and every State legislature will have to deal with.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I begin my comments and thank the \nSenator from South Dakota for answering that question. Having been a \nGovernor and, for that matter, a mayor, this is a very difficult time \nback home. When I refer to ``back home,'' I refer to Nebraska, but \nevery Senator could say the same. State budgets are struggling.\n  Today, I rise because I believe there is another important point to \nbe stressed as Senators on both sides of the abortion issue decide how \nthey want to approach their vote relative to this legislation.\n  We saw a clear pro-life approach when the House passed what is now \nbeing referred to as the Stupak amendment. That amendment is \nstraightforward. It says no Federal tax dollars will pay for abortions, \nwhether that is directly or through subsidies or any other means. Put \nanother way: If you accept a subsidy from the Federal Government, you \ncannot use that to fund an abortion. It is clear and straightforward. \nThis carries on the longstanding tradition of separating tax dollars \nfrom abortions.\n  Now the focus is on the Senate. The House passed their legislation on \nSaturday. I have heard very little about the importance of what some \nhave characterized as little more than a procedural vote. In reality, \nit is an important vote that might well become the deciding factor in \nthe debate over Federal funding of abortion. Let me explain. It all \ndepends on whether the\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nban on Federal funding of abortions is weakened in the Senate bill \ncompared to the House.\n  As I speak today, the Senate bill is being written behind closed \ndoors by the majority leader and others. If their final product \nincludes anything less than the House-passed ban, the critical vote for \npro-life Senators will be their vote on cloture on the motion to \nproceed. Why? Because if the motion to proceed is successful, it will \nend, in my opinion, any chance to match the House bill's ban on using \nFederal funds to fund abortion. It is the way the Senate works, \naccording to its rules. Sixty votes would be needed to change the bill \nonce a motion to proceed passes. Let me repeat: 60 votes would be \nneeded to change the bill once a motion to proceed passes. We all know, \nregrettably, that there are not 60 Senators who would support the House \nprovision that bans Federal funding for abortions; therefore, we would \nlack the votes to close the door on Federal funding of abortions if \nthis bill proceeds to the floor with a weakened approach.\n  The ban on Federal funding of abortions must be a part of the Senate \nbill before debate is allowed to proceed. Don't be fooled by the claims \nthat the motion to proceed to the bill is a first step in improving the \nbill; it will be the final say for the pro-life community.\n  I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have declared \nthey will accept nothing less than a complete separation between \nFederal funds and abortion services. I wish to express unequivocally, I \nstand firmly with them. If we are presented with a weakened ban on \nFederal funding of abortion compared to the House version, we must vote \nagainst cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. In my judgment, \nthis point should be nonnegotiable.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise today on the eve of Veterans Day \nto honor all those who have and are now serving to protect our \nfreedoms, especially the service men and women of my State who have \nsuch a vital role in our Nation's defense.\n  At trouble spots across the world--from Afghanistan to Korea, Iraq to \nKosovo--Alaskan servicemembers are on the front lines.\n  Today, I welcome the opportunity to praise Alaska's service men and \nwomen, their families who are such a key part of our communities, and \nthe thousands of veterans who have chosen to live in the 49th State.\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\n  Nearly 75 years ago, Air Force GEN Billy Mitchell testified before \nCongress and famously said:\n\n       Alaska is the most strategic place in the world.\n\n  General Mitchell's pronouncement might have been an eye-opener for \nMembers of Congress in 1935, but the importance of Alaska's strategic \nlocation has been well known to Alaskans for centuries.\n  Shortly after Alaska's purchase from Russia in 1867, the U.S. Army \nwas dispatched to help administer the new American territory. Within 10 \nyears, a significant presence was established in Alaska by both the \nNavy and the Reserve Service, which later became the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  The Army helped maintain law and order during the turn of the century \nGold Rush, which saw thousands scramble north in search of fame and \nfortune.\n  With the buildup to World War II, Alaska's vital role in the Nation's \ndefense grew dramatically. Alaska's Aleutian Islands were the only \nAmerican territory occupied by the Japanese during the war. Dislodging \nthem in brutal conditions cost American and Japanese troops more than \n6,000 casualties combined.\n  Servicing Alaska's strategic military needs during the war required \nconstruction of the 1,400-mile Alaskan-Canadian Highway, known as the \nALCAN. This road was built largely by three African-American regiments, \nand their success helped spur the Army to end segregation among its \nranks.\n  Some of the Nation's most essential eyes and ears during the war were \nsoldiers of the Alaska Territorial Guard. These Eskimo volunteers, \ncapable of living off the land as they guarded against invasion, knew \nevery nook and cranny of Alaska's coastline. Today, some two dozen of \nthese scouts are still with us--most in their eighties and still living \nlargely off the land through subsistence hunting and fishing.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and working with my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, we guaranteed in next year's military \nbudget bill that these brave guardsmen will receive proper Federal \nbenefits and recognition for their service.\n  Today Alaska is home to some 30,000 Active-Duty service men and \nwomen. Another 30,000 Alaskans are the family members of these soldiers \nand airmen.\n  Alaska's major military installations include Elmendorf, Eielson, and \nClear Air Force Bases, Army Forts Richardson, Wainwright, and Greely, \nand Kulis Air National Guard Base. Through these bases, about one in \nfive Alaskans has a personal tie to the military.\n  To maintain these vital posts, the Department of Defense spends in \nexcess of $1.5 billion a year in our State. That is a huge part of \nFederal spending in Alaska, which constitutes about 18 percent of the \nState economy.\n  Alaska is also proud to have the highest per capita population of \nveterans of any State. The more than 75,000 veterans who call our State \nhome comprise 11 percent of our population.\n  Alaska's bases support the latest and greatest in the military's \narsenal: from the F-22, the Air Force's latest fifth generation fighter \naircraft; the C-17 cargo aircraft; the Army's Stryker vehicle; and the \nGround-Based Midcourse element of missile defense.\n  Today more than 4,000 servicemembers stationed in Alaska are \nsupporting overseas contingency operations around the world.\n  Just last month, we welcomed home the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team \nof the 25th Infantry Division based at Fort Wainwright. This brigade \nspent 12 months in Iraq's Diyala Province doing a remarkable job \nprotecting the people of Iraq.\n  Still in Iraq is the 545th Military Police Company of the Arctic \nMilitary Police Battalion that continues to patrol the streets of Baji.\n  The Alaska National Guard also has a vital role in that theater. The \nGuard's 207th Aviation Regiment continues to fly C-23 Sherpa military \naircraft missions, delivering more than 1 million pounds of cargo \nthroughout Iraq.\n  Back home, the Guard plays a significant role in the defense of our \nNation around the clock. At Fort Greely, they staff the operations \ncenter for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, protecting the \nUnited States from ballistic missile threats from countries such as \nNorth Korea and Iran.\n  The Guard also provides invaluable search and rescue support and \nother vital missions to ensure the safety of our citizens in our vast \nState.\n  Alaskans continue to serve in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq. The \n4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division operates \nin Afghanistan's Regional Command-East in support of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force.\n  These soldiers are bravely serving on the front lines, hunting down \nal-Qaida terrorists, securing the border, and trying to establish \ngovernance in this vital part of the world.\n  Since their arrival in February, the 4-25 BCT has suffered \nsignificant casualties. In fact, since the 9/11 attacks on America, 143 \nservicemembers from Alaskan units deployed in support of the global war \non terror have paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Madam President, I would like to honor those based in Alaska who were \nkilled in action since September 11, 2001.\n  The pictures beside me which I show in the Chamber are of those who \nhave fallen in the past year, just since Veterans Day 2008.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, a lifelong Alaskan paid the ultimate sacrifice. On \nOctober 23, in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, two U.S. aircraft \ncollided in midair in the predawn dark. Marine Corps Cpl Gregory Fleury \nwas the crew chief aboard one of those aircraft.\n  Corporal Fleury was just 23 years old, a graduate of Anchorage's \nService High School. He had already served two tours of duty in Iraq as \na combat helicopter mechanic and gunner.\n  The helicopter crash that took the young corporal's life was a bad \none. But the Marines were able to recover one item that belonged to \nhim--an Alaskan flag.\n  I spoke to Corporal Fleury's grandfather last week to thank him for \nhis grandson's service on behalf of this proud Nation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of all the \nAlaskan troops who have made the ultimate sacrifice since September 11, \n2001, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Following is a list of Alaskan, or Alaska-based, soldiers who have \ndied since 2003.

In addition to these fallen heroes, hundreds more \nservicemembers will forever contend with the physical and mental wounds \nsuffered in service to our Nation.\n  I have had the honor to visit several of these brave soldiers at \nWalter Reed Army Medical Center and at the Elmendorf Warrior Transition \nUnit also. It is critical that the transition of our servicemembers \nfrom the care of the Defense Department to Veterans Affairs is as \nsmooth and as comprehensive as possible. We must ensure the VA is \nfunded to meet the current demands of this generation of veterans.\n  I am proud to have been one of the original cosponsors with Senator \nAkaka on a bill signed into law by the President last month which will \nensure 2-year advance funding for the VA. This allows the VA to focus \non providing care for our veterans instead of worrying annually about \ntheir funding.\n  Today's veteran population is much different from all previous wars. \nThanks to improvements in protective gear and equipment, many survive \nserious wounds which previously would have been fatal. We also have a \nmuch greater population of female veterans who have unique needs and \nrequire specialized care. Today's veterans often have families with \nexceptional needs.\n  In World War II, nearly one in five Americans served in the armed \nservices. Today less than 1 percent of our population currently serves. \nStill, some 25 million veterans live among us, representing every \nconflict since World War II. Our commitment to each and every one of \nthese veterans must be full, honorable, and proud.\n  We honor Veterans Day this week on the anniversary of the armistice \nthat ended World War I. In my State, we also celebrate Women Veterans \nDay on November 9.\n  On these occasions, let us rededicate ourselves to our commitment to \nour Nation's veterans and service men and women so their sacrifice is \nnever taken for granted or forgotten.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of health \ncare reform and on behalf of greater access to health care for all \nAmericans. This weekend, the House took a historic step, passing a \nhealth care reform bill that ensures affordable, quality care for all, \nincluding a public plan that will bring real competition to the market \nand drive down costs. Passing this bill in the House represents a \nmonumental step toward the goal of achieving meaningful reform this \nyear and is the furthest we have come in the decades-long fight for \nhealth care reform in this country.\n  However, there is one aspect of the House bill about which I wish to \nvoice my strong disagreement--the Stupak-Pitts amendment.\n  While proponents of the measure say this is a continuation of current \nFederal law, this amendment will, in fact, bring about significant \nchange and dramatically limit reproductive health care in this country. \nThis is government invading the personal lives of many Americans, \nestablishing, for the first time, restrictions on people who pay for \ntheir own private health insurance. We all agree it is important to \nreduce abortions in this country and I have and will continue to work \non many ways to reduce unintended pregnancies and to promote adoption. \nHowever, the Stupak amendment prohibits the public plan as well as \nprivate plans offered through the exchange, if they accept any \nsubsidized customers, from covering abortion services, effectively \nbanning abortion coverage in all health insurance plans in the new \nsystem, whether they be public or private. This ban puts the health of \nwomen and young girls at grave risk.\n  Proposing that women instead purchase a separate abortion rider is \nnot only discriminatory but ridiculous. It would require women to \nessentially plan for an event that occurs in the most unplanned and \nsometimes emergency situations.\n  There are currently five States that require a separate rider for \nabortion coverage, and in these five States it is nearly impossible to \nfind such a private insurance policy. In one State, North Dakota, one \ninsurance company holds 91 percent of the State's health insurance \nmarket and refuses to even offer such a rider. A lack of access to full \nreproductive health care puts the lives of women and girls at grave \nrisk.\n  This anti-choice measure poses greater restriction on low-income \nwomen and those who are more likely to receive some kind of subsidy and \nless likely to be able to afford a supplemental insurance policy. \nDenying low-income women reproductive coverage in this way is \ndiscriminatory and dangerous.\n  Without proper coverage, women will be forced to postpone care while \nattempting to find the money they need to pay for it--a delay that can \nlead to increased costs and graver health risks, particularly for \nyounger girls, or these women will be forced to turn to dangerous, \nback-alley providers. Women and girls deserve better.\n  In fact, this amendment represents the only place in the entire \nhealth care bill where the opponents are actually correct: It limits \naccess to medical care by giving the government, not the\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\npatient and the doctor, the power to make medical decisions.\n  The Senate bill already ensures that no Federal tax dollars may be \nused to pay for reproductive services in any public or private \ninsurance plan beyond cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment. The \nHouse language goes much further and should be removed from the final \nbill.\n  This health care package must move us forward, toward quality, \naffordable health care for all Americans. I ask my colleagues to oppose \nany similar amendment in the Senate and work to end disparities among \nrace and gender in our health care system.\n  Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        omnibus health services\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of our Nation's \nveterans and in support of their families.\n  Ninety years ago tomorrow, our Nation marked the very first Armistice \nDay in recognition of the end of World War I. In 1954, Armistice Day \nbecame Veterans Day, and every year since, we have marked the occasion \nthrough ceremonies, pageants, parades, and other events designed to \nhonor the men and women who have served this Nation so selflessly in \nthe Armed Forces. I encourage all Americans to use the opportunity of \nVeterans Day to let those around you who have served our Nation, those \nin your community, know how thankful we are for their contributions.\n  I know that across our Nation there will be remembrances of those we \nhave lost and honors to those who have served in the past or who are \nserving today, but we can and should do more to honor our Nation's \nveterans. We should make sure they have access to the health care we \nhave promised. We should make sure their caregivers are given the \nsupport they need to assist our wounded warriors. We should expand \nhealth services for female veterans. We should do more for veterans in \nhard-to-reach rural areas. We should increase our mental health \nservices for veterans because injuries to the brain deserve the same \nattention as injuries to the body.\n  These programs--access to health care, support to caregivers, \nservices for female veterans, services to rural veterans, improved \nmental health services--are all included in the bills that have been \nput into the veterans package, the Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus \nHealth Services Act of 2009. I have cosponsored a number of these bills \nand will passionately support this package. Our servicemembers stand up \nfor America when on duty. America must stand up for our servicemembers \nwhen they return home.\n  The legislation before us has wide bipartisan support. It has been \nendorsed by organizations, including the Disabled American Veterans and \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America. It has been endorsed by the American \nLegion. It has been endorsed by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica. It has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It has \nbeen endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project. Each of these groups \nwants to see a vote on this omnibus package of support for our veterans \nand to see that vote happen now. But we in the Senate are not here \ndebating this package, we are not here preparing to vote on this bill \nbecause a single Senator has objected to having an up-or-down vote. Our \nveterans deserve to have this Chamber debate this bill. They deserve to \nhave this Chamber vote up or down on this bill.\n  Tomorrow we will honor our veterans through ceremonies across this \nNation. But we should do more than simply honor our veterans; we should \nact to stand up for our veterans. We need to stand with them and their \nfamilies as they have stood up for us when on duty. We should move \nexpeditiously, and I encourage all Senators to support the effort to \nquickly have this bill before us for a debate and an up-or-down vote.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Recognition of Sergeant Major Gregory Symes\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, 90 years ago this Wednesday, President \nWilson signed a proclamation marking the first anniversary of the \nArmistice that ended World War I. At the time, many believed the \ncruelty experienced by the combatants and civilian victims of that war \nwould never be surpassed. Unfortunately, as we learned later, they were \nmistaken. But it was the tragedy of that conflict and the harrowing \nstories brought back from the trenches that led to the establishment of \na day honoring America's veterans.\n  Veterans Day is a moment of pause to remember the sacrifices made by \nthose who wore our Nation's uniform. It also presents an opportunity to \nreflect on the dual nature of our Federal Government.\n  When average Americans hear ``Federal employees,'' they usually think \nof the 1.8 million civilian government employees. However, it is all \ntoo often forgotten that the 1.4 million men and women serving in \nuniform are also Federal employees. Our Federal workforce has two \nlegs--the civilian and the military. But they march together in step, \nbecause we depend on both and they depend on one another.\n  Without the military, we could not remain free and secure. Without \nthe civilian Federal workforce, we could not keep America on the path \ntoward prosperity and the continued pursuit of happiness. Civilian \nFederal employees work closely with the military not only to craft \nstrategies and policies but also to pay, arm, and care for our troops.\n  While some choose to serve in uniform and others in civilian roles, \nthere are many who do both. According to the 2006 study by the Office \nof Personnel Management, one out of every four civilian Federal \nemployees is a military veteran. Moreover, a fifth of these are \ndisabled veterans. And that is just in the executive branch. This \nnumber doesn't even include those who currently serve in the National \nGuard or the many veterans working right here on Capitol Hill and in \nthe Federal Judiciary. They work in nearly every department and agency.\n  Not surprisingly, some of the agencies with the highest percentage of \nveterans are those that relate to law enforcement. The Pentagon too \nemploys many veterans, as does the Department of Homeland Security. \nAlmost half of the civilian employees in the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration are veterans themselves. However, many Americans do not \nrealize that roughly one in every three employees at the Department of \nTransportation is a veteran. The same is true of the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration at the Department of Labor. Over a third of those \nworking at the U.S. Mint are veterans. I bet most Americans would be \nsurprised to learn veterans make up a quarter of those who work at the \nSmithsonian's National Gallery of Art.\n  It would take me a long time to read through all the departments and \nagencies with large numbers of veterans on staff. But the point I \nemphasize is that so many of our Federal employees share a tradition of \nnational service that began with their service in the military.\n  Today, I wish to continue my weekly tradition of recognizing an \noutstanding Federal employee by sharing the story of a man from my home \nState of Delaware. Not only does he fill a full-time job as a Federal \ntechnician for the Delaware National Guard, but he also recently \ncompleted a year of active-duty service.\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\n  CSM Gregory Symes had already served in the Delaware Army National \nGuard for 7 years when he started working as a Federal technician for \nthe Guard in 1989. A graduate of John Dickinson High School in \nWilmington, Gregory trained as an automotive mechanic. While he began \nhis Federal employment in that role, he studied telecommunications and \nin 2001 became a telecommunications specialist for the Delaware Guard's \nDirector of Information Management.\n  Gregory has served truly as a mentor to those working alongside him \nand he has risen to become the senior enlisted adviser to the battalion \ncommander for the 722nd Troop Command. In this capacity, he is often \ngiven the task of looking after the well-being of other soldiers in the \nbattalion.\n  Last month, Gregory completed a 1-year deployment on active duty with \nthe 261st Signal Brigade, and he was stationed at Fort Bliss, NM, in \nsupport of Iraqi Freedom. Decorated for his service, Gregory has \nreceived the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and \nthe Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon, among \nothers.\n  He continues to serve with dedication and distinction in his Federal \nrole with the Guard, staying in the forefront of ever-changing \ntelecommunications technology. For Gregory and all the other veterans \nand National Guard members who work as Federal employees, sacrifice and \nservice are a life's pursuit. They are a constant reminder of why \nVeterans Day is so important.\n  While on Memorial Day we remember those who never made it home, on \nVeterans Day we dedicate ourselves to the task of caring for those who \ndid. Care and gratitude for our veterans remains a sacred \nresponsibility, and one that was as relevant to those who fought at \nBunker Hill as it is to those stationed in Baghdad today.\n  George Washington once said:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  I hope all Americans will take the opportunity this week to express \ntheir appreciation of all our veterans, especially those who continue \nto serve in the public as Federal employees. I invite my colleagues to \njoin me in thanking Command Sergeant Major Symes, the Federal employee \nof the Delaware National Guard, and all who have served our Nation in \nuniform. They continue to make us all proud.\n\n\n                      Remembering Samuel J. Heyman\n\n  Madam President, I cannot let this occasion pass without also noting \nwith sadness the passing yesterday of Samuel J. Heyman. Each week, I \nhave been speaking from this desk about our excellent Federal \nemployees. I continue to do so because I believe that Americans need to \nhear more about the outstanding men and women who serve in government, \nand we need to do more to encourage our graduates to consider careers \nin public service.\n  Samuel J. Heyman was a champion of this cause. Mr. Heyman attended \nYale University and Harvard Law School, and he felt called to public \nservice as a young law graduate in 1963. Working at the Justice \nDepartment under then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Mr. Heyman \nserved as chief assistant U.S. attorney for his native Connecticut.\n  After 5 years, he left government service to take over his family's \nreal estate development business, but he would never forget the sense \nof duty and pride he felt as a Federal employee. Mr. Heyman knew that \nFederal employees were those who shared his level of determination and \nwork ethic. He knew that the men and women who choose to spend their \ncareers working for the American people not only deserve more credit \nthan they typically receive, but he understood as well that they have \nthe benefit of looking back on their careers with the great \nsatisfaction of having made a difference.\n  It is for that reason that, in 2001, Mr. Heyman founded the \nPartnership for Public Service, which promotes Federal employment, and \nhe received the Presidential Citizen Medal last year for his work as \nits chairman. The partnership also awards annual Service to America \nMedals in several categories, which have affectionately been called \n``Sammie'' in his honor. I have been privileged to be able to share the \nstories of Sammie winners from this desk.\n  It is with deep regret that I share with my colleagues this news of \nMr. Heyman's passing. A respected business leader, philanthropist, and \na champion of public service, Mr. Heyman will be truly missed. My \nthoughts are with his wife Ronnie, their four children, and their nine \ngrandchildren, as well as his mother, who also survives him.\n  I also extend my condolences to the Partnership for Public Service \nfamily. I know they will continue working to carry on Mr. Heyman's \nlegacy. I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering Samuel J. \nHeyman and his tireless efforts to inspire a new generation to pursue \ncareers in public service and to celebrate the enormous contribution \nmade by Federal employees to our great Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Health Care Disparities\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this Congress has taken a giant step \nforward in our effort to reform the Nation's health care system. \nSaturday evening, the House of Representatives passed its bill, which \nis estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to provide affordable \nhealth coverage to 96 percent of Americans while reducing our deficit \nby $109 billion over the next 10 years.\n  On behalf of the 760,000 uninsured Marylanders and the countless more \nwho are underinsured or facing huge premium increases next year, I am \nencouraged by my colleagues' success, and I look forward to debating \nthis most important issue here in the Senate in the weeks ahead.\n  Today, I rise to discuss an issue that has received scant attention \non the floor of the Senate, and that is health disparities. It is an \nissue directly affecting 1 out of every 3 Americans: the 45 million \nLatinos, 37 million African Americans, 13 million Asians, 2.3 million \nNative Americans and Alaskan Natives, and 400,000 Hawaiians and Pacific \nIslanders in our Nation. While they represent one-third of our Nation's \npopulation, they are fully one-half of the uninsured. So when we enact \nlegislation that expands access to millions of uninsured Americans, it \nwill make a difference in minority communities, in overall minority \nhealth, and in the health of our Nation.\n  But it is not enough to just get people health insurance coverage. \nResearch tells us that even after accounting for those who lack health \ninsurance, minority racial and ethnic groups face inequities in access \nand treatment, and they have adverse health care outcomes at higher \nrates than Caucasians.\n  That is right, even when insurance status, income, age, and severity \nof conditions are comparable, racial and ethnic minorities tend to \nreceive lower quality health care, so coverage is not enough.\n  Despite many attempts over the years by health policymakers, \nproviders, researchers, and others, wide disparities still persist in \nmany facets of health care. When it comes to equitable care for \nminorities, low income, geographic, cultural and language barriers, and \nracial bias have been found to be common obstacles. These inequities \ncarry a high cost in terms of life expectancy, quality of life, and \nefficiency.\n  And they cost our Nation billions of dollars each year. Researchers \nfrom Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland found that \nbetween 2003 and 2006, racial and ethnic disparities cost the Nation \nmore than $229 billion in excess direct medical costs.\n  Adding in indirect costs reveals a staggering $1.24 trillion from \nlost wages and premature and preventable deaths and disabilities. By \nelevating the focus on health disparities, we can bring down these \ncosts and improve the quality of care across the board. So health \ndisparities should matter to us\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nall, in terms of improved value for our health care dollars, both \npublic and private.\n  If we are to improve the health care status of America, we must focus \non these inequities and make a concerted effort to eliminate them. \nThere is no better place to commit ourselves to that effort than in the \nhealth reform legislation that we are about to consider. There is no \nbetter time to begin than right now.\n  Examples of grim health disparities are found in all racial and \nethnic minority groups and across a broad range of diseases and \nconditions. The overall life expectancy for African Americans is 5.3 \nyears less than Whites, but as the Kaiser Family Foundation has \nreported, health disparities begin even before birth.\n  The use of prenatal care varies widely by race, with 88 percent of \nWhite mothers receiving care in the first trimester of a pregnancy, but \nonly 76 percent of Black mothers and 77 percent of Latino mothers.\n  This disparity is evident at birth, when Black women experience \npreterm births at a rate 50 percent higher than White women--18.5 \npercent compared to 11.7 percent, and the rates of low-birth weight \nbabies are also higher among Black babies--14 percent, compared to the \n8.3 percent national average.\n  In August of 1967, 8 months before his assassination, Martin Luther \nKing addressed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Tenth \nAnniversary Convention in a speech entitled, ``Where Do We Go from \nHere?''\n  He said that to answer that question:\n\n       We must first honestly recognize where we are now. When the \n     Constitution was written, a strange formula to determine \n     taxes and representation declared that the Negro was sixty \n     percent of a person. Today another curious formula seems to \n     declare that he is fifty percent of a person. ``Of the good \n     things in life, the Negro has approximately half those of \n     whites. Of the bad things in life, he has twice those of \n     whites.\n\n  He goes on to discuss housing, income, and employment rates, before \nsaying, ``the rate of infant mortality among Negroes is double that of \nwhites.'' Today, in 2009, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that the \noverall rate of infant mortality in the United States is 6.9 deaths per \n1,000 live births, a white infant mortality rate is at 5.7 deaths, but \nAfrican Americans have an infant mortality rate more than twice that of \nWhites at 13.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.\n  So 46 years after Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, and 41 years \nafter his death, we have not made progress in closing the gap in infant \nmortality.\n  There is no other way to put it: this is a crisis, it has been a \ncrisis for decades, we have known it, and we have failed in our \nresponse.\n  Health disparities continue through life, and the data cut across \ndiagnoses and conditions. These are just a few of the statistics:\n  African-American children have a 60 percent higher rate of asthma \nthan White children and visited the emergency room for asthma related \nservices 4.5 times more often than White children in 2004.\n  The incidence of diabetes is nearly twice as high in African \nAmericans as in Whites. Complications from diabetes and death from the \ndisease are also higher in African Americans, and the rate of hospital \nadmissions for uncontrolled diabetes for African Americans and Latinos \nis nearly 5 and 3 times, respectively, the rate for Whites and Asians.\n  High blood pressure accounts for 18 percent of the Nation's overall \ndeath rate, but 41 percent of deaths in African-American women and 50 \npercent of deaths in African-American men are attributed to \nhypertension.\n  Regarding early detection of colon cancer, African Americans, Asians, \nNative Americans and Latinos over age 50 all have lower rates than \nWhites when it comes to receiving any form of colon cancer screening. \nThis disparity increased between 1999 and 2006.\n  Incidence of, and death rates from, kidney cancer in Native Americans \nand Alaska Natives are higher than in any other racial or ethnic group.\n  Native Americans and Alaska Natives die from heart disease much \nearlier than the overall population--36 percent are under age 65 \ncompared with only 17 percent for the U.S., according to the American \nHeart Association's data.\n  Perhaps the greatest disparities are in the rates of HIV and AIDS. \nAfrican Americans experience an AIDS case rate nearly 10 times that of \nWhites: 60.1 per 100,000 adults and adolescents, compared to 6. per \n100,000 for Whites. Latinos and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific \nislanders have an AID case rate nearly 3 times that of Whites, at 20.4 \nper 100,000.\n  Disparities also affect oral health care, which--as I have discussed \non the floor before--is an integral part of overall health care--and \nwithout which, patients cannot have good overall health. Regardless of \nage, minorities are less likely than Whites to have visited a dentist \nin the past year. The percentage of people who had untreated dental \ndisease is substantially higher for African Americans and Latinos than \nfor Whites, and the prevalence of periodontal disease is 2.5 times \ngreater for Native Americans and Alaskan Natives than for Whites. We \nknow that periodontal disease leads to heart disease, brain infections, \nand other serious illnesses.\n  Last year, the American Journal of Public Health published research \nshowing the vast disparities in mortality rates. Using data for the \ndecade between 1991 and 2000 from the National Center for Health \nStatistics, the researchers, including Dr. David Satcher, the 16th \nSurgeon General of the United States, found that the mortality rate for \nAfrican-American infants and adults aged 25 to 54 years was more than \ndouble that of Whites.\n  Had the mortality rates of the two races been comparable during that \ndecade, the researchers calculate that 886,202 deaths could have been \naverted.\n  Let me repeat that--the lives of nearly 900,000 African Americans \ncould have been lengthened and the quality of life improved for many \nmore if we had been able to close the gaps in health disparities.\n  This chart illustrates the higher death rate observed among African \nAmericans across Maryland and the United States, based on Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention data, for the years 1999 to 2003. The \nstriped bar shows that in the U.S., African Americans had a 31.5 \npercent higher death rate from all causes of disease than Whites.\n  Maryland has a comparable discrepancy at 30.8 percent, shown by the \nred bar. The number of excess deaths varies by county, with the lowest \ndiscrepancy in death rates in Charles County--4.1%--and the highest \ndiscrepancy in Talbot County--64.5%.\n  We cannot afford to wait. We need action at every level: local, \nState, and Federal, but the leadership must come from the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. HHS will need a strengthened institutional \ncapacity to achieve these goals.\n  Codifying the Office of Minority Health and elevating it to report \ndirectly to the Secretary will empower the agency to continue its \nimportant work--protecting and improving the health of racial and \nethnic minority populations, advising the Secretary of HHS on the needs \nof minority communities, coordinating and supporting research and \ndemonstration programs, and supporting the community organizations that \nenhance outreach and education efforts. These offices will be able to \npromote activities related to disease prevention, wellness, access to \ncare, and research related to racial and ethnic minorities with the \ngoal of reducing and eliminating disparities.\n  The offices will be authorized to administer grant programs and also \nhelp train health professionals to care for diverse populations. The \nbill passed by the House on Saturday includes a provision to codify the \nOffice of Minority Health.\n  I will be working to expand that provision in the Senate bill so that \nit reflects concerns echoed by many health advocates and provider \ngroups across the nation who know that we must marshal the resources \nnecessary to eliminate disparities.\n  The bill reported by the HELP Committee contains many important \nprovisions, including section 221, which would codify and increase the \nauthority of the Office of Women's Health across several agencies in \nHHS. I believe strongly that the Office of Minority Health should \nreceive the same prioritization that the Office of Women's Health is \nset to receive, particularly in light of the vast amount of data \ndocumenting racial and ethnic\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\ndisparities. This is really an issue of equality in the efforts to \nachieve health equity. As we champion efforts to achieve equity in \nwomen's health, let us also do the same for minority health.\n  I will also be working to ensure the codification of the Office of \nMinority Health at HHS and the network of minority health offices \nthroughout the Department's various agencies.\n  I will close with another quote from Dr. King, who said that ``of all \nthe forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking \nand inhuman.'' As with other forms of inequality in America, it is \nwithin our power to change it, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthe quest to do so without further delay.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Fort Hood Victims\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today in honor of those killed \nlast week at Fort Hood. They died serving their country, and that means \nthey died as heroes.\n  Tomorrow, as we honor the service and sacrifice of the brave men and \nwomen of America's military on Veterans Day, I ask all Americans to say \na prayer for these 13 folks who gave the ultimate sacrifice and the 30 \nwho were injured. Remember them and their families, their friends and \nthe places they called home as we pay our respects.\n  Today, flags are flying at halfstaff across Montana in honor of the \n13 victims killed and 30 wounded. One of the men who died was a veteran \nof Montana's Army National Guard. Michael Grant Kahill worked \nthroughout Montana for many years as a guardsman and as a physician's \nassistant. To Michael's wife Joleen and to all of his loved ones, \nMontana joins the rest of the Nation in saying that our thoughts and \nprayers are with you.\n  What happened at Fort Hood doesn't make sense. It never will. But \nworking together, we need to focus on keeping something such as this \nfrom happening again. What can we do right now? We can keep working \ntogether to live up to the promises we make to all of our troops while \nserving our country in the field or after they come home, and we can \nimprove access to health care and mental health care that they deserve.\n  I join in mourning the lives lost at Fort Hood. I ask all Americans \nto keep those 13 heroes in their thoughts and prayers, and I urge my \ncolleagues to keep working together to better serve all the men and \nwomen who have worn our country's uniform, and their families and their \ncommunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           The Climate Change\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about the Kerry-Boxer \nclimate change bill which, sadly, was reported out of the EPW \nCommittee, contrary to its rules and precedents, without any discussion \nor amendment.\n  First of all, let me underscore that I think it is very unfortunate \nthat a 1,000-page bill, a bill with enormous potential impact on our \neconomy--indeed, on our way of life--was pushed out of committee with \nno Republicans being present, with not a single amendment being \nconsidered, and, in my opinion, directly contrary to the very rules and \nprecedents of the committee. But I want to focus on specific provisions \nof the bill that are particularly troubling to me that underscore how \nserious a matter this is and what an enormous impact it could have on \nour economy and, indeed, on our way of life.\n  I guess in many ways the title of the presentation is ``Why Carbon \nCredits Don't Matter.'' So many folks, so many companies, so many \npeople particularly within the beltway are concerned about their \nallocation of carbon credits. But because of these significant sections \nin the bill which also exist word-for-word in the Waxman-Markey bill, \nthe carbon credits will not matter because sections 705 and 707 will \nshut down significant economic activity, no matter what carbon credits \ncertain people and certain companies have.\n  Let me explain what I am talking about. Section 705(e) and section \n707 are very important in the bill. Basically, section 705(e) says that \nwe are to track the global measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and \nspecifically to see if they are held below a threshold set in the bill, \na goal set in the bill of 450 parts per million carbon dioxide \nequivalent. Then section 707 says that, beginning July 1, 2015, if the \nglobal concentrations are above this 450 parts per million line, then:\n\n       . . . the President shall direct relevant Federal agencies \n     to use existing statutory authority to take appropriate \n     actions identified in the reports submitted under sections \n     705 and 706 and to address any shortfalls identified in such \n     reports.\n\n  What does that mean? That means if you bust this 450 parts per \nmillion line, the President does not have authority to take action; he \nis mandated to take every administrative action possible, to use every \nagency in the Federal Government under him--he shall direct them to \naddress whatever shortfalls there are between that 450 parts per \nmillion line and where the measurements are.\n  One significant factor in all of this, whether we can ever reach that \ngoal of limiting greenhouse gases to 450 parts per million, is what \nother countries, particularly the developing world, are going to do.\n  One thing that is really problematic with this entire plan is the G5 \ndeveloping countries and Russia have made it crystal clear that they \nwill not accept any hard caps. I cite here a clear quote from a top \nChinese Foreign Ministry official, a clear quote from the Minister of \nState for Environment of India and the top economic adviser of Russia's \nPresident about that issue. All of these statements and many more make \nit crystal clear that the G5 and Russia will not accept any such hard \ncap.\n  This is a pretty significant issue. Because of this, I wrote to the \nEPA on July 15 and asked several questions. One is basic to this issue: \nWhat does your modeling say if the G5 and Russia reject hard caps? That \nis a pretty significant scenario because it seems pretty clear that it \nis the scenario that will happen based on the statements of those \ncountries. The EPA answered that it has not even analyzed that \nscenario. These other countries have made it clear they are going to \nreject hard caps. The EPA has not analyzed this scenario.\n  Because of that, I then went to the Department of Energy's Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory. That is the leading modeling expert in \nthese matters that Federal Government agencies, starting with the EPA, \ndepend upon. In fact, the EPA helped direct us to this laboratory. I \nasked the same question: What does the modeling say if the G5 and \nRussia reject hard caps as they have absolutely promised to do? The \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory answered that none of the models \nthey use--and they use 10 models--none of those models, under this \nscenario, produced global concentrations at or below 450 ppm of CO-\nequivalent greenhouse gases. So under all of those models we break \nthrough this goal set in the bill.\n  This chart shows what DOE's specific Northwest National Laboratory \nmodel predicts when the G5 and Russia reject all hard caps. Already we \nare in the four hundreds. In about 1 year we break through the 450 \nlimit--451. Then it goes up from there.\n  What does that mean in the context of this legislation and, \nspecifically, the sections I talked about a minute ago? Well, the \nlegislation says that on July 1, 2015, if this green line is above 450, \nthen the President is mandated to take whatever action is necessary: \nUse all tools available to get us back to this 450 limit.\n  Under this scenario, the G5 and Russia rejecting hard caps, which is \nan absolute certainty based on their clear pronouncements, this \nmandate, under those significant sections of the legislation, both \nKerry-Boxer and Waxman-Markey, exactly the same language in both, this \nmandate goes into effect and would absolutely go into effect.\n  What does that mean? Well, the first thing it means is carbon \ncredits, which everybody is so focused on, so many people and companies \nare fixated on, carbon credits will not matter if your project, if your \neconomic activity takes any discretionary Federal permit because, \nbeginning July 1, 2015, the President will be mandated, not authorized, \nnot encouraged, nothing is suggested, he will be mandated to take\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nany action possible to get us down to that limit. That would include \ndenying all discretionary permit requests.\n  What else does it mean? It means, under that mandate in the law, you \ncan bet that every leftwing environmental group in the world, much less \nin this country, will sue to block all economic activity that requires \ndiscretionary permits. Quite frankly, they will have a very compelling \ncase. They will point to this legislative language, if it is enacted, \nand say: Time out. The President is not just authorized to do this, the \nPresident is not just encouraged to do this, the President is mandated \nto take every action he can, which clearly would include denying all \ndiscretionary permits to push that curve, that green curve, back down \nto 450 or as low as it can go.\n  So what does that mean? That means carbon credits are meaningless if \nyou need a discretionary permit for certain economic activity or for \nany new economic project. This is a very important aspect of the bill. \nAgain, it is in Kerry-Boxer. Exactly the same language is also in \nWaxman-Markey as it passed the full House of Representatives.\n  This gives an enormous mandate to the President of the United States \nto absolutely take action once those global greenhouse gas emissions \nget above 450. So my message is clear, particularly to the companies \nthat have supported this legislation because they have been assured \ncertain carbon credits.\n  The message is clear: Carbon credits will not matter if any of your \nactivities, if any of your new projects or proposed projects requires \nany discretionary Federal permit. To deliver that message, crystal \nclear, to those companies, in particular, tomorrow I am writing to a \nsignificant leading handful of those companies that so far have \nsupported the legislation, pointing out the enormous impact of those \nsections, 705 and 707, and asking them to focus very clearly on what it \nmeans to their projects, to their economic activity, to their bottom \nline because, again, carbon credits will not matter once this enormous \nmandate and authority of the President goes into effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill and urge its \nquick and prompt adoption.\n  In doing so, I wish to pay tribute to a fallen warrior from the State \nof Maryland who died in the terrible massacre at Fort Hood. I wish to \nexpress my condolences to all families who suffered the loss of life or \nwere injured at that terrible shooting. It was a terrible tragedy for \nthem at Fort Hood, for their families, and for our country.\n  We know the 13 families are now dealing with the loss of loved ones, \nand 30 other families have members who were wounded in the attack. We \nin Maryland suffered a casualty as well. I am here today to pay my \nrespects and express my condolences to the family of LTC Juanita \nWarman, a wonderful woman who moved to Maryland 5 years ago as a call \nto duty. She had a 25-year military career in both the Active and \nReserve Army. She devoted her career to serving fellow soldiers.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Warman was a nurse practitioner. Her field was in \npsychiatric and emotional counseling. She served in other parts of the \ncountry and came as a call to duty to Perry Point Veterans Hospital in \nMaryland. There she served to help our wounded warriors. Perry Point is \nthe designated facility in Maryland to help wounded warriors, those who \nbear the permanent injury of war, who bear the wounds of either \nemotional or mental illness. She was absolutely on their side. She was \nviewed as a consummate professional by her colleagues and by the people \nwho relied upon her for her talented counseling.\n  A master's degree in nursing, she was an expert in posttraumatic \nstress as well as traumatic brain injury. She devoted her career to \nhelping these soldiers as she did her family. Her family saw her as a \nmother to two, a grandmother to eight, and two stepchildren as well. \nShe was raised in a military family. She understood the bonds between \nfellow soldiers. She also volunteered as part of a program called the \nMaryland Yellow Ribbon Program to help soldiers reintegrate into the \ncommunity. She developed guidelines to dispel myths about PTSD. She \nparticularly would reach out to women soldiers who had unique \nchallenges, both in their own life and the lives of their families.\n  She provided mental health counseling to soldiers coming out of a war \nzone trying to come into a family zone so that family zone didn't \nbecome a battleground as well. She also was well known for her work at \nRamstein Hospital. She traveled there in many instances to help our \nsoldiers make the transition from battlefield to the hospital in \nGermany to back here. She received an Army commendation medal for her \nmeritorious service at Ramstein. She was a great soldier.\n  She was at Fort Hood less than 24 hours. She was getting ready to \ndeploy to Iraq. She was ready to go, though she was sad to go. From her \nlast posting on Facebook, she knew she would be away for the holidays \nfrom her beloved husband Philip, her children, grandchildren, and \nstepchildren. But there were no stepchildren; they were all her \nchildren to Lieutenant Colonel Warman.\n  We are going to miss her. Her family is going to miss her. We are \ngoing to miss her in Maryland because she was an active member of the \ncommunity. The Army is going to miss her. Most of all, those who need \nmental health counseling will miss her. We are so sorry this happened \nto her.\n  There will be those who will want to wear yellow ribbons and black \narmbands and have flags at half mast. And we should. We should do all \nthe symbols to honor what happened to those who fell at Fort Hood. But \nthe best way to honor the people in the massacre at Fort Hood, to honor \nthe people who have been wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan is to pass this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation pending is the Military Construction and VA health \nbill. There is so much good in this bill that will provide medical \nservices to those who bear the permanent and sometimes invisible wounds \nof war. While we want to salute those who fell at Fort Hood and on the \nbattlegrounds of Iraq and Afghanistan, the way we honor their memory \nand their service, the service of all who have been abroad, is by \nmaking sure when they come home, they get the medical and social \nservices they need, a bridge to get them back into civilian life.\n  Again, my condolences to the Warman family and to all who fell, but \nmost of all I thank everybody for their service. Let's thank them not \nonly with words but with deeds. Let's pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2740 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I call up amendment No. 2740 and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2740.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To extend the authority for a regional office of the \n   Department of Veterans Affairs in the Republic of the Philippines)\n\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229.  Section 315(b) of title 38, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking ``December 31, 2009'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2010''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this week, thousands of families across \nour country are stopping to honor the\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nmemory of those who have served for us because of Veterans Day tomorrow \nand to thank them for all they have done to protect and defend our \ncountry. It is a time when many American families are watching what is \nunfolding at Fort Hood this week. It is a time in my State where today \nwe are having a memorial service at Fort Lewis honoring seven soldiers \nwho lost their lives a few days ago in Afghanistan. Our hearts and \ncondolences go out to those families who have suffered the ultimate \nloss, especially at this time when everyone is recognizing the \ntremendous sacrifice so many people have given.\n  As a Senator from a State with a very large military presence and \ncommunities that are heavily populated with the men and women who \ndedicate their lives to protecting our country, I was particularly \nsaddened by the senseless violence that ripped through our Nation's \nlargest active-duty base last Thursday. As anyone who has ever spent \ntime on a U.S. military base knows well, those are some of our most \nsafe and compassionate communities in the entire country. They are \nplaces where a young family plants roots and raises a child and \nestablishes a life for themselves. They are a place where military \nspouses form bonds that they carry with them throughout their \ndeployments. They are a place where neighbors always lend a hand to \nthose in need. I have seen that firsthand at places such as Fort Lewis \nArmy Base in Tacoma and Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane. I know the \npain of the loss of those 13 public servants extends to everyone at \nFort Hood and to the U.S. military community as a whole.\n  I wish to make special mention today of Michael Grant Cahill who came \nfrom Spokane, WA. He was the lone civilian killed in that attack. He \nwas a physician's assistant who worked in rural clinics and veterans \nhospitals, places where our veterans desperately need care and we \ndesperately need workers. At the time of his death, he was only 4 years \nfrom retirement. In an interview with the Spokesman-Review newspaper a \nday after her father was killed, Cahill's daughter Keely told the paper \nthat her dad was ``a wonderful person, that he loved his job and loved \nworking with people and helping them with their physical needs.''\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Keely and the family members of all \nthose who died or were wounded and the U.S. military families who are \nstill reeling from this tragedy.\n  To the families who have lost soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan \nrecently, especially those having military services today in my home \nState of Washington at Fort Lewis as well as many others, I want them \nto know that we know we are their voice and we need to stand up for \nthem. As we all know, Veterans Day tomorrow is a day we celebrate and \nhonor the great sacrifices all veterans have made. It is because of \ntheir sacrifice that we can safely enjoy the freedoms our country \noffers. It is because of their unmatched commitment that America can \nremain a beacon for democracy and freedom throughout the world.\n  Growing up I saw firsthand the many ways military service can affect \nboth veterans and their families. My father served in World War II. He \nwas among the first soldiers to land in Okinawa. He came home as a \ndisabled veteran and was awarded the Purple Heart. Like many soldiers \nof my dad's generation, he didn't talk about his experiences during the \nwar. In fact, we only learned about what he did and his heroism when he \npassed away, and we found his journals and read them. I think that \nexperience offers a larger lesson about veterans in general. They are \nvery reluctant to call attention to their service, and they are \nreluctant to ask for help. That is why we have to publicly recognize \ntheir sacrifices and contributions. It is up to all of us to make sure \nthey get the recognition they have earned and, by the way, not only on \nVeterans Day. Our veterans held up their end of the deal. We have to \nhold up ours.\n  Veterans Day must not only be a day of remembrance, it must also be a \nday of reflection. It is a chance for all of us to reflect on our own \nresponsibilities to our Nation's veterans. It is a chance to look at \nwhat we can do to make sure we are keeping the promise we made to our \nmen and women when they signed up to serve. It is a chance to take \nstock of where care and benefits have fallen short, where new needs are \nemerging, and how we can make it easier for veterans to get the care \nand benefits they deserve.\n  It is appropriate that on the eve of this very important day, \nVeterans Day, we are working to pass a bill that takes a hard look at \nmany of the challenges facing veterans and their families. It is a bill \nthat is the product of collaboration with veterans, their families, \ncaregivers, and scores of veterans service organizations.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am aware we have a \nlot of work to do for the men and women who serve our country. Not only \nmust we continually strive to keep up our commitment to veterans from \nall wars, but we also have to respond to the new and different issues \nfacing veterans who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, wars that \nare being fought under conditions that are very different from those of \nthe past. That is precisely what the caregiver and veterans omnibus \nhealth bill seeks to do.\n  One of the changes we have seen in our veterans population recently \nis the growing number of women veterans who are seeking care at the VA. \nToday more women are serving in the military than ever before. Over the \nnext 5 years, the amount of women seeking care at the VA is expected to \ndouble. Not only are women answering the call to serve at unprecedented \nlevels, they are also often serving in a very different capacity. In \nIraq and Afghanistan, we have seen wars that don't have traditional \nfront lines. All of our servicemembers, including women, find \nthemselves on the front lines. Whether it is working at a checkpoint or \nhelping to search and clear neighborhoods or supporting supply convoys, \nwomen servicemembers face many of the same risks from IEDs and ambushes \nas their male counterparts. But while the nature of their service has \nchanged in these conflicts, the VA has been very slow to change the \nnature of the care they provide when these women return home.\n  Today at the VA there is an insufficient number of doctors and staff \nwith specific training and experience in women's health issues. Even \nthe VA's own internal studies have shown that women veterans are \nunderserved. That is why we included in the veterans health bill a bill \nI have introduced and worked on that will enable the VA to better \nunderstand and ultimately treat the unique needs of female veterans. \nThe bill authorizes a number of new programs and studies, including a \ncomprehensive look at the barriers women currently face when they try \nto get care at the VA. It includes a study of women who have served in \nIraq and Afghanistan to assess how those conflicts affected their \nhealth. It includes a requirement that the VA implement a program to \ntrain and educate and certify VA mental health professionals to care \nfor women with sexual trauma and a pilot program that provides \nchildcare to women veterans who seek mental health care services at the \nVA because, as we know, women will choose to take care of their kids \nbefore they take care of themselves. I believe we need to provide that \nchildcare so those women get the care they need.\n\n  This bill I am talking about is the result of many discussions with \nwomen veterans on the unique and very personal problems they face when \nthey return home from war. Oftentimes, when I hold veterans meetings in \nmy State, the men who are there speak up and talk to me about some of \nthe barriers they face, and it is not until the meeting closes and \neverybody is going out the door that the women come up to me and speak \nsilently and as quietly as they can in my ear about the barriers they \nface. Some of these women have told me they did not even view \nthemselves as a veteran and therefore did not even think of seeking \ncare at the VA. Oftentimes, they have told me they lack privacy at \ntheir local VA or they felt intimidated when they walked in the doors. \nThey have told me about being forced into a caregiving role that \nprevented them from even asking for care because they had to struggle \nto find a babysitter in order to keep an appointment. They should not \nhave to speak quietly into my ear at the end of a meeting. They have \nserved our country honorably. We should move this women veterans health \nbill so they get the care they support.\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\n  To me and to the bipartisan group of Senators who cosponsored the \nwomen veterans bill, these barriers to care they face are unacceptable. \nSo as we now have more women transitioning back home and stepping back \ninto their careers and their lives as mothers and wives, this VA has to \nbe there for them. So this bill in the omnibus bill in front of us will \nhelp the VA to modernize to meet those needs.\n  Another way this bill meets the changing needs of our veterans is in \nthe area of assisting caregivers in the home.\n  As we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, medical advances have helped \nsave the lives of many of our servicemembers who in previous conflicts \nwould have perished from the severity of their wounds. But these \nmedical miracles mean that many of those who have been catastrophically \nwounded now need round-the-clock care when they come home.\n  In many of our rural areas, where access to health care services is \nvery limited, the burden of providing that care often--and most often--\nfalls on the family of that severely injured veteran. For those family \nmembers who are providing care to their loved ones, it now becomes a \nfull-time job for them. They often, I have been told, have to quit \ntheir current jobs--forfeiting not only their source of income but also \ntheir own health care insurance at the same time. It is a sacrifice \nthat is far too great, especially for families who have already \nsacrificed so much.\n  So this underlying omnibus bill we are trying to bring forward \nprovides caregivers with health care and counseling and support and, \nimportantly, a stipend so they can take care of their loved ones when \nthey come home.\n  This bill also takes steps to provide dental insurance to veterans \nand survivors and their dependents and improves mental health care \nservices and eases the transition from Active Duty to civilian life. It \nexpands outreach and technology so we can provide better care for \nveterans in our rural areas. And it initiates three programs to address \nhomelessness among veterans, which is especially troubling during these \neconomic times.\n  This is a bill that is supported by numerous veterans service \norganizations and the VA. It is supported by many leading medical \ngroups. It was passed in our Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee with \nbroad bipartisan support after hearings with health care experts and VA \nofficials and veterans and, importantly, their families.\n  Like other omnibus veterans health care bills before it--bills that \nhave often been passed on this floor with overwhelming support--it puts \nveterans before politics. It is a bipartisan bill designed to move \nswiftly so its programs can be implemented swiftly. It is a bipartisan \nbill that is designed to make sure our veterans do not become political \npawns. Yet here we are today facing delays.\n  The fact that this bill is now being held hostage by ideology is both \na disservice to our veterans and a troubling precedent for our future \nefforts to meet their needs. Providing for our veterans used to be an \narea where political affiliation fell by the wayside. But today, \nbecause of an effort to score political points on issues that are far \nremoved from the struggles of families who are delivering care to their \nloved ones with injuries or women veterans who are returning home to an \nunprepared VA or the mounting toll of this economy on homeless \nveterans, we are faced with delay on the floor. For our Nation's \nveterans, it is a delay they cannot afford. Our aging veterans and the \nbrave men and women who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan \nneed our help now. And how we treat them at this critical time will \nsend a signal to a generation of young people who might now be sitting \nat home considering whether they want to go into the military.\n  It is imperative that we keep our promise to our veterans--the same \npromise Abraham Lincoln made to America's veterans 140 years ago--``to \ncare for the veteran who has borne the battle, his widow and his \norphan.''\n  Our veterans have waited long enough for many of the improvements in \nthis bill. We should not ask them to wait any longer. So I urge our \ncolleague to withdraw his objection to consideration of this bill and \nto let us move it quickly through the Senate so the families and the \nservicemembers who are waiting for its passage--whether it is a family \ntaking care of a veteran who has been seriously injured or a woman \nveteran or anyone who has served our country--can know we stand behind \nthem when they serve our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, may I ask the Chair, are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I actually came to the floor to join with \nSenator Thune and to congratulate him on the effort he has undertaken \nto rededicate a site in Washington, DC, to become the National World \nWar I Memorial. I am an original cosponsor on that legislation, and \napparently he is tied up in some sort of meeting right now, so I will \njust precede him and give my thoughts and my support for the \nlegislation he has introduced.\n\n\n                      Marine Corps 234th Birthday\n\n  Before I do that, Mr. President, I would like to point out that this \nis November 10, and marines around the world stop on this day every \nyear--no matter where they are, no matter what they are doing--to \ncommemorate what we call the Marine Corps birthday, which is the \ncelebration of the initial recruitment and organization of the Marine \nCorps, at a place called Tun Tavern in Philadelphia in 1775.\n  This is the 234th anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps. As \none who has proudly served in the U.S. Marines, who has a brother who \nwas a marine, a son who is a marine, and a son-in-law--three of us \ninfantry combat veterans--I would like to extend my congratulations to \nall of those who served in the Marine Corps in the past and to those \nwho are doing such a fine and difficult job today all around the world. \nThis is the finest fighting organization in the world, and I am very \nproud to have been a part of it at one point in my life.\n\n  We all wish success and the best to our marines.\n\n\n                 Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, where we will stop as a \nnation with a national holiday to commemorate the service of all of \nthose who have served our country throughout our history and to thank \nthe 23.4 million veterans in this country for the service they have \ngiven in war and in peace, extending all the way back, in terms of \nliving veterans, to World War I, which I am going to talk about in a \nminute. I think we have one surviving veteran from World War I still \nalive. We have some 2.6 million World War II veterans who are still \nwith us. And we want to, as so many people have pointed out today, do \nour best to take care of those who have served our country, to honor \nthat service.\n  With respect to the legislation Senator Thune put together and on \nwhich I am an original cosponsor, we should stop today and think about \nthose who served in World War I. I think the memorial he is proposing \nhas three important benefits to our country. The first is that it will \nhelp us remember a war that I think is not really appropriately \nremembered in our own history--the importance of it, the incredible \ncarnage that took place, the way it changed the face of the civilized \nworld. The second is to think about our own World War I veterans and \nthe struggles they went through and in terms of putting together the \nright sort of care and benefits for those who followed them. The third \nis to talk about the site itself that Senator Thune has done such a \nfine job in discovering and proposing.\n  We in this country did not get involved in World War I until the very\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nend of the war. I think that is one of the reasons, perhaps, we do not \nconsider in enough detail how much of an impact that war had on the \ncivilized world as it was then known, on the relationships particularly \namong the European powers, and also the place of the United States in \nworld affairs.\n  These numbers are rough, but they are fairly close; I think they are \naccurate enough that I can use them today: In World War I, the German \nArmy lost 1.8 million soldiers, dead; the French lost 1.7 million \nsoldiers, dead; the British Empire lost nearly a million soldiers, \ndead. The impact on those cultures and on the economy and the health of \nthe communities was enormous. We came in at the end of the war. The \nUnited States lost 55,000 soldiers on the battlefield in less than a \nyear. We lost another 55,000 to the Asian flu epidemic that swept \nthrough the world and had a very strong impact on those who were \nserving in the military. We lost 110,000 people in uniform during that \nwar.\n  The impact it had on the relationships among European countries was \nenormous, and it is much more fully understood in other countries than \nit is here in the United States. The Russian Revolution occurred during \nWorld War I. The way we negotiated the settlement after World War I \nbrought about, within a short period of time, the rise of fascism and, \neventually, of nazism in Germany. The British Empire began to spend \nitself down in a way that finally had a fairly conclusive impact after \nthe additional carnage of World War II.\n  All of those things impacted this country in a way that pushed us to \nthe forefront in many ways in terms of our place in the world because \nof the exhaustion that had happened in these other societies.\n  Our World War I veterans had a very difficult time in a transitional \nperiod in terms of how we define veterans' benefits themselves. \nPrevious to World War I, when soldiers left the military, they got what \nwas called mustering-out pay, and when they reached a certain age, no \nmatter what their service was in terms of disability or those sorts of \nthings, they got a pension, an automatic pension, all the way through \nour history until World War I. World War I veterans didn't get either \nof those.\n  Some of us who are fond of looking at American history in the 1930s \nwill remember the Veterans Bonus March, where World War I veterans \nliterally camped out here in our Nation's Capital, saying they needed \nto get the same kind of bonuses that those who had preceded them \nreceived. They didn't receive that bonus. They did fight hard and long \nand were able to bring about the creation of the VA medical system, but \nthey didn't get a GI bill; they didn't get so many things the other \nveterans who followed them received. Yet when I was much younger and \nworking as a committee counsel in the House on veterans issues, we were \nstill seeing the World War I veterans. They felt a stewardship to those \nwho served in World War II. They helped push through the GI bill. They \nhelped push through compensation packages that were unheard of before. \nWe owe our World War I veterans a great deal, not simply for what they \ndid on the battlefield but for how they helped transform veterans law \ninto today.\n  The site Senator Thune proposed--and with which I agree--for a World \nWar I memorial, I believe, is perfectly placed. We are all very \nsensitive in terms of putting additional memorials and monuments on The \nNational Mall. I was involved in the formulation stages of the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial on The Mall. That was one of the big push-backs in \nCongress, as well as from the National Capital Planning Commission and \nother entities; that we don't want to put so many memorials on The Mall \nthat you impact the free flow of tourists and people visiting that \narea.\n  Right now, here is what we have on The Mall. I wish I had a diagram, \nbut we have the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, just down from the Lincoln \nMemorial, and to its south we have the Korean War Memorial and further \nto the east, toward the Washington Monument, we have the World War II \nMemorial. Almost in a diagrammatic diamond there is an area presently \nwhere the District of Columbia was allowed to place a memorial to those \nwho had served in World War I and were residents of the District of \nColumbia.\n  What Senator Thune has proposed, and what I strongly also support, is \nto take this existing memorial, which is in some disrepair at the \nmoment, quite frankly--I have been by there a number of times--and to \nupgrade it so it would become the National World War I Memorial, so we \nwould have on The Mall, in a very tasteful way, four sites dedicated to \nthe four major wars our country was involved in, in the 20th century. I \ncan't think of a better way right now for us to recommend and remember \nthe service of those who served in World War I and for the rest of the \npeople in this country also to be encouraged to remember the impact \nthat war had and the sacrifices the people who served in that war made.\n  So I rise, as I mentioned earlier, to commend the Senator from South \nDakota for his recommendation, as well as, as I said, to remember the \nMarine Corps today and to remember our veterans tomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Virginia \nin support of this legislation and I thank him for his leadership on \nthis and on so many of the other issues and initiatives that recognize \nthe service and sacrifice of America's veterans. He has been a leader \non that, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue because I think, \nas we prepare to observe Veterans Day tomorrow, it is important to \nrecognize those veterans who served throughout our Nation's history. \nAlong with Senator Rockefeller, Senator Webb and I have introduced \nlegislation that is known as the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial \nAct, which recognizes, once and for all, those veterans who served \ntheir country during World War I.\n  Frank Buckles's World War I Memorial Act would rededicate the \nexisting District of Columbia War Memorial as the National and District \nof Columbia World War I Memorial on The National Mall in Washington, \nDC. The act is named for Frank Buckles of West Virginia who, at 108 \nyears of age, is the last surviving American World War I veteran.\n  I appreciate the strong support of Senator Rockefeller who, of \ncourse, has Frank Buckles as a constituent, and I appreciate also the \nstrong support of Senator Webb for this bill. Senator Burr, the ranking \nmember of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, is also a cosponsor, so \nit has strong and meaningful support on both sides of the aisle.\n  As I said, I think it is very fitting to speak on a bill seeking to \nestablish a national World War I memorial because, as many know, \nVeterans Day was initially known as Armistice Day, which marked the end \nof World War I on November 11 of 1918.\n  After America's role in World War II and the Korean war, Congress \npassed legislation changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day, and \nPresident Eisenhower signed the change into law on June 1, 1954. From \ninitially being a day to honor World War I veterans, November 11 became \na day to honor all veterans.\n  We are rapidly nearing a century since the beginning of World War I, \nwhich began for most of the world in July of 1914. While World War I \nhas become a distant, fading memory of another era, it still profoundly \nshapes the world in which we live.\n  As Oxford historian Hew Strachan concludes in his history of the \nfirst World War, the war ``forced a reluctant United States onto the \nworld stage'' and began to ``lay the seeds for the conflict in the \nMiddle East. In short, it shaped not just Europe but the world in the \n20th century.''\n  World War I began for the United States when it entered the war in \nApril of 1917 on the western front because of German submarine attacks \non United States shipping and because President Woodrow Wilson \nconcluded that the United States had to wage war if it was to shape the \nfuture of international relations, as Hew Strachan states in his \nhistory of World War I.\n  The United States was in World War I for only 18 months. Its Army \ngrew from only 100,000 men to 4 million, with 2 million men sent \noverseas, 1\\1/2\\ million of whom arrived in Europe in the last 6 months \nof the war. Forty-two American divisions were in the field by November \n11 in 1918, and 29 of them had\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\nseen action. Over 100,000 American soldiers died in World War I.\n  Frank Buckles is the last surviving American World War I veteran. He \nwas born in Missouri and currently lives in West Virginia. He joined \nthe Army at 16 and went to Europe to fight in 1917, driving ambulances \nand motorcycles for a casualty detachment. He was discharged from the \nArmy in 1919. Mr. Buckles also was extraordinarily affected by World \nWar II. He was in Manila as a civilian on business in December of 1941, \nwhen the Japanese attacked, and was captured by the Japanese and spent \n4 years in a Japanese prison camp in the Philippines. I strongly urge \neveryone to track down his interview, where he talks about his war \nexperiences in both World War I and World War II. Transcripts and \nvideos of Frank Buckles' interview can be found on the Library of \nCongress's Veterans History Project Web site. The Veterans History \nProject is a great initiative. I have taken advantage of the Veterans \nHistory Project myself, to interview my dad about his experiences as a \npilot in World War II.\n  Mr. Buckles is also the honorary chairman of the World War I Memorial \nFoundation, which is seeking refurbishment of the District of Columbia \nWar Memorial and its establishment as the National World War I Memorial \non The National Mall. The Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act will \nhelp to make this vision a reality.\n  I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Buckles last year. He is certainly \nan extraordinary individual. Mr. Buckles also traveled to South Dakota \nin July of 2008 to be honored at Mount Rushmore during their \nmagnificent Fourth of July celebration. It is a great honor for me to \nsupport this bill that carries his name.\n  I wish to briefly describe what the bill does. In 1924, Congress \nauthorized the construction of a war memorial on The National Mall near \nthe Lincoln Memorial to honor the 499 District of Columbia residents \nwho died in World War I. Funded by private donations from organizations \nand individuals, the memorial was dedicated by President Herbert Hoover \non November 11, 1931. The Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act would \nrededicate the District of Columbia Memorial as the National and \nDistrict of Columbia World War I Memorial. The legislation would also \nauthorize the nonprofit World War I Memorial Foundation to make repairs \nand improvements to the existing memorial, as well as install new \nsculptures to underscore the sacrifice of over 4 million Americans who \nserved in World War I.\n\n  The bill would not require any taxpayer dollars because the World War \nI Memorial Foundation would raise the necessary funds through private \ndonations.\n  All the major wars our Nation has fought in the 20th century are \nmemorialized on The National Mall. Rededicating the District of \nColumbia World War I Memorial as the National and District of Columbia \nWorld War I Memorial fits the narrative of The Mall, with its wonderful \nmemorials to World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. I think \nit only makes sense to rededicate a memorial to this 20th century war \nthat established our Nation's path to superpower status among the \ncommunity of nations.\n  This Veterans Day will mark the 91st anniversary of the end of World \nWar I. I can think of no better way to honor Mr. Buckles and his \ndeparted comrades than by quickly passing this bill to establish a \nnational World War I memorial. This bill would provide timely but long \noverdue recognition of all World War I veterans in our Nation's \ncapital. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill \nas soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me join the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, and Senator Thune in endorsing the \nconcept of this World War I memorial. I am a student--a minor, amateur \nstudent of history, and I realize the dramatic impact that war had on \nthe United States. It is amazing to know there is still a surviving \nveteran from that great conflict.\n  When I first got involved in politics, I would go to rural counties \nin Illinois, and there would be a flatbed truck with five or six World \nWar I vets on it. Of course, they are gone. They were a great \ngeneration that sacrificed and engaged in a war so far away at such \ngreat peril. It is fitting that there be an update of that monument. I \nhave walked by it. In its day, I am sure it was a glorious monument, \nbut it needs attention today for it to be a fitting tribute to the men \nand women who served our Nation during that great conflict. I heartily \nsupport it. I wish to thank Senator Johnson, the chairman of this \nappropriations subcommittee, for entertaining this as part of his \nlegislation.\n  I will tell my colleagues we had a press conference today on another \nissue involving veterans. It is one that means a lot to me, personally, \nbecause it involves a family whom I have become very close to. It is \nthe Edmondson family. They live in North Carolina. I met them by chance \nwhen Eric Edmondson, who was a veteran of the war in Iraq, was being \ntreated at a hospital in Chicago. Eric was a victim of a traumatic \nbrain injury and in surgery after his injury there was deprivation of \noxygen and he has become a quadriplegic and cannot speak. When I first \nmet him 2 years ago, he was 27 years old, a husband and father of a \nlittle baby girl. I met his father Ed and his mother Marybeth. They \nwere people who came to a hearing I held on veterans health care. They \ntalked about the journey Eric had made from Iraq to the United States \nand then to Chicago to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.\n  They had all but given up on Eric because of his injuries and, at one \npoint, they told his father he would have to be admitted to a nursing \nhome at the age of 27 because there was nothing they could do. It \nappeared he was headed in that direction until his father said: No, I \nwon't do this to my son.\n  What followed has been a heroic story--heroism matching, I believe, \nthe courage his son showed in volunteering to serve our country and \nrisk his life--because Eric's father, Ed, started his own personal \neffort to find the very best place in America for Eric's treatment. He \ncame up with the Rehab Institute of Chicago.\n  I went to visit Eric at the Rehab Institute, when he was there 2 \nyears ago. When I walked into the room, he was sitting in a wheelchair \nwith a big smile. He cannot speak. We talked a little bit about his \ntreatment there. They invited me to come back. I came back a few weeks \nlater, about 6 weeks later, and they said Eric had a gift for me. I \ndidn't know what they meant by that. His mother and dad each grabbed an \nelbow, stood him up, and Eric took four steps out of his wheelchair. It \nwas an amazing moment. There wasn't a dry eye in that hospital room \nthat day; that he had made the progress where he could literally take \nfour steps. His father said he would be checking out of the Rehab \nInstitute in Chicago a few weeks after that and invited me to come \nbecause, he said: Eric is going to put on his dress uniform and he is \ngoing to walk out the front door of this hospital.\n  I said: I will be there. So was the mayor of Chicago and every other \npolitician who heard about it, and every TV camera in Chicago was there \nto see Eric make it out the front door, with the help of two attendants \nby his side. There he was with a big smile on his face in his dress \nuniform.\n  Well, Eric returned to North Carolina, and because of the amazing \ngenerosity of a lot of local people, they literally built him and his \nfamily a home that was wheelchair accessible. Because of that \ngenerosity, he had a place to live but still with a very young wife and \na baby girl.\n  His mother and father decided they would quit their jobs and move in \nwith their son and become full-time caregivers to Eric Edmondson, this \nveteran of the Iraq war, and that is what happened. His father \nbasically cashed in all his savings, sold his home, sold his business, \ntook what he had and dedicated himself to his son--totally dedicated \nhimself to his son.\n  Over the period of time that Ed and Marybeth were taking care of \nEric, they lost their health insurance. But Eric was still being cared \nfor by the veterans system. I went down to visit them in their home. It \nwas clear they spent every minute of every day caring for their son.\n  Mr. Edmondson asked me to take a look at a bill that Senator Hillary \nClinton had introduced called the Caregivers Assistance Act which said \nthe\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\nVeterans' Administration should start off on a demonstration basis to \ntake a look at caregivers, such as the Edmondson family, and give them \na helping hand. I asked Senator Clinton as she was leaving the Senate \nand heading for the State Department if I could take over the bill, and \nshe said I could.\n  I introduced it in this session of Congress. Senator Danny Akaka, the \nchairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, read the bill and \ncalled me and said: I want to move this bill. I want to make it a major \npiece of legislation to help veterans. That bill was considered by the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee and was reported out unanimously.\n  What the bill would do is create a program in the Veterans' \nAdministration for caregivers, such as Ed and Marybeth Edmondson. What \nit would give them is training so they would know how to take care of \ntheir son, a disabled veteran--training in basic first aid and health \ncare.\n  Second, it would provide them with a monthly stipend which the \nVeterans' Administration would determine is appropriate so they would \nhave some help in getting by with the expenses of keeping their family \ntogether and helping their veteran.\n  It would also give them a respite for a couple weeks so at least they \nwould be able to have some time off and others would come in and take \ncare of the veteran while they went off and recharged their batteries \nand came back and dedicated themselves again to the veteran.\n  It would provide basic health insurance for caregivers as well \nbecause that is one of the first things they lose when they give up a \njob or business to take on this responsibility.\n  This is just one family's story from our recent war that still goes \non. There are others. I met another one in Chicago on Sunday, Aimee \nZmysly, who literally married her husband after he came home and became \ndisabled from an operation at a veterans hospital. This 23-year-old \nwoman married this young man who had no family and now is his full-time \npersonal care attendant. Because of it, he can stay home; he is not in \na formal facility.\n  The cost of his care is a fraction of what it would be otherwise, and \nhe has the dignity of being where he wants to be--with someone who \nloves him very much, who spends every moment of every day helping him.\n  This is the right thing to do. This caregivers bill is the \nappropriate thing to do. For at least 6,000 veterans across America, \nthere is a personal family caregiver who makes the difference every day \nin their lives, a person who will be there for them every second they \nneed them. You cannot buy that kind of help. Even the best medical \nprofessionals could not provide the love that comes with that care.\n  I think the Veterans' Administration, certainly the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, recognizes that. That is why this legislation is \ncurrently on the calendar of the Senate. It has been here now for over \n6 weeks. I had hoped we could pass this before this Veterans Day, \ntomorrow. But, unfortunately, it is being held by one Senator.\n  The Senator and I debated it on the floor yesterday. He said he \ndoesn't want us to even consider this bill. We cannot even debate this \nbill. He would not even offer an amendment to this bill. He wants to \nstop this bill, he said, because I haven't figured out a way to pay \nthese caregivers.\n  We reminded him that during the course of this war, we waged this war \nand paid for it with debt. The former administration did not pay for \nany of the war expenses. They added them to the debt of the United \nStates. That Senator and others--myself included--voted to continue \nthat war, understanding that it was not being paid for.\n  Now when it comes to caring for the veterans and the casualties of \nthat war, we have a strict accounting standard, a deficit standard that \nwas not applied to waging a war. Why is it the cost of the war--the \nbullets and the bombs--does not have to be paid for, but when it comes \nto the care of our veterans who come home, we have this strict \naccounting; we cannot consider helping them unless there is some \nspecific way of demonstrating how to pay for it?\n  I believe we will pay for it, I believe we should have it, and I \nbelieve this Senator for veterans in 2009 should lift his hold on this \nbill and let us consider it on the Senate floor. Let us have this \ndebate. Let us determine who will be covered by it and what kind of \ncoverage they will have.\n  These caregivers will not quit on us because they will not quit on \ntheir veteran. Why should we quit on them? Why should we say we are not \ngoing to provide them help when every moment of every day they are \nhelping a man or woman who literally risked their lives for our country \nand paid a heavy price in doing so?\n  I also have two other amendments. One of my amendments now pending \nbefore the Senate on this appropriations bill is the capstone of a \nproject that I have been working on for a long time.\n  It seems that right outside of Chicago in Lake County, north of \nChicago, is a great veterans hospital known as the North Chicago \nVeterans Hospital. It is modern. It serves thousands of veterans in the \nregion. It was threatened with closure just a couple years ago, a few \nyears ago now.\n  Then, coincidentally, not far away, is the Great Lakes Naval Training \nCenter, the training station for all of our new recruits in the U.S. \nNavy. There is a hospital in the center of the Great Lakes naval \ntraining base. It turned out that this hospital needed to be modernized \nbecause all of these recruits who once were trained in places such as \nCalifornia and Florida are now coming to the Great Lakes Naval Training \nCenter off Lake Michigan.\n  I talked with them about combining these two facilities. Can we bring \ntogether a Navy hospital and a veterans hospital, put them in one \nfacility and coordinate their activities so they both have the very \nbest?\n  After years--literally years--of effort, it is going to happen. I \nthank Senator Carl Levin and so many others for making it a reality. \nThis was a dream that many of us had, and it is on its way to \ncompletion.\n  The amendment I have offered is one that will name this first-of-its-\nkind medical facility in North Chicago the Captain James Lovell Federal \nHealth Care Center. I think this is a fitting name for this facility.\n  CAPT James Lovell was one of the first humans to travel in space. \nFrom his humble beginnings in Cleveland, OH, he loved flight. In 1944, \na 16-year-old Lovell and his friends built a little rocket that shot up \n80 feet in the air and exploded. But it hooked him. He wanted to be a \npilot.\n  He went on to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 where he \nwrote his senior thesis on the feasibility of sending a rocket into \nspace. He married his high school sweetheart, Marilyn Gerlach, the day \nhe graduated. He went on to become a test pilot for the Navy. In 1962, \nNASA chose him as one of our first astronauts.\n  He distinguished himself among his space flight colleagues, including \nNeil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and John Glenn. He will be remembered for \nlaunching America into the new age of space. He had success as an \nastronaut, serving on the early Gemini 7 and Gemini 12 missions. In \nDecember 1968, he circled the Moon as a member of the Apollo 8 mission.\n  Today, the iconic image of the Earth--a world of greens and blues \nhovering in the vastness of space--is a common sight. But in 1968, the \nApollo 8 brought this image of Earth to the people of the world in a \nway never before seen, in Captain Lovell's own words, ``an oasis in the \nvastness of space.''\n\n  Of all his accomplishments in space, Lovell is best known as the \ncommander of the Apollo 13 mission. In 1970, Lovell and fellow \nastronauts, Fred Haise and John Swigert, launched what would become one \nof the most storied flights in NASA history.\n  The Apollo 13 mission started as the third attempt at a lunar landing \nby a manned spacecraft. It ended, in the words of author W. David \nCompton, as ``a brilliant demonstration of the human spirit triumphing \nunder almost unbearable stress.''\n  The crew's mission started with little difficulty, but a few days \ninto the flight, one of the fuel cells on the Apollo 13 short-\ncircuited, causing a fire that spread to the oxygen tanks.\n  Lovell radioed back to mission control:\n\n       Houston, we've had a problem.\n\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\n\n  He knew that with the oxygen tanks and the fuel cells compromised, \ntheir lunar landing could not be completed.\n  Apollo 13 had been on a lunar landing course. NASA made a risky \ndecision. It set the spacecraft on a trajectory around the Moon. NASA \nengineers hoped the Moon's gravitational pull would whip Lovell and his \ncolleagues back toward Earth with the speed they needed to return.\n  For days the crew suffered from cold, a lack of oxygen, and little \nnourishment. The world turned its attention to the three American \nastronauts and to our government's effort to save them and bring them \nhome.\n  Seventy-two hours after Lovell and his crew had been in space, the \nApollo 13 shot around the far side of the Moon and lost contact with \nmission control. But NASA's bet had paid off and the spacecraft headed \nhome for a successful splash landing in the Pacific.\n  With the safe return of Apollo 13, Captain Lovell became a great \nAmerican hero and a great story in American history. He remained with \nNASA until he retired in 1973. During his 11 years as an astronaut, he \nspent more than 715 hours in space.\n  Today, I am proud to say, he lives in my home State in Lake Forest, \nIL, just a few minutes from this new health care facility.\n  The story of Apollo 13 has been told so many times as a testament to \nhuman ingenuity in harrowing circumstances. Captain Lovell's experience \nreminds us of our excitement in exploring the final frontier of space.\n  With this amendment, which I hope the committee will accept, and I \nhope the Senate will accept, his name will embrace a new effort, not as \nglamourous and exciting as space travel, but an effort that honors his \nlegacy, providing quality health care for Navy recruits, veterans, and \nmilitary families.\n  The second amendment which I have pending is one which will allow \nrural VA centers to be able to offer incentives for recruitment and \nretention of medical personnel. A little over 2 years ago, at the VA \ncenter in Marion, IL, we had a tragic situation where nine veterans \nlost their lives in surgery. We found later it was the result of \nmismanagement and medical malpractice. At that point, they closed down \nthe surgical facilities in the Marion VA and started hiring new people \nto run the institution.\n  I am sorry to tell you that it still is not where it needs to be. \nProgress has been made. A recent hygiene report has given us pause. We \nrealize more has to be done. We still are finding there is a difficulty \nin attracting the kinds of medical professionals we need at this rural \nVA facility. This is not the only facility facing it. Many others have \nas well.\n  What we are doing is taking existing funds in the VA and allowing \nthem to dedicate a small portion to recruit and retain medical \nprofessionals. This is the least we can do to make sure we provide our \nveterans the very best.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Rockefeller and Tester be added \nas cosponsors of my amendment, which I believe is amendment No. 2760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have learned the hard way how important \nit is for rural veterans' hospitals to attract good doctors and \nadministrators.\n  The VA Medical Center in Marion, IL, has had significant problems \nwith quality management and patient safety.\n  In an effort to help improve quality at this rural medical center, I \nhave spoken with two VA Secretaries, and one acting Secretary, about \nthese challenges and potential responses. I have also corresponded with \nnumerous VA officials, and met with the employees on the frontline of \ncare at Marion.\n  One thing I have taken away from all these conversations is how \nimportant it is to have the best possible providers and administrators \nin our veterans' medical facilities. And that is easier for Hines \nMedical Center in Chicago than it is for Marion and other rural health \ncenters throughout this country.\n  Many rural counties have the highest concentrations of veterans \naccording to the 2000 census. The VA estimates that 37 percent of all \nveterans reside in rural areas.\n  In 2007, we were horrified to learn that nine patients at Marion \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center had died in what turned out to be a \nterrible lapse in quality management and accountability.\n  The hospital administrator, the chief surgeon, and others were \nrelieved of their duties, and the hospital stopped offering in-patient \nsurgeries.\n  Since then, we have been told time and again, that the VA has \naddressed quality management structures there and has been trying to \nrestart a full continuum of care at Marion.\n  Last week, we found out that these efforts have not been enough. The \nVA's IG reported that patient safety and quality management at the \nMarion VAMC failed again on several measures.\n  Many are repeats from what was found at Marion 2 years ago. It is \nclear that Marion VAMC leadership did not right the ship.\n  Last week, members of the Illinois congressional delegation met with \nSecretary Shinseki about this most recent report on Marion.\n  The Secretary talked about how important quality leadership is at the \nlocal level and how hard it is to recruit and retain talented, high-\nperforming administrators and doctors to rural facilities.\n  This is not the first time we have heard this. In fact, the surgical \nprogram at the hospital has been shut down for two years because we \ndon't have the personnel to restart it.\n  Recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals to serve rural \npopulations is a nationwide problem. It is not limited to the VA. And \nit is not limited to Illinois.\n  In February, the Director of VA's Office of Rural Health testified \nthat, ``greater travel distances and financial barriers to access can \nnegatively impact care coordination for many rural veterans.''\n  As far back as 2000, the VA recognized that the large proportion of \nrural veterans has made it harder for those veterans to access care.\n  My amendment allows the VA to develop and test a pilot program to \nattract and retain high quality providers and management to rural \nfacilities across the country. It is one of many efforts to address \nquality of care for our veterans.\n  These incentives would only be available to the employee for as long \nas they were serving in the designated rural areas.\n  The amendment would allow the VA to spend up to $1.5 million to \nattract qualified health care providers and another $1.5 million to \nattract qualified health care administrators to our neediest, most \nunderserved rural VA facilities.\n  The amendment would also require VA to report back to Congress on the \nstructure of the program, the number of individuals recruited through \nsuch incentives, and the prospects for retention of these doctors, \nnurses, and administrators.\n  Just last month, the Kansas Health Institute reported that financial \nincentives are an important part of recruiting and retaining providers \nto rural areas in the civilian sector.\n  We need to give the VA similar tools.\n  Veterans in Marion and Chicago, IL, New York City and Niagara, NY, \nDallas and Temple, TX, deserve the same quality of care. As veterans of \ncurrent wars leave active duty and return to their hometowns, we must \nbe ready to serve them. It is simply the cost of war.\n  This amendment would give the VA another tool to use as it works to \nimprove its rural health facilities. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators \nThune and Webb, I am in strong support of the Frank Buckles World War I \nMemorial Act. This bill rededicates the site of the District of \nColumbia War Memorial on the National Mall as a National and DC World \nWar I Memorial in recognition of the upcoming anniversaries of \nAmerica's entry into World War I, and of the armistice that concluded \nWorld War I on November 11, 1918.\n  The legislation is named in honor of Frank Buckles of West Virginia, \nthe last surviving American World War I veteran. Mr. Buckles, born in \n1901 in Harrison County, MO, is a wonderful man and representative of \nhis generation. At the age of 108, he resides in the\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\neastern panhandle of West Virginia, where he lives on his 330-acre farm \nwith his daughter.\n  His personal story is similar to many young men of his era. As an \neager 16-year-old, Frank Buckles tried to enlist in the Army several \ntimes and finally succeeded. He then pestered his officers to be sent \nto France. Mr. Buckles drove motorcycles, cars, and ambulances in \nEngland and France, and during the Occupation, he guarded German \nprisoners. Following the war, he went to work for the White Star \nsteamship line and was in Manila on business in December 1941 when the \nJapanese attacked the Philippines. Frank Buckles spent over 3 years as \na prisoner at the city's Los Banes prison camp. On February 23, 1945, a \nunit from the 11th Airborne Division freed him and 2,147 other \nprisoners in a daring raid on the Los Banes prison camp. Mr. Buckles \nwas affected by and has memories of both World War I and World War II.\n  After his liberation from Los Banes, Frank Buckles returned to the \nUnited States. He married Audrey Mayo, a young lady whom he had known \nbefore the war, and in 1954 they settled down on the Gap View Farm in \nWest Virginia. On this same farm, Mr. Buckles has remained mentally \nsharp and physically active. He worked on his farm with tractors up to \nthe age of 105. Now, he reads from his vast book collection and enjoys \nthe company of his daughter Susannah Flanagan who came to live with him \nafter his wife passed away in 1999.\n  I had the privilege of listening to Frank Buckles' compelling stories \nin his home in West Virginia while sitting with his daughter. He \ngenerously shares his memories of working to enlist and get to France, \nas well as meeting French soldiers and guarding German prisoners. \nEveryone can hear his reflections by visiting the Library of Congress's \nspecial Web site for its Veterans History Project. It has personal \ninterviews of Mr. Buckles and thousands of other veterans that have \nserved our Nation both during times of war and peace. Visiting this Web \nsite is an incredible resource for scholars, students and every \nAmerican, and it reminds us of the compelling personal stories of \nbravery, commitment, and sacrifice made by our country's veterans and \nhow they shaped our world.\n  The bill I introduced with Senators Webb and Thune is designed to \nhonor and remember over 4.35 million Americans, like Frank Buckles, who \nanswered the call of duty and served from 1914-1918 in World War I. \nWhat became known as the Great War claimed the lives of 126,000 \nAmericans, wounded 234,300, and left 4,526 as prisoners of war or \nmissing in action.\n  At the end of World War I, numerous cities and States erected local \nand state memorials to honor their citizens who answered the call and \nproudly served the United States of America. On Armistice Day in 1931, \nPresident Hoover dedicated the DC World War I Memorial to honor the 499 \nDistrict of Columbia residents who gave their lives in the service of \nour country. Since then, national monuments to commemorate the \nsacrifice and heroism of those who served in World War II, the Korean \nwar, and the Vietnam war have all been built on the National Mall.\n  Yet no national monument has yet been created to honor those who \nserved in World War I. As our Nation prepares to celebrate the \ncentennial of World War I, it is time for that to change by creating \nthe National and DC World War I Memorial.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to cosponsor this \nlegislation to rededicate the site of the District of Columbia War \nMemorial on the National Mall as a National and District of Columbia \nWorld War I Memorial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning guess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, tomorrow our Nation will honor the thousands \nof men and women who have answered the call to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States of America against all enemies. Today \nI rise to pay tribute to these veterans and their commitment to the \ncause of freedom. These brave men and women are ones throughout ages \nwho have made the contribution, who made the efforts, and some made the \nultimate sacrifice to keep our country free. We owe them no less than \nour heartfelt thanks.\n  In Kansas City, MO, we are very proud to have a facility called the \nLiberty Memorial which was set up many years ago as the only memorial \nto World War I veterans. That facility continues today to be a very \nproud part of the Kansas City heritage. We want to make sure that as we \nlook back and honor the veterans of World War I, we recognize that this \nwas the first, the best, and the most outstanding memorial to the \nveterans of World War I. I ask my colleagues to work with us as we \nappropriately recognize and elevate the Liberty Memorial to the status \nit deserves in honoring the men and women who served in that very \ndifficult First World War.\n  But also as we mark this Veterans Day, the massacre of 13 of our \nservicemembers at Fort Hood Texas is in all of our hearts.\n  It is unthinkable that the brave men and women in our military, who \nalready sacrifice so much when they go forward on the battlefield to \nfend off attacks, now find the attacks can come at home. But in the \nmidst of this horrific tragedy, our Nation has also witnessed the \ncourage, the heroism, and the quick thinking we have come to expect \nfrom our military personnel and law enforcement.\n  There are many questions that need to be answered, and as vice \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and also as the father of \na marine and as an American, I want answers about how this could have \nhappened and whether we could have prevented it. What do we learn from \nthis? How do we take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again? I want \nto find out the who, what, when, where, if anything, our intelligence \ncommunity knew and whether such information was shared with the \nappropriate action agencies.\n  Whatever those answers turn out to be, we must ensure that our Nation \nremains vigilant against the threat of terrorism both from within and \noutside of the United States; that our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies and our military have the tools and resources they need to \ndefend and protect us here at home and abroad; and that their vigilance \nis never hampered by unreasonable restrictions on the use of those \ntools that end up aiding only the terrorists. In doing so, we will not \nonly honor the memory of those men and women who died on this horrible \nday, in this unprovoked attack, but help save future men and women from \nsuch a fate.\n  It is fitting that we honor our veterans and pause to recognize the \nhardships and sacrifices they have endured throughout wars, conflicts, \nand many difficult times. We remember especially those men and women \nwho gave their lives so that others--whether comrades, families, total \nstrangers, or the rest of us--could live in freedom. We owe these \nheroes and their families our eternal gratitude and respect.\n  As a Senator from Missouri, I offer my very special thanks to the men \nand women in uniform and the men and women who have served in uniform \nfrom our State. In Missouri, the history of service is long and proud. \nMy great State is home to Whiteman Air Force Base, Fort Leonard Wood, \nand many smaller Guard installations and bases. I am particularly proud \nof the work being done by the Missouri National Guard's Agricultural \nDevelopment Team, currently in Afghanistan, where they are helping sow \nthe seeds of peace and providing the security needed to ensure those \nseeds can grow.\n  We owe these heroes in Missouri and across the Nation a debt too \nlarge ever to repay. At the same time, we recognize the many \naccomplishments and victories of our military forces. Since the \nSeptember 11 attacks on our country, we have witnessed their bravery \nand determination as they fought al-Qaida and other terrorists head-on. \nEven when naysayers here in Washington were predicting certain defeat \nin Iraq, these men and women soldiered on and turned the tide toward \nvictory.\n  Turning to the battle we fight today, the battle in Afghanistan has \nbeen described by President Obama and many in this body as a war of \nnecessity. The President has rightly said that we cannot retreat, we \ncannot fail, we cannot\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\nbe deterred from our efforts to counter the forces of evil in \nAfghanistan. But the voices who advocated cutting and running from \nIraq, who predicted certain defeat, have been peddling the same \npessimism with respect to Afghanistan.\n  Seven months ago, I was very encouraged when President Obama outlined \na strategy--a full-blown strategy--for achieving success in \nAfghanistan. I strongly supported this strategy, and particularly the \nappointment of GEN Stanley McChrystal to lead our troops on the ground. \nYet here we are, on the eve of Veterans Day, and the latest indications \nfrom the President are troubling. Instead of a firm commitment to his \nown strategy, there is indecision. Instead of trusting the judgment of \nhis own hand-selected commander on the ground, there are endless war \ncouncils and sessions with commanders who are not on the ground. \nInstead of one strategy, there are now five. Instead of certainty, \nthere is only one possibility; that is, that a decision may be made by \nNovember 19. That is no way to run a war, at least not if we want to \nwin the war. Dithering and wavering are not viewed with favor in any \nsituation. When the lives of our men and women are on the line and the \nthreat from al-Qaida and the Taliban grows stronger every day--as \nGeneral McChrystal said, they are growing stronger--these delays are \nsimply unacceptable. Yet the delays continue, threatening to undo the \nhard work by our military and intelligence professionals on the \nbattlefields of Afghanistan.\n  I have heard some congratulate the President for ``taking his time'' \non such an important decision. As a father of a marine who served two \ntours of duty in Iraq, I agree that whenever we send Americans into \nbattle to risk and possibly lose their lives, the decision must not be \na hasty one. But it must not be unnecessarily delayed either. On the \neve of Veterans Day, the gravity of this decision is even more moving.\n  As I said earlier, the President has been advised by General \nMcChrystal that every day we wait, the Taliban is gaining momentum. Our \nallies are wondering where we are going to come down. Our troops are \nwondering if they are going to be supported. The people of Afghanistan, \nwho are and must be the target, are wondering if they are ever going to \nsee the troops they need. That is why I applauded the President for \nmaking the firm decision on his war strategy in March of this year, \nmonths after campaigning on what he called a war ``fundamental'' to the \ndefense of our people, months after he was sworn in as our Commander in \nChief.\n  As I said earlier, I also applauded President Obama for wisely \nchoosing General McChrystal to implement his strategy for success in \nAfghanistan. The President was right to wait until hearing from his \ncommander on the ground on what resources were needed before moving \nforward--an assessment that was delivered in July. Now we are hearing \nthere are four other strategies, and what I want to know is: Who are \nthe other four generals with responsibility for the troops on the \nground, with responsibilities for their success, who are coming up with \ndifferent strategies? We should learn one thing: When you are fighting \na war, you need to listen to the commander whom you have selected and \nwho is carrying out your strategy as you announced it. But now, as \nNovember goes by, months later, we are simply witnessing dangerous \ndelay. Unfortunately, those in Washington whispering ``delay, delay, \ndelay'' to the President are really whispering ``defeat.''\n  I urge the President to ignore the pundits peddling pessimism in \nWashington. Instead, as we honor our veterans for their sacrifices \ntoday and in the past, I urge the President to honor our brave troops \ncurrently on the battlefield. Mr. President, honor the commander in \nchief you chose by giving him the resources needed to succeed in \nAfghanistan. Mr. President, please honor our warfighters in Afghanistan \nby recommitting to your own strategy, ending this indecision in \nAfghanistan, and giving our troops the support they need to succeed. \nThat would be the most fitting tribute to our veterans of past, \npresent, and future wars. I hope this opportunity will not pass.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to \nMontana's fallen heroes, the dedicated men and women from our great \nState who have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan \nsince 9/11.\n  Montanans proudly volunteer for military service at rates higher than \nany State in the country, higher per capita. Unfortunately, this \ndistinction comes at a great price. To date, 40 Montanans have died and \nnearly 250 have been wounded in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Montana \nhas now suffered more casualties per capita than any other State in the \nUnion. This is staggering. It illuminates just how much our State's \ncitizens have sacrificed in the service of our country.\n  The famous World War II radio reporter Elmer Davis once said:\n\n       This Nation will remain the land of the free only so long \n     as it is the home of the brave.\n\n  It is painfully apparent that Montana is home to some of the bravest \nmen and women of all. Who are these fallen heroes? They range in age \nfrom 18 to 40. They hailed from places far afield, such as Troy and \nGlendive, Billings and Missoula, Lame Deer and Colstrip. They grew up \nin cities and towns, on ranches and farms, and on the reservation. Some \nheroes were Active-Duty warriors, others part-time citizen soldiers. \nThey held ranks from lance corporal to lieutenant colonel. It amazes me \nthat with such a variety of backgrounds, our heroes all shared the \ncommon bond of a desire to serve their country in this time of crisis \nand need.\n  The Gospel of John, chapter 15, reads:\n\n       Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his \n     life for his friends.\n\n  No tribute could possibly express the extent of my gratitude for what \nthese soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have done for their \ncountry.\n  During Vietnam, the late Senator Mike Mansfield carried a casualty \ncard in his breast pocket. In that same spirit, I, too, wish to honor \ntheir sacrifice by reading Montana's fallen heroes into the Record. The \nfollowing Montanans were killed while serving in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom:\n\n       Army SGT Travis M. Arndt, 23, Bozeman; Army SSG Travis \n     Atkins, 31, Bozeman; my nephew, Marine Cpl Phillip E. Baucus, \n     28, Wolf Creek; Army SSG Shane Becker, 35, Helena; Marine PFC \n     Andrew D. Bedard, 19, Missoula; Marine LCpl Nicholas William \n     Bloem, age 20, Belgrade; Army PFC Kyle Bohrnsen, 22, \n     Philipsburg; Army LTC Garnet Derby, 44, Missoula; Army SGT \n     Scott Dykman, 27, Helena; Army SPC Michael Frank, 36, Great \n     Falls; Marine LCpl Kane Michael Funk, age 20, Kalispell; Army \n     SSG Yance T. Gray, 26, from Ismay; Army SSG Aaron Holleyman, \n     26, Glasgow; Army PVT Timothy J. Hutton, 21, Dillon; Navy PO2 \n     Charles Komppa, 35, Belgrade; Army CPL Troy Linden, age 22, \n     Billings; Army CPT Michael McKinnon, 30, Helena; Army SGT \n     James A. McHale, 31, Fairfield; Army MSG Robbie McNary, 42, \n     Lewistown; Marine LCpl Jeremy Scott Sandvick Monroe, 20, \n     Chinook; Army PFC Shawn Murphy, 24, Butte; Marine LCpl Nick \n     J. Palmer, 19, Great Falls; Army CPT Andrew R. Pearson, 32, \n     Billings; Marine Cpl Dean Pratt, 22, Stevensville; Army SPC \n     James Daniel Riekena, 22, Missoula; Army 1LT Edward M. Saltz, \n     27, Bigfork; Army PVT Daren Smith, 19, Helena; Marine Cpl \n     Raleigh C. Smith, 21, Troy; Marine Cpl Stewart S. Trejo, 25, \n     Whitefish; Army PFC Owen D. Witt, 20, Sand Springs; Army SPC \n     Donald M. Young, 19, Helena; Army PVT Matthew T. Zeimer, 18, \n     Glendive.\n\n  The following Montanans were killed while serving in Operation \nEnduring Freedom:\n\n       Navy aviation electronics technician, Andrew S. \n     Charpentier, 21, Great Falls; Army 1LT Joshua Hyland, 31, \n     Missoula; Marine Sgt Trevor Johnson, 23, Colstrip; Army SGT \n     Terry Lynch, 22, Shepherd; Army PFC Kristofer T. \n     Stonesifer, 28, Missoula.\n\n  The following Montanans died shortly after returning home from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom: Army CPL Christopher M. Dana, 23, Helena; and \nArmy SGT George Kellum, 23, Lame Deer.\n  It pains me dearly to read this list out loud and I cannot begin to \nimagine how many broken hearts each name represents back home. Our \nfallen heroes fought and died for our great Nation and all it \nrepresents. We owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be fully \nrepaid. We must honor their legacies by remembering their sacrifice as \nwe carry on with our lives.\n  To all of Montana's families staring at an empty bedroom or an empty \nchair at the dining room table: You will always be in my thoughts and \nprayers. I pledge to do all I can to honor your fallen loved ones.\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\n  To Montana's fallen warriors: We will never forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think, as most Americans understand, as \na result of the greed, the recklessness, the illegal behavior of a \nrelatively small number of financial institutions, the United States of \nAmerica is currently in the midst of the worst economic and financial \ncrisis since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans have lost \ntheir jobs. Millions of other Americans are working longer hours for \nlower wages. People have lost their homes, people have lost their \nsavings, people have lost, in many respects, their hope.\n  On Friday we learned that the official unemployment rate is now 10.2 \npercent, the highest in over 26 years. But the official unemployment \nrate tells only half the story. If you add the number of people who are \nunderemployed, if you add the number of people who have given up \nlooking for work, what you find is we have 27 million people in that \ncategory of unemployed or underemployed, which is 17.5 percent of the \nAmerican workforce. That is an astronomical number. Obviously there are \nareas of our country, in the Midwest and California, where the number \nis substantially higher than that.\n  Over a year has come and gone since Congress passed the $700 billion \nbailout of Wall Street. In addition, of course, the Federal Reserve has \ncommitted trillions of dollars in zero interest loans and other \nassistance to large financial institutions. Added together, this \namounts to the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world.\n  President Bush, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and Fed \nChairman Ben Bernanke told us we needed to bail out Wall Street because \nwe could not allow huge financial institutions and insurance giants to \nfail. They said if any of these large institutions failed, it would \nlead to systemic damage to the financial system and, in fact, the \nentire economy.\n  One might think, if these institutions then were too big to fail, it \ndoesn't take a Ph.D. in economics to figure out maybe one of the \nimportant solutions would be to make them smaller. Too big to fail? \nWell, let's reduce their size.\n  Yet in the last several years these financial institutions in many \nrespects did not get smaller but, amazingly enough, they got larger. \nToo big to fail. What do we do? Make them larger. If that makes sense \nto somebody, it doesn't actually make sense to me, nor do I think to a \nmajority of Americans.\n  Last year the Bank of America, the largest commercial bank in this \ncountry, which received a $45 billion taxpayer bailout, purchased \nCountrywide, the largest mortgage lender in this country, and Merrill \nLynch, the largest brokerage firm in the country. So you had a huge \nbank--too big to fail. They became larger through the consolidations of \nCountrywide and Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America.\n  Last year JPMorgan Chase, which received a $25 billion bailout from \nthe Treasury Department and a $29 billion bridge loan from the Federal \nReserve, acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the largest \nsavings and loan in the country. Too big to fail? Well, what happens if \nyou are JPMorgan Chase? You become bigger.\n  Last year the Treasury Department provided an $18 billion tax break \nto Wells Fargo to purchase Wachovia, allowing that bank to control 11 \npercent of all bank deposits in this country. Too big to fail? If you \nare Wells Fargo, make it bigger.\n  Today these huge financial institutions have become so big that the \nissue now is not just too big to fail and taxpayer liability, the issue \nbecomes concentration of ownership. According to the Washington Post, \nthe four largest banks in the United States--that is the Bank of \nAmerica, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup--now issue one out \nof every two mortgages. Half of the mortgages in America are issued by \nfour large financial institutions. Two out of every three credit cards \nin this country are issued by the four largest financial institutions \nof the country. These same institutions hold $4 out of every $10 in \nbank deposits in the entire country.\n  What we are looking at here is not just taxpayer liability for when \nhuge financial institutions collapse and the taxpayers have to bail \nthem out; now what we are also looking at is concentration of ownership \nwhere a handful--four major financial institutions--controls half of \nthe mortgages, 2 out of 3 credit cards, and 40 percent of bank deposits \nin the entire country. That is wrong from a competitive point of view, \nfrom a point of view that the consumer has to have some choices and has \nto see some competition in order to get a break.\n  The face value of over-the-counter derivatives at commercial banks \nhas grown to $290 trillion--that is an astronomical sum of money--95 \npercent of which is held in 5 financial institutions in the entire \ncountry. Five financial institutions control 95 percent of over-the-\ncounter derivatives. Derivatives are nothing more than side bets by \nWall Street gamblers that oil prices will go up or down or that the \nsubprime mortgage market will continue to get worse or betting on the \nweather or whatever else can make them a quick buck. Risky derivative \nschemes led to the $182 billion bailout of AIG, the collapse of Lehman \nBrothers, the downfall of Bear Stearns, and precipitated the largest \nbailout in the history of the world and the severe recession that \nmillions and millions of people are experiencing today through their \nloss of jobs.\n  If any of these financial institutions were to get into major trouble \nagain, taxpayers one more time would be on the hook for another \nsubstantial bailout. In fact, the next time it might even be bigger \nthan we saw last year. Now is the time to say clearly we cannot allow \nthat to happen. Not only are too-big-to-fail financial institutions bad \nfor taxpayers, the enormous concentration of ownership in the financial \nsector has led to higher bank fees. Every Member of the Senate has \nheard from constituents who pay their credit card bills on time every \nsingle month, they then bailed out Wall Street, and what they get in \nreturn is interest rates which have gone from 10 percent or 15 percent \nto 25 percent or 30 percent. That is what you get when four large \nfinancial institutions control two-thirds of the credit cards in this \ncountry.\n  According to Businessweek, ``Bank of America sent letters notifying \nsome responsible card holders that it would more than double their \nrates to as high as 28 percent.''\n  That is what we are seeing all over this country. Credit card \ninterest rates went up by an average of 20 percent in the first 6 \nmonths of this year, even as banks' cost of lending declined. We all \nknow this. Here are these guys on Wall Street. We bailed them out. They \nbecome bigger. And they say: Thank you, America. Now we are going to \nraise the interest rates on your credit cards to usurious rates--\noutrageous, unacceptable. Twenty-five percent or thirty percent \ninterest rates on hard-working people who pay their bills on time is \nsomething that should be eliminated and, in fact, on another issue we \nhave legislation to do that.\n  It seems to me if you add all of that together, the fact that the \nlargest banks that were ``too big to fail'' have grown larger, that we \nhave a very dangerous concentration of ownership within the financial \ninstitution industry, the time is now to do exactly what good \nRepublicans, good Republicans such as Teddy Roosevelt and William \nHoward Taft, did 100 years ago; that is, to start breaking up those \ninstitutions.\n  That is what we have got to do. We have got to start breaking up \nthese institutions. Last week I introduced S. 2746, the Too Big to \nFail, Too Big to Exist Act that would do that. I think the title of \nthat legislation I have introduced says it all: If an institution is \ntoo big to fail, it is too big to exist. Let's break it up.\n  This legislation is all of two pages long. It is not 2,000 pages like \nthe\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\nhealth care bill. It is two pages. That is all. It is very simple. This \nlegislation would require the Secretary of Treasury to identify within \n90 days every single financial institution and insurance company in \nthis country that is too big to fail. That should not be too hard to \ndo. Which are the institutions that are too big to fail? Tell us who \nthey are. Then within the rest of the year, within 1 year, start the \nprocess of breaking them up.\n  One of the further reasons we have got to break up these institutions \nis not just that they continue to be a liability for taxpayers, not \nonly that the concentration of ownership leads to higher and higher \ninterest rates, leads to the fact that Wall Street remains an entity \nunto itself, largely a gambling casino which makes huge amounts of \nmoney for the people on Wall Street but ignores the credit needs of \nsmall and large businesses in the productive economy, but there is \nanother reason. The other reason is I know some of my friends here say: \nWell, you know, we have got to regulate Wall Street. That is what we \nhave to do, not break them up, regulate them. But it is not the \nCongress that is going to regulate Wall Street, it is Wall Street that \nis going to regulate the U.S. Congress.\n  I think anybody who knows anything about politics knows that is true. \nWe know that over a 10-year period, Wall Street has spent $5 billion on \nlobbying and campaign contributions. Despite their greed and the \nfiascos which they caused, what they are doing now is spending millions \nmore trying to make sure that Congress allows them to go back to where \nthey were.\n  I don't think it is a question of us regulating them, it is them \nregulating us with so much wealth and so much power. That is what they \nare capable of doing. What we are beginning to see, not only in the \nUnited States but all over the world, are people saying: Enough is \nenough.\n  I find it interesting that John S. Reed, who helped engineer the \nmerger that created Citigroup, Inc., apologized for his role in \nbuilding a company that has taken $45 billion in direct U.S. aid, and \nsaid ``banks that big should be divided into separate parts.''\n  That is what John S. Reed said, the former CEO of CitiGroup. He was \none of the people who engineered the deregulation effort. He has \napologized to the American people, and I respect that very much; one of \nthe few who has had the guts to come before the United States and say: \nI made a mistake. I am sorry. I respect him for doing that.\n  Furthermore, we have Alan Greenspan, who probably more than any other \nperson in this country led the effort to deregulate, to do away with \nGlass-Steagall, this philosophy that said: If we deregulate, if we \nallow these titans on Wall Street to do anything they want, they are \ngoing to create wealth for the whole economy.\n  But even Alan Greenspan, whose disastrous leadership helped lead us \nto where we are right now, even he, I think, has recognized the error \nof his ways. According to Bloomberg News on October 15, 2009, former \nChairman Greenspan said:\n\n       If they're too big to fail, they're too big. In 1911 we \n     broke up Standard Oil--so what happened? The individual parts \n     became more valuable than the whole.\n\n  That is Alan Greenspan understanding the errors he made.\n  I should note, I am grateful Mr. Greenspan's views on the subject \nhave drastically changed. Because when I was in the House, on the \nFinancial Institutions Committee, he would come before that committee. \nHe and I used to have a little bit of a debate on the issue of \nderegulation. I remember, back in 2000, I asked Mr. Greenspan the \nfollowing question. I asked him:\n\n       Aren't you concerned with such a growing concentration of \n     wealth that if one of these huge institutions fails that it \n     will have a horrendous impact on the national and global \n     economy?\n\n  Here is what Mr. Greenspan said in the year 2000:\n\n       No, I'm not. I believe that the general growth in large \n     institutions have occurred in the context of an underlying \n     structure of markets in which many of the larger risks are \n     dramatically--I should say fully--hedged.\n\n  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Greenspan appeared to be wrong, was wrong, \nand we have spent $700 billion bailing out Wall Street and trillions \nmore on low-interest loans. But it is not just Alan Greenspan who has \nchanged his views. According to the Washington Post, we know this to be \nthe case:\n\n       The British government announced Tuesday it will break up \n     parts of major financial institutions bailed out by taxpayers \n     . . . The British government--spurred on by European \n     regulators--is forcing the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds \n     Banking Group and Northern Rock to sell off parts of their \n     operations. The Europeans are calling for more and smaller \n     banks to increase competition and eliminate the threat posed \n     by banks so large that they must be rescued by taxpayers, no \n     matter how they conducted their business, in order to avoid \n     damaging the global financial system.\n\n  In other words, what the United Kingdom is beginning to say is, we \nhave got to start breaking up these institutions. If they are too big \nto fail, they are too big to exist.\n  But it is not just Alan Greenspan, it is not just John Reed, former \nCEO of CitiGroup, it is Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve \nChairman and the head of President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory \nBoard. This is what he said:\n\n       Keep [banks] small, so that any failure won't have \n     systematic importance. People say I'm old fashioned and banks \n     can no longer be separated from nonbank activity. That \n     argument brought us to where we are today.\n\n  Robert Reich, President Clinton's former Labor Secretary, has said \nthat:\n\n       No important public interest is served by allowing giant \n     banks to grow too big to fail . . . Wall Street giants should \n     be split up--and soon.\n\n  That is Robert Reich.\n  Sheila Bair, the head of the FDIC, has said that:\n\n       We need to reduce our reliance on large financial \n     institutions and put an end to the idea that certain banks \n     are too big to fail.\n\n  Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the International \nMonetary Fund, the IMF, has said:\n\n       Banks that are too big to fail must now be considered too \n     big to exist.\n\n  I am under no illusions that taking on Wall Street will be an easy \ntask. Generally speaking, Congress is never successful or very rarely \nsuccessful taking on big money interests. They are too powerful, they \nhave too much sway over this institution.\n  As I mentioned earlier--this is quite incredible--the banking and \ninsurance industry has spent over $5 billion on campaign contributions \nand lobbying activities over the past decade in support of \nderegulation, and they are spending even more today to try to prevent \nCongress from seriously regulating their industry.\n  In 2007 alone--and if people want to know why the rich get richer and \neverybody else gets poorer, they should understand--the financial \nsector employed nearly 3,000 separate lobbyists to influence Federal \npolicymaking. Remember, we only have 100 people in the Senate, 435 in \nthe House. They have 3,000 separate lobbyists. So if anyone thinks it \nis going to be easy to reform the financial services sector, it clearly \nwill not.\n  But if we are going to turn this economy about, if we are going to \ntry to prevent another disaster by which taxpayers have to bail out \nsome of the wealthiest and most powerful people, if we are going to \ncreate a situation where financial institutions provide capital to the \nproductive economy so that we can create decent paying jobs, producing \nreal products and real services, we are going to have to finally stand \nup to these very powerful institutions.\n  I think the issue is clear. I think all over this country people, \nwhether they are progressive, whether they are conservative, understand \nthat if an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. \nLet's break them up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) The Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2741 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand there is a pending \namendment before the Senate. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2741.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2741 to amendment No. 2730.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S11331]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide, with an offset, an additional $4,000,000 for \ngrants to assist States in establishing, expanding, or improving State \n                          veterans cemeteries)\n\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229. (a) Additional Amount for State Veterans \n     Cemeteries.--The amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``grants for construction of state veterans \n     cemeteries'' is hereby increased by $4,000,000.\n       (b) Offset.--The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``general operating \n     expenses'' is hereby decreased by $4,000,000.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we are often reminded of the special \nsacrifice military families make in service to our country.\n  Memorial Day and Veterans Day are just two occasions when we as \nAmericans take a moment to acknowledge our military men and women, \nthose who have served in uniform.\n  We pause for a moment of silence. We bow our head for the fallen. \nFamily members visit the final resting place of those they have lost.\n  We think of those hallowed grounds, those special places, the lines \nof crosses at Normandy, the graves at Arlington, the tomb of the \nunknown soldier, veterans cemeteries across America, and we remember \nall those who have served this Nation with honor.\n  One of the ways that we can honor them and their families is by \ncovering the cost of burial for veterans, their spouses, and their \ndependent children in Federal veterans' cemeteries.\n  Unfortunately, we have not adequately funded these cemeteries in the \npast and as the greatest generation ages, our ability to keep the \npromise of a free resting place for each of them is becoming \nincreasingly difficult to keep.\n  Across America and in my home State of New Jersey, Federal cemeteries \nare having problems keeping up with requests for burial. As these \ncemeteries become overcrowded, veterans and their families are turned \naway from a benefit they earned through their service. In fact, 10 \nStates do not even have Federal cemeteries, but have managed to set \naside State cemeteries.\n  The very least we can do is provide funding for these State veterans' \ncemeteries which would be a cost-effective way for the VA to provide \nveterans with the burial benefits they were promised.\n  Veterans who have lived their whole lives in one place, a place with \nspecial meaning to them and to their families should have a final \nresting place based on the veterans cemetery in their location of \nchoice, not the Veterans Administration's funding choice.\n  My amendment would simply increase Federal funding for State \ncemeteries by $4 million so that we can have the resources to keep our \npromise and provide our heroes with the dignity, respect, and honor \nthey deserve.\n  Honoring America's veterans is not solely reserved for Memorial Day \nand Veterans Day.\n  This commitment to State veterans' cemeteries reinforces America's \nrespect for its veterans and their families. They have already given \ntheir service to this country; the least we can do is give them a final \nresting place with their brothers and sisters who served.\n  Arlington cemetery is an inspiring place. We have all seen it. We \nhave all been there. We are awed by its majesty and what it says about \nAmerica, about who we are as a Nation, and what we stand for as a \npeople.\n  Let us give every State an Arlington to inspire the next generations \nto live up to the promise of America. We owe our veterans the choice to \nbe buried with their families at a cemetery based on location and not \neconomics.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 1407, Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $78.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $48.4 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $77.7 billion.\n  An amendment has been adopted to designate $1.4 billion in budget \nauthority in the bill as being for overseas deployment and other \nactivities. Pursuant to section 401(c)(4) of the 2010 budget \nresolution, adjustments to the Appropriations Committee's section \n302(a) allocation and to the 2010 discretionary spending limits were \nmade for that amount and for the outlays flowing therefrom.\n  The bill matches the subcommittee's revised allocation for budget \nauthority and for outlays.\n  The bill is not subject to any budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 1407, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES\n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n[Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill with Technical Amendment (in\n                          millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     24,632     53,473     78,105\n    Outlays............................     24,743     52,960     77,703\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:---\n    Budget Authority...................                           78,105\n    Outlays............................                           77,703\nHouse-Passed Bill:---\n    Budget Authority...................     24,577     53,328     77,905\n    Outlays............................     24,691     52,967     77,658\nPresident's Request:---\n    Budget Authority...................     24,351     53,315     77,666\n    Outlays............................     24,643     52,219     76,862\nSenate-reported bill with technical\n amendment compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:---\n        Budget Authority...............  .........  .........          0\n        Outlays........................  .........  .........          0\n    House-Passed Bill:---\n        Budget Authority...............         55        145        200\n        Outlays........................         52         -7         45\n    President's Request:\n        Budget Authority...............        281        158        439\n        Outlays........................        100        741        841\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: The subcommittee's 302(b) allocation has been adjusted to reflect\n  adoption of an amendment to designate $1.399 billion in budget\n  authority as being for overseas deployments and other activities\n  pursuant to Sec. 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 Budget\n  Resolution.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, the administration's fiscal year 2010 \ndefense budget request included authorization of an appropriation of \n$46.3 million for the dredging of the channel and turning basin at \nNaval Station Mayport, FL. The Deputy Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of the Navy confirmed that this dredging project is not \nassociated with the Navy's proposal to homeport a nuclear-powered \naircraft carrier, CVN, in Mayport. However, advocates for the Navy's \nhomeporting proposal continue to assert that the dredging project is \nthe ``first step'' in having a carrier homeported in Mayport. It is \ntime to set the record straight.\n  There is no cause-and-effect linkage between the Navy's homeporting \nproposal with the authorization and appropriation of fiscal year 2010 \nmilitary construction funds to dredge the channel at Mayport. The \nNavy's homeporting scheme is being reviewed separately as part of the \nDepartment of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review. Dredging Mayport's \nchannel will have no influence on its evaluation.\n  Last April, when Secretary of Defense Gates announced key decisions \nassociated with the President's fiscal year 2010 defense budget \nrequest, the Navy called me to confirm that its request for funds for \ndredging and pier improvement projects at Naval Station Mayport was not \nassociated with its homeporting proposal. The Navy said its military \nrequirement for dredging is to permit safer routine and emergency port \nvisits by an aircraft carrier by lessening the current severe \nrestrictions associated with the existing water depth in Mayport's \nchannel and basin. The Navy acknowledged that the Quadrennial Defense \nReview would consider its carrier homeporting proposal separately.\n  In August, Deputy Secretary of Defense Lynn wrote me to reconfirm \nthis point. He said:\n\n       Secretary Gates has taken the prudent step of seeking \n     funding for the dredging of the Mayport channel within the \n     fiscal year 2010 budget to provide an alternative port to \n     dock East Coast carriers in the event of a disaster. As you \n     know, the Secretary decided that the larger issue of whether \n     Mayport will be upgraded to enable it to serve as a homeport \n     for CVNs should be objectively evaluated during the \n     Department's Quadrennial\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\n     Defense Review (QDR). We continue to believe that the QDR \n     will provide the best forum to asses the costs and benefits \n     associated with a strategic move of this scale.\n\n  Also in August, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps wrote the chairman \nof the Senate Committee on Armed Services regarding conference action \non the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. Their \nletter specifically addressed the reasons why it was necessary to \ndredge Mayport's channel and basin. They stated the military \nconstruction project was necessary regardless of a final decision on \naircraft carrier homeporting at Mayport.\n  The three senior leaders of the sea services stated dredging was \nneeded for the following reasons:\n\n       Mayport is currently used as a transient dock for nuclear \n     aircraft carriers, and the current Mayport Channel and \n     turning basin depths impose undesirable restrictions on the \n     safe navigation of an aircraft carrier. Operational readiness \n     is degraded because a nuclear aircraft carrier cannot enter \n     the port with the embarked air wing and full stores and only \n     during certain high-tide conditions. It is prudent to remove \n     these operational limitations. The dredging provided in this \n     project is therefore required irrespective of the final \n     decision on aircraft carrier homeporting at Mayport.\n\n  Conferees for the fiscal year 2010 defense authorization bill from \nthe House of Representatives and Senate Armed Services Committees met \nin September and October to reconcile differences between each \nChamber's bill. During their consideration of military construction \nprojects, the conferees recognized that confusion could exist regarding \nthe dredging project owing to the erroneous assertions that it would \npave the way for homeporting a carrier in Mayport.\n  As a result, a manager's statement accompanied the Fiscal Year 2010 \nNational Defense Authorization Act signed into law by President Obama \nlast month. It states, in part, that the conferees authorized funding \nfor the project based on assurances provided by the Secretary of the \nNavy and the Chief of Naval Operations that the dredging is needed for \ncurrent operational considerations irrespective of a final decision on \ncarrier homeporting at Mayport. Of note, the manager's statement says:\n\n       The conferees emphasize that the inclusion of an \n     authorization for dredging at NS Mayport is not an indication \n     of conferee support for the establishment of an additional \n     homeport for nuclear aircraft carriers on the East Coast, or \n     intended to influence the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review, \n     which may include a recommendation on the establishment of a \n     second East Coast homeport for nuclear aircraft carriers. \n     Furthermore, the conferees note that this funding is provided \n     solely to permit use of Mayport as a transient port, and that \n     any potential designation of Mayport as a nuclear carrier \n     homeport will require future authorizations from the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Last year, the Navy said that the risk of a catastrophic event \nclosing Hampton Roads is ``small.'' Dredging Mayport's channel and \nturning basin so that it can accommodate a nuclear-powered aircraft \ncarrier for an unlikely emergency port visit clearly obviates the need \nto invest up to $1 billion to build duplicative nuclear-support \ninfrastructure for carrier homeporting. During the Department of the \nNavy's budget testimony last June, Admiral Roughead, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, stated: ``Future shore readiness . . . is at risk.'' In \nfact, the Navy's shore readiness is at risk today. In January, the Navy \nacknowledged it had a $28 billion backlog in shore facility restoration \nand modernization.\n  The need to sustain Naval Station Mayport is clear. Before investing \nwhat could be up to $1 billion to support a nuclear-powered aircraft \ncarrier, however, the Navy should first properly maintain its existing \nshore facilities. As the Navy's own studies reveal, there are other \nmore fiscally responsible and strategically sound homeporting options \nfor Mayport, including the assignment of a large-deck amphibious ship \nor Littoral Combat Ship, LCS, surface combatants.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, we learned that the Nation's \nunemployment rate has risen to 10.2 percent. That is 1 out of every 10 \nworking Americans being out of a job. But the real number is even \nhigher than that. It is really closer to 1 in 6 workers. When you add \nin people who are underemployed or have stopped looking for work, the \nunemployment number is almost 17 percent.\n  According to a weekend article in the New York Times, that is the \nhighest this country has seen in unemployment since 1982. The Times \nalso noted: ``If statistics went back so far, the measure would almost \ncertainly be at its highest level since the Great Depression''--the \nGreat Depression 80 years ago.\n  After all the bailouts and a $1 trillion stimulus bill, there are \nstill 16 million of our constituents who want to work but are \nunemployed. In fact, despite the White House's fuzzy math, the real \nstatistics show that the unemployment rate has more than doubled since \nthe President signed the stimulus bill in February. And, you remember, \nthat bill was supposed to be passed very quickly so the unemployment \nrate would not exceed 8 percent, and here we are today at 10.2 percent \nthe way it is officially reported, but taking all the other people into \nconsideration, 17 percent.\n  So people kind of wonder why there is some question about all the \ndebt we are piling on our future generations through the national debt. \nParticularly, it is a legitimate question when people were told the \nstimulus bill had to be passed ``right now'' or unemployment, then \nunder 8 percent, might exceed 8 percent.\n  So there are a lot of questions out there, and some of it carries \nover into the health care reform issues before Congress right now \nbecause it is kind of like people were not really concerned about \nhealth care legislation in the Congress of the United States even \ncosting $1 trillion or more until they found out all these other \ntrillions of dollars that were being spent to get us out of a recession \nwere not working. Then it is kind of like the health care reform was \nkind of the straw that broke the camel's back to cause people to lose \nconfidence in Congress using its own good judgment to solve this \nproblem of the recession.\n  So we have 10.2 percent unemployment officially, more otherwise. That \nequates to about 7 million lost jobs since the stimulus bill was \npassed, and despite the stimulus bill's failings, the White House is \npinning its hopes on yet another trillion-dollar effort. Now they are \nusing their ``back of the envelope'' calculations to say health care \nreform is going to save the economy. This picked up about 6 months ago, \nback in March, when the White House chose to focus on health care \nreform rather than the economic crisis.\n  I would like to quote President Obama:\n\n       Healthcare reform . . . is a fiscal imperative. If we want \n     to create jobs and rebuild our economy, then we must address \n     the crushing cost of healthcare this year, in this \n     administration.\n\n  That is a quote from President Obama.\n  I want to say, to some extent I agree with him. It is true health \ncare costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation, straining family \nbudgets, and making it difficult for American businesses to remain \ncompetitive. Congress should absolutely enact legislation that \naddresses these issues.\n  But, unfortunately, the pending health care reform proposals in the \nHouse and Senate not only ignore the primary issue of cost, they also \nput in place policies that are going to cause more Americans to lose \ntheir jobs and further damage our struggling economy.\n  So now to the main point of my coming to the floor to discuss this \nissue: Whether it is the $500 billion in tax increases or the growing \nlist of Federal mandates in these pending health care reform bills, the \npending bills will take our economy in the wrong direction, contrary to \nwhat the President said in\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\nthat speech several months ago when he said that if you want to fix the \neconomy, you have to do something about health care reform. Maybe if \nthe President had proposed his own bill, maybe he would have proposed \nsomething that did it, but what we see evolving in the Congress of the \nUnited States is not going to solve that problem.\n  Back in March, again, when the President turned his attention to \nhealth care reform, the head of his Council of Economic Advisers, \nChristina Romer, said--and I have a chart that has the quote:\n\n       We know that small businesses are the engine of growth in \n     the economy, and we absolutely want to do things to help \n     them.\n\n  Well, I am not sure how the White House defines the word ``help,'' \nwhen it comes to getting small businesses back on track and turning the \neconomy around, but I do know President Obama came up to Capitol Hill \nthis past weekend to pressure House Members to vote for a bill that \nwill have a devastating impact on small business in America. If this is \nwhat the administration means when they want to ``help'' small \nbusinesses, the old phrase, ``With friends like these, who needs \nenemies'' comes to mind.\n  The President and Democratic leadership twisted arms and bought \nsupport for a bill that the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses--and that organization tends to be the voice of America's \nsmall businesspeople--actively opposed. After the bill passed, the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses released the following \nstatement about the administration and Congress's efforts to help small \nbusiness. This is a long quote, so let me read it, but we also have it \non a chart here:\n\n       Small business owners are outraged.\n\n  Let me start over again. This is from the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses' comments on what happened in the House of \nRepresentatives:\n\n       Small business owners are outraged. This bill will actually \n     make things worse, not better. With unemployment at a 26-year \n     high, the punitive employer mandates and atrocious new taxes \n     will force small business owners to eliminate jobs and freeze \n     expansion plans at a time when our Nation's economy needs \n     small business to thrive.\n\n  It doesn't sound like the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses and the thousands of members they have throughout the United \nStates appreciate the administration's efforts to help. With the \nmarginal tax rate on some small businesses, especially those likely to \nexpand, rising by 33 percent under the House bill, it is no wonder. \nHere we have a chart that says this. The green, present level of \ntaxation; the red, how the President proposes to increase taxes to 39.6 \npercent in his budget; and then we have other things that are still in \nthe President's budget that are kind of hidden. I will not go into what \nPEPs and Peases are, but they are a hidden additional tax rate that \nbrings it up almost another 2 percentage points to 41 percent. Then we \nhave the last big bar that has everything in the previous two, plus the \n5.4-percent surtax that is in the House bill. It is these increased \ntaxes on individuals--because a lot of small businesses file \nindividually, they don't file corporate tax returns--that kills small \nbusiness, the engine that creates 70 percent of the new jobs in \nAmerica.\n  So we have a situation with these potential tax increases, where any \nbusiness looking to the capital markets will probably find sources of \ncapital chilled by the 70-percent increase in marginal rates on capital \ngains that occurs under the House bill. We have this chart over here \nthat shows when you add in the capital gains as well what happens. \nBecause capital gains has a great deal to do with capital formation in \nAmerica, and higher marginal tax rates tend to discourage that.\n  Some Members might say the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses' statement was about the House bill, and it was, but bills \nwe have before the Senate aren't much better. The HELP Committee bill \nhas a similar pay-or-play mandate that will cost American jobs, as does \nthe House bill. The Finance Committee bill is filled with tax increases \nthat will directly affect small business owners and their employees, \nincluding families who make less than $250,000 a year, which would \nobviously be a violation of the President's campaign promise that he \nwasn't going to increase taxes for those earning under $250,000.\n  So here we have another chart: Health care reform raises taxes on \nfamilies with more than $75,000 in income. That is because $75,000 is \nbelow $250,000, so the President violates his campaign promise. Further \nanalysis by the Congressional Budget Office has shown that small \nbusinesses could also face significantly higher health insurance \npremiums as a result of the new insurance market reforms. We have the \nconsulting firm of Oliver Wyman concluding that the insurance reforms \ncould raise premiums by as much as 20 percent. As more American \nbusinesses, big and small, face higher premiums and more taxes, workers \nwill end up suffering.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that pending Senate \nlegislation could force about 3 million people out of their employer-\nbased coverage, and that doesn't even include the potential impact of a \nnew entitlement program, a government-run program we call the public \noption.\n  All of this doesn't sound like it is helping small businesses or \nletting people keep what they have, which was another Presidential \npromise. The bills also make our unemployment situation worse. We are \ntalking about another $1 trillion in spending--$1 trillion we can't \nafford--that will end up costing Americans jobs.\n  I wish to quote from a recent article jointly published by Health \nAffairs and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. We have that quote \nright here. I am going to quote a small part of that article:\n\n       Small, lower-wage firms could be among the most affected--\n\n  Meaning most affected by the pay-or-play mandate.\n\n       Firms might respond by firing or declining to hire workers. \n     Several studies projected the loss of anywhere from 224,000 \n     to 750,000 jobs.\n\n  That analysis doesn't even take into account the impact of the tax \nincreases and the new Federal mandates. The people who don't lose their \njobs, of course, face lower wages because it doesn't matter whether you \nare an economist to the far right or an economist to the far left, \nthere is agreement that as health insurance costs increase, wages go \ndown.\n  As all the new Federal mandates and the regulatory requirements drive \nup premiums, businesses will be forced to respond by lowering wages. \nAll of this doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the economy back on \ntrack.\n  I wish to review what the pending bills mean for the average worker \nand our struggling economy: higher unemployment, more than 750,000 jobs \nlost; increased health insurance premiums, maybe by as much as 70 \npercent; lower wages, less money in your paycheck; $500 billion in \nhigher taxes for individuals and businesses; more government spending \nand higher deficits.\n  The administration and the Democratic leadership can make all the \npromises they want, but facts are the facts. Congress needs to address \nhealth care. We need to bring down costs, improve quality, and create a \nmore competitive market for insurance, but we should do it in a way \nthat makes our economy stronger. Unfortunately, the health care reform \nbills we have seen so far are bad for the economy and particularly bad \nfor an American worker and particularly bad at a time when there is, at \nleast officially, 10.2 percent of people unemployed and, if you take \nother factors into consideration as I have already spoken about, maybe \naround 17 percent unemployed. As the New York Times said, maybe the \nhighest rate of unemployment going back to the Great Depression. This \nis bad.\n  So I can only end by saying, as we look to the debate on health care \nreform and the analyses of these bills that are done by economists, \ndone by advocates for small business, and the impact it is going to \nmake on the economy, I think we ought to take a second look and not \nmake this situation of the economy worse through a bill that ought to \nbe helping the economy. Everybody agrees we may have the best medical \ncare in the world. We don't have a perfect system, and that system \nneeds to be changed, but in the process of doing it, we have to make \nsure we do not make a bad situation worse for our economy.\n  Thank you.

Mr. President, I was pleased to join with Senators Dodd, \nCardin, Bond, Kerry, Lugar, and many others in passing a resolution on \nthe need to empower and strengthen the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  The resolution calls for three important steps--that a USAID \nAdministrator be named without delay, that such Administrator be \nincluded in key national security deliberations, and that USAID's \nstaffing and expertise be significantly increased.\n  Development assistance is part of any comprehensive American approach \nin foreign policy, whether it responds to regional conflicts, terrorist \nthreats, weapons proliferation, disease pandemics, or persistent \nwidespread poverty. Assistance programs not only provide help to those \nmost in need but also are a symbol of American values.\n  Our own security depends on the stability of far-flung places beyond \nour borders. And America's generosity and ability to help other \ncountries is becoming more important to the effectiveness of our \nforeign policy.\n  In the United States, the responsibility for development falls \nlargely to the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n  USAID was founded by the Kennedy administration in 1961, becoming the \nfirst U.S. foreign assistance organization with the primary goal of \nlong term economic and social development efforts overseas.\n  During its first decade, it had more than 5,000 Foreign Service \nofficers serving all over the world, often in the most difficult of \nconditions.\n  Today--at a time when the United States is engaged in two wars and \nneeds development expertise more than ever--USAID operates with just \n1,000 Foreign Service officers. USAID's managed program budget in real \ndollars has dropped by more than 40 percent since the mid-1980s. And \nthe Agency still does not have an Administrator.\n  From the early 1960s until 1992, the Office of Management and Budget \nenforced a rule mandating that all foreign aid programs and spending \nmust go through USAID, except when USAID chose to contract with other \nFederal agencies. Today more than half of all foreign assistance \nprograms are administered by Federal agencies other than USAID, and \nfunding for such programs is spread across more than 20 U.S. Government \nagencies.\n  This decline in personnel, budgets and coordinating leadership has \ndiminished the capacity of USAID and the U.S. Government to provide \ndevelopment assistance and implement foreign assistance programs.\n  Quite simply, as the United States works to win hearts and minds \naround the world, our efforts have been diminished by an underfunded \nand understaffed lead development agency. USAID has been shortchanged--\nand America's efforts abroad have suffered as a result.\n  Secretaries Clinton and Gates both recognize the need to reverse this \ntrend.\n  During her first month as Secretary of State, Clinton told USAID \nemployees, ``I believe in development, and I believe with all my heart \nthat it truly is an equal partner, along with defense and diplomacy, in \nthe furtherance of America's national security.''\n  Secretary of Defense Gates has made a similar case, stating ``The \nproblem is that the civil side of our government--the Foreign Service \nand foreign-policy side, including our aid for international \ndevelopment--[has] been systematically starved of resources for a \nquarter of a century or more . . . We have not provided the resources \nnecessary, first of all, for our diplomacy around the world; and \nsecond, for communicating to the rest of the world what we are about \nand who we are as a people.''\n  Military and civilian experts agree that the wars in Iran and \nAfghanistan will only succeed in the long term with a sustained and \nstrategic development program to compliment military efforts. We owe it \nto the brave men and women serving in those nations to get this piece \nof our foreign policy right and to so without delay.\n  That is why earlier this year I introduced the Increasing America's \nGlobal Development Capacity Act, which calls for a tripling of USAID's \nForeign Service personnel over the next 3 years. The bill seeks to \naddress the considerable personnel loss that USAID has experienced over \nthe course of the last two decades. I have also worked with Senator \nLeahy to help appropriate additional funds for USAID.\n  And that is why I was pleased to support Senator Dodd's resolution \nexpressing the Senate's view that we must rebuild USAID, starting with \nthe urgent naming of an empowered Administrator, inclusion of that \ndesignee in top-level national security deliberations, and continued \nlong-term investment in USAID staffing and funding. I thank the Senate \nfor adopting this important resolution yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11335-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11335-S11336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, on November 11, 1921, exactly 2 years \nafter the armistice that ended the First World War, a brave soldier was \nlaid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  His grave was marked, not with a name, but with the inscription \n``Here rests in honored glory an American soldier, known but to God.''\n  Like all of his brothers in arms, this soldier left his home and his \nfamily to defend his nation in an hour of need.\n  Perhaps he was a factory worker or a farmer or a businessman.\n  Perhaps he had a wife and children; perhaps not.\n  But whoever he was in civilian life, he heard the call--as many have \ndone before and since--and he took up arms in defense of our liberty.\n  He laid down his life that others might live free.\n  He gave what Lincoln called ``the last full measure of devotion.''\n  And today, although his name has been lost to the ages, the power of \nhis sacrifice endures.\n  It is a sacrifice that every American veteran has been prepared to \nmake, if duty should require it.\n  As we observe Veterans Day this November 11, let us express our \nthanks and appreciation for those brave veterans who are still with us.\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\n  And, in doing so, let us remember this man who was brought to his \nrest exactly 88 years ago.\n  He reminds us of the dear price of freedom--a price which all \nveterans must be ready to pay.\n  These men and women put their lives on the line to defend the United \nStates.\n  We must recognize and honor the enormity of such patriotic devotion.\n  So let us celebrate the heroes who walk among us--our grandparents, \nour parents, and our children. Our friends and our neighbors.\n  Let us honor their sacrifice. Let us express our support, our \nfriendship, and our gratitude for the service they have rendered to \ntheir country and all its citizens.\n  Their stories are woven into the story of this Nation.\n  These men and women have become a part of something greater than \nthemselves--greater than all of us.\n  More than two centuries ago, when a tyrant from across the ocean \nrefused to grant basic freedoms to his subjects, a brave few decided to \nclaim it for themselves and for their countrymen.\n  When Europe was consumed by violence and genocide--when a dictator \nseemed poised to march across an entire continent--a generation of \nAmericans rose to this threat and joined with our allies to save the \nworld from oppression.\n  From the hallowed fields of Saratoga and Gettysburg, to the muddy \ntrenches of France, to the rugged Korean peninsula--\n  From the humid jungles of Vietnam, to the arid sands of Afghanistan, \nand Iraq, and every theater of combat in between--America's veterans \nare the valiant protectors of American liberty.\n  We must never forget our servicemen and women--those who fought \nbravely and returned home, and those who perished on the field of \nbattle.\n  Our freedom is their legacy.\n  And, just as we ask them to make great sacrifices for our Nation, so \nthis country owes them a deep debt of gratitude.\n  We must give our veterans nothing but the very best.\n  As a member of the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services Committees, I \nwill work with my colleagues to make sure we keep our promises to those \nwho serve.\n  This means increasing educational benefits through programs like the \nPost-9/11 G.I. bill.\n  It means stepping up impact aid support to military communities.\n  And it means providing high quality healthcare to every single \nsoldier, sailor, airman, and marine who puts on a uniform.\n  I will not stand for anything but the best. And I urge my colleagues \nto join me in renewing this commitment.\n  These men and women answered the call in America's hour of need.\n  And now America must be ready to answer in their hour of need.\n  Colleagues, let us see this Veterans Day as a time to remember--a \ntime to celebrate the heroes of all wars, and to honor their service \nand sacrifice.\n  But let us also see this Veterans Day as a challenge for the future.\n  Let us see it as a time to keep our promises, and to fight for those \nwho have fought for us.\n  Eighty-eight years ago, a brave soldier was laid to rest at Arlington \nNational Cemetery under the inscription ``Here rests in honored glory \nan American soldier, known but to God.''\n  And although we call him the Unknown Soldier, in reality he is \nanything but unknown.\n  He is our countryman--our brother--our protector.\n  He is every American soldier, past and present.\n  His sacrifice lives in our freedom. His service is carried on by all \nthose who wear the American flag into combat, and all who perish under \nits standard.\n  My friends, this Veterans Day is a time for remembrance and \ncelebration.\n  It is a time for American heroes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to take advantage of a \nunique opportunity to recognize and thank those who hold the \ndistinguished title of ``veteran.'' It is because of their service, \ntheir commitment, and their sacrifice, that our country is what it is \ntoday, a great nation which stands for freedom and which shines as a \nbeacon of hope and opportunity to the rest of the world.\n  Ninety-one years ago today, on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the \n11th month of 1918, the hostilities of World War I between the Allied \nnations and Germany, ceased. While the commemoration of this day was \noriginally known as Armistice Day, later being renamed as ``Veterans \nDay,'' the purpose and intent has never changed. President Woodrow \nWilson, in 1919, expressed his thoughts of this day, and they ring as \ntrue today as they did nine decades ago:\n\n       To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be \n     filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in \n     the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, \n     both because of the thing from which it has freed us and \n     because of the opportunity it has given America to show her \n     sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the \n     nations.\n\n  In Alaska we have the distinct pleasure and honor of having the \nlargest per capita percentage of veterans of any State in the Union. We \ncall them our neighbors, our coworkers, and our friends. Our \ncommunities benefit from the experience and expertise which they have \nbrought home with them from their time in the service of our Nation. \nToday, while they may wear different clothing in place of a uniform, \ntheir service continues as they provide leadership and skill within the \nState of Alaska.\n  As we reflect on the service of heroes who have served our country in \nconflicts past such as World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the \nPersian Gulf war and others, we would be remiss if didn't also pause to \nhonor the dedication of the men and women who are putting their lives \non the line today to protect our freedom. This includes not only those \nserving in Southwest Asia but also those still in Kosovo, those still \nstanding watch of the Korean demilitarized zone, and those serving and \nsacrificing in countless other countries and regions around the world.\n  Today, we also mourn. We mourn those veterans who made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the defense of freedom. This year, Alaska lost several \nmembers of our military community in the Afghanistan and Iraq \nconflicts. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the families of our fallen \nservice members.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize a group who often isn't honored \nenough: the families and loved ones of America's veterans. These are \nthe folks who have had to see their loved ones sent away to war zones \nand who worried about their well being every second, of every minute, \nof every day until they returned. These are the folks who have had to \nsinglehandedly manage the household and deal with the car, the washing \nmachine, or the heater invariably breaking the second that their spouse \ndeparted. These are the folks who firsthand deal with the invisible \nscars and injuries of war, such as PTSD, when their loved one comes \nhome. The family members of our veterans are heroes who bravely serve \nour Nation and rightfully deserve our recognition.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to stand among my colleagues \nhere on the Senate floor and proudly state that while we know that \nwords cannot express the gratitude that a grateful nation has for its \nveterans, with a common voice we want to say thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11336-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11336-S11337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, 234 years ago today, a group of American \npatriots gathered to found a new branch of the Armed Forces.\n  They organized and trained a robust fighting force that has \ndistinguished itself time and again in the years since that day.\n  In 1805, these brave warriors were ordered into battle by President \nJefferson. They fought for safe passage of American ships and American \ncitizens, defending our fledgling nation against a grave new threat.\n  In fact, they carried this fight halfway around the world to the city \nof Derne, on the shores of Tripoli.\n  And 40 years later, at the height of the Mexican-American War, this \nfighting force again proved their bravery.\n  They charged enemy positions at Chapultepec Castle, eventually \ncapturing the enemy capital, and leading U.S. forces into the very \nhalls of Montezuma.\n  In these defining moments, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores \nof Tripoli, the legend of the United States Marine Corps was born.\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\n  Since the early days of our Republic, the Marines have been at the \nforefront of America's defenses.\n  And in every subsequent conflict from the days of the Revolution to \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan these brave warriors have proven their \nmettle, and put their lives on the line to defend our freedom.\n  For their sacrifice, their bravery, and their heroism, they deserve \nthe praise and thanks of a grateful nation.\n  So, to every man and woman who has worn the uniform of the U.S. \nMarines: we thank you. And we owe you our very best.\n  As a member of the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees, I \nam inspired by stories of those who serve almost on a daily basis.\n  And I will work with my colleagues to make sure this country keeps \nits commitment to these fine individuals.\n  So this Veterans Day, as the Marines celebrate 234 years of \ndistinguished service and brave sacrifice, let us all offer our utmost \ngratitude and support to all of those in uniform.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as we approach the commemoration of \nVeterans Day, I rise to speak in recognition of veterans across the \ncountry, but particularly those in Utah. In doing this, I wish to be \ncareful to not allow the regularity of this topic diminish its \nsignificance or make our veterans seem ordinary. Those who know them \nbest know they are anything but.\n  When speaking of our veterans, perhaps we remember news clips of \nheroic jungle rescues, a frozen, rocket-blasted hill, or soldiers \nfighting bravely in the searing heat of the desert. We rightly \ncelebrate them for what they did, but more than that--let us celebrate \nthem for who they are.\n  As meaningful as words of praise may be, they often are all we give \nto our veterans. It is too rare when we can present our veterans with a \ngift--a concrete reminder that this Nation honors those individuals who \nfight to keep us free. Today, I am especially pleased to recognize the \nopening of the George E. Wahlen Veterans' Nursing Home in Ogden, UT. On \nNovember 19, officials and the public will gather to commemorate the \nopening of the nursing home and present this impressive facility to the \nveterans of northern Utah. As with any major accomplishment, the list \nof people to thank stretches long, including public officials from \nlocal, State, and Federal Government, particularly State Representative \nBrad Dee and State Senator Pete Knudson who sponsored the legislation \nthat made this all possible. However, I would also like to recognize \ntwo Utah veterans, whose contributions made this project a reality.\n  Terry Schow is a Vietnam veteran and the director of the Utah \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. His efforts to reach out to his fellow \nveterans are not confined to his professional obligations. Rather, his \npassion and unmistakable tenacity give power to his fundamental belief \nthat kind words simply are not enough when it comes to caring for our \nveterans. Determined to make sure that all veterans receive the support \nthey deserve, Terry was instrumental in seeing that no bureaucratic or \nlogistical obstacle prevented the creation of the veterans' nursing \nhome.\n  Finally, I wish to speak of the late George Wahlen. A World War II \nveteran and recipient of the Medal of Honor, George passed away on June \n5, 2009, just 5 months before completion of the facility that he fought \nso hard to establish. Along with several of his colleagues, George made \nthe repeated trek to the Capitol building in Salt Lake City, UT, to \npersuade legislators of the need to provide funding for a veterans' \nnursing home in northern Utah. It is noteworthy that in fighting for \nthe needed funding, George never sought any personal benefit. He never \nknew the nursing home would be named in his honor. Instead, at a time \nwhen he could have retired and spent his life in comfort and quiet, he \nchose to take up this cause, a symbol of his dedication to the service \nof his fellow veterans. After numerous meetings, phone calls, and \nhearings, the persistence of George as well as dozens of other veterans \npaid off when on January 24, 2008, the State House, and later on \nFebruary 29, 2008, the State Senate voted unanimously to advance all \nfunding for the construction of the facility. This measure was then \nsigned into law by Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. on March 18, 2008.\n  For George Wahlen and Terry Schow, their work for their country and \nfellow servicemen did not end when they became veterans. These two men \nhave inspired many of us in Utah by their integrity, character, and \npassion to ensure our country returns the favor for the many sacrifices \nmade by our servicemen and women. You see, it is not that George or \nTerry or any number of veterans did this one single thing or that. What \nsets them apart is the character which leads them to do it again, and \nagain. When honoring our veterans this Veterans Day, let us not forget \ntheir valiant acts of courage--but may we always remember their \ncharacter.\n  As a Senator, I am acutely aware of the many issues that face \nveterans.

Madam President, last month, efforts by Senate Democratic \nleaders to add roughly $250 billion to the U.S. debt over the next 10 \nyears by increasing Medicare payments to physicians were put off by \narguments from other Democrats that the cost of the proposal should be \noffset so as not to burden future generations with more debt. A series \nof press releases, editorials, and op-eds declared the proposal to be \nfiscally irresponsible and the Democratic leadership foolish for trying \nto take it up as a standalone bill. And yet, a Senate highway bill that \nwould add roughly $150 billion to the U.S. debt over the next 10 years \nremains below the radar and far more likely to be approved.\n  The last highway bill, SAFETEA-LU expired at the end of September \n2009. But highway programs, like much of the rest of government, \ncontinue to operate by virtue of the continuing resolution, CR, now in \nplace through December 18, 2009. Until the authorization committees can \nagree on how to underwrite the $500 billion over 6 years that they \ndesire in highway spending, a CR or another legislative vehicle will \ncarry a highway programs extension. Meanwhile, the highway trust fund \nis already insolvent and cannot support baseline spending levels equal \nto the highway program levels in fiscal year 2009, much less an \nauthorization bill amounting to half a trillion dollars.\n  The House and Senate authorizing committees advertise they are simply \narguing over the length--3 months v. 6 months v. 18 months--of a \n``clean'' extension. A clean extension, however, already exists in law \nin the CR and can be perpetuated indefinitely. The authorizers really \nwant to combine a highway extension bill with an increase in highway \nspending authority above the fiscal year 2009 level for contract \nauthority.\n  The various ``clean'' extension bills being advocated by the highway \nauthorizers are anything but clean, and they are certainly not \nextensions. For example, the latest Senate version to be hotlined on \nOctober 26 is a massive highway expansion bill--it would increase \nspending authority by $20.8 billion over the CBO baseline in 2010 and \nin every year after that.\n  Madam President, $20.8 billion per year over the baseline is a lot of \nmoney. Why so much? Because authorizers set, back in 2005, the overall \n5-year net level of highway spending in the last authorization bill, \nSAFETEA-LU, by rescinding $8.7 billion on the day that bill expired--\nSeptember 30, 2009. They had always planned to repeal that rescission \nbefore it occurred, but failed to do so. They are so irritated by the \nfailure to avert the rescission that they propose to re-enact the \nfunds--twice!\n  I will ask that a table showing the components of the $20.8 billion \nabove the CBO baseline be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  CBO projects that limiting highway spending to the fiscal year 2009 \nprogram level, as the CR does, will exceed the gas tax revenue to the \nhighway trust fund by $87 billion over the next 10 years. If Congress \ncontinues to cover trust fund shortfalls as it has been--by \ntransferring money from the Treasury's General Fund--then $87 billion \nof\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\ntransfers and debt would be required to continue just this fiscal year \n2009 level of spending. The general fund, however, is also broke--\nincurring a $1.4 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2009, and the fiscal \nyear 2010 deficit is likely to be about the same. Consequently, when \nCongress transfers money from the broke general fund to the broke \nhighway trust fund, the debt of the U.S. Government goes up by exactly \nthat amount and immediately counts against the debt limit.\n  Despite the unaffordability of the baseline, Congress adopted a 2010 \nbudget resolution in May 2009 that allocated amounts to authorizing \ncommittees to write a highway bill that would spend more than current \nlaw revenues collected by the trust fund. The Senate highway expansion \nbill, which would restore the $8.7 billion rescission twice, would not \nonly enact the levels magically assumed by the 2010 budget resolution \nbut would also increase outlays by another $62 billion over 10 years, \nbringing the total draw on the general fund, the debt, and future \ngenerations to nearly $150 billion, just from a so-called 6-month \nextension bill.\n  The authorizers brush off any deficit concerns by saying that, under \nthe Byzantine system of split jurisdiction with the appropriators, they \ndon't control outlays and so there is no ``pay-go'' problem with their \nexpansion bill. But it's too late to raise any objection if you wait to \nmeasure highway program outlays for budget enforcement until they are \ntriggered by an appropriations bill, since the outlays are already \nbaked into the baseline and into the allocations of the appropriators. \nThe only point where taxpayers or their watchdogs can measure whether \nproposed future spending is higher than current law is at the \nauthorization stage. Extra special vigilance is required whenever \nauthorizers claim they just want to enact a ``simple clean extension.''\n  When Republicans controlled Congress in 1998, they enacted a \nbipartisan highway bill dedicated to spending all gas tax revenues only \non highways. When they enacted the next highway bill in 2005, it was \nalso a bipartisan goal to spend every penny of gas tax revenue. They \nsucceeded beyond their imaginations. And now that Democrats are \nresponsible for writing the next highway bill, their proposal is to \nspend all the gas taxes plus an additional $150 billion. This can only \nbe done by increasing the Nation's debt, in other words--handing the \nbill to our children so today's politicians can take credit for highway \nprojects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the components to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Components of the $20.8 Billion in Highway Spending Above the CBO \n                                Baseline\n\n       The $20.8 billion consists of 4 pieces:\n       $11.9 billion from the highway title of the bill, made up \n     of $8.7 billion from restoring the funds lost due to the \n     rescission enacted in SAFETEA-LU and $3.2 billion from \n     restoring the funds lost due to the rescission enacted in the \n     FY09 Transportation/HUD appropriation bill;\n       Another $8.7 billion in additional appropriations to again \n     restore the amount that was rescinded on September 30, 2009, \n     just to make sure;\n       $0.1 billion for the safety title of the bill; and\n       $0.1 billion for the transit title of the bill.\n       The $8.7 billion appears twice in the bill:\n       In Section 101, which provides highway funding for FY10 and \n     beyond at the FY09 level but defines the FY09 level as if no \n     rescissions occurred in FY09, and\n       In Section 103, which adds another $8.7 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11338-S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANDRE M. DAVIS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I would like to address the concerns \nstated by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, about Judge Davis's record when it comes to \ncriminal cases. His concerns seem primarily rooted in six criminal case \nreversals that appear in Judge Davis's record. As a Federal judge over \nthe past 14 years, Judge Davis has presided over approximately 5,300 \ncases. Of that number, Judge Davis has presided over approximately \n4,300 cases that went to verdict or judgment based on a trial or \ndecision he made. My colleagues are focusing on just a handful of cases \nto argue that Judge Davis should not be elevated to the Fourth Circuit.\n  While the number of reversals on criminal evidentiary matters \nappearing in Judge Davis's record that my colleague has mentioned is \nsmall, Judge Davis has directly addressed Senators' questions related \nto each of these reversals, expressing his commitment to applying the \nlaw to the facts impartially and fairly, while respecting the role of \nthe appellate courts in our judicial system and their decisions in all \ncases. Following his confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee in \nApril, which I chaired, our committee reported him out favorably with a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 16 to 3. This overwhelming, bipartisan \napproval indicates that Judge Davis is well-qualified to be a U.S. \nCircuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit. Out of the 5,300 cases over which \nJudge Davis has presided, these six cases are hardly cause for the \nconcern my colleagues have expressed. Later I want to also mention some \ncriminal cases in which Judge Davis's stiff criminal sentences were \nupheld by the Fourth Circuit, along with convictions obtained after \njury trials. However, to make the record clear, I will review in detail \nJudge Davis's responses to some of the half a dozen cases noted by my \ncolleagues.\n  In US v. Bradley, Judge Davis accepted several plea agreements with \nthe defendants, who ultimately pleaded guilty but later, on appeal, \nargued that their pleas were not voluntary because the court \nimpermissibly participated in pleas negotiations. The Fourth Circuit \ndid ``not suggest that [Judge Davis] improperly intended to coerce \ninvoluntary guilty pleas,'' but found plain error and remanded the case \nfor assignment to a different district judge. Upon questioning by the \ncommittee, Judge Davis said that he became involved with--but did not \ninterfere with the plea process--at the invitation and encouragement of \ndefense counsel. He ultimately concluded that he shouldn't have gotten \ninvolved with the process at all. He said he believed, with the benefit \nof hindsight, that his involvement in facilitating the guilty pleas in \nthis case was inappropriate and that the Fourth Circuit was correct to \nsay so.\n  In US v. Custis, Judge Davis granted the defendant's motion to \nsuppress evidence discovered in a residential search on the grounds \nthat the warrant was defective and insufficient. The Fourth Circuit \nreversed, holding that probable cause supported the warrant. While \nJudge Davis told the committee he does believe he read the affidavit in \na common sense manner, he fully accepts the appellate court's ruling in \nthis case.\n  In US v. Kimbrough, Judge Davis said he accepts the appellate court's \nruling rejecting his legal conclusion that the police permitted the \ndefendant's mother to question him under circumstances which the police \ncouldn't have done so without first administering customary warnings. \nHe agrees that warnings are required only when official interrogation \ntakes place, but not when private interrogation takes place.\n  In US v. McNeill, Judge Davis granted a motion to suppress the \ndefendant's confession on the grounds of an unlawful arrest. Judge \nDavis explained to the committee that the principal issue before him \nwas whether, for a warrantless misdemeanor arrest, the fourth amendment \nrequired that the misdemeanor be committed in the officer's presence. \nHe concluded that the answer was ``yes'' in this case, and that no \nmisdemeanor had been committed in the officer's presence as of the \nmoment of arrest. While Judge Davis explained that the Fourth Circuit's \nholding presented an argument and precedent that had not been presented \nto him, he fully accepted the appellate court's ultimate ruling in this \ncase.\n  In US v. Dickey-Bey, Judge Davis also suppressed evidence arising out \nof the interception of cocaine by police for lack of probable cause to \narrest the defendant. He has told us that he fully accepts the \nappellate court's rejection of his legal conclusion that the evidence \npresented at the hearing on the motion to suppress was insufficient, \nand remains committed to adhering to the fourth amendment requirement \nto make commonsense assessments of objective facts, taking into account \nthe totality of the circumstances.\n  I found Judge Davis's responses to the Judiciary Committee's \nquestions\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\nabout these six criminal cases to be candid, honest, and forthright. \nJudging by the overwhelming bipartisan support for his approval in the \nJudiciary Committee, so did many of my colleagues, on both sides of the \naisle. Judge Davis has told us that in every case that has ever come \nbefore him, and there have been over 5,300 of them, he has done his \nbest to determine the facts and to apply the law to the facts \nimpartially and fairly.\n  Indeed, among the 5,300 cases that Judge Davis has presided over, he \nhas a clear record of using a moderate and fair approach to criminal \ncases. He has presided over numerous important criminal trials that \nhave resulted in convictions affirmed by the Fourth Circuit, and he has \nalso granted motions to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the \nrights of the accused. So let's look at his record more broadly to get \na clearer picture of his many years on the bench.\n  For example, in US v. Ulrich, Judge Davis handed down convictions for \nfour defendants for mail fraud in connection with a real estate \nflipping scheme, a ruling that was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit in \nJune 2007. In 2001, in US v. Montgomery, the Fourth Circuit affirmed \nhis convictions related to a 10-week, multidefendant trial in a \nnarcotics conspiracy prosecution. In 1998, the Fourth Circuit affirmed \nhis conviction handed down in a murder prosecution in US v. Gray.\n  As a Fourth Circuit Judge, Judge Davis has expressed that he will \nfollow the precedents of the Supreme Court and the circuit, and will \ncontinue to apply the law to the facts of each case impartially and \nfairly. His record as a district judge clearly bears out this \ncommitment.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11339-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING NEBRASKA'S ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to salute the 313th \nMedical Company of Nebraska Army National Guard on its upcoming and \nsecond deployment to Iraq. The 313th Medical Company is about to embark \non an important mission, and I want its members to know how thankful I \nam for their service and how proud I am of their professionalism and \ndedication.\n  Thanks to the sacrifices made by the 313th during previous \ndeployments and those of so many other servicemen and women, 29 million \nIraqis are free, Iraq is the most democratic country in the Arab world, \nand Iraq has become an ally in the war on terror. As conditions \ncontinue to improve in Iraq, with Iraqi armed forces and police taking \nthe lead on security, the need for our presence in Iraq is diminishing. \nHowever, we must be vigilant in successfully completing the transition. \nMedical support from the 313th will be vital to ensuring our \nachievements in Iraq are lasting.\n  Members of the 313th are some of the best-trained and prepared \nsoldiers in our Nation's history. Some of them have already been \ndeployed one or more times and their experience will undoubtedly be \ninvaluable to mission success. The equipment they use is the best in \nworld. But, ultimately, their individual patriotism and dedication has \nmade and continues to make the difference in Iraq.\n  I also thank the families of the 313th. They will also endure \nhardships in the name of freedom and security. Their support will \nundoubtedly enable the unit to focus on the mission. The Department of \nDefense and many private organizations have established programs to \nassist families while their loved ones are fighting overseas. My staff \nand I stand ready to assist them if they need help accessing these \nresources.\n  The thoughts and prayers of all Nebraskans and of grateful citizens \nacross this great Nation go with the 313th. I could not be more proud \nof them, and look forward to seeing them all back in a year. May God \nbless the 313th, and protect them and their families as they answer the \ncountry's call to duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11339-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LAURENCE CAROLIN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today I would like to tell the story of a \nyoung Michigan man who gives us all great reason to be proud.\n  Laurence Carolin from Dexter, MI, was only 13 years old when doctors \ndiscovered an inoperable tumor in his brain. After intensive radiation \nand chemotherapy regimens, the tumor still grew. Today Laurence is 15. \nHe has fought the cancer valiantly, but it is the larger fight he has \nwaged for the impoverished around the world that moves me to speak \ntoday.\n  Laurence was born in South Korea, just south of the demilitarized \nzone. When he was 5 months old he was adopted by Lisa and Patrick \nCarolin, who brought him to their home a world away in Michigan. There, \nwith access to education and health care, he experienced what he \ndescribed as ``the kind of start that I wish everyone could have.''\n  Warning signs emerged in 2007 when Laurence started to get headaches \nand began to fatigue easily. Two days after Christmas he and his family \nreceived the diagnosis of the glioblastoma multiforme.\n  Many of us would react to this diagnosis with despair and self-pity. \nBut not Laurence. When he was offered the opportunity to fulfill a \ndream by the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Laurence did what many 13-year-old \nboys might do: asked to meet his favorite rock star, U2's lead singer \nBono. When told that might not be possible, Laurence asked instead that \na donation be made to the United Nations Foundation to combat AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Characteristically, he said, ``I \nshould have thought of my next wish as my first wish. It's a much \nbetter wish. I have everything I need.''\n  That selfless act was only the start of the great work Laurence has \nperformed in his efforts to help fight poverty in his community and \naround the world. When a class at Mill Creek Middle School in his \nhometown wanted to raise donations for him, Laurence instead asked the \nclass to run a food drive for the needy in Michigan. Today Laurence is \norganizing efforts in his community to support Nothing But Nets, a U.N. \nFoundation campaign designed to stop the spread of malaria across \nAfrica.\n  Laurence says that though the cancer has weakened him, it has given \nhim perspective on suffering that is felt around the world. His efforts \nto fight his cancer make him admirable. His actions to help the world's \npoor make him nothing less than heroic. His example calls us all to \naction, reminding us in his words that ``it's our ethical and moral \nobligation to help others who are in need.''\n  An avid guitar player, I am happy to report that Laurence did get \nthat meeting with Bono and the rest of U2 after all, at a concert \nearlier this fall. Laurence's inspirational work gives new meaning to \nthe band's music, which helped open his eyes to the problems in this \nworld.\n  Laurence does not want to leave his work left unfinished. In his \nwords, ``Death isn't a big deal to me. It's just another part of life. \nSome people die earlier than others. . . . I can accept dying, but I \ndon't want to die before there's an end to extreme poverty in Africa.''\n  I thank Laurence for the example he sets, I commend him for his \ncourage in confronting his disease, and I share his hope that someday \nsoon the twin plagues of disease and poverty will be lifted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11339-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11339-S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF DAVID GOMPERT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I voted to confirm David Gompert to be \nDeputy DNI during the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's, SSCI, \nconsideration of his nomination. He is highly qualified, and the \nresponses he provided to questions from members of this committee have \ngenerally demonstrated a strong grasp of many of the issues he will \nface. However, one issue--the statutory obligations to notify the full \ncommittee of intelligence activities--requires further comment. I voted \nagainst the confirmation of Robert Litt to be the ODNI's general \ncounsel and that of Stephen Preston to be CIA's general counsel because \nof their misinterpretation of the National Security Act. Specifically, \nthey misread the ``Gang of Eight'' provision, which is included only in \nsection 503 of the act covering covert action, to apply to section 502, \nwhich covers all other intelligence activities. When I asked Mr. \nGompert about this, he acknowledged that the provision is not in \nsection 502 but nonetheless cited the views of the general counsel.\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\n  I have no reason to believe that, as a matter of policy, Mr. Gompert \nwon't elect to notify the full SSCI, regardless of the statutory \ninterpretations of the general counsel. Nonetheless, this confirmation \nprocess should serve to remind Mr. Gompert and other leaders of the \nintelligence community that those clear statutory obligations apply to \nthem, regardless of the general counsels' misinterpretation of the law \nand regardless of the practices of the previous administration. These \nobligations are consistent with basic notions of statutory \ninterpretation. They are also consistent with recent testimony before \nthe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence by two experts on \ncongressional notifications, both of whom worked on the Church \nCommittee. Frederick ``Fritz'' Schwarz testified that the ``Gang of \nEight'' provision ``should be read as limited to covert action'' and \nnoted CIA Director Panetta's testimony at his confirmation hearing \nsupporting this view. Britt Snider's testimony traced the entire \nhistory of the provision, describing amendments passed in 1991 and \nnoting that he was general counsel of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence at the time of the amendments and was ``heavily involved \nin their development.''\n\n       Another important change brought about by the 1991 \n     amendments limited the ``gang of 8'' option to covert \n     actions, rather than making it available to notify the \n     committees of any intelligence activity that was particularly \n     sensitive. This was done for several reasons. First, the gang \n     of 8 option had, to that point, only been used for covert \n     action. Sensitive collection programs had been briefed to the \n     committees as a whole. The view on the two intelligence \n     committees was that if an agency was instituting a new, \n     ongoing program to collect intelligence, they all needed to \n     know about it, regardless of its sensitivity. This was what \n     the committees were set up to do. They had to authorize the \n     funding for these programs. How could they not know of them? \n     Again, the [George H.W.] Bush Administration did not resist \n     the change . . . There have been no major changes to the \n     congressional notification requirements since the 1991 \n     Amendments. But I think it is fair to say that practice under \n     the law has changed over time. It changed, for example, in \n     the late 1990s when the CIA began to disclose more \n     information to the committees about its collection \n     operations, especially those that were experiencing problems. \n     (Emphasis added.)\n\n  Both the plain language of the statute and its history are thus \nclear. Moreover, the practice of violating the statute in this manner \nis not longstanding; it was limited to the George W. Bush \nadministration. It is therefore particularly dangerous for the current \nadministration and any current leaders of the intelligence community to \nassociate themselves with this misinterpretation of the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11340-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO CHAIRMAN SCHAPIRO AND COMMISSIONER AGUILAR\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today primarily to note for the \nRecord two recent speeches: one by Chairman Mary Schapiro and the \nsecond by SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar.\n  Last year, rapid changes in the markets, opaque practices, and a lack \nof effective regulation caused a devastating financial debacle from \nwhich our Nation is still struggling to recover.\n  The lesson was simple: when our regulators fail to keep pace with \nmarket developments and are taken off the field, the consequences can \nbe disastrous.\n  With this lesson in mind, I wrote to Chairman Mary Schapiro on August \n21 urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to undergo a \ncomprehensive ``ground up'' review of a broad range of market structure \nissues in order to ensure our regulatory capacity is up to speed with \nchanges in the market.\n  I am pleased that the SEC is in the process of conducting such a \nreview and has already acted to address flash orders and dark pools, \ntwo sources of potential unfairness that are opaque and insufficiently \nregulated. But a few narrowly tailored rule proposals are not enough to \nrestore investor confidence and avert a future disaster. We need \nregulators, lawmakers, and investors to embrace a new approach to \nregulation--one that values fairness and transparency over liquidity \nand nips systemic risks in the bud.\n  Accordingly, I applaud Chairman Schapiro's speech, entitled ``The \nRoad to Investor Confidence,'' which she delivered at the Securities \nIndustry and Financial Markets Association annual conference on October \n27.\n  Chairman Schapiro outlined the road towards a lasting regulatory \nframework and a fairer market, asserting:\n\n       To me, we don't get there by assuming all is well now, and \n     reverting to the practices that got us to where we are. We \n     don't get there by letting newly engineered financial \n     instruments escape the umbrella of regulation and the natural \n     disinfectant of meaningful market transparency. And, we \n     certainly don't get there by permitting, or even advocating, \n     for gaps in our regulatory landscape. I believe those are the \n     directions that send us back to another financial crisis. \n     And, we cannot afford to let that happen.\n\n  Chairman Schapiro also discussed the importance of adopting a \nforward-looking approach to regulation, particularly with respect to \nrapid technological developments like high frequency trading.\n  She said:\n\n       I believe we need a deeper understanding of the strategies \n     and activities of high frequency traders and the potential \n     impact on our markets and investors of so many transactions \n     occurring so quickly.\n\n  Following the chairman's lead, Commissioner Aguilar also struck a \nthoughtful chord with respect to upcoming regulatory reform in an \nimpressive speech delivered at George Washington University Law School \nlast Friday.\n  Commissioner Aguilar underscored the need for meaningful reform, \nstating:\n\n       [T]here is a growing concern that we might miss the \n     opportunity to make the transformational changes required to \n     address the realities of today's financial markets--and to \n     prepare for the unforeseen challenges of tomorrow. Moreover, \n     I fear that we may go down the path of piecemeal changes that \n     give the illusion of regulatory reform but leave us in danger \n     of repeating our recent history. This ``false comfort'' would \n     be a recipe for disaster.\n\n  Commissioner Aguilar also highlighted specific recommendations that \nshould guide financial reform efforts. He asserted the focus of \nsystemic risk regulation should be on investor protection and, should \nensure ``the continuation of systemically important market functions, \nnot institutions. . . . To that end, systemic risk regulation should \nfacilitate an environment where no institution is indispensable and \nwhere other firms can step in to meet the needs of the market.''\n  Commissioner Aguilar went on to endorse the creation of a council of \nregulators which would better ``identify accumulation of risks . . . \n[provide] for a diversity of perspectives that could make it more \nlikely that a risk will be identified . . . facilitate the free flow of \ninformation among regulators . . . [and] avoid the inherent tensions \nand conflicts that arise when one regulator has combined \nresponsibilities over monetary policy, a vested interest in the safety \nand soundness of particular institutions, and plenary powers to address \nsystemic risk.''\n  In addition to laying the foundation for systemic risk regulation, \nCommissioner Aguilar also maintained that regulators must be empowered \nto address a broad range of market practices, like hedge funds and \nasset-backed securities, for example, in order to ``not only close \ntoday's gaps but to look ahead and [use] flexible powers that can be \ndeployed as an unknown future unfolds.''\n  Undoubtedly, reform is long overdue, and so I am pleased this body \nappears set to undertake financial regulatory reform legislation in the \ncoming months. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nmeaningful reforms.\n  With Chairman Schapiro and Commissioner Aguilar's words as a guide, \nCongress should grant regulators the authority to ensure our markets \nare fair, stable and transparent in order to prevent another disaster. \nMr. President, failure to do so is simply not an option.\n  Madam President, Chairman Schapiro and Commissioner Aguilar's \nspeeches may be found at: http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2009/\nspch102709mls.htm (Schapiro) http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2009/\nspch110609laa.htm (Aguilar).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11340-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11340-S11341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TIM JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, a voice familiar to thousands of \nVermonters was singled out for special recognition this past weekend.\n  Tim Johnson, a broadcaster who has long made Brattleboro's WTSA Radio\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\nhis home, was honored by the town of Brattleboro and the Vermont \nAssociation of Broadcasters.\n  Tim's love of radio and community affairs brought him to radio in \n1974, and he has faithfully provided local news to listeners in \nBrattleboro and in Springfield, MA, ever since then. I have enjoyed \nknowing him and his work for several decades as we often meet at \ncommunity meetings, conferences and press conferences in the \nBrattleboro region and across Vermont.\n  Brattleboro proclaimed Saturday, November 7, 2009, as ``Tim Johnson \nDay'' and celebrated with a cake. The same day, at their annual meeting \nthe Vermont Association of Broadcasters heralded Tim for his \ndistinguished service. Distinguished service helps sum up Tim's \nimportance to southern Vermont. His contributions to his community and \nto Vermont broadcasting have been of the highest quality, and they have \nbeen steady. His many hours in the studio each week ensure that \nresidents in Brattleboro receive news that is important, relevant and \ntimely. It is regrettable that today's broadcasting environment \nsustains less of that kind of community service and community presence.\n  I know Tim will continue on this path of excellence, and I know that \nall Vermonters join me in expressing appreciation and admiration for \nhis good work on WTSA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article from The Rutland \nHerald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 8, 2009]\n\n               Brattleboro--On-Air Celeb Johnson Honored\n\n                          (By Susan Smallheer)\n\n       Brattleboro.--Tim Johnson is the Energizer bunny of \n     Brattleboro radio: he's on the air day and night, whether \n     it's reporting breaking news, broadcasting local football \n     games and or promoting local food shelf fundraisers.\n       In fact, Johnson was on the air Saturday morning, not even \n     taking a break on ``Tim Johnson Day,'' hoping to garner some \n     donations for ``Project Feed the Thousands.''\n       Johnson, 53, a longtime radio newsman for WTSA AM & FM, was \n     honored by the town of Brattleboro last week with a \n     proclamation and a cake. The proclamation was paired with the \n     Vermont Association of Broadcasters announcement that Johnson \n     was honored yesterday for distinguished service at the \n     organization's annual meeting.\n       Kelli Corbeil, owner and general manager of the radio \n     station, nominated Johnson for the award.\n       ``He's the hardest worker at the radio station,'' said \n     Corbeil. ``I'm so glad he's on my team.''\n       By Johnson's own estimation, his love of community radio \n     lands him in front of a microphone anywhere from 60 to 80 \n     hours a week.\n       Corbeil, who along with her late husband Bill purchased the \n     station in 2007, said that Johnson's devotion to local radio \n     news was obvious to everyone in Brattleboro and deserved to \n     be recognized statewide. ``I think he has a love and a \n     passion for it. He loves the community and I think the \n     community is important to him,'' she said.\n       Johnson first got into radio back when he was a senior at \n     Brattleboro Union High School, and as the representative of \n     the Future Farmers of America, appeared on a WTSA talk show \n     by Larry Smith, Johnson's predecessor at the news desk. He's \n     been doing radio news ever since, a total of 36 years.\n       Smith, who left TSA in 1997 for a job at Entergy Nuclear, \n     said that even at 17, Johnson had a noticeable voice.\n       ``Local radio news is a dying art as more stations are \n     purchased by conglomerates,'' Smith said.\n       ``If anything, Timmy has expanded the coverage. I don't \n     know what he doesn't cover. Every time I listen, he's been to \n     a meeting or a community forum. It's wonderful,'' he said.\n       ``With so many stations, you're lucky if you get the local \n     weather,'' Smith said.\n       After high school, Johnson landed a part-time job as an \n     announcer at cross-town radio rival WKVT in 1973, and \n     eventually left Brattleboro for four years to work at WCFR in \n     Springfield.\n       Johnson said he came back to his hometown in 1985 to WKVT \n     rather than go to a bigger market because the area was deep \n     in his heart, his parents' health was failing and then-owner \n     Dave Underhill was ``a news junkie just like myself.''\n       ``Bright lights? Big city? This is my home,'' he said.\n       Town Manager Barbara Sondag wrote the proclamation for the \n     Selectboard, and she said until she did the research, she \n     didn't grasp the scope of Johnson's community work.\n       ``I had no idea of all the boards he served on,'' said \n     Sondag. Johnson is currently working hard on Project Feed the \n     Thousands, the local food drive, as well as the local United \n     Way, Warm Hands Warm Hearts. In addition to that, Johnson is \n     also the town moderator in his hometown of Vernon, and also \n     serves as the moderator for the Brattleboro Union High School \n     annual meeting.\n       ``Tim Johnson has for 36 years continuously provided \n     accurate, reliable, respectful reporting of the issues \n     important to the citizens of Brattleboro,'' the proclamation \n     said.\n       ``Tim can be found at all emergencies, celebrations, \n     meetings and buffets across Windham County, regardless of \n     time,'' the proclamation went on with a touch of humor.\n       Johnson has a well-known proclivity for free food, she \n     said, as well as multi-tasking.\n       While covering selectboard meetings, he also ``watches'' \n     Red Sox games on his computer, and keeps people posted on the \n     score, Sondag said.\n       And Johnson, whose real name is Tim Arsenault, has an \n     uncanny ability to report accurately on a meeting despite a \n     predilection for cat naps during late-night meetings, the \n     selectboard couldn't resist adding.\n       As the morning show anchor and news director, Johnson gets \n     up at 3 a.m. and heads into WTSA's studio in ``the new north \n     end'' of Brattleboro by 4:30 a.m. He is on the air by 5 a.m.\n       He works at least until mid-afternoon.\n       On a recent day, Johnson was busy juggling family, news and \n     his community commitments, aided greatly that day by instant \n     messaging.\n       Johnson and his wife Sue's 16-year-old granddaughter \n     recently started living with them, and there's plenty to \n     organize and do.\n       Smith, who actually hired Johnson to replace himself at \n     WTSA, said that Johnson is a consummate radio professional, \n     and overcame a stutter, as well.\n       ``The first time I ever heard him on the radio, there was \n     no stutter. He does commercials, he overcame that--quite an \n     accomplishment,'' said Smith.\n       In radio, the hardest thing, he said, is doing commercials. \n     ``You really have to concentrate and Timmy's production is \n     unbelievable and his ad libs are great too,'' said Smith, \n     himself a 30-year radio news veteran.\n       ``I'm delighted for him,'' Smith said.\n       ``This is really what I enjoy doing,'' said Johnson, his \n     newscast devoted this day to the local hospital's reaction to \n     the swine flu epidemic, a major water main break in town, the \n     upcoming Winter Farmer's Market and Feed the Thousands.\n       ``This is really what I enjoy doing and I want to do it for \n     50 years,'' Johnson said. ``That's another 14 years.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11341-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11341-S11342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         TRIBUTE TO NELSON MICHAEL, JEROME KIM, AND MERLIN ROBB\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I acknowledge three sons of \nHawaii. They are remarkable individuals and leaders in the U.S. \nMilitary HIV Research Program. COL Nelson Michael, COL Jerome Kim, and \nCOL Merlin Robb have worked vigorously to develop a safe and effective \nAIDS vaccine that has become a true glimmer of hope paving the way for \nsignificant advances in our fight against this disease.\n  These three men, along with the entire U.S. Military HIV Research \nProgram worked side by side with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to \nconduct the largest study worldwide, a 6-year vaccine field trial held \nin Thailand--historically one of the countries hardest hit by AIDS. And \nHawaii became a vital midpoint and meeting place for Thai and U.S. \nmilitary researchers as experts from both Thailand and the Walter Reed \nArmy Institute of Research in Maryland worked tirelessly to move this \ninitiative forward.\n  The study consisted of 16,000 volunteers and tested two vaccines, one \nthat prepares the immune system by training cells to recognize and \ndestroy the virus and one that intensifies that response. The study \nfound that the two-vaccine approach proved to be 31-percent effective \nin preventing HIV infection.\n  COL Nelson Michael, M.D., Ph.D, is a Punahou High School graduate and \nhis father, Jerrold Michael was dean of the University of Hawaii School \nof Public Health. Colonel Michael is currently the director of the \ndivision of retrovirology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of \nResearch. Prior to serving as director, he was the chief of the \ndepartment of molecular diagnostics and pathogenesis.\n  COL Jerome Kim, M.D., is an Iolani High School graduate and a \nclinical associate professor of medicine at the John A. Burns School of \nMedicine, University of Hawaii. He is deputy director and chief of the \ndepartment of molecular virology and pathogenesis, division of \nretrovirology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.\n  COL Merlin Robb, M.D., is a Radford High School graduate and a \nprogram\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\ndirector for the HJF HIV U.S. Military HIV Research Program. Dr. Robb \nis a retired lieutenant colonel from the U.S. Army Medical Corps and \nserves as assistant professor of pediatrics, department of pediatrics, \nUniformed Services University of Health Sciences, USU, in Bethesda, MD.\n  The published study results were presented at the AIDS Vaccine \nConference 2009 held in Paris, France, and show great promise as we all \nlook to one day soon make this disease part of our past. \nCongratulations to all of you for your hard work and continued \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11342-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER\n\n Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I wish to honor the men and women \nof NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH.\n  NASA Glenn is a leader in space exploration and scientific discovery, \ndelivering success after success in aeronautics and energy research and \ndevelopment.\n  The first test launch of the Ares-1X test rocket 2 weeks ago is just \none example of the important work of NASA Glenn. The Ares-1X test \nrocket represents a new era in NASA and American space exploration. Its \nsuccessful launch is a profoundly important victory for our Nation.\n  The scientists and engineers at Glenn designed and built the upper \nstage simulator of the Ares-1X at its Power Systems Facility. For more \nthan 2 years, NASA Glenn engineers and scientists molded the simulator \ninto an 18-foot-wide cylinder that weighed between 18,000 pounds and \n60,000 pounds and contained more than 250 cameras and censors. The \nupper stage simulator is designed to replicate what will eventually be \nsituated above the main booster rocket. It will also carry liquid \noxygen and liquid hydrogen to fuel the second stage propulsion for \nanother NASA Glenn-led effort, the Orion crew ship.\n  The successful completion of the Ares-1X test launch is a testament \nto the hard work and dedication of NASA employees everywhere. And the \ncontributions of NASA Glenn will only grow as scientists study the vast \ndata from last week's launch.\n  As NASA contemplates its future, the men and women of NASA Glenn have \nonce again shown that the research center will excel regardless of the \nfuture missions it fulfills. As the only NASA center north of the \nMason-Dixon Line, the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH, will \ncontinue to work with all of NASA's facilities around the Nation to \nensure that America remains the world leader in space and \naeronautics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11342-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STEVEN C. McCRAW\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to recognize a gentleman \nwho has served in law enforcement at the State and Federal levels since \n1977. Steven C. McCraw is a native of El Paso, TX, and holds a Bachelor \nof Science degree and a Master of Arts degree from West Texas State \nUniversity. Mr. McCraw began his career in 1977 as a State Trooper and \nlater a Sergeant Narcotics Investigator for the Texas Department of \nPublic Safety.\n  Becoming an FBI Special Agent in 1983, Mr. McCraw served in the \nDallas, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Antonio Field offices. \nHe worked at FBI headquarters in assignments that included Unit Chief \nof an Organized Crime Unit; Inspector; Deputy Assistant Director; \nAssistant Director of the Office of Intelligence, which was established \nin February 2002; and Assistant Director for the Inspections Division \nwhere he was responsible for strategic planning, internal \ninvestigations and bureau-wide performance evaluations. He also served \nas the Inspector-In-Charge of the Southeast Bomb Task Force. After the \nattacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001, the President created the \nForeign Terrorist Tracking Task Force and named Mr. McCraw as the \ndirector. At the point when our Nation seemed most vulnerable, Mr. \nMcCraw led the charge to identify and locate additional terrorist \nthreats.\n  Mr. McCraw retired as an FBI Assistant Director in August 2004. After \nmore than 20 years of exemplary Federal service, he could have simply \nretired. Instead, he answered the call of Texas Governor Rick Perry and \nwas appointed the Director of the Governor's Office of Homeland \nSecurity. Mr. McCraw has been instrumental in leading the State's \nhomeland security efforts, from border security to hurricane response, \nincluding the successful humanitarian relocation of hundreds of \nfamilies left homeless by Hurricane Katrina. His extensive background \nin law enforcement and intelligence has enabled him to make well-\ninformed decisions in preparing for and responding to all hazards and \nthreats in Texas.\n  On July 17, 2009, Mr. McCraw was selected as the Director of the \nTexas Department of Public Safety. He will be leading nearly 8,500 \ncommissioned and non-commissioned personnel in the department where he \nstarted his law enforcement career.\n  On behalf of the Congress and the country, I would like to thank Mr. \nMcCraw for his service to the Nation and wish him well as he continues \nhis contributions to the safety and security of the State of \nTexas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11342-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11342-S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING THE MUDDY RUDDER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, tomorrow, our Nation pauses to \nhonor those brave men and women who have served our country so \nadmirably in the Armed Forces. Veterans Day affords us the tremendous \nopportunity to reflect on the freedoms we enjoy and to acknowledge \nthose who have sacrificed so much to protect those liberties. Today I \nwish to recognize a small business in my home State of Maine that is \ndoing its own part to celebrate the contributions that veterans have \nmade to our country.\n  The Muddy Rudder--which has locations in Yarmouth and Brewer--has \nbeen a mainstay on the Maine dining scene since 1976, when it opened \nits first location overlooking Yarmouth's Cousins River. The \nrestaurant's Brewer location was opened in 2002 at the site of the \nformer Harborside Restaurant, on the town's scenic and revitalized \nPenobscot River waterfront. Affectionately known to frequent guests and \nlocals as ``the Rudder,'' these remarkable restaurants have gained a \nsolid following in the communities they serve. Noted for its nautical \nthemed decor and picturesque water views, the Muddy Rudder has also \ngained welcome attention from people near and far for its expertly \nprepared fresh seafood.\n  The reason the Muddy Rudder can lay claim to such a delectable menu \ncomes directly from the talent in the restaurants' kitchens. Brewer's \nMuddy Rudder is home to award-winning executive chef David Smith, an \nactive member of the American Culinary Federation, who makes frequent \nappearances on local television preparing creative and exciting dishes \nfor people to attempt at home. And the Yarmouth location boasts the \nexpertise of renowned chef Tom Schwarz, a former fisherman who began \nhis culinary journey as a fishmonger for some of New York City's finest \nrestaurants, hotels, and bistros.\n  But more than just a place to enjoy a hearty meal, the Muddy Rudder \nis a visible and active member in the communities they serve. As such, \nin celebration of Veterans Day, both Muddy Rudder restaurants are \nproviding veterans and active military servicemembers with a free meal \ntomorrow. And unlike many larger national chains that are offering \nsimilar incentives, the Muddy Rudder is giving veterans and active duty \nservicemembers the option to choose a free entree from any menu item, \nwith no restrictions. From the Rudder's delicious baked stuffed lobster \nor Fisherman's Platter to meals preferred by landlubbers, including a \nNew York strip steak or chicken marsala, America's bravest can select a \nwholesome and appetizing meal as a small but meaningful thank you for \nthe commendable service they have given to our Nation.\n  The Muddy Rudder's cuisine has long been a staple of the culinary \nlandscape in Yarmouth, and more recently in Brewer. And as demonstrated \nby their actions this week, it is no secret why they are so popular in \nthe community. I am proud that Peter Anastos, the restaurants' owner, \nand everyone at the Muddy Rudder have set such a thoughtful and timely \nexample as we celebrate those who protect our freedoms. I thank them \nfor their creativity and passion, and wish them success in all of their \nendeavors.\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11343-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 AUBURN LIONS CLUB COMMEMORATES CHARTER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I pay tribute to the Auburn \nLions Club which will commemorate the receipt of their charter on \nNovember 13th during their magnificent ``Charter Night.'' Although I \ndeeply regret that I am unable to attend in person, I will be there \nvery much in spirit!\n  I cannot tell this Chamber how inspired and impressed I am by the \nphenomenal history of the Lions Club and all it has accomplished and \nexemplifies to this day. For 92 years, the men and women of the Lions \nClub have been on the front lines of compassion and good will for \ncountless individuals throughout America and the world with their \nextraordinary commitment to community and humanitarian service that has \nbeen the cornerstone of the Lions Club's exceptional mission as well as \nthe impetus behind its founding by Melvin Jones in 1917.\n  Speaking of the enormous legacy of the legendary Melvin Jones, I want \nto take a moment to express the profound distinction I felt this past \nMay when I was honored as a Melvin Jones fellow, the most prestigious \nform of recognition conferred by the Lions Club International \nFoundation. And I can tell you, receiving that accolade from the Lions \nClub which I hold in such high esteem as well as from my cousin, Duke \nGoranites, 1st Vice District Governor of Maine and District Governor-\nElect of the Lions Club--who is like a brother to me and is the brother \nof my wonderful cousin, Georgia Chomas, was truly one of the most \ngratifying experiences of my life!\n  And let me just say, Duke has really outdone himself this year! \nBelieve me, we are all well aware of how busy he is these days. His \nschedule could not be more rigorous as he's traveling around the State, \nand so I am even more grateful to Duke who not only will emcee the \nCharter Night event, but has been vital in helping Auburn bring this \ncharter to fruition.\n  What a truly landmark accomplishment this charter represents--one \nthat is emblematic of the initiative, generosity, and resolve of my \nhometown of Auburn, ME, where my roots run deep, as well as the \nenduring purpose of the Lions Club which has a longstanding legacy of \ncontribution on behalf of others in Maine, America, and the world. And \nlet me say, how pleased I was to send an American flag to the Auburn \nLions Club that was flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of this \nmarvelous occasion.\n  The Auburn Lions Club will be joining the ranks of the largest \ninternational service organization in the world which has a presence in \nmore than 200 countries and with 1.3 million members and 45,000 clubs \nworldwide. They will be committed in word and deed to advancing the \nLions Club motto ``we serve.'' And Melvin Jones' time-honored precept \nthat ``you can't get very far until you start doing something for \nsomebody else'' will be in good hands in Auburn.\n  The Auburn Lions Club will not only celebrate their newly acquired \ncharter status but will also install the respective officers, whose \nleadership throughout the process has been instrumental. In that light, \nI commend Adam Smith, Auburn chapter president; and Georgia Chomas, \nvice-president, who coordinated the Charter Night event with Sandy \nTassinari. I also commend Celeste Yakawonis, second vice-president, \nNicole Andree, treasurer, and Sherry Bonawitz, secretary.\n  I also convey my immense appreciation for the stewardship and support \nof Glen Aho, Auburn city manager and charter member of the Auburn Lions \nClub, as well as to Ron Johnson, international director of the Lions \nClub, Lewis B. Small, Sr., past international director, and Roger \nBlackstone, district governor. I also recognize the Gray/New Gloucester \nLions Club for their sponsorship of the Auburn Lions Club.\n  In keeping with the high caliber of individuals who have dedicated \ntheir enormous time and talent to this sterling endeavor, I am proud to \nsay, the Auburn Lions Club can already point to community projects its \nmembers will be tackling, from addressing challenges confronting Auburn \nschool students with a focus on homeless teens to working with the \nLions' statewide effort to raise funds to purchase and install a \nstandby generator for the Good Shepherd Food Bank. The Auburn Lions \nClub has established a goal of raising $76,000 to match the Lions Club \ninternational grant of $75,000. To say they will be hitting the ground \nrunning is an understatement!\n  The achievement of this charter is a memorable moment for the Auburn \nLions Club, and I have no doubt what is said of Lions Clubs throughout \nMaine and around the world will be said of the Auburn Lions Club many \ntimes over--``whenever we get together, problems get smaller. And \ncommunities get better.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11343-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11343-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11343-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3962.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nan increase in the annual amount authorized to be appropriated to the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out comprehensive service \nprograms for homeless veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, tomorrow we will observe \nVeterans Day, a day to honor the millions of men and women who put on \nthe uniform to defend our Nation. In communities across the Nation, we \nwill gather to thank all veterans for their service, for their having \nrisked their lives so that the rest of us could enjoy freedom.\n  I rise to offer legislation that is meant to honor veterans who are \ntoo often forgotten. Tonight, on the eve of the day meant to highlight \ntheir heroism, more than 130,000 veterans will be homeless, left \nwithout a home and without a warm meal. For many, they are on the \nstreets with their families--husbands and wives and children left \nwithout any safety net. Perhaps they recently lost their job. Perhaps \nthey recently lost their home to foreclosure. Why they are on the \nstreets matters less than why we have left them on their own.\n  When coming into office, President Obama set a goal of ending \nhomelessness among veterans within 5 years. This is a goal that I \nstrongly support. VA Secretary Shinseki, himself a decorated veteran, \nhas aggressively taken on this challenge, focusing efforts and funding \ntoward eradicating homelessness.\n  Last Friday, I rose on this floor to increase funding for the \nhomelessness and grant per diem program to the fully authorized amount \nof $150 million. This vital program has produced real results, offering \ntransitional housing to veterans and their families and allowing \norganizations to construct and renovate facilities that can provide a \nmultitude of services. I am hopeful that we will see this amendment \npass and this level of funding included in the final bill.\n  However, if we are going to reach the President's goal of ending \nveterans' homelessness in five years, more will be needed. For that \nreason, I am joined today by Senator Bond in introducing S. 2760, \nlegislation to increase the authorization of the grant and per diem \nprogram to $200 million. This increased funding can provide hundreds, \nperhaps thousands, of new beds and facilities for veterans in all 50 \nStates.\n  Congressman Harry Teague introduced similar legislation earlier this \nyear in the House where it has been marked up in subcommittee and is \nawaiting further action. I am hopeful that we will see Congress stand \nup to this moral obligation and provide the full resources needed for \nthe thousands of veterans who have no home, who have no hope.\n  Last week, as I offered my amendment, I read a letter from a 15-year-\nold Boy Scout from Albuquerque. His father and grandfather are veterans \nand he is planning to follow in their footsteps and join the military \nhimself when he is old enough. This young man wrote to say how angry he \nis that we are not doing enough to help our homeless veterans. ``These \nmen and women are doing what they were called to do by our \ngovernment,'' he wrote, ``but then they come back and are treated so \npoorly by everyone. We, as a Nation, need to do more to help our \nveterans.''\n  To the smart young man who wrote me that letter and to all of \nAmerica's veterans, this bill builds on efforts to meet our country's \nmoral obligations to the men and women who so bravely served our \ncountry. I thank Senator Bond for his support and I urge fast action to \nmove this legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 2762. A bill to designate certain lands in San Miguel, Ouray, and \nSan Juan Counties, Colorado, as wilderness, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the San \nJuan Mountains Wilderness Act of 2009. This bill is the Senate \ncompanion to the bill introduced by Representative John Salazar in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I want to thank Representative Salazar for all of his great work in \nbringing this bill forward. I am proud to sponsor this legislation in \nthe Senate along with my Colorado colleague, Senator Bennet.\n  The San Juan Mountains Wilderness Act would designate about 33,383 \nacres in southwestern Colorado as wilderness, and about 21,697 acres as \na special management area. It would also withdraw about 6,596 acres \nfrom mineral entry lands within the Naturita Canyon.\n  The bill is the result of the extensive work by many people to \ndevelop a collaborative approach to wilderness proposals and land \nprotection designations. Representative Salazar and his staff worked \nwith the affected Colorado county commissioners and interested \nstakeholders in developing this legislation. It is crafted to take into \naccount the various ongoing uses of these lands, such as for water and \nrecreation, while also providing strong managerial protection for these \nsensitive lands.\n  These lands are indeed worthy of this designation.\n  This region of Colorado is blessed with stunning beauty. Much of the \nland proposed for wilderness and other protections in this legislation \nare additions to existing wilderness. Those areas include the Mt. \nSneffels Wilderness Area and the Lizard Head Wilderness--two areas that \ncontain fourteen thousand foot peaks. They are defined\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\nby their rugged beauty or rock and ice surrounded by forests that frame \nthese peaks in summer's vibrant greens and brilliant fall colors.\n  The bill also establishes a new area called McKenna Peak. This peak \npresides over imposing sandstone cliffs which rise 2,000 feet above the \nplain that presents a remarkable opportunity to add a unique landform \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. It also provides \nimportant winter wildlife habitat for large numbers of deer and elk. \nThe Peak borders North Mountain, now considered to contain one of the \nlargest deer and elk herds in all of Colorado. The Division of Wildlife \nplaces winter numbers of deer at 500 to 600, with up to 150 wintering \nelk. The favorable habitat for deer and elk naturally draws many \nhunters. Over 30,000 recreation user days are recorded annually during \nhunting season in the game management unit of which McKenna Peak is a \npart.\n  A wild horse herd numbering about 100 roams the western reaches of \nMcKenna Peak within the designated Spring Creek Wild Horse Herd \nManagement Area. Bald eagles winter in the lower reaches of the area, \nand peregrine falcons have been sighted as well. Mountain lions, \nbobcats, and black bear are also known to inhabit McKenna Peak. Other \nnatural features of interest include rich fossil beds.\n  Moreover, the bill would establish the Sheep Mountain Special \nManagement Area. This area is equally as striking as the surrounding \nmountains and valleys that are already protected or would be protected \nas wilderness in this legislation. However, since helicopter skiing \ncurrently exists in this area, the legislation designates this area in \na way that protects its wilderness character, but still allows this use \nto continue. It is the sort of accommodation that is reflective of \nsound wilderness and land protection proposals, and I appreciate the \ncompromises that are reflected in this approach.\n  As many of these lands are in high altitude areas, there should not \nbe any issues related to water or other conflicts. As a result, the \nlegislation does not exert a federally reserved water right, but allows \naccess to existing water facilities and needs while also precluding any \nfederal assistance for any new or expansion of existing water resource \nfacility.\n  This bill has been carefully crafted and narrowly tailored to apply \ndeserving protections to these lands. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in seeing it passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous Consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2762\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

WATER.\n\n       (a) Findings, Purpose, and Definition.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the lands designated as wilderness or a Special \n     Management Area by this Act are located at the headwaters of \n     the streams and rivers on those lands, with few, if any, \n     actual or proposed water resource facilities located upstream \n     from such lands and few, if any, opportunities for diversion, \n     storage, or other uses of water occurring outside such lands \n     that would adversely affect the wilderness values of such \n     lands;\n       (B) the lands designated as wilderness or Special \n     Management Area by this Act are not suitable for use for \n     development of new water resource facilities, or for the \n     expansion of existing facilities; and\n       (C) therefore, it is possible to provide for proper \n     management and protection of the wilderness value of such \n     lands in ways different from those utilized in other \n     legislation designating as wilderness lands not sharing the \n     attributes of the lands designated as wilderness or Special \n     Management Area by this Act.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to protect the \n     wilderness values of the lands designated as wilderness or \n     Special Management Area by this Act by means other than those \n     based on a Federal reserved water right.\n       (3) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``water \n     resource facility'' means irrigation and pumping facilities, \n     reservoirs, water conservation works, aqueducts, canals, \n     ditches, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, and \n     transmission and other ancillary facilities, and other water \n     diversion, storage, and carriage structures.\n       (b) Restrictions on Rights and Disclaimer of Effect.--\n       (1) Water rights claims.--Neither the Secretary of \n     Agriculture nor the Secretary of the Interior, nor any other \n     officer, employee, representative, or agent of the United \n     States, nor any other person, shall assert in any court or \n     agency, nor shall any court or agency consider, any claim to \n     or for water or water rights in the State of Colorado, which \n     is based on any construction of any portion of this Act, or \n     the designation of any lands as wilderness or Special \n     Management Area by this Act, as constituting an express or \n     implied reservation of water or water rights.\n       (2) No affect on water rights.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed as a creation, recognition, disclaimer, \n     relinquishment, or reduction of any water rights of the \n     United States in the State of Colorado existing before the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) No interpretation or designation.--Except as provided \n     in subsection (g), nothing in this Act shall be construed as \n     constituting an interpretation of any other Act or any \n     designation made by or pursuant thereto.\n       (4) No precedent.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as establishing a precedent with regard to any \n     future wilderness designations.\n       (c) New or Expanded Projects.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, on and after the date of enactment of this \n     Act neither the President nor any other officer, employee, or \n     agent of the United States shall fund, assist, authorize, or \n     issue a license or permit for the development of any new \n     water resource facility within the areas described in \n     sections 3 and 4 or the enlargement of any water resource \n     facility within the areas described in sections 3 and 4.\n       (d) Access and Operation.--\n       (1) Access to water resource facilities.--Subject to the \n     provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall allow \n     reasonable access to water resource facilities in existence \n     on the date of enactment of this Act within the areas \n     described in sections 3 and 4, including motorized access \n     where necessary and customarily employed on routes existing \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Access routes.--Existing access routes within such \n     areas customarily employed as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act may be used, maintained, repaired, and replaced to \n     the extent necessary to maintain their present function, \n     design, and serviceable operation, so long as such activities \n     have no increased adverse impacts on the resources and values \n     of the areas described in sections 3 and 4 than existed as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Use of water resource facilities.--Subject to the \n     provisions of subsections (c) and (d), the Secretary shall \n     allow water resource facilities existing on the date of \n     enactment of this Act within areas described in sections 3 \n     and 4 to be used, operated, maintained, repaired, and \n     replaced to the extent necessary for the continued exercise, \n     in accordance with Colorado State law, of vested water rights \n     adjudicated for use in connection with such facilities by a \n     court of competent jurisdiction prior to the date of \n     enactment of this Act.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to authorize loan \nguarantees for health information technology; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we move forward in modernizing our \nhealth care system, we must not forget the small businesses that simply \ncannot afford the upfront costs of installing new health information \ntechnology. That is why today I am introducing the Small Business \nHealth Information Technology Financing Act. This bill will amend the \nSmall Busis Act to allow the administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to guarantee up to 90 percent of the amount of a loan to \nsmall business health professionals to be used for the purchase and \ninstallation of health information technology. The loans can be used \nfor computer hardware, software and other technology that will assist \nin the use of electronic health records and prescriptions.\n  A modernized health system using electronic prescribing and \nelectronic health records will help improve patient care while reducing \ncosts. Electronic prescribing not only saves money through improved \nefficiency, but more importantly, it reduces medical errors and saves \nlives. According to the Institute of Medicine, 1/3 of written \nprescriptions require follow-up clarification, with medication mistakes \ncausing 7,000 deaths and 1.5 million injuries per year. The Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act that was enacted into law \nin July 2008 included provisions from my electronic prescribing bill, \nproviding incentive payments for medical professionals using electronic \nprescribing. Now we must take an additional step to make health IT \naccessible to small providers so they can afford to implement new \ntechnology such as e-prescribing and electronic health records.\n  Small businesses employ more than half of all private sector \nemployees and have generated 64 percent of net new jobs in the past 15 \nyears. Access to capital for small health providers not only benefits \npatients but also boosts small businesses in the medical field. Helping \nsmall businesses grow and succeed is critical as we look to create jobs \nand strengthen the economy.\n  It is my hope that we can move forward with this bill in a bi-\npartisan manner. I ask all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 2766. A bill to provide for the coverage of medically necessary \nfood under Federal health programs and private health insurance; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year an estimated 2,550 children in \nthe U.S. are diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism disorder. For \nthe rest of their lives they will need modified foods that are void of \nthe nutrients their body is incapable of processing. They may also \nrequire supplementation with pharmacological doses of vitamins and \namino acids. The good news is that with treatment they can lead normal, \nproductive lives. But without these foods and supplements, patients can \nbecome severely brain-damaged and hospitalized.\n  Newborn screening has made a tremendous difference in the early \ndiagnosis of metabolic disorders, but affordable and accessible \ntreatment options remain out of reach for too many Americans. Medical \nfoods and supplements which are necessary for treatment may not be \ncovered by insurance policies and can be prohibitively expensive for \nmany families. For those with a metabolic disorder, medical foods are \ncritical in treatment, just as other conditions are treated with pills \nor injections. The sporadic insurance coverage of treatment has already \nbeen recognized as a problem. Over 30 States have enacted laws to \nenforce coverage of medical foods, but too many loopholes Thmain and \nfederal legislation is necessary to ensure that these individuals \nreceive what they need to stay well.\n  The Medical Foods Equity Act follows the April 2009 recommendations \nof the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary's Advisory Committee on \nHeritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. It will ensure coverage \nof medical foods and necessary supplements for individuals with \ndisorders as recommended by the Advisory Committee and, most \nimportantly, peace of mind for those families affected by inborn errors \nof metabolism.\n  The lack of medical food coverage available to families has a \nsignificant impact on their lives. With the current situation of \nvarying regulations between States and insurance providers, even \nfamilies with coverage find themselves living in fear that a change in \ninsurance provider will lead to reduced or nonexistent coverage. Too \nmany Americans across the country are struggling to access the \ntreatment they need for this type of disorder.\n  Take the story of Donna from Wilmington, MA. Donna has two daughters \nwith phenylketonuria and she speaks eloquently about the frustration \nshe experienced after her employer switched insurance plans. Because \nmedical foods are not listed along with other necessary medicines, \nDonna was forced to navigate a long list mostly made up of durable \nmedical equipment providers unequipped to help her. Even when she \nfinally found a pharmacy that could order the formula, she was told \nthat they required an upfront payment because they were wary of not \nbeing reimbursed by insurance companies. In Donna's own words, she was \ndismayed at ``having that feeling like you're being held hostage every \ntime a change may occur in your insurance or carrier.''\n  Donna's story sharply illustrates the potential pitfalls even for \nthose with insurance that offers some coverage. Too many families face \na lack of coverage altogether. Take the case of Gwen of Waltham, \nMassachusetts. Her son Austen was 36 hours old when his heart stopped \nfor over 20 minutes. Thankfully, he was stabilized but one doctor gave \nhim only 6 months to live. A second opinion brought hope for Austen's \nfamily and a diagnosis of Glutaric Acidemia Type Two. Glutaric Acidemia \nType Two is an inborn error of metabolism managed almost exclusively \nthrough diet. Because of the disorder, Austen cannot metabolize much \nfat or protein. He relies on supplements and specialty foods. \nMassHealth, Medicaid, covers most of the supplements but not the foods. \nGwen pays for his food out of pocket, a significant strain on the \nfamily budget at a time when many families can least afford it. That \nstrain is coupled with fears of job security and thoughts of what would \nhappen if she could not pay for Austen's medical foods. No parent \nshould have to see their child recover from a life-threatening trauma \nonly to spend every day worrying about payment for their medical \ntreatment--a treatment just as necessary as insulin for a diabetic or \nchemotherapy for a cancer patient.\n  As newborn screening and medical advances continue to improve the \nability of those born with an inborn error of metabolism to lead full, \nhealthy lives, we must make sure that the necessary treatments are \navailable. The Medical Foods Equity Act will close existing loopholes \nin coverage and provide the parity in coverage these families deserve. \nIt is my hope that we can move forward with this bill in a bi-partisan \nmanner. I ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11349-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11349-S11350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 349--SUPPORTING AND ENCOURAGING GREATER SUPPORT FOR \n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Johanns) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which has considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1422 and the \nSenate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1422) to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     of 1993 to clarify the eligibility requirements with respect \n     to airline flight crews.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I would like to engage my friend, the \nSenator from Washington and the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety, with whom I have been pleased to work \non many initiatives on behalf of America's workforce, in a conversation \nabout the bill she has just introduced. I would like to take this \nopportunity to clarify the treatment of workers contained in the Flight \nCrew Technical Corrections Act before us today that pertains to flight \ncrews. Is it the Senator's understanding that her legislation resolves \na problem unique to flight crews--meaning flight attendants and \npilots--and that no other group of workers is addressed under this \nbill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the Senator is correct. This bill is narrowly \nconstructed to address the unique situation faced by flight attendants \nand pilots in the calculation of the hours they need to qualify for \nleave under the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA. I understand that the \nFMLA eligibility calculation does not include paid vacation, sick, \nmedical or personal leave unless otherwise agreed to in a collective \nbargaining agreements or the employers manual. This bill reflects the \nintent of the FMLA's original sponsors to provide an alternative way to \ninclude flight crews that addresses the airline industry's unique time-\nkeeping methods. I am proud that the Flight Crew Technical Corrections \nAct fixes a technical problem that has left many full-time flight crew \nmembers ineligible for family medical leave for many years due to the \nunique way their work hours are calculated.\n  Mr. ENZI. In other words, is it the Senator's understanding that the \nbill should not be construed to apply to other occupational groups that \noperate under reserve systems such as health care, railway, and \nemergency services to seek similar treatment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Correct, this bill narrowly deals with flight crews \nonly. The bill is a technical correction for language that was intended \nto be in the original Family Medical Leave Act, but for some reason or \nanother was left out. Flight crews were specifically mentioned in the \nFMLA's legislative history. Thus, I believe that the correction is \nclearly appropriate for flight crews. If other groups were to attempt \nan adjustment in their FMLA eligibility requirements, I suggest that \ntheir situation and the ramifications of such an adjustment would need \nto be examined on a case by case basis.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator mentioned the FMLA's legislative history. Is it \nthe Senator's further understanding that this is the only group of \nemployees which was intended to be included with an alternative \neligibility standard?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. The original authors stated that \nthey did not intend to exclude flight crews in unique circumstances \nfrom the bill's protection simply because of the airline industry's \n``unusual time keeping methods.'' They believed that these workers--\nflight attendants and pilots--were entitled to family and medical leave \nunder the law based upon the situation they specifically faced.\n  This legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in the \nHouse of Representatives. I am pleased to present it in the Senate with \nbipartisan support. This language was drafted through a process that \nincluded representatives from large and small airline carriers and \ncarrier associations, and organized labor. I need to recognize the work \nthat Senator Clinton did on this bill when she introduced its precursor \nin the 110th Congress.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to thank the Senator from Washington and the \nformer Senator from New York for the deliberative process they both \nutilized while drafting this legislation. As the Senator knows, I am a \nfrequent advocate for following Senate committee process so as to \ncreate the opportunity for all affected stakeholders to be included in \nthe process. In this case, the Senator has done an admirable job of \nvetting the legislation with most stakeholders and produced a better \nproduct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a Murray \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 350) recognizing November 14, 2009, \n     as the 49th anniversary of the first day of integrated \n     schools in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, last spring, a first grade teacher at \nBarton Elementary School in Milwaukee contacted my office seeking help \nin furthering a project her classroom had started. The Ruby Bridges \nProject began as a modest effort to teach a first grade class in \nMilwaukee, WI, about the courage and bravery another first grader \ndisplayed on November 14, 1960, when she became the first child to \nintegrate a public elementary school in New Orleans, LA. Soon, the Ruby \nBridges Project grew and expanded because these first graders at Barton \nElementary School wanted to teach other students in Milwaukee about \nRuby Bridges. These first graders' efforts were featured in the local \nmedia and supported by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and then State \nSuperintendent of Education Elizabeth Burmaster, who wrote letters of \ncommendation for the project. The class\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\nalso started a petition which garnered over 2,000 signatures from \nWisconsinites, and which was sent to President Obama asking him to \ndesignate a national day of recognition honoring Ruby Bridges.\n  On November 14, 1960, Ruby Bridges became the first African-American \nchild to attend William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans, LA. \nWhile she is forever immortalized in Norman Rockwell's painting as a \nsix-year-old child being escorted to school by U.S. Marshals, with \ntomatoes splattered in the background, her story is one of courage, \nbravery and a lifelong commitment to raising awareness of diversity \nthrough improved educational opportunities for all children. Even \nthough Ruby Bridges endured riots and protests and retaliations against \nher family, she attended school at William Frantz every day during the \n1960-61 school year. She was supported by her teacher, Ms. Barbara \nHenry, who herself faced retaliation and was not invited back to teach \nat William Frantz the following school year. Ruby went on to graduate \nhigh school and college, have a career and raise a family.\n  In 1999, Ruby Bridges established the Ruby Bridges Foundation to help \neliminate racism and improve society by educating students around the \ncountry about her experiences, discussing ongoing efforts to promote \ndiversity and providing lessons students could take back to their \ncommunities. Even today, 49 years after Ruby Bridges became the first \nchild to attend integrated school in New Orleans, LA, her story \nprovides an inspiring example for our young people. The story of Ruby \nBridges has affected and influenced the lives of children across the \ncountry and one first grade class in Milwaukee, WI, in particular.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this Senate resolution \nrecognizing November 14, 2009, as the 49th anniversary of the first \nschool integration in New Orleans, LA, and commending Ruby Bridges for \nher bravery, courage and lifetime commitment to raising awareness of \ndiversity through education.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, that there be no intervening action \nor debate, and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 350) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 350\n\n       Whereas, in 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated \n     schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution;\n       Whereas Judge J. Skelly Wright, of the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, ordered \n     the Orleans Parish School Board to develop a school \n     desegregation plan in 1956 and, after years of delay, in \n     1960, ordered the Orleans Parish School Board to carry out a \n     plan designed by the United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Louisiana;\n       Whereas 6 years after the Brown v. Board of Education (347 \n     U.S. 483) decision, on November 14, 1960, Ruby Bridges, at \n     the age of 6, became the first African-American student to \n     attend the all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New \n     Orleans, Louisiana;\n       Whereas, in 1995, Ruby Bridges contributed to ``The Story \n     of Ruby Bridges'', a book for children, and, in 1999, wrote \n     ``Through My Eyes'' to help educate children and people of \n     all ages about her experiences and the importance of \n     tolerance;\n       Whereas Ruby Bridges established the Ruby Bridges \n     Foundation in 1999 to help eliminate racism and improve \n     society by educating students about the experiences of Ruby \n     Bridges, discuss ongoing efforts to promote diversity, and \n     provide lessons students can take back to their own \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, in 2002, the Ruby Bridges Foundation, along with \n     the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum for Tolerance in Los \n     Angeles, launched The Ruby's Bridges Project, a program that \n     brought together students from diverse backgrounds to develop \n     relationship-building skills and promote an appreciation of \n     one another: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes November 14, 2009, as the 49th anniversary \n     of the first day of integrated schools in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana;\n       (2) remembers Judge J. Skelly Wright for his advocacy, \n     support, and lifelong commitment to promoting civil rights, \n     fairness, and equality;\n       (3) commends Ruby Bridges for her bravery and courage 49 \n     years ago, and for her lifetime commitment to raising \n     awareness of diversity through improved educational \n     opportunities for all children;\n       (4) supports policies and efforts to--\n       (A) close the achievement gap in the schools of our Nation;\n       (B) improve the high school graduation rate for all \n     students;\n       (C) strengthen the ability of all students to attend and \n     complete post-secondary education; and\n       (D) promote the benefits of school integration throughout \n     the educational careers of students; and\n       (5) congratulates all the individuals who have dedicated \n     their lives to the field of education and to promoting equal \n     opportunities for all students regardless of the backgrounds \n     of the students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11355-S11356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we have worked hard today. We have had a \nnumber of Senators go to Fort Hood. We have had a number of speeches \ntoday that were extremely good relating to Veterans Day, which is \ntomorrow. We had a moment of silence for the fallen at Fort Hood. And \nwe arrived at an agreement on a very important bill, the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs bill. I am glad we were able to do \nthat. I wish we didn't have as many amendments as we do, but we have \nhad a number of intervening problems. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who \nrepresents the State of Texas, was necessarily detained in Texas. She \nhad to be there, and we understand that. I think a number of amendments \nlisted will be worked out with the two managers. I feel fairly \nconfident we will not have to have all those votes. Senators should \nexpect the next vote, as I indicated, at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/10/senate-section/article/S11357-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
