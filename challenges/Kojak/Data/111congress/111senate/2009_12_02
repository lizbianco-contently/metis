Mr. President, this historic health care reform bill before \nus is strong, and it is a strong head start in the right direction \ntoward urgently needed change. But similar to nearly every bill to come \nbefore the Senate, it stands to benefit from the constructive input of \nall Senators. This good bill will be even better when this body debates \nit, refines it, and improves it.\n  I am pleased we have begun the amendment process. I hope we will soon \nbe able to begin voting on those amendments--the ones drafted and \nsponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. But as we delve into the \ndetails and give the individual parts of this bill the considerable \nthought and attention they deserve, let's not forget the big picture.\n  So as we begin the third day of debate on this bill, let's remember \nwhat it does: First, we are making it more affordable for every \nAmerican to live a healthy life. Second, we are doing it in a way that \nis fiscally responsible and in a way that will help our economy \nrecover.\n  This bill does not add a dime to the deficit--quite the opposite. In \nfact, we will cut it by $130 billion in the first 10 years and as much \nas $\\3/4\\ trillion in the next 10 years. We do this by keeping costs \ndown. This critical piece of legislation will cost less than $85 \nbillion a year over the next decade--well under President Obama's goal. \nIt will make sure every American can afford quality health care. We \nwill make sure that more than 30 million Americans who don't have \nhealth care today will soon have it. It will not only protect Medicare, \nbut it will make it stronger. In short, this legislation saves lives, \nsaves money, and saves Medicare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and respected economists outside \nWashington have studied it, and they agree. The bill will do what we \nset out to do at the beginning of this Congress: It will lower costs \nand increase value so all Americans can afford quality health care, not \njust a few.\n  The experts have crunched the numbers, and they have come back with \npositive reviews. It will help parents afford to take care of their \nchildren and help bosses provide coverage for their workers. It creates \nmore choices and more competition in the health care market. It will \nprotect everyone against insurance company abuses, and for all the \nchanges, in areas where our health care system does work, it keeps it \nthe way it is.\n  I am very happy with the way Democratic Senators have stood for these\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nprinciples and those who have defended them against hollow attacks from \nthe other side. One after another, Republicans have come to the floor \nwith disingenuous claims.\n  For example, they have talked about health care premiums, overlooking \nthe fact that those costs will go down for the vast majority of \nAmericans--in fact, 93 percent. They have talked about the deficit, \nignoring the fact that health care reform will do more to lower the \ndeficit than any other measure has in years--remember, over 20 years, \nalmost $\\3/4\\ trillion. They have tried to scare seniors, saying you \nare going to die soon, as an example, closing their eyes to the fact \nthat we strengthen Medicare and cut waste, fraud, and abuse from the \nprogram. They have tried to scare women, closing their ears to the fact \nthat we will make it easier than ever for women to get the preventive \nscreenings they need, and that is a gross understatement. They claim to \nspeak for the American people but neglect to mention that, for the last \nyear, a majority of the Americans have consistently said it is more \nimportant than ever to nurse our health care system back to health.\n  What is the most consistent Republican attack on this bill? They \ncarefully count the number of pages in this legislation but completely \ndiscount the number of people it helps. Can anyone think of a more \nsuperficial way to measure the worth of a bill than how many pages it \nis printed on? As far as I can tell, the only threat that poses is more \npaper cuts, perhaps.\n  Those who want to keep the broken system the way it is throw \neverything they can at the wall, but nothing has stuck. Incredibly, my \ndistinguished counterpart, the Republican leader, last week, called the \nhealth care crisis manufactured, in spite of the fact that 750,000 \npeople filed for bankruptcy last year--70 percent of them because of \nhealth care costs. In one sense, my Republican counterpart is right--it \nwas manufactured. This health care crisis has been manufactured by the \ngreedy insurance companies that raise families' rates on a whim and \ndeny health care to the sick.\n  Remember, the health care industry is exempt from the antitrust laws. \nThey can conspire to fix prices with no civil or criminal penalties. No \nother business is like that, except baseball. This crisis was \nmanufactured by leaders who enabled them, who empowered them, and who \nsat idly by while the problem grew worse and worse, until it finally \ncollapsed into a crisis.\n  My Republican friends have been so busy coming up with distortions \nthat they have forgotten to come up with solutions. They seem more \nconcerned with scaring the American people than helping them. This \nbarrage of baseless accusations underscores how desperate some are to \ndistract the American people from the real debate and from the fact \nthey have no vision for fixing our health care system, which is broken.\n\n  Yes, correcting the record has taken a long time. That is OK. We will \ncontinue to do so as long as necessary. Democrats are more than willing \nto defend this good bill. After all, it is not hard to do. As Mark \nTwain, a great Nevadan, said: ``If you tell the truth, you don't have \nto remember anything.''\n  I wish to note that I especially appreciate the assistant leader, my \nfriend of decades, Senator Durbin, for his brilliant statements on the \nfloor during the last several weeks on this health care issue. I so \nadmire his spunk, his intelligence, and his ability to deliver a \nmessage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12094-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to continue our debate on the McCain \namendment to ensure Medicare benefits for our seniors are not cut, as \nwould happen under this legislation, I wanted to talk a little bit \nabout the commitments we have made to our seniors and what exactly \nwould happen under the legislation that is before us.\n  As we all know, seniors have paid into the Medicare Program, and that \nis with the expectation that they will get the benefits that have been \npromised to them. The question is, Why would we, at this point, reduce \nthe benefits that have been promised to them, especially if the purpose \nis not to enhance the financial viability of Medicare, which everyone \nknows is going broke but, rather, to use that money to establish a new \nentitlement program?\n  Let me break down the list of cuts seniors would face under this \nlegislation: $137.5 billion would be cut from hospitals that treat \nseniors, $120 billion from the Medicare Advantage plan. By the way, \nthat Medicare Advantage plan serves almost 40 percent of the Arizona \nseniors on Medicare. It cuts $14.6 billion from nursing homes, $42.1 \nbillion from home health care, and $7.7 billion from hospice care. \nThese are deep cuts, and you cannot avoid jeopardizing the health care \nseniors now have under Medicare by making these deep cuts. That is why \nthe Chief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--we \nuse the initials CMS--believes these cuts would cause some providers to \nend their participation in Medicare, which, of course, would further \nthreaten seniors' access to care. There would not be as many providers \nto whom they could go for their services.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle say part of this is an \nintention to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Of course, we have \nknown for many years that there is waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, \nbut actually doing something about the problem and recognizing it are \ntwo different things. If it were easy to wring hundreds of billions of \ndollars of savings from Medicare by just pointing to waste, fraud, and \nabuse, we would have done it a long time ago. Certainly the President \nwould, during his first year in office, want to do that, given the fact \nwe are spending a lot of money and he is trying to find sources of \nrevenue for the various spending programs he has proposed. If it were \nthat easy to do, it would have been done before now.\n  Moreover, Medicare faces a $38 trillion, 75-year unfunded liability. \nThat is almost incomprehensible. Most of us believe that whatever \nsavings we could achieve in Medicare, to the extent you could eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, for example, you should do that to help make \nMedicare solvent.\n  Next I want to talk about what seniors are telling us. They believe, \naccording to public opinion surveys--and I have talked to enough of \nthem to know this is true--that these Medicare cuts are going to \njeopardize their health care. They are troubled in particular by this \n$120 billion proposed cut to Medicare Advantage. It has been called the \ncrown jewel of Medicare. It is the private insurance addition to \nMedicare in which many are able to participate in programs they would \nnever have been able to afford otherwise. It gives them this choice to \nsupplement Medicare to provide all kinds\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\nof benefits such as dental, vision, hearing, physical fitness programs, \nand other things, as I said, that they could not get otherwise. One in \nfour of the beneficiaries in Arizona, as I said, signs up for this \nprogram--more than 329,000 seniors. They like the low deductibles and \ncopayments in Medicare Advantage.\n  But the Congressional Budget Office has bad news for the seniors who \nlike this program and who like the extra benefits they have under \nMedicare Advantage because, as the Congressional Budget Office notes, \nit would cut benefits on average by 64 percent over the next 10 years, \nfrom an actuarial value of $135 to $49 a month. Think about that. The \nactuarial value of the benefits the average Medicare Advantage \nparticipant has is worth $135 a month today. It would be cut in this \nbill to $49 a month. That is a 64-percent cut, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. When we say we are not cutting benefits \nseniors currently receive, that is not true. This legislation would do \nthat.\n  I have been sharing letters from constituents who have expressed \nconcerns to me. Let me share three more letters today.\n  One recently arrived from Joseph and Mary-Lou Dopak of Sun City West, \nin Arizona, of course. They wrote as follows:\n\n       The plan to reduce our coverage and take $120 billion from \n     Medicare Advantage is a slap in the face to all seniors. The \n     Medicare Advantage plan works because Medicare funds are \n     given to a private insurance company to administer the plan.\n       We do not want our Medicare Advantage plan robbed to fund a \n     government-operated comprehensive health insurance plan. \n     Commonsense tells us that will not work.\n       The President should be fixing what ails the current health \n     care system, instead of putting everyone into a government-\n     operated health care plan.\n       For our President to pick on Medicare Advantage is totally \n     unfair to those of us upon whose shoulders this country has \n     been built.\n\n  A constituent from Tucson, AZ, wrote a rather short and direct \nletter, and so it is easy to quote here.\n\n       I am a senior citizen age 83. If I lose my Medicare \n     Advantage coverage, I'll also lose my primary care physician \n     of 18 years because he does not accept Medicare Direct. \n     Senator Kyl, do not let them take away my Medicare Advantage.\n\n  I get these letters every day. I have not yet had a constituent come \nup to me and say: Please, would you take away the Medicare Advantage \nProgram, it is not right. Everybody has said, of course: Please \npreserve this important program.\n  Finally, a constituent from Phoenix, AZ, who suffers from multiple \nsclerosis, describes what it means to her.\n\n       I am a 57-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis, currently \n     on Social Security Disability. I make under $14,000 a year \n     and have been on the Secure Horizons Medicare Advantage plan \n     for a long time now. . . .\n       I realize it is hard for Congress to understand, but we \n     need to keep our Medicare Advantage plans in order to have \n     [quality] health care at a price we can afford.\n       We need you to help protect Medicare Advantage plans for \n     the seniors in your State. We are the ones you need to fight \n     for and we should not have to choose between going to a \n     doctor and getting our medication and having food on the \n     table and a place to live. Please do your part to protect our \n     Medicare Advantage plans and keep prices within our reach.\n\n  As I said, these are the kinds of letters we get all the time. It is \nhard for these folks to understand, first of all, why, having paid into \nthe plan and having taken advantage of what is a good supplement to the \nbasic Medicare, that would be taken away from them. I think it is even \nharder for them to fathom that the reason it is being done is to pay \nfor a new program rather than to keep Medicare itself solvent.\n  I tell folks like this that I will continue to fight for her and I \nwill continue to try to protect this program because we believe it is \nessential. It is why I support the McCain amendment to commit the bill \nback to committee. It only has to be there a day. We are not talking \nabout a further delay here. But it addresses both of the key issues of \ncuts and savings. If the McCain amendment passes, it would send the \nbill back to the Finance Committee with instructions to remove the \nMedicare cuts from the bill. That is all it does. But, second, those \nsavings would be applied to Medicare rather than to fund a new \ngovernment program. Those savings could therefore address the waste, \nfraud, and abuse problem that has been identified by everyone. It can \nbe used to strengthen the Medicare trust fund rather than to fund a new \nhealth care entitlement program.\n  We believe the first thing we should do to see whether we can \nactually fix this bill--I have been quoted as saying that I don't think \nwe can fix this bill. By that, I mean, with all due respect to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, I don't think they want to \nmake the changes I think would be necessary for the American people to \nbegin to support this kind of legislation. Seniors are overwhelmingly \nopposed to the Medicare cuts. That is a fact. If my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are not willing to support the McCain amendment \nor something like it, I don't know how we could then say we can fix \nthis bill. So I hope my colleagues will use this process we have to \nactually make amendments to the bill and not simply have a political \ndiscussion.\n\n  Republicans have pointed out that there are better ways to reform the \nhealth care problems we have today than to do it on the backs of \nseniors. We put forth a bounty of ideas. Let me just recoup some of \nthem.\n  We think we could start and we could save a great deal of money by \nmedical malpractice reform. That would bring down costs. We could allow \nAmericans to buy lower cost insurance policies across State lines. That \nalone would unleash a wave of competition for patients' business. We \ncould allow small businesses to band together to get the same \npurchasing power big businesses have. These ideas have essentially been \nignored by the majority. Instead, we have this big government takeover \nof health care at a huge cost and significant reduction in quality and \nbenefits to the American people. We don't think this is the way to go.\n  Certainly, on behalf of my senior citizen constituents and others who \nare on Medicare Programs, I am going to continue to fight for them, as \nmy colleague John McCain is, and therefore urge my colleagues to \nsupport his amendment to eliminate the Medicare cuts under this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the McCain \nmotion, and I do it from the perspective of a representative of the \nState of Kansas.\n  We have a number of senior citizens and hospitals that are Medicare-\ndependent. We have a number of providers for whom a majority of their \npractice is Medicare reimbursement. They are scared to death of these \ncuts, and the cuts are well documented--$500 billion in Medicare cuts, \nand for the 43 million senior citizens on a program that is already \nprojected to go insolvent by 2017, specific cuts of $135 billion from \nhospitals, $120 billion from 11 million seniors in Medicare Advantage, \nnearly $15 billion from nursing homes, nearly $40 billion from home \nhealth agencies, and then--a cruel gesture, it seems to me--nearly $8 \nbillion from hospice, where people are getting their final care for \ncancer and diseases that are killing them--$8 billion cut from hospice.\n  What that does in a State such as mine and in many rural hospitals, \nit cuts the legs out from under them. They are not going to have the \nmoney they need to operate. They are going to do everything they can to \ncontinue to operate--and they will, probably. What they will try to do \nis tax their local citizenry, raise property taxes, in all probability, \nto make up for the Medicare cuts because they are going to have a \nhospital there and they are going to do everything they can to keep a \nhospital there.\n  But what a terrible gesture on our part here, to take money that has \nbeen going into Medicare--and people have been paying into Medicare--\nand then steal it for a new program that is not going to get everybody \ncovered on top of that and from a program that is already set to go \ninsolvent by 2017. It is like writing a big fat check on an overdrawn \nbank account to start something new, to buy a new motorcycle. That \ndoesn't make sense to people. Then it seems cruel and unusual to the \nsenior citizens that you are taking $500 billion and really gutting a \nlot of their care programs on a program that doesn't work.\n  I met earlier, within the last several days, with the Kansas \nAssociation of\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nAnesthesiologists. They are looking at these things and saying: This is \nreally going to hurt us and our ability to provide services and care. I \ntalked with other individuals who look at this, and they say: Wait a \nminute, you are going to change everything to try to get a few more \npeople covered and you are going to gut a Medicare program that is not \npaying the bills now, that a number of private insurance plans are \nhelping to subsidize Medicare and Medicaid, and you are going to cut \nthe reimbursements that are not making things work yet? It makes no \nsense to individuals that this would take place.\n  I get called by a number of individuals across the State of Kansas \nsaying they are very scared of this bill and what it is going to do to \ntheir health care. I do telephone townhall meetings, as a number of \nindividuals across this body do, and the individuals there whom you get \non a random phone calling basis are scared and mad about this bill and \nthe prospects of what it does to their health care. I get it from \nindividuals. I get it from mail.\n  I was in a meeting in Kansas the week of Thanksgiving, and I polled \nthe audience--it was an audience that was mostly over the age of 65--\nhow many were in favor of the overall bill? There were about 200-some \npeople there, and 10 were in favor. How many opposed? Everybody else, \nwith a few saying they don't have an opinion. But it was 90 percent, 95 \npercent opposed to this bill, and it is because they look at it and \nthey see what it is going to do to them, and they don't see it \nproviding the care that is being promised--and adding, on top of that, \nto the deficit.\n  One of two things is going to happen on these Medicare cuts, because \nwe have seen, in the past, efforts to control the spending in Medicare \npassed by this body and then each year those cuts to try to restrain \nthe spending on Medicare being restored.\n  One of two things is going to happen. Either these cuts in Medicare \nare going to take place, and it is going to cripple the program and \nparticularly hurt it in a number of rural areas across the country and \nin my State, or these cuts will never take place in Medicare and it is \ngoing to add to a ballooning deficit and debt that is taking place \nright now. Either choice is an irresponsible choice for this body to \ndo. It is irresponsible for us to do for this country. Most people look \nat it and say: I want to get more people covered, and I want to bend \ndown the cost curve. But let's do that on an incremental basis.\n  Senator Kyl spoke about incremental changes that can take place, \nwhether it is tort reform, allowing bigger pooling on health insurance, \nwhether it is starting more community-based clinics, one that I look at \nas something that has worked in my State to get more people covered at \nan earlier phase in their health care needs. All of those are \nincremental, low cost, and, in some cases, ones that actually do bend \ndown the cost curve and that can help, not a gargantuan $2.5 trillion \nprogram that takes $500 billion out of Medicare that is already headed \ntoward insolvency in less than a decade. The bill doesn't make sense to \nindividuals.\n  Then to do it on top of a time period when the President, 10 days \nago, comes back from China, meeting with our bankers, as most people \nlook at it, and the bankers lecturing us on why are we spending more \nmoney which we don't have, going further and further into debt, which \nwe should not do at this point in time, being lectured by the Chinese \nwhen we ought to be talking to them about what they are doing about \nhuman rights and currency. We are being lectured about fiscal \nirresponsibility, and it is because of bills such as this. If we just \nstop and slow down and listen to seniors and others across this \ncountry, there is a commonsense middle ground that we can go to, that \ndoesn't cost anything along the nature of this, doesn't change health \ncare for most people but addresses the narrow problem of getting the \ncost curve down, of getting more people covered. This bill with these \ncuts in Medicare cripples many of my providers in the State of Kansas \nand will make them raise property taxes to keep the hospitals open, to \ntry to provide doctors in the community--a lot of the hospitals are \ngoing to close and a lot of providers will stop providing Medicare--or, \nin all probability, these cuts will never happen, and it will be added \nto the debt and deficit, completely irresponsible toward our kids.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the McCain motion that makes sense, \nthat is what the citizenry wants to do: send these cuts in Medicare \nback to communities and pull out of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to be on the floor of the Senate with the \ndistinguished Senators from Kansas and Connecticut and Montana. We have \nobviously before us one of the most important issues we will deal with \nin this body.\n  I have had over 40 townhall-like meetings since the beginning of \nAugust. I can say without hesitation that I have never used those \nmeetings to try to focus on some of the hot-button issues that divide \nus. On not one occasion have I tried to do that. I have tried to focus \non the fundamentals of this health care bill. Way back when, when I \nbegan meeting with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--I greatly appreciated his desire to meet with me--and \nrealized that Medicare may be a place where money will be taken to \nleverage a new entitlement, I began expressing my concerns about that.\n  Later, I sent a letter to Majority Leader Reid, signed by 36 \nSenators, talking about the fact that if Medicare moneys were used to \nleverage a new entitlement, we could not support that effort.\n  The reason I say this is, this is the same exact thing I have been \nsaying about this bill from day one, before it was ever constructed. I \nam very dismayed that we find ourselves here in December debating a \nbill that does exactly that.\n  When I first came to this body, there was a lot of concern about the \nsolvency of Medicare. Everyone here knows the trustees have stated that \nin 2017 Medicare will be absolutely insolvent. Two Senators from \nopposite sides of the aisle have tried to create legislation that would \nput in place a commission, eight Republicans and eight Democrats, to \nactually solve that issue. We realize we do not have the resources in \nMedicare to actually deal with the liabilities we have with seniors.\n  The fact that we are taking $464 billion in savings out of Medicare \nto leverage a new entitlement, to me, is totally irresponsible. It is \nthe same thing I have been saying from day one. I am dismayed that we \nwould consider kicking the can down the road, making sure that people \nof the generation of the many people who are helping us on the floor \ntoday will be saddled with huge amounts of cost that they will not be \nable to deal with in a responsible manner. I am discouraged.\n  The fact is, the other piece of this that is extremely troubling is \nthat we all know we have the issue of SDR, the doc fix, which is a \ncolloquial term to describe the fact that in any year after this bill \npasses, physicians across the country will be receiving a 23-percent \ncut for serving Medicare recipients. Medicare recipients understand \nwhat that means. It means they will have less physicians to deal with \nthe needs they will have at that time. This bill, instead of dealing \nwith that issue, deals with it for one year. What that means is there \nis about $250 billion worth of expenses that are not being dealt with \nwith this Medicare savings.\n  Let me go walk it one more time. We have a program that is insolvent. \nWe have a program that cannot meet the needs of those people who have \npaid into it for years and many of us continue to pay into. This \nprogram is insolvent, and we are going to take moneys out of this \nprogram, $464 billion--something that most Americans cannot do, \nsomething that does not pass the commonsense test in Tennessee, and my \nguess is doesn't pass the commonsense test in most States--we are going \nto take $464 billion out of this program, this entitlement which is \nunderfunded and insolvent, and we will leverage it to create a new \nentitlement for Americans. Yet we are not going to deal with the issue \nof the doc fix, which is a $250 billion issue. We are going to kick the \ncan down the road. We are going to cause physicians around the\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\ncountry next year to, if this bill passes--if not, certainly they will \nbe dealing with that this year--but we are going to cause physicians \naround the country another year to be concerned about these huge cuts, \nnot deal with it in this bill, and possibly end up with a $250 billion \nobligation that could have been dealt with during this health care \nreform that now is not met, that is going to create additional fiscal \nburdens to this country and certainly great distress to seniors and \nphysicians who care for them.\n  I tried to stick with the basic fundamental building blocks of this \nbill. I don't think anybody in this body has ever heard me focus on \nsome of the more emotional issues. The fact that we would use Medicare \nmoneys to create a new entitlement, the fact that we would have an \nunfunded mandate to States through Medicaid of $25 billion, to me, is \nproblematic; the fact that premiums are going to increase, whether it \nis the CBO number of 10 to 13 percent or the Oliver Wyman number in my \nState which says 60 percent, the fact that private premiums are going \nto go up and the fact that we are using 6 years' worth of costs and 10 \nyears' worth of revenues--I don't know how we have gotten caught up in \nthis debate in such a manner that we are ignoring basic fundamentals \nthat I don't think any of us on our own accord would consider \nsupporting.\n  The fact is, I am afraid this, again, has become nothing but a \npolitical victory for the President.\n  What I hope we will do is step back and do some things in a \nbipartisan way that will stand the test of time. I ran on health care \nreform. I would like to see us do responsible health care reform. The \nbasic fundamentals of this bill do not meet that test.\n  I see my time has expired. I thank the Chair and the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle who have worked hard to put this bill together. \nI hope they will step back away from these flawed fundamentals, and I \nhope in some form or fashion we will put together a bill that will \nstand the test of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first talk about the Medicare issue, \nbecause this has been the subject of sort of round-and-round debate, \nback and forth over the last couple of days. It is important to share, \nagain, as emphatically as I know how what is being done with regard to \nMedicare. The whole idea is to strengthen Medicare, to put it on a \nsounder footing, to extend its solvency from 8 years by an additional 5 \nyears, which we do under this bill, making it a stronger, more reliable \nsource of health care for older Americans.\n  In fact, the finest and largest organization representing older \nAmericans, which doesn't lightly endorse proposals without examining \nthem thoroughly--hardly a partisan group given the fact of where they \nhave been on these issues--has put out, once again, in the last 24 \nhours, a statement laying out the facts of what is included in the bill \ndrafted by the Finance Committee principally in this area of Medicare.\n  Let me recite, if I may, the facts as they identify them. Fact No. 1, \nnone of the health care reform proposals being considered by Congress \nwould cut Medicare benefits or increase out-of-pocket costs for \nMedicare services. That is not from the Democratic National Committee. \nIt is not from the HELP Committee or the Finance Committee. This is \nfrom AARP saying: None of the proposals in this bill cut Medicare \nbenefits or cut Medicare services.\n  Fact No. 2, the health care reform bill drafted by the Finance \nCommittee will lower prescription drug costs for people in the Medicare \nPart D coverage gap, or the so-called doughnut hole with which many \nseniors are familiar.\n  We are going to cut the cost of prescription drugs. Again, this is \nnot from some partisan group announcing what is in the bill. This is \nfrom an objective, nonpartisan analysis of the bill that is before us.\n  Fact No. 3, health care reform will protect seniors' access to their \ndoctors and reduce the cost of preventive services so patients stay \nhealthier. Again, that is critical.\n  I presume others understand this; it is so axiomatic you wonder why \nyou have to explain it. It is better to catch a problem before it \nbecomes a major problem. Through mammograms, colonoscopies, obviously \nexaminations and screenings, you can discover that an individual has a \nproblem and, if caught early enough, can address it. As many of my \ncolleagues know because it became rather public, I went through cancer \nsurgery in August. It was discovered that I had an elevated PSA test, \nindicating I had prostate cancer. That screening let me know that I had \na growing problem that I had to deal with. So I went through a variety \nof discussions on what best to do, what was the best way to handle all \nof this and decided that surgery made the most sense.\n  The cost of that surgery is expensive. It is not cheap--$5,000, \n$6,000, $7,000, $8,000 to do it. If I had not discovered I had prostate \ncancer and it had grown, I could have become 1 of the 30,000 men a year \nin this country who die from it, or if I had waited longer for it to be \nfull-blown cancer, I am told it could have easily cost $250,000. So by \ncatching this early and getting the needed treatment, I was not only \nable to stay alive and stay healthier, with two young daughters aged 4 \nand 8--and looking forward to the day I may dance at their weddings--\nbut also there were the savings because it did not grow into a problem \nthat would require massive expenditures to deal with it.\n  Our bill deals with that. We provide for the first time ever that \nseniors and other Americans have access to prevention and screening \ntests that would allow them to discover problems they have early on. \nThat is according to AARP. That is what we drafted in this legislation. \nIt is a major benefit.\n  I listened to our colleague from North Carolina yesterday, Senator \nHagan, talk about nurses in a hospital in her State of North Carolina \nwho were not getting mammograms early, not because they did not want \nthem but because, of course, the out-of-pocket expenses for them are so \nhigh they could not afford to do it and pay rent and put food on the \ntable and take care of their families.\n  That hospital in North Carolina decided they were no longer going to \nrequire their nurses to pay those high out-of-pocket expenses and they \neliminated that. As a result, every nurse--or almost every nurse--in \nthat hospital got those mammograms early on and, of course, could \nidentify problems before they became larger issues for them to grapple \nwith.\n  That is what this bill of ours does. That is a major achievement--a \nmajor achievement. So the suggestion is, we ought to roll back and \ncommit this bill. But that would eliminate the kind of investments we \nmake in reducing the cost of prescription drugs or providing the kinds \nof benefits so people can get screenings and treat problems while they \nare still small.\n  As a Senator, I have a health care plan that allows me to do that. I \nam 1 of 8 million people in this country who are Federal employees. We \nall get to do that. Why should a Senator's battle with cancer be more \nimportant than someone else's in this country? Why shouldn't every \nAmerican male over the age of 50 be able to be screened to determine \nwhether they might have prostate cancer?\n  That is what we are talking about. That is what we are achieving in \nthis bill. The idea that the status quo is OK is wrong. It is not OK. \nTo say we ought to throw the bill back into committee, again--we all \nknow what the meaning of that is, of course. It will mean an end to \nthis legislation. Those are the facts.\n  Fact No. 4, if you will: Rather than weaken Medicare, the health care \nreform will strengthen the financial status of the Medicare Program. \nThat is from AARP. That is not some partisan conclusion.\n  I say, respectfully, to our colleagues, and having been through this \nat great length over the summer, filling in for our friend whom we have \nnow lost, Senator Kennedy, we went through long debates and discussions \nearly on, a lot of bipartisan discussions. As I pointed out earlier, as \nto the bill that came out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee in the Senate, we conducted the longest\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\nmarkup in the history of that committee, going back decades, in order \nto listen to each other and to try to provide a bipartisan bill.\n  In many ways, that bill is a bipartisan bill. It did not get \nbipartisan votes, unfortunately, coming out of committee. But the \nsubstance of the legislation includes the ideas and thoughts of our \ncolleagues across the political spectrum, and it is important the \npublic know that during the debate.\n  This is not a bill that was rushed through, jammed through. My \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, spent weeks and weeks--months--\nwith Democrats and Republicans gathered around the table late into the \nevenings talking about how we can shape this bill on a bipartisan \nbasis. I attended many of those meetings in his office. No one can \naccuse the Senator from Montana of not reaching out to the other side \nto be a part of this solution. He went beyond the extra mile to achieve \nthat, and he was flatly turned down, regretfully, in that effort. But \nthat should not be a reason why we do not try to move forward.\n  I am still hoping we can get bipartisan support for the bill before \nit is concluded, but we will only get there if we work at it, and this \nis where we are working at it: on the floor of the Senate, and this \ndebate is an opportunity to come forward and make constructive \nsuggestions--not sending the bill back to committee, in effect, killing \nthe legislation. That is the effect of what would happen if the McCain \namendment were adopted.\n  Rather than engage in this kind of debate back and forth, where the \nRepublicans say Medicare gets cut and the Democrats say, no, it does \nnot, I wished to share with my colleagues this morning what \nnonpartisan, outside groups say about this bill. Listen to those who \nhave made an analysis of this bill who do not wear a partisan hat, who \ndo not have a political label attached to their names but are viewing \nevery syllable, every punctuation mark in the bill to determine what it \ndoes for people. The most important, significant organization that \nrepresents the interests of the elderly in this country has analyzed \nthis bill and has said to America: This is a good bill. This bill \nstrengthens Medicare, provides benefits, and reduces costs.\n  That is what we have tried to achieve over these many months. So \nlet's move on. If you want to cut this bill, if you want to change all \nthis, then offer an amendment and let's vote on it, up or down, and \nmove forward. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nreject the McCain amendment because I think his proposal would do great \ndamage to the effort we have achieved so far.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I noted that the other side, in the last \ncouple, 3 days, has tried to make the case that seniors' Medicare \nbenefits are in jeopardy because ``this legislation cuts Medicare.'' I \nhave heard that statement over and over and over and over again. In \nfact, the last speaker on the other side made that same point.\n  I am confounded, I am very surprised, when I hear those statements. \nWhy am I very surprised? Because it is totally, patently false. It is \nfalse. It is untrue. There are no benefits cut here, none. One could \nsay that with the private plans, the Medicare Advantage plans, which \nare vastly overpaid--the nonpartisan MedPAC organization states they \nare vastly overpaid by about 14 percent--one could say those private \nplans--it is not Medicare; those private plans, Medicare Advantage; \nthose are not Medicare plans, those are private plans, private \ninsurance plans--they may be overprescribing some nonguaranteed \nbenefits for beneficiaries, things such as eyeglasses or something like \nthat, which might be cut back. That is true. But none of the guaranteed \nbenefits--the basic benefits under Medicare that every senior knows \nabout when he or she goes to the doctor; and it is care under \nMedicare--is reduced. None. Nothing is cut.\n  In fact, this legislation adds benefits to seniors. For example, it \nvirtually fills up this thing we call the doughnut hole. That is the \nportion of prescription drug payments that seniors otherwise would have \nto pay. But we say $500 of that is going to be paid for, and the rest \nof it is going to be paid for at least for 1 more year. So that is an \nadditional benefit. Then all the screening provisions that are in this \nbill, that is an additional benefit. There are many other benefits that \nare added onto the ordinary benefits seniors have.\n  So it is not true--it is not true--that the basic guaranteed benefits \nunder Medicare are cut. None of the guaranteed benefits under Medicare \nare cut--none. So it is totally untrue. It is false when people make \nthe claim that ``Medicare is being cut.''\n  They are being very clever, the people who are making those claims. \nWhat they are saying when they say Medicare will be cut--they want you \nto think they mean benefits will be cut--but deep in their mind, what \nthey are holding back in their mind--well, when pressed, they will \nagree, well, it is the Medicare providers, it is the hospitals, it is \nthe medical equipment manufacturers, it is the pharmaceutical industry. \nThat is being cut. That is ``Medicare'' that is being cut and, \ntherefore, that will hurt seniors. That is kind of the way they get \naround it.\n  Well, the fact is, the way you preserve the solvency of the trust \nfund is to make sure there are not so many payments, frankly, by Uncle \nSam going to pay for all the doctors and hospitals and so forth so the \nsolvency of the trust fund is extended. Right now this legislation \nextends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. If this legislation \nwere not to pass, the Medicare trust fund would probably go insolvent \nin about the year 2017. But this legislation extends the solvency of \nthe trust fund for at least 5 more years to 2022.\n  So I wish to make it very clear that this legislation we are \nconsidering does not cut Medicare benefits. In fact, the hospitals and \ndocs, I would say, are going to find at least a 5-percent increase in \ngrowth over the next 10 years in payments to them under the Medicare \nProgram--growth. I have a chart which I showed yesterday on the floor. \nIt showed, for each of the various years, it is a 5-percent increase in \ngrowth for all those industries. They are being cut 1.5 percent, but \nthat is from a 6.5-percent growth, to net down to a 5-percent growth \nfor each of the years.\n  You ask analysts on Wall Street how hospitals are doing. They are \ndoing great under this legislation. You ask analysts on Wall Street how \nthe pharmaceutical industry is doing. They are doing great under this \nlegislation. You ask any analyst about other industries--home health \ncare, hospice care, you name it--they are all doing OK. Wall Street \nanalysts say they are doing fine.\n  Why are they doing fine? Why, objectively, are they doing fine? Why \ndo the CEOs of these organizations not grumble too much? Because they \nknow what they may lose in a little bit of a reduction in their \npayments--they will still get big, hefty payments--they will make up in \nvolume because so many more people will have health insurance. They \nknow that. They are going to make a lot of money. So they are OK.\n  So it is not true that Medicare is going to go broke under this \nlegislation. First of all, there is no reduction in benefits. That is \nvery clear. Senator Dodd read a letter from AARP making that very \nclear. Also, the reductions are not reductions in provider payments; \nthey are reductions in the rate of growth of provider payments, and \nthey are going to do fine. Providers do not care that much because they \nare making it on volume because everybody is going to have health \ninsurance. They have quite a bit--a 5-percent growth rate anyway. So it \nis not true--it is not true--that Medicare is in jeopardy because of \nthis legislation. It is not true that benefits are going to be cut. In \nfact, just the opposite is true. This legislation strengthens benefits, \nincreases benefits, extends the length of the Medicare trust fund to a \nfuture date further down the road, so it stays solvent for many years \nthan otherwise is the case.\n  This legislation helps seniors. It helps seniors, contrary to what \nyou are hearing on the other side that it hurts seniors. If you just \nlook at the facts, not the rhetoric--not the rhetoric but just look at \nthe facts, look at the facts and look at who the supporters of this \nlegislation are and objective groups and what they say about this \nlegislation--you cannot help but be compelled\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\nto the conclusion that this legislation is not only good for seniors, \nit is very good for seniors.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with the apologies to my good friends \nfrom Montana and Connecticut, I was unavoidably detained at the opening \nand would like to now, on my leader time, give my opening remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has the floor.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the challenges of the ongoing war in \nAfghanistan are immense, but Americans believe in the mission. They \ntrust the advice of our commanders in the field to see that mission \nthrough.\n  So I support the President's decision to follow the advice of General \nPetraeus and General McChrystal in ordering the same kind of surge in \nAfghanistan that helped turn the tide in Iraq.\n  These additional forces will support a counterinsurgency strategy \nthat will enable us to begin the difficult work of reversing the \nmomentum of the Taliban and keeping it from power.\n  The President is right to follow the advice of the generals in \nincreasing troops, and he is also right to focus on increasing the \nability of the Afghan security forces so they can protect the people.\n  By doing both, he has made it possible for our forces to create the \nright conditions for Afghanistan--the right conditions for them to \ndefend themselves, create a responsible government, and remain an ally \nin the war on terror.\n  Although our forces are in Afghanistan to defend our security \ninterests, the people of Afghanistan must assume a greater burden in \nthe future. The President's plan recognizes that.\n  Once we achieve our objectives--an Afghanistan that can defend \nitself, govern itself, control its borders, and remain an ally in the \nwar on terror--then we can reasonably discuss withdrawal, a withdrawal \nbased on conditions, not arbitrary timelines.\n  But, for now, we owe it to the American people, to those who died on \n9/11, and to the many brave Americans who have already died on distant \nbattlefields in this long and difficult struggle, to make sure \nAfghanistan never again serves as a sanctuary for al-Qaida. We owe it \nto the men and women who are now deployed or who will soon be deployed \nto provide every resource they need to prevail.\n\n\n                           health care reform\n\n  With every passing day, the American people become more and more \nperplexed about the Democratic plan for health care, and they like it \nless and less.\n  Americans thought reform meant lowering costs. This bill actually \nraises costs. Americans thought reform meant helping the economy. This \nbill actually makes it worse. Americans thought reform meant \nstrengthening Medicare. This bill raids it to create a new government \nprogram that will have the same problems that Medicare does. Americans \nwanted reform. What they are getting is the opposite--more spending, \nmore debt, more burdens on families and businesses already struggling \nto get by.\n  One of the biggest sources of money to pay for this experiment is \nMedicare. This bill cuts Medicare Advantage by $120 billion. It cuts \nhospitals by $135 billion. It cuts home health care by $42 billion. It \ncuts nursing homes by $15 billion. It cuts hospice by $8 billion.\n  Reform shouldn't come at the expense of seniors. The McCain amendment \nguarantees it wouldn't. The McCain amendment would send this bill back \nto the Finance Committee with instructions to remove the language that \ncuts Medicare. The McCain amendment also says any funds generated from \nrooting out waste, fraud, and abuse should be used to strengthen \nMedicare, not to create an entirely new government program.\n  A vote in favor of the McCain amendment is a vote to protect \nMedicare. Let me say that again. A vote in favor of the McCain \namendment is a vote to protect Medicare. A vote against the McCain \namendment is a vote to raid this vital program in order to create \nanother one for an entirely new group of Americans. So a vote against \nthe McCain amendment is a vote to take money out of Medicare to create \na program for an entirely different set of Americans. A vote against \nthe McCain amendment is a vote against our seniors, and it is a vote \nagainst real health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield myself 5 minutes, if I may. I want to go back, if I \ncan. I wish to put up these charts. Again, I say this respectfully, \nbecause I genuinely believe that people across the spectrum want to see \nsome reform of the health care system. The question is whether the \nproposal that has been laid before us by the Finance Committee and the \nHELP Committee achieves reform and whether the ideas we bring to the \ntable are actually going to achieve lower costs, provide greater \naccess, and improve the quality of health care. We believe very firmly \nand strongly that it does.\n  There are outside observers of this process who have no political \nagenda whatsoever other than to make determinations as to whether the \ngoals we have sought in this legislation achieve the desired results. \nIt is the conclusion of the major organizations that make these \ndeterminations that, in fact, we have done exactly what we said we had \nset out to do.\n  But I wish to point out, because I think it is important when I hear \nthe arguments from our friends on the other side about their deep \nconcerns about Medicare, it is very important they understand that over \nthe last number of years, we have seen quite the opposite reaction when \nit comes to the Medicare Program in our Nation. Going back to 1995, \nwhen our friends took control of both this body and the other body, the \nthen-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich announced to the world that \nbasically he was prepared to let Medicare ``wither on the vine.'' That \nis not ancient history. That is not 1965 when the Medicare Program was \nadopted; that is merely 14 years ago when the other party, for the \nfirst time in 40 years, became the dominant party here in Congress. One \nof the first statements from the leadership of that party was to let \nthis program ``wither on the vine.'' Again, that is one person, the \nSpeaker, the leader of the revolution that produced the results \nelectorally in 1994. But I think it is important as a backdrop. When we \nhear the debate about Medicare, it is important to have some history \nabout where the parties have been on this issue, generally speaking. So \nin 1995 we begin with that as a backdrop.\n  In 1997, 2 years later, it happened again. In 1997, proposed Medicare \ncuts in the Republican Balanced Budget Act of that year were twice as \nmuch as the savings we are talking about in this bill. They proposed a \n12.4-percent reduction in Medicare benefits in 1997. Of course, the \nlast budget submitted by President Bush last year--again, reflective of \nwhere things stand, and this is a year ago, not 14 years ago, and not \n1997, but 2009--the Bush administration in its submission of this \nbudget proposed a $481 billion reduction in Medicare benefits. That was \nnot in the context of a health reform bill; that was in the context of \na budget proposal.\n  Here we are talking about savings by reducing costs for hospitals and \nother providers as a way of strengthening Medicare, providing more \nbenefits to the beneficiaries themselves through things such as \nprescription drugs as well as screenings and early prevention efforts \nwhich are included in our bill. Those things have been identified, of \ncourse, by AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare. They have analyzed our proposals and have suggested we do \njust that. We strengthen Medicare and we preserve those benefits. Our \nbill saves $380 billion in order to strengthen the Medicare proposal. \nIt improves the quality of health care for seniors as part of our \ncomprehensive reform. In fact, Senator Coburn's Patient Choice Act \nactually imposes $40 billion more in cuts to Medicare Advantage than \nour bill does.\n  I find it somewhat intriguing that those who are arguing for the \nCoburn proposal as an alternative and simultaneously suggesting we \nought not to do anything to Medicare Advantage have\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\nnot read the Coburn bill, because he cuts $40 billion more out of \nMedicare Advantage than we did in our legislation as proposed.\n  In conclusion, let me quote from the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare--again, not a partisan organization. Their \nsole mission is to see to it that Social Security and Medicare will be \nthere for the people it was intended to support. Let me quote exactly \nfrom a letter sent to every Senator yesterday from the committee:\n\n       Not a single penny of the savings in the Senate bill--\n\n  the bill now before us--\n\n     will come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in the \n     traditional Medicare program. The Medicare savings included \n     in H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     will positively impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by \n     slowing the rate of increase in out-of-pocket costs and \n     improving benefits, and it will extend the solvency of the \n     Medicare trust fund by 5 years. To us, this is a win-win for \n     seniors and the Medicare program.\n\n  So we can hear all of the partisan debate back and forth as to what \nthis bill does, but if you are interested in what those organizations \nsay, whose sole mission is to analyze whether beneficiaries are going \nto be advantaged or disadvantaged by what is being proposed here, they \ncategorically, unequivocally, suggest that the McCain amendment does \njust the opposite of what our bill does. It would roll the clock back, \ndamage seniors terribly by reducing or eliminating the provisions we \nhave included in our bill, and they strongly support what the Finance \nCommittee wrote in its bill that is now presented to all of us here as \na way to strengthen and preserve the Medicare Program.\n  I say to my colleagues and to others, you can listen to this partisan \ndebate back and forth as to whether you want to believe the Democrats \nor believe the Republicans, but I would suggest if you are not clear \nwho to believe in this, listen to the organizations whose job it is to \nprotect this program, with whom we have worked very closely to \ndetermine that we would not in any way reduce those guaranteed benefits \nthat Senator Baucus addressed in his remarks. That is what we do. That \nis why this bill is a good bill and deserving of our support. I urge \nour colleagues to reject the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Republican leader a few moments ago \nsaid this bill raises costs. With all due respect to my good friend \nfrom Kentucky, that statement is false.\n  Just this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the \norganization that analyzes legislation--and both sides, both bodies \ndepend on it; it is a very professional outfit, I might add--said our \nbill would reduce premiums, not increase but reduce premiums for 93 \npercent of Americans. And for all Americans, it would make sure that \nbetter quality insurance is available.\n  Let me state that a little bit differently. The Congressional Budget \nOffice said that for 93 percent of Americans, premiums would be \nreduced. It is true that for 7 percent that is not the case. Those are \nAmericans whose incomes are too high to qualify for subsidies; that is, \nthe tax credits, buying insurance in exchange. But those 7 percent \nwould get a lot better insurance, a lot higher quality insurance than \nthey get today because of the insurance market reforms that are in this \nlegislation. The provisions prevent insurance companies from denying \ncoverage based on preexisting conditions, health status, the committee \nmarket rating provisions, no rescissions, et cetera. So for all \nAmericans, it is true that this legislation will provide better quality \ninsurance comparing apples with apples. There is a reduction for 93 \npercent of Americans. The other 7 percent would be in the individual \nmarket and they would have a lot higher quality insurance. So if the \nquality is much higher, it would exceed the increase in premiums. They \nwould be getting a better deal than they would otherwise be getting.\n  CBO looked at this for the year 2016. They didn't look at it for \nother years, but at least that is the case for 2016: a reduction, not \nan increase but a reduction. In fact, for many in the nongroup market, \nthose who individually buy insurance, they would find their premiums \nwould be reduced about 40 or 50 percent. About 60 percent of those in \nthe nongroup market are finding their insurance premiums would be \nreduced. I don't have the exact figure in front of me, but it is in the \nneighborhood of a 40- or 50-percent reduction in premiums. That is due \nto tax credits. Again, CBO says those tax credits would cover nearly \ntwo-thirds of premiums. So I guess I was a little conservative. It is a \nlittle more than 40 or 50 percent. It would cover two-thirds of \npremiums.\n  CBO said those getting these tax credits would pay for roughly 56 \npercent to 59 percent lower premiums than they would without our bill. \nThose are real savings. That is with respect to the premiums.\n  What about out-of-pocket costs? This legislation has absolute limits \non out-of-pocket costs. Today insurance companies can sell you a \npolicy, you pay certain premiums, but there is no limit on the out-of-\npocket costs you might have to pay. Your deductible is so high, for \nexample. This legislation puts an absolute limit so no policy can be \nsold that allows you to have out-of-pocket costs above a certain \namount. I think it is $6,000 for an individual, and it might be double \nthat for a family. But there is a limit. So this bill does not, as \nstated by the minority leader, raise costs. In fact, it reduces costs.\n  In addition, there are many people who say, Oh, gosh, this is a $1 \ntrillion bill. Some people even say it is a $2.5 trillion bill. \nSenators on the other side of the aisle make those statements and they \nsay this to try to scare us.\n  I will be honest with you. I don't know if they believe it. They like \nsaying it because it is a nice, good scare tactic. I say I am not sure \nthey believe it. I wonder if they believe it, because when you read the \nlegislation, it is deficit neutral. It does not add to the deficit.\n  We have a budget resolution. Under that budget resolution, health \ncare legislation for the next 10 years has to be deficit neutral. It \ncannot add one thin dime to the deficit. So I am a little curious when \npeople talk about a $1 trillion bill. In fact, it reduces the deficit \nby $130 billion over a 10-year period. That is what the Congressional \nBudget Office says, the professional nonpartisan budget office.\n  In the second 10 years, the CBO says our bill reduces the deficit by \na one-quarter of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. That is \nroughly $\\1/2\\ trillion. In the second 10 years, this legislation \nreduces the deficit by $\\1/2\\ trillion. That is a reduction in the \ndeficit.\n  I don't know why these people are saying on the other side that this \nis a trillion-dollar bill. One said--and I will not mention his name--\nthe other day that this is a $2.5 trillion bill. That is not true. It \nis just not true because it is paid for. It would only be fair for them \nto say it is paid for. I think it is fair to get both sides of the \nstory, not just one side. It does cost $1 trillion over 10 years, but \nit is more than paid for over 10 years. Those who say $2.5 trillion--\nthey start at 2014 up to 2020, and say that is why it costs so much. It \nis paid for during those years, too.\n  Let me make it very clear this bill doesn't raise costs. In fact, it \nlowers costs, and the CBO says so. It doesn't add to the Federal \ndeficit. In fact, it reduces the Federal deficit. I urge everyone to \nlook at the facts closely whenever we hear statements made by anybody, \nincluding me. I urge people to listen to the words and read between the \nlines and see what is really going on. Like my father used to say: \nDon't believe everything you read and only half of what you hear. Take \neverything with a few grains of salt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KIRK). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. That is why \nwe have 22 minutes on the Republican side to clear up some \nmisconceptions.\n  The Democratic health care bill does cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years \nwhen it is fully implemented. If I may say so, it is arrogant to think \nthe American people couldn't figure out the difference between the \nfirst 10 years, when the bill wasn't implemented in 4 of those years, \nand they would like to know that it costs $2.5 trillion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If it is on your time.\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is it paid for?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is right. It is paid for by cutting \ngrandma's Medicare. It is paid for by cutting grandma's Medicare by \n$465 billion over a 10-year period of time, and about $500 billion in \ntaxes----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a second question I would love to debate with the \nSenator. But on the first question only, the Senator admits it is paid \nfor?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No. I admit it costs $2.5 trillion, and the attempt to \npay for it is through Medicare cuts, tax increases, and increases to \nthe deficit by not including the physician reimbursement in the health \ncare bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One more question. I think we all know the House has \ntaken action on physician reimbursement, and the Senate will also do so \nbefore we adjourn. That is the so-called doc fix. That is a separate \nissue. That will be paid for. Putting the doctor issue aside, health \ncare reform--and I say that because we take up the doc fix virtually \nevery year. We don't take up health care reform every year. That is an \nentirely separate proposition, separate legislative endeavor.\n  If the Senator will bear with me and take the doc fix off the table \nfor a second--we can address that later--health care reform--to use a \n10-year number, or when you start in 2010 or in 2014, wherever you are \nstarting--either there is $1 trillion or $2.5 trillion, depending where \nyou start, not getting into how it is paid for. Is it paid for and \ntherefore it is not deficit; am I not correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will concede to the Senator from Montana that the \nattempt of the Democrats to pay for this $2.5 trillion bill consists of \nMedicare cuts, tax increases, and additions to the deficit by not \nincluding the physician reimbursement, which is an essential part of \nany 10-year health care plan. There may be other problems, but those \nare the three things I know about.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One more question on my time. Is it true there are no \ncuts in guaranteed beneficiary payments--none whatsoever--in this \nlegislation--in guaranteed benefits?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say no to that, Mr. President, because the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office made it clear there would \nbe specific cuts in benefits for those who have Medicare Advantage, \nwhich is about one out of four seniors.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is it true those provisions are not guaranteed \nprovisions? I am talking about guaranteed benefits that seniors expect \nto get when they go to the doctor, fee for service, expected benefits, \nunder ordinary Medicare, not benefits that a private plan may pay in \naddition.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is clear there are $465 billion in \ncuts in Medicare. The Chair and the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Connecticut have all agreed that is a big part of how the \nbill is supposedly paid for. It is specific enough to say that $135 \nbillion comes from hospitals; $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, \nwhich 11 million seniors have; nearly $15 billion from nursing homes; \n$40 billion from home health agencies; $8 billion from hospices.\n  The Director of the CBO testified that provisions like that would \nresult in specific cuts to benefits for Medicare Advantage. He said \nthat fully half of the benefits currently provided to seniors under \nMedicare Advantage would disappear. The changes would reduce the extra \nbenefits, such as dental, vision, and hearing coverage, that currently \nare made available to beneficiaries.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One more question. Does the Senator agree this \nlegislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for 5 \nyears, and failure to pass this would mean the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund would not be extended for 5 years?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wholeheartedly disagree with that. The Medicare \ntrustees have said that between 2015 and 2017 Medicare will be \napproaching insolvency. They have asked that we take urgent action. The \nurgent action recommended by the Democratic majority is that we take \n$465 billion out of the Medicare Program over 10 years and spend it on \na new entitlement.\n  It is hard for me to understand how that can make Medicare more \nsolvent, when you take money out of grandma's Medicare and spend it on \nsomeone else.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it, shall we say, Enron accounting when you have a \nproposal that, as soon as the bill becomes law, you begin to raise \ntaxes and cut benefits, and then you wait 4 years before any of the \nbenefits are then extended to the beneficiaries? That, on its face, is \na remarkable piece of legislation. My experience, which has only been \n20-some years, is that we haven't passed legislation that says we are \ngoing to collect taxes on it for 4 years, and then we are going to give \nyou whatever benefits that may accrue from this legislation. Again, \nthere has been no time in history where we have taken money from an \nalready failing system to create a new entitlement program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Which colleague is the Senator asking that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe the Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. He does.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was addressing the person who has the floor, which I am \nsure the Senator from Montana should understand by now.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I say to the Senator from Arizona that he is exactly \nright. Another way to describe it, the Senator from Kansas said it was \nlike writing a big check on an overdrawn bank account and buying a big \nnew car. Maybe another way, if I may respond to the Senator from \nArizona--I ask unanimous consent that Republican Senators, on our time, \nbe allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to finish responding to Senator McCain, \nif I might.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Then I have a question on the same subject.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I hope the Parliamentarian is keeping track of the \nRepublican time. I am enjoying the questioning, and I thank the Senator \nfor his question. One of the things--in fact, a great compliment has \nbeen paid to the Senator from Arizona. It is rare that a Senator can \nhave something he said actually begin to break through the fog.\n  Dana Milbank, a columnist for the Washington Post, wrote a column \nabout it being all about grandma and wondering why we never mention \ngrandpa. Maybe Mr. Milbank hasn't seen the movie ``My Big Fat Greek \nWedding,'' where the man said, ``I'm the head of the house,'' and the \nwoman said, ``I'm the neck, because I can turn the head any way I \nwant.''\n  We are talking about grandma because she can help persuade grandpa. \nIf we take $465 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, grandma and \ngrandpa and those who are younger and looking forward to Medicare will \nbe affected.\n  If I may say to the Senator from Arizona--and I see the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from Nebraska--it wasn't long ago, in response \nto the question--in fact, in 2005, when we sought to restrain the \ngrowth of Medicare by $10 billion over 5 years, and this is what they \nsaid--remember, they are ``restraining'' the growth of Medicare by $465 \nbillion and spending it on a new program, and Republicans were, at that \ntime, trying to save $10 billion over 5 years.\n  ``An immoral document,'' said Senator Reid and Senator Dodd. The \nSenator from Connecticut said that funding for Medicare would be cut. \nSenator Rockefeller: ``A moral disaster of monumental proportion.'' \nSenator Boxer, in the same way, compared it to Katrina. Senator Kerry \nsaid we are ``passing the costs on to seniors.'' Senator Levin said \npeople are ``going to be hurt by this bill.'' ``Irresponsible and \ncruel,'' said Senator Kohl. Senator Reed and Senator Hillary Clinton \nalso made similar comments.\n  That was for $10 billion of restraining the growth of Medicare to \nspend it on the existing program. Yet this proposal by the Democrats \nwould take $465 billion and spend it on a new program.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true--and the Senator from Montana is on the \nSenate floor and wants to enter into this. Maybe he can respond to his \ncomments of 14 years ago. We weren't trying to create a new entitlement \nprogram, which is the object of the Senator's bill. We were just trying \nto enact some savings in the Medicare system.\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\n  What did Senator Baucus say? He said:\n\n       And above all, we must not use Medicare as a piggy bank.\n\n  What are we using the $483 billion in cuts in Medicare for?\n  Then he said:\n\n       That is disgraceful. Perhaps some changes lie ahead. But if \n     they do, they should be made for the single purpose of \n     keeping Medicare services for senior citizens and people with \n     disabilities.\n\n  Isn't it true that now that we are taking $483 billion out of a \nfailing system the Medicare trustees say is going to go bankrupt, and \nthe Senator from Montana, 14 years ago, said:\n\n       Seniors could easily be forced to give up their doctor, as \n     doctors begin to refuse Medicare patients and hospitals--\n     especially rural hospitals--close.\n\n  Isn't that the effect of taking $483 billion in cuts in Medicare? \nThen the Senator from Montana went on to say:\n\n       Equivalent to blowing up the house and erecting a pup tent \n     where it used to be.\n\n  Instead of blowing up a pup tent, I would say what they are doing is \nlike a hydrogen bomb. Finally, Senator Baucus said:\n\n       Staggering. The leadership now proposes something like $250 \n     billion in Medicare cuts. It is staggering. It is a reduction \n     of nearly a quarter in Medicare services by the year 2002.\n\n  All of us here learn about the issues. Apparently, the Senator from \nMontana didn't learn much, because he was deeply concerned 14 years ago \nabout a very small savings in Medicare. Now he wants to spend $2.5 \ntrillion and taking $483 billion out of Medicare to create a new \nentitlement system.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I respond to the Senator?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am happy to see a debate actually \nbreak out on the Senate floor on this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Here is your opportunity; here is your chance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As long as it is on Democratic time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is on both sides. We have even time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I mean whatever time the Senator uses should be on \nDemocratic time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes. The basic question, obviously, is how to protect \nMedicare benefits. I think most of us would say how do we protect \nMedicare benefits and extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. I \nthink we would all agree that excessive payments to providers would \ncause insolvency of the trust funds to come earlier rather than \nlater. We all agree with that proposition.\n\n  The next question is, What would excessive payments to providers be? \nDo providers get paid excessively? I think that is an honest question \nwe should ask ourselves in a way to help extend the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund. In fact, in 1995, many Senators, especially on the \nother side of the aisle, did say just that, that we have to cut \nMedicare in order to save benefits. That was made by many Senators. I \nhave them right in front of me, if anybody wants to hear them. I am not \ngoing to go through all of that, but it is the truth. That is exactly \nwhat we are doing in this bill. We are trying to help extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund by cutting down on excessive \nprovider payments from the Medicare trust fund.\n  How do we decide whether payments are excessive? That is the basic \nquestion here. All we can do is just give it our best shot, make our \nbest judgment. I think it makes sense to look at the recommendations by \noutside independent groups, what they think. One is MedPAC, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission. That is an outside group, as we \nall know, that advises Congress on Medicare payments. As Members of \nCongress, we are not totally competent to know exactly what dollars \nshould go to which industry group. We have too many other obligations \nto think about. As Senators, we must be responsible to do the best we \ncan. MedPAC has said these groups have been overpaid. And Wall Street \nanalysts tend to agree. In fact, MedPAC said, with respect to Medicare \nAdvantage, that they have been overpaid--I forget the exact amount but \nmuch less than the $118 billion reduction in this bill.\n  In fact, I totaled up and looked at the projected growth rate of \nproviders--hospitals, nursing homes, home health, hospice, PhRMA, you \nname it--and on average their growth rate over the next decade is going \nto be 6\\1/2\\ percent. That is the growth rate of providers. We decided \nto trim that a little bit by 1.5 percent. So it is 5 percent. It is a \n5-percent growth rate in an attempt to try to find the right levels of \nreimbursement to providers, which will also help extend the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n  When we talk to providers, they basically agree with those cuts. They \nbasically agree. Why do they basically agree? They basically agree \nbecause they know that with much more coverage, with many more people \nhaving health insurance, they could spread out their business. They may \nlose a little on margin, but they can pick it up on volume. That is \nexactly what their business plan is under this bill.\n  Wall Street analysts say--I quote them--these industries are doing \ngreat, they are doing well under this bill. They are not getting hurt. \nSo we do achieve a win-win--I don't like that phrase, by the way, but I \nwill use it here--where the solvency of the trust fund is being \nextended and where reimbursement rates to providers are fair--not being \nhurt; it is fair. And that is why they want this bill, by and large.\n  Most groups tend to want this bill enacted because they know it is \ngood for the country, it is good for the seniors, and it is good for \nthem too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I just mention again, $70 billion in \nfraud, abuse, and waste, and Senator Coburn, the doctor, can tell you, \nthat is nowhere in this bill. The fact is, maybe some of the providers \nhave been bought off, jawboned, or had their arms twisted or given a \ngood deal, like PhRMA has. Recipients have not. Medicare recipients \nknow you cannot cut $483 billion without ultimately affecting their \nbenefits, and that is a fact.\n  Again, conspicuous by its absence, I say to the Senator from Montana, \ntotally conspicuous by its absence is any meaningful malpractice \nreform, which has been proven in the State of Texas and other States to \nreduce costs and to increase the supply of physicians and caregivers. \nThere is nothing in this bill that is meaningful about medical \nmalpractice reform.\n  I had a townhall meeting with doctors in my State, and everyone stood \nup and said: I practice defensive medicine because I fear being sued.\n  If you are really serious, I say to the Senator from Montana, if you \nare really serious about this, medical malpractice should be a key and \nintegral part of it. Even the CBO costed it out at about $54 billion a \nyear. When you count in all the defensive medicine, it could be as much \nas $200 billion over 10 years. That is conspicuous by its absence. I \nthink it brings into question the dedication of really reducing health \ncare costs across America.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have enjoyed our discussion with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and thank him for his \nquestions.\n  Senator Coburn, who is a physician--the Senator from Montana talked \nabout doctors being overpaid. He talked about----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, no, no, I did not. With all due respect, I did not \nsay that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Didn't I hear the words ``providers overpaid''?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I talked about hospitals. I did not talk about doctors \noverpaid. If I may say to my friend from Tennessee, this legislation \npays more to primary care doctors, a 10-percent increase in Medicare \nreimbursement for each of the next 5 years. I did not say ``doctors.''\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I must have misunderstood. Normally when we talk about \nproviders, we talk about hospitals and physicians.\n  We have a physician on the Senate floor, the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nwonder if he, having heard this debate, might want to comment. I might \nsay, isn't it true that the McCain motion, which we have on the floor, \nwould send this back to the Finance Committee and say: If there are \nsavings, let's spend it on Medicare to actually strengthen it?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. The first comment I \nhave is about relying on what Wall Street analysts say today. They have \nabout this much credibility in this country today. Look at the economic \nsituation we find ourselves in because of what\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\nWall Street analysts have said. That is the first point I would make.\n  The second point is that the majority whip yesterday said we should \ncut Medicare Advantage because of the 14 percent. Senator Dodd just \nrecently went after the Patients' Choice Act because we actually make \nit be competitively bid without any reduction in benefits. Your bill, \nfor every Medicare Advantage, cuts 50 percent of the benefits out. It \ncuts the benefits.\n  The difference is--and I agree with the majority whip--we do need to \nhave the savings in Medicare Advantage, but the way you get that is \nthrough competitively bidding it while at the same time maintaining the \nrequirements for the benefits that are offered. There is a big \ndifference in those two. Ours ends up being pure savings to save \nMedicare. The savings in this bill are to create a new entitlement.\n  The other point I wish to make is, if you are a senior out there \nlistening and if you are going to be subject to the new increase in \nMedicare tax, for the first time in history, we are going to take the \nMedicare tax and not use it for Medicare, we are going to use it for \nsomething else under this bill. This one-half of 1 percent is now going \nto be consumed in something outside of Medicare. So no longer do we \nhave a Medicare tax for the Medicare trust fund. We have a Medicare tax \nthat funds the Medicare trust fund plus other programs.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think we want a lot of the same things. How \nwe go about it--the Senator from Montana recognized the fact that we \nare going to increase payments to primary care physicians. Ask yourself \nthe question why only 1 in 50 doctors last year who graduated from \nmedical school is going into primary care. Why do you think that is? \nCould it be that the government that is setting the payment rates \ncreated a maldistribution in remuneration to primary care physicians; \ntherefore, they choose to go where they can make 200 percent more over \ntheir lifetime by spending 1 additional year in residency rather than \ndoing primary care?\n\n  What this bill does, and what the Senator from Arizona is trying to \ndo by sending this bill back, is to refocus it on the fact that \nMedicare money ought to be used for Medicare. If, in fact, we are going \nto slow the growth of Medicare, can we do that without cutting \nbenefits? To slow the growth in this bill for 11 million Americans who \nnow have Medicare Advantage will diminish their benefits. That is out \nof the $120 billion that is going to come.\n  You cannot tell a senior who is in a rural area today, who is on the \neconomic lower rungs of the ladder, who uses Medicare Advantage to \nequalize their care with somebody who can afford a Medicare \nsupplemental policy, you cannot tell them this is not going to decrease \ntheir benefits and their care, because it is. And in the bill, it \nactually states that it is going to decrease their benefits.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? Very briefly, the Senator from \nMontana talked about the support the bill gets. AARP makes more money \nfrom Medigap plans they sell to seniors. AARP should be opposing the \nbill, but other groups such as 60 Plus are educating seniors.\n  The AMA endorsement of the bill--shocking. The bill puts the \ngovernment in charge, but AMA cut a deal to get their Medicare payments \naddressed by increasing the deficit by $250 billion.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. PhRMA--my God, if there ever was an obscene alliance made \nthat will harm seniors because it has the administration against drug \nreimportation from Canada and competition for treatment of Medicare \npatients.\n  So now we understand a little bit better why these special interest \ngroups, 500-some of them, have visited the White House in recent \nmonths, according to White House logs.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator would probably be interested to know--and, I \nknow, my colleagues on the other side--that the American Medical \nAssociation now represents less than 10 percent of the actively \npracticing physicians in this country. The physicians as a whole in \nthis country are adamantly opposed to this bill. The reason they are \nopposed to this bill is because you are inserting the government \nbetween them and their patient. That is why they are opposed to this \nbill.\n  So you have the endorsement of the AMA which represents less than 10 \npercent of the practicing doctors--actively practicing doctors--in this \ncountry because not only will it increase payments, but CPT code \nrevenue is protected. That is the revenue AMA gathers from the payment \nsystem that continues to be fostered in this bill, which is their main \nsource of revenue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my colleague's indulgence for just a moment \nbecause, as you know, the majority leader seems to appear more and more \nfrantic as he, perhaps, is reading the same polls we are that more and \nmore Americans, when they figure out this legislation, are becoming \nmore and more opposed to it.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader came out and directly addressed me, \nsaying:\n\n       This man talks about earmarks, but his amendment is one big \n     earmark to the insurance industry. And in addition to that, \n     the sponsor of the amendment--\n\n  Talking about me--\n\n     during his Presidential campaign talked about cutting these \n     moneys.\n\n  Mr. President, I hate, I say to my colleagues, to take a trip back \ndown memory lane, but at the time--of course, this was echoed by a DNC \nspokesperson, who then echoed it throughout the blogosphere and \nleftwing liberal blogs. The fact is, on October 20, FactCheck.org says:\n\n       He accuses McCain of proposing to cut benefits. Not true.\n\n  This is from FactCheck.\n\n       In a TV ad and in speeches, Obama is making bogus claims \n     that McCain plans to cut $880 billion from Medicare spending \n     and to reduce benefits.\n       A TV spot says--\n\n  A very well-funded campaign, I might add--\n\n       McCain's plan requires ``cuts in benefits, eligibility, or \n     both.''\n       Obama said in a speech that McCain plans ``cuts'' that \n     would force seniors to ``pay more for your drugs, receive \n     fewer services, and get lower quality care.''\n       A second ad claims that McCain's plan would bring about a \n     22 percent cut in benefits.\n\n  FactCheck.org says:\n\n       These claims are false, and based on a single newspaper \n     report that says no such thing. McCain's policy director \n     states unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisioned.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire FactCheck.org article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Obama's False Medicare Claim\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       In a TV ad and in speeches, Obama is making bogus claims \n     that McCain plans to cut $880 billion from Medicare spending \n     and to reduce benefits.\n       A TV spot says McCain's plan requires ``cuts in benefits, \n     eligibility or both.''\n       Obama said in a speech that McCain plans ``cuts'' that \n     would force seniors to ``pay more for your drugs, receive \n     fewer services, and get lower quality care.''\n       Update, Oct. 21: A second Obama ad claims that McCain's \n     plan would bring about a 22 percent cut in benefits, ``higher \n     premiums and co-pays,'' and more expensive prescription \n     drugs.\n       These claims are false, and based on a single newspaper \n     report that says no such thing. McCain's policy director \n     states unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisioned. \n     McCain does propose substantial ``savings'' through such \n     means as cutting fraud, increased use of information \n     technology in medicine and better handling of expensive \n     chronic diseases. Obama himself proposes some of the same \n     cost-saving measures. We're skeptical that either candidate \n     can deliver the savings they promise, but that's no basis for \n     Obama to accuse McCain of planning huge benefit cuts and more \n     expensive prescription drugs, and claims that both nursing \n     home care and a patient's choice of doctor could be affected.\n\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       As the narrator says that McCain's plan ``means a 22 \n     percent cut in benefits,'' the ad displays a footnote citing \n     an Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal story as its authority.\n       But, in fact, the Journal story makes no mention of any 22 \n     percent reduction, or any reduction at all. To the contrary, \n     the story's only mention of what might happen to benefits is \n     a quote from McCain adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin promising to \n     maintain ``the benefit package that has been promised.'' The \n     story quotes him as saying ``savings'' would come from \n     eliminating Medicare fraud and by reforming payment policies \n     to lower the overall cost of care.\n       The fact is that McCain has never proposed to cut Medicare \n     benefits, or Medicaid benefits either. Obama's claim is based \n     on a false reading of a single Wall Street Journal story, \n     amplified by a one-sided, partisan\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\n     analysis that piles speculation atop misinterpretation. The \n     Journal story in turn was based on an interview with McCain \n     adviser Holtz-Eakin. He said flatly in a conference call with \n     reporters after the ad was released, ``No service is being \n     reduced. Every beneficiary will in the future receive exactly \n     the benefits that they have been promised from the \n     beginning.''\n\n\n                    Twisting Facts to Scare Seniors\n\n       Here's how Democrats cooked up their bogus $882 billion \n     claim.\n       On Oct. 6, the Journal ran a story saying that McCain \n     planned to pay for his health care plan ``in part'' through \n     reduced Medicare and Medicaid spending, quoting Holtz-Eakin \n     as its authority. The Journal characterizes these reductions \n     as both ``cuts'' and ``savings.'' Importantly, Holtz-Eakin \n     did not say that any benefits would be cut, and the one \n     direct quote from him in the article makes clear that he's \n     talking about economies:\n       Wall Street Journal, Oct. 6: Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the \n     Medicare and Medicaid changes would improve the programs and \n     eliminate fraud, but he didn't detail where the cuts would \n     come from. ``It's about giving them the benefit package that \n     has been promised to them by law at lower cost,'' he said.\n       Holtz-Eakin complains that the Journal story was ``a \n     terrible characterization'' of McCain's intentions, but even \n     so it clearly quoted him as saying McCain planned on ``giving \n     [Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries] the benefit package \n     that has been promised.''\n       Nevertheless, a Democratic-leaning group quickly twisted \n     his quotes into a report with a headline stating that the \n     McCain plan ``requires deep benefit and eligibility cuts in \n     Medicare and Medicaid''--the opposite of what the Journal \n     quoted Holtz-Eakin as saying. The report was issued by the \n     Center for American Progress Action Fund, headed by John D. \n     Podesta, former chief of staff to Democratic President Bill \n     Clinton. The report's authors are a former Clinton \n     administration official, a former aid to Democratic Sen. Bob \n     Kerrey and a former aid to Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski.\n       The first sentence said--quite incorrectly--that McCain \n     ``disclosed this week that he would cut $1.3 trillion from \n     Medicare and Medicaid to pay for his health care plan.'' \n     McCain said no such thing, and neither did Holtz-Eakin. The \n     Journal reporter cited a $1.3 trillion estimate of the amount \n     McCain would need to produce, over 10 years, to make his \n     health care plan ``budget neutral,'' as he promises to do. \n     The estimate comes not from McCain, but from the Urban-\n     Brookings Tax Policy Center. McCain and Holtz-Eakin haven't \n     disputed that figure, but they haven't endorsed it either.\n       Nevertheless, the report assumes McCain would divide $1.3 \n     trillion in ``cuts'' proportionately between the two \n     programs, and comes up with this: ``The McCain plan will cut \n     $882 billion from the Medicare program, roughly 13 percent of \n     Medicare's projected spending over a 10-year period.'' And \n     with such a cut, the report concludes, Medicare spending \n     ``will not keep pace with inflation and enrollment growth--\n     thereby requiring cuts in benefits, eligibility, or both.''\n       The Obama campaign began the Medicare assault with a 30-\n     second TV ad released Oct. 17, which it said would run \n     ``across the country in key states.''\n       Announcer. John McCain's health care plan . . . first we \n     learned he's going to tax health care benefits to pay for \n     part of it.\n       Now the Wall Street Journal reports John McCain would pay \n     for the rest of his health care plan ``with major reductions \n     to Medicare and Medicaid.''\n       Eight hundred and eighty-two billion from Medicare alone. \n     ``Requiring cuts in benefits, eligibility, or both.''\n       John McCain . . . Taxing Health Benefits . . . Cutting \n     Medicare. We Can't Afford John McCain.\n       Obama. I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message.\n       The ad quotes the Wall Street Journal as saying McCain \n     would pay for his health care plan with ``major reductions to \n     Medicare and Medicaid,'' which the ad says would total $882 \n     billion from Medicare alone, ``requiring cuts in benefits, \n     eligibility, or both.''\n       Obama elaborated on the theme Oct. 18 in a stump speech in \n     St. Louis, Mo., claiming flatly that seniors would face major \n     medical hardships under McCain:\n       Obama, Oct. 18: But it turns out, Senator McCain would pay \n     for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare--$882 \n     billion worth. Under his plan, if you count on Medicare, you \n     would have fewer places to get care, and less freedom to \n     choose your doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs, receive \n     fewer services, and get lower quality care.\n       Update, Oct. 21: A second and even more misleading Obama ad \n     begins: ``How will your golden years turn out?'' It states \n     flatly that McCain's plan would mean a 22 percent cut in \n     benefits, higher premiums, higher co-pays, . . .\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Nevada will stop \nmaking false claims--repeating the false claims that were in attack ads \non me throughout the campaign, funded by tens of millions of dollars, \nabout my positions on health care in America which the fact checkers \nfound to be totally false.\n\n       As the narrator says that McCain's plan ``means a 22 \n     percent cut in benefits,'' the ad displays a footnote citing \n     an Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal story as its authority.\n\n  FactCheck:\n\n       But, in fact, the Journal story makes no mention of any 22 \n     percent reduction, or any reduction at all.\n\n  I hope, among other things, in his, may I describe, frustration, that \nthe Senate majority leader would at least not repeat false accusations \nabout what I wanted to do in the Presidential campaign. It is \nunfortunate.\n  And I hope that maybe, instead of attacking David Broder, instead of \nattacking me, instead of attacking others who are in support of this \namendment, maybe we could have a more meaningful discussion about the \nfacts surrounding this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds remains for the minority.\n  Mr. DODD. The minority has 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I will speak very quickly, since we have \n30 seconds.\n  Reality does set in. We have looked at the impact of these cuts on \nour nursing home beds in Nebraska. We have about 14,000 beds dedicated \nto Medicare. This will be a loss of $663 per bed. That affects real \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of our time to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Senator. That is very kind of you, and I \nappreciate that.\n  Maybe it comes from my time as Governor, maybe it comes from my time \nas mayor, but somehow, some way, you have to live with the legislation \nthat is passed, whether it is by the Federal Government, whether it is \nat the State level or whatever. You can bounce this back and forth all \nday, but the reality is these are real cuts and they involve real \nprograms that involve real people in our States. You can describe them \nany way you want, you can call them excessive payments, you can do \nthis, that, or the next thing. You can say: Well, we are giving this \nour best shot, but the difficulty is this is a high-risk venture. We \nwill be impacting in my State, for example--and every Senator could \nstand up and give this same speech--but this will impact the most \nvulnerable population in our Nation--people who are in a nursing home \nand who are the Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As I said in my short statement, there are 14,061 nursing home beds \nacross our State that are dedicated to Medicare patients. We are \nworking overtime to try to understand what this legislation does to \nreal people. The number we have come up with, working with our nursing \nhome industry, is that if this legislation is passed, each bed is \nimpacted by a loss of $663.\n  I will sum up my comments by reading something that was sent to me by \nsomeone who works in the nursing home industry. Here is what this \nperson says:\n\n       For the first time in my career, I am honestly questioning \n     how much longer I can continue. To constantly be up against \n     regulation and funding, when all you want to do is make a \n     difference in someone's life, is exhausting.\n\n  This is a high-risk venture. This shouldn't be about taking our best \nshot, this should be about getting this legislation right.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, if I can, address a couple of \npoints. First of all, I made this point yesterday, but it deserves \nbeing made again because the suggestion somehow that this bill doesn't \nprovide any benefits to anyone until the year 2014 is untrue. I could \nspend the next 40 minutes describing the various things our bill does \nimmediately. Upon the enactment of this legislation, there are tax \nbreaks immediately for small businesses to be able to reduce the cost \nof health care in a market where small businesses pay, on average, 18 \npercent more for health care premiums than other businesses do. As \npointed out by the CBO, under our bill you are actually seeing premium \ncost reductions in the small\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\nbusiness market, as well as the individual market and the large-group \nmarket.\n  Right away our legislation closes a good part of that doughnut hole, \nwhich is an immediate benefit to the cost of prescription drugs for the \nelderly. That doesn't happen 4 or 5 years from now, but immediately.\n  We provide immediate screening and prevention services for Americans. \nAs I mentioned earlier, that is not only the humane thing to do, it is \nalso a great cost saver. If you can detect an early problem and deal \nwith it, the cost savings are monumental, and we all know that.\n  Under our health care plans as Senators--where we get 23 different \noptions every year to choose from--we have that benefit. I am a \nbeneficiary of that benefit, having identified a health care problem \nearly through screening. That was not only beneficial to me personally, \nbecause I am going to be alive for a longer period of time than \notherwise, but it saved thousands of dollars in long-term medical costs \nthat would have occurred if I had not identified the problem. Those are \nsimple things that are included in our bill that happen immediately.\n  You can't be dropped by your health care carrier, as you are today. \nToday, you can be dropped for no cause--for no reason whatsoever. That \nis stopped immediately on the adoption of this legislation.\n  So when I heard my good friend from Arizona saying there are no \nbenefits in this bill for 4 or 5 years, that is not true. And again, a \nsimple reading of the legislation would identify any number--I have \nhere a long list--of benefits that will happen immediately.\n  The issue Senator Baucus has raised over and over again is the issue \nof guaranteed benefits under Medicare. Guaranteed benefits. Let me \nchallenge my colleagues to identify a single guaranteed benefit under \nMedicare that is cut by the bill before us. There is not a single \nbenefit under the guaranteed program that is in any way disadvantaged \nor reduced as a result of this legislation. What is cut are private \nhealth care plans under the Medicare Advantage Program. The reason why \nwe are doing this is Medicare Advantage overpayments cost every senior \nmore money. A typical elderly couple pays $90 more per year in Part B \npremiums to pay for the Medicare Advantage overpayments, even if they \nare not enrolled in these plans. That is $90, on average, for every \ncouple, and they get none of the benefits from it. Fully 78 percent of \nbeneficiaries are forced to pay higher premiums for non-Medicare extra \nbenefits they will never see.\n  Again, I understand some people would like to have these additional \nbenefits. I understand that. They are not guaranteed Medicare benefits. \nThese are benefits that are provided for under Medicare Advantage. But \n78 percent of our elderly are paying higher premiums so a smaller \npercentage of people can get those benefits. Why should 78 percent of \nthe elderly in this country pay a higher premium for a smaller \npercentage of people under private health care plans?\n  What Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee tried to do is to \nreduce those costs. Those are not guaranteed Medicare benefits. There \nis no guaranteed Medicare benefit that is cut under this bill, and I \ndefy any Member of this body to find one guaranteed benefit that is \nreduced under this plan.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BURR. I would ask the distinguished Senator from Connecticut if \nwe empower the independent Medicare advisory board to come up with \n$23.4 billion in cuts under Medicare? Can the Senator from Connecticut \nassure me that the independent Medicare advisory board would not find a \nbenefit that they would suggest cutting?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely. That is not allowed under this. You cannot cut \nguaranteed benefits. Going back and looking at providers--\n  Mr. BURR. If the Senator will yield for an additional question: Is \nthis board empowered to find $23.4 billion worth of cuts?\n  Mr. DODD. Not under guaranteed benefits. That is very clear.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator show me that language?\n  Mr. DODD. The board is prohibited, forbidden, from proposing changes \nthat would take benefits away from seniors or increase their costs. The \nboard cannot ration care, raise taxes on Part B premiums, or change \nMedicare benefits eligibility or cost-sharing standards.\n  It couldn't be more clear. They are absolutely prohibited from doing \nthat. And that is the point we have been trying to make here. Frankly, \nas we know, there are hospitals that will tell you themselves, in many \ncases, as a provider, there are cost savings there. I am told--and \nagain my colleagues know more about these details than I do--that it is \nnot uncommon for an elderly person to leave a hospital and, on average, \nbe given four prescription drugs to take. I am told as well that within \na month or so that elderly person is not following their prescriptions \nvery well--either they live alone, or for one reason or another they do \nnot follow their prescriptions--and they end up being readmitted. There \nis a very high readmission rate in hospitals, thus raising the cost for \nhospitalization.\n  Our bill makes significant efforts to try to reduce the problem of \nhospital readmissions, which, again, raises costs tremendously. That is \nwhere the savings are coming from here, by taking steps to try and \nreduce the readmission rate to the hospitals. That is a cost savings \nthat is not denying a benefit to the elderly. It is trying to save \nmoney and save lives. That is what we are trying to achieve here.\n  But, again, I challenge any Member to come up and identify a single \nguaranteed benefit under Medicare that is cut in this bill. There are \nnone. And 78 percent of our elderly should not be required to pay \nadditional premiums to take care of a handful of other people out \nthere. I understand why they want some of these benefits, and they \nshouldn't be denied them, if they want to pay for them, but don't \ncharge the other Medicare beneficiaries for the benefit they never get.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is interesting to me that under the McCain amendment, \nthe first line in the amendment--the motion to commit--relates to \nMedicare Advantage. I used to work for an old fellow in Illinois \npolitics named Cecil Partee, and Cecil said: For every issue in \npolitics, there is a good reason and a real reason. We hear a lot of \ngood reasons on the floor for this McCain amendment and the future of \nMedicare. The real reason is on the first line of Senator McCain's \nmotion to commit. He says: Send this back to committee and don't touch \nMedicare Advantage.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Connecticut about Medicare Advantage, \nbecause some of the things I have read around the country about \nMedicare Advantage tell me this plan, run by private health insurance \ncompanies, costs more than basic Medicare. These companies promised us, \nwhen they got involved, they would show us how to run a health \ninsurance plan. They would show us how to provide Medicare benefits and \nthey would save us money. Some have. But by and large, if I am not \nmistaken, isn't the verdict in--a 14-percent increase in cost for \nMedicare benefits under this Medicare Advantage?\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Illinois is absolutely correct, it is 14 \npercent. In some States it is 50 percent more.\n  Mr. DURBIN. When we talk about saving over $100 billion in the \nMedicare Program over the 10 years, part of it is by saying to those \nprivate health insurance companies that are overcharging Medicare \nrecipients, the party is over. The subsidy is over. We are going to \nmake sure that every American who qualifies for Medicare gets the basic \nbenefits, but we will not allow these private health insurance \ncompanies to get a subsidy from the Federal Government at the expense \nof Medicare and its recipients.\n  Mr. DODD. And then charging the other 78 percent of Medicare \nrecipients to raise their premiums. That is the outrage of all this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the motive behind the McCain amendment is less about \nsaving Medicare and more about saving a private health insurance \nprogram called Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. DODD. And talk about misbranding, calling something Medicare\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\nAdvantage. It is neither Medicare nor an advantage. Quite the opposite, \nin fact.\n  You are accurate in your numbers, by the way, because I want people \nto know, as much as we respect the Senator from Illinois and his math, \nthe numbers he identifies of $100 billion this program is costing us, \ncomes from the Congressional Budget Office. We didn't make up these \nnumbers. That is the cost savings by modifying Medicare Advantage that \nhas cost us so much and deprived the overwhelming majority of our \nelderly the benefits they end up paying for. So I appreciate very much \nthe Senator's question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield for another question, might I \nask my friend if it isn't also true that in the June MedPAC report it \nstates that Medicare Advantage overpayments cost taxpayers an extra $12 \nbillion?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. And again, that is MedPAC.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, that is right, that is MedPAC. I think the point \nthe Senator from Illinois is making needs to be underlined two or three \nor four times here--and the Senator from Connecticut has made it too--\nand that is there is a huge distinction between Medicare and these \nprivate insurance plans.\n  Mr. DODD. I think too many of our fellow citizens hear the word \nMedicare Advantage and assume that is the Medicare Program, and it is \nnot.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is not. It is a private plan.\n  What Medicare Advantage is overpaid--that is what these insurance \ncompanies are overpaid, and a lot of that goes back to the Part D drug \nbill and so forth--do those overpayments necessarily mean better \nbenefits for persons who signed up for those plans?\n  Mr. DODD. No. In fact, there is no evidence that overpayments to \nplans leads to better health care. That is again according to MedPAC.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If that is true, why might that be the case, just so \npeople understand?\n  Mr. DODD. Because insurers, not seniors or the Medicare Program, \ndetermine how these overpayments are used. And too often they are used \nto line the pockets of insurers, to increase their profits and not to \nprovide benefits.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does Medicare decide what the benefits will be for those \nfolks?\n  Mr. DODD. No, it is the private carriers that decide that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The private insurance carriers.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, they are the ones that set the rates and determine \nwhere the profits go. That is why it is such a misnomer to call this \nMedicare Advantage, because it is neither Medicare nor an advantage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, I will ask for 2 \nadditional minutes for my side.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I gave 2 minutes to my friends earlier.\n  Mr. COBURN. How about 1?\n  Mr. DODD. OK, 1. Well, make that 2. If he wants 2 additional minutes, \nI have no problem giving my colleague 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You already said it, but I think it is worth repeating--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Most seniors, as they pay Part B premiums under fee for \nservice, don't get any benefit whatsoever?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. None whatsoever. In fact, all they do get \nis higher premiums.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right. Higher premiums.\n  Mr. DODD. Higher premiums. And 78 percent, almost 80 percent are \npaying more for a program from which they never get any benefit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The figure I saw--I guess it is $90 a year they pay extra \nand get no benefit from it.\n  Mr. DODD. So vote for the McCain amendment and you do exactly what \nSenator Durbin is suggesting: Preserve Medicare Advantage, and under \nMedicare Advantage 78 percent of our elderly pay more premiums, never \nget any benefits, and the private carriers get to pocket the \ndifference. That is a great vote around here. That is great health care \nreform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, could we \ncharacterize this as an earmark in the Medicare Advantage Program?\n  Mr. DODD. It is two ears, not even one ear. I give it two ears.\n  Mr. BROWN. I say to Senator Dodd, we remember 10 years ago when the \ninsurance companies came to the government and said we can do something \nthat later became Medicare Advantage, and we can do it less \nexpensively. They said we can do it for 5 percent less than the cost of \nMedicare and the government unfortunately made the agreement with them \nto sign up to do that. Then what happened in the last 10 years is, the \ninsurance lobbyists came here and lobbied the Bush administration and \nlobbied the Congress and got bigger payments. It is a subsidy for the \ninsurance companies, but you and Senator Baucus and Senator Durbin said \nit is not Medicare, it is private insurance, privatized form of \nMedicare that serves the insurance companies very well, is that \ncorrect, but doesn't serve the seniors in this country?\n  Mr. DODD. I will sit here all day waiting for someone to identify a \nsingle benefit guaranteed under the Medicare Program that is cut in our \nbill. They are all talking about Medicare Advantage, not Medicare. \nThere are no guaranteed benefits cut under this bill nor can those \nbenefits be cut. Our legislation bans and prohibits any cuts in \nguaranteed benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. One of the questions and one of the promises was: If you \nhave what you have now and you like it, you can keep it. What is \nhappening under this bill for 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage, \nthat is not going to happen. If they like it, they are not going to be \nable to keep what they have. You can't deny that. That is the truth.\n  Medicare Advantage needs to be reformed. There is no question about \nit. I agree. As the Senator alluded to, in the Patients Choice Act we \nactually save $160 billion in the Patients' Choice Act, but we don't \ndiminish any of the benefits, and we do that because CMS failed to \ncompetitively bid it, because when it was written--and I understand who \nwrote it--when it was written we didn't make them competitively bid it. \nYou could get the same savings, actually get more savings and not \nreduce benefits in any amount, if you competitively bid that product. \nBut we have decided we are not going to do that.\n  The second point I make with my colleagues is the vast majority of \npeople on Medicare Advantage are on the lower bottom economically. They \ncan't afford an AARP supplemental bill. They can't afford to pay an \nextra $150 or $200 a month. So what happens most of the time with \nMedicare Advantage is we bring people up to what everybody else in \nMedicare gets because most people can afford--84 percent of the people \nin this country can afford to buy a Medicare supplemental policy \nbecause Medicare doesn't cover everything.\n  Your idea to try to save money, I agree with. But cutting the \nbenefits I do not agree with. You are right, Senator Dodd, the basic \nguaranteed benefits have to be supplied to Medicare Advantage and then \nthe things above that which you get from the supplemental policy, what \nyou can afford to buy, is what these people get. And what you are \ntaking away from poorest of our elderly is the ability to have the same \ncare that people get who can afford to buy a supplemental policy. That \nis the difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, on Monday the Congressional Budget \nOffice sent a letter to the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, that \nprovides a very comprehensive analysis of what health insurance \npremiums will look like as a result of this 2,074-page bill before us, \nintroduced by Senator Reid. Listening to that discussion, I am starting \nto wonder if anyone actually read the letter. I hear a lot of people \nsaying this letter proves that premiums will go down under the Reid \nbill, even though that is not what the letter says. I am here to tell \nmy colleagues what the letter really says.\n  The letter makes it very clear that premiums will increase on average \nby 10 to 13 percent for people buying coverage in the individual \nmarket. Since it seems to fly by everybody what this letter actually \nsaid about increasing premiums, I brought down a chart to show everyone \nin case they missed it.\n  The letter from the CBO says very clearly that for the individual \nmarket, premiums are going to go up 10 to 13 percent. My colleagues \nkeep saying premiums are going to go down, conveniently forgetting, \nthen, to mention this 10- to 13-percent increase. They prefer to talk \nabout the 57 percent of Americans in the individual market who are \ngetting subsidies. It is true that government is spending $500 billion \nin hard-earned taxpayer money to cover up the fact that this bill \ndrives up premiums faster than current law. So we might as well repeat \nit: Premiums will go up faster under this bill.\n  Supporters of this bill are covering this increase in cost how? By \nhanding out subsidies. If you are one of the 14 million who doesn't \nhappen to get a subsidy, you are out of luck. You are stuck with a plan \nthat is 10 to 13 percent more expensive and also, simultaneous with it, \nan unprecedented new Federal law that mandates that you purchase \ninsurance. If you don't purchase insurance, you are going to pay a \npenalty to the IRS every time you file your income tax. Some may say \nthis is just the individual market. It only accounts for a small \nportion of the total market. If you are comfortable with 14 million \npeople paying more under this bill than they would under current law, \nlet's look at the employer-based market.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analysis says this bill maintains the \nstatus quo in the small group and large group insurance market. Is that \nsomething to be celebrating? Are expectations so low at this point that \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle are celebrating that this \nbill will increase premiums for some and maintain the status quo for \neveryone else? I am being generous in using the phrase ``status quo'' \nbecause this bill actually makes things worse for millions of people. \nThis bill is so bad that my friends on the other side of the aisle are \ntrying to convince the American people that this is just more of the \nsame, when that doesn't happen to be the case.\n  Whatever happened to bending the growth curve? If that is too \nWashingtonese for people, the goal around here of a bill at one time \nwas to make sure the inflation in insurance didn't continue to go up so \nmuch that it would go the other way.\n  Then what about the President's promise that everyone would save \n$2,500? According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost every \nsmall business will pay between 1 percent more to 2 percent less for \nhealth insurance. That means, of course, that compared to what \nbusinesses would have paid under current law, this bill will either \nraise premiums 1 percent or decrease them a whopping 2 percent. It \ndoesn't sound like this bill is providing any real relief or, for sure, \nnot providing $2,500 savings for every American, as President Obama \nrepeatedly pledged during the campaign. Larger businesses will pay the \nsame or up to 3 percent less for health insurance. Once again, that \ndoesn't sound like relief; it sounds like more of the same.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that between \nnow and 2016, premiums will continue to grow at twice the rate of \ninflation. I thought Congress was considering health reform to put an \nend to unsustainable premium increases.\n  So this bill cuts Medicare by $500 billion, raises taxes by $500 \nbillion, restructures 17 percent of our economy, and spends $2.5 \ntrillion. Yet some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ncelebrating that they have achieved the status quo when, in fact, the \nsituation will be worse. I always thought the status quo was \nunacceptable. I thought businesses could not afford the status quo. I \nthought the status quo was killing American businesses, killing jobs, \nand making this country less competitive. But Member after Member keeps \ncoming down to the floor to celebrate spending $2.5 trillion on the \nstatus quo. We could have done that for free. Am I missing something? \nDid people really read the same letter I did from the CBO?\n  When President Obama visited Minneapolis in September, he didn't \nsound as though he was celebrating maintaining the status quo. On the \ncontrary, I have a chart with one of his quotes:\n\n       I will not accept the status quo. Not this time. Not now. . \n     . .\n\n  Some Members seem to disagree. Some Members are celebrating that they \nare making things worse for millions of Americans and maintaining the \nstatus quo for everyone else.\n  Here is what Vice President Biden said:\n\n       The status quo is simply unacceptable. Let me say that \n     again--the status quo is simply unacceptable. Rising costs \n     are crushing us.\n\n  That doesn't sound like a call for more of the same. Once again, \nMembers on the other side of the aisle seem quite comfortable investing \n$2.5 trillion in more of the same. That is taxpayer dollars we are \ntalking about.\n  If I asked most Iowans how they would feel about government spending \n$2.5 trillion and premiums would still increase as fast or faster, they \nwould say that was a pretty bad investment. Well, I will not argue with \nwhat our constituents would say on that point. I agree with them.\n  This Congressional Budget Office letter tells me that we are debating \na pretty bad investment. Our constituents want lower costs. That is \ntheir main concern. But this bill fails to address that concern because \nit raises premiums. Despite offering new ideas throughout the committee \nprocess and on the floor of the Senate, Republicans are being accused \nof supporting the status quo. CBO has spoken, and it is pretty clear \nthat my colleagues are not only OK with the status quo, they are OK \nwith making things worse: higher taxes, higher premiums, increased \ndeficit, less Medicare. They are celebrating that they spent $2.5 \ntrillion to raise premiums for 14 million people, not bending the \ngrowth curve of inflation in health care, and not cutting costs. Don't \ntake my word for it. Read the letter. Read the letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office. I have copies I will pass out if anybody \nwants them. I have this chart that demonstrates that point.\n  I also wish to take a few minutes at this time to correct some \ninaccurate comments made earlier by some of my colleagues. When we are \ntalking about 17 percent of the economy and something that touches the \nlives of every single American, I want to make sure we have an honest \nand accurate debate. This morning I heard at least three Members on the \nother side of the aisle say that Medicare Advantage is not part of \nMedicare. This is totally false.\n  But don't take my word for it. I would like to have Members turn to \npage 50 of the handbook,''Medicare and You.'' Presumably it has the \ndate of 2010 on it. It is sent out every year. In fact, I think I have \ntwo copies of this in my household. If anybody wants to save paper and \nnot waste taxpayer money, they can get on the Internet and tell them \nonly to send one to their house next year. I have done that.\n  This book says, for those who say Medicare Advantage is not part of \nMedicare:\n\n       A Medicare Advantage plan is another health coverage choice \n     that you may have as part of Medicare.\n\n  I repeat, despite what Members were saying earlier, the ``Medicare \nand You'' handbook says very clearly: Medicare Advantage Plans are part \nof Medicare. So if you are cutting Medicare Advantage benefits, you \nare, in fact, cutting Medicare benefits.\n  Next, I hear a lot of Members talking about guaranteed benefits \nversus statutory benefits. I can't speak for my other 99 colleagues, \nbut the seniors in Iowa who have come to rely upon the free flu shots, \neyeglasses, and dental care that Medicare Advantage provides don't care \nif they are guaranteed or if they are statutory. Seniors in Iowa just \nwant to know they will still have\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nthese benefits after health reform is passed.\n  The Senator from Connecticut challenged any Member to come down to \nthe Senate floor and point out where this bill will cut benefits. He \neven read a section from page 1,004 of this 2,074-page bill that talks \nabout how the Medicare Commission cannot cut benefits or ration care. I \nhave read page 1,004. What Senator Dodd failed to mention is that this \nsection only refers to Parts A and B of Medicare. It fails to provide \nany protection to Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit, or \nthe Medicare Advantage Program that covers 11 million seniors.\n\n  Are we now going to start hearing that Medicare Part D is not part of \nMedicare either? In fact, on page 1,005, it specifically says the \nMedicare Commission can ``[i]nclude recommendations to reduce Medicare \npayments under parts C and D.''\n  I have asked CBO, and they have confirmed this authority could result \nin higher premiums and less benefits to seniors. In fact, this is what \nCongressional Budget Office Director Elmendorf said, and we have that \non a chart for you to see the quote I am going to read: ``A reduction \nin subsidies to [Part D] would raise the cost to beneficiaries.''\n  Lastly, I wish to raise an issue about access to care. I keep hearing \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle talk about how these cuts \nwill not affect seniors. They say they are just overpayments to \nproviders. Well, in my opinion, if you cannot find a doctor or if you \ncannot find a home health provider or a hospice provider to deliver \ncare, then that tends to be a very big problem. I would even consider \nthat a cut in benefits or hurting access to care.\n  But, once again, do not take my word for it. In talking about similar \ncuts to Medicare in the House bill, the Office of the Actuary at the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services said providers that rely on \nMedicare might end their participation, ``[p]ossibly jeopardizing \naccess to care for beneficiaries.''\n  So let's be accurate and let's be honest. Medicare Advantage is part \nof Medicare, and this bill cuts benefits seniors have come to rely \nupon. The Medicare Commission absolutely has authority to cut benefits \nand to raise premiums, and this bill will jeopardize that access to \ncare.\n  Those are all facts. They are not my facts but facts taken directly \nfrom the language of this 2,074-page bill and from reports of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of the Actuary at the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it seems I am following the Senator from \nIowa every day. I, first, wish to acknowledge my friendship and respect \nfor him. But the Medicare Advantage Program, which the Republican side \nis trying to protect, is a program which is private health insurance.\n  The largest political opponent to health care reform in America is \nthe private health insurance industry. We estimate they have spent $23 \nmillion so far lobbying to defeat this bill because they are doing very \nwell under the current system. They are very profitable companies, and \nthey realize, if they face competition, limitations on the way they do \nbusiness, it will cut into their bottom line and their profits, and, \nnaturally, are fighting the bill.\n  The amendment before us, the motion to commit by Senator McCain--the \nfirst thing it does is to protect the Medicare Advantage Program. That \nis a private health insurance program that was created with the promise \nthat it would be cheaper than traditional government-run Medicare. In \nsome cases, they have offered a cheaper policy. But, overall, these \nprivate health insurance companies are charging the Medicare Program 14 \npercent more than the actual cost of the government-run system.\n  The promise that the private sector could do it more cheaply and \nbetter turned out not to be true. So we are paying a subsidy in \nprofits--extra profits--to private health insurance companies. The \nMcCain amendment, which has been supported by Senator Grassley and \nothers who have come to the floor, is an effort to stop us from \neliminating this subsidy.\n  What is this subsidy worth? This subsidy to private health insurance \ncompanies will cost the Medicare Program $170 billion over the next 10 \nyears--no small amount. We believe that money is better spent on \nextending benefits to Medicare beneficiaries, not in providing \nadditional profits to already profitable private health insurance \ncompanies.\n  Yes, Medicare Advantage policies are offering Medicare benefits, but \nthey are charging more for it than the government. So it did not turn \nout to be a bargain. It turned out to be a loss to the Medicare \nProgram. They did not do what they promised to do. We want to hold them \naccountable. The McCain amendment wants to let them off the hook and \nbasically say: Private health insurance companies, keep drawing that \nmoney out of Medicare. We are not going to hold you accountable.\n  That earmark of the Medicare Advantage Program, that decision by \nCongress to give them a special privilege in selling this health \ninsurance, is too darn expensive for senior citizens and people who \nrely on Medicare. That is why we are opposing the McCain amendment.\n  I might add, this is the third day of the debate on health care \nreform in America. We have yet to vote on a single amendment because \nthe Republicans refuse to allow us to bring an amendment to the floor \nfor a vote. How can you have an honest debate about a bill of this \nseriousness and magnitude if you cannot bring a measure to a vote on \nthe floor?\n  Those who follow the Senate know it is a peculiar institution and its \nrules protect minorities, and individual Senators can object to a vote. \nThe Republican Senators have objected to a vote, even on the McCain \namendment, which I believe was filed on Monday, and here we are on \nWednesday. We have talked about it. We know what is in it. We should \nvote on it. But the Republicans do not want to vote on it. They want to \ndrag this out in the hopes that our desire to go home for Christmas \nmeans we will walk away from health care reform.\n  Well, if a few of the Republican Senators could have just left the \nDemocratic caucus, they would know better. We are determined to bring \nthis bill to a vote. We are determined to bring real health care reform \nto this country. We know what is at stake.\n  The current health care system in America is not affordable for most \nAmericans. Health insurance premiums have gone up dramatically in cost. \nIndividuals cannot afford to buy a policy. Businesses are dropping \ncoverage of their employees. We know the costs are unsustainable.\n  Unless we start bringing those costs down, this great health care \nsystem is going to collapse. We need to preserve the things that are \ngood in this system and fix those that are broken. Affordability is the \nfirst thing we need to address. The second thing we need to address, \nquite obviously, is to make sure every American has the right, as a \nconsumer, to get coverage when they need it.\n  How many times have you heard the story of people who pay their \nhealth insurance premiums their whole lives, then somebody gets sick in \ntheir house--a new baby, a child, your wife, your husband--a big \nmedical bill is coming, you go to the health insurance company, and you \nare in for a battle. They will not pay it. They say: Oh, we took a look \nat your application you filed a few years ago. You failed to disclose \nthat you had acne when you were an adolescent. Am I making that up? No. \nThat is an actual case. Because you did not disclose that you had acne \nas an adolescent, you failed to disclose a preexisting condition, so we \nhave no obligation to pay for anything. If this sounds farfetched, \nbelieve me, it is an actual case--and there are many others like it.\n  Private insurance companies have spent a fortune hiring an army of \npeople, sitting in front of computer screens, talking to the people who \nare paying the premiums, and above their computers is a sign that says: \n``Just Say No.'' They say no consistently because every time they say \nno, their profits go up. But it leaves individuals and families in a \nterrible situation--denied coverage because of a preexisting condition; \ndenied coverage because they could not carry their health insurance \npolicy with them after they\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nlost their job; denied coverage because of a cap in the amount of money \nthe policy would pay; rescinded, where they walk away from an insurance \npolicy because of some objection they have, legal objection; or how \nabout one of your kids who turned age 24, no longer covered by your \nfamily health plan, now out on their own, maybe fresh from college, and \nhas no job and no health insurance.\n  This bill addresses those issues. This bill eliminates the concern \npeople will have over a preexisting condition. It takes away the power \nof the health insurance companies to say no. It finally creates a \nsituation, which we have waited for for a long time. America is the \nonly civilized, industrialized country in the world where a person can \ndie for lack of health insurance. It does not happen anywhere else--\nonly in America. Madam President, 45,000 people a year die for lack of \nhealth insurance.\n  Who are these people? Let me give you an example, one person whom I \nmet. Her name is Judie, and she works in a motel in southern Illinois. \nShe is 60 years old, a delightful, happy woman. She is the one who \ntakes the dishes at the end of this little breakfast they offer at the \nmotel. She could not be happier and nicer. She is 60 years old, with \ndiabetes. She never had health insurance in her life--never. She goes \nto work every day, works 30 hours a week, and makes about $12,000 a \nyear. She does not have health insurance, but she does have diabetes. \nShe said to me: If I had health insurance, I would go to the doctor. I \nhave had some lumps that have concerned me for a little while here, but \nI can't afford it, Senator.\n  That is an example of a person who does not have the benefit of \nhealth insurance. This bill we are talking about--this bill we are \ngoing to produce for everyone to read on the Internet; it is already \nthere; it has been there for 10 days already; it will continue to be \nthere--this bill makes sure that 94 percent of the people in America \nhave health insurance coverage. That is an alltime high for the United \nStates of America.\n  I might also say, despite the criticisms--and they are entitled to be \ncritical on the Republican side of the aisle--they have yet to answer \nthe most basic criticism I have offered. Where is your bill? Where is \nthe Republican health care reform bill? They cannot answer that \nquestion because it does not exist. They have had a year to explore \ntheir ideas and develop them, but they have failed. They cannot produce \na bill. They are for the current system, as it exists, that is \nunsustainable, unaffordable, leaving too many Americans vulnerable to \nhealth insurance companies that say no and too many Americans without \nhealth insurance.\n  I wish to address one particular issue that seems to come up all the \ntime, and it is the issue of medical malpractice. I know my Republican \ncolleagues are going to bring up that issue. Senator McCain has, many \nothers have as well. President Obama recently recognized this as an \nissue of concern. Our bill will as well. We are going to explore, \nencourage, and fund State efforts to find ways to reduce medical \nmalpractice premiums and to reduce, even more importantly, the \nincidence of medical errors.\n  Medical malpractice reform proposals are based in States. The Federal \nGovernment does not have a medical malpractice law, not in general \nterms. It does for specific programs such as Indian health care, for \nexample, or federally qualified clinics. But when it comes to the \ngeneral practice of medicine, that is governed by State laws, and the \nStates decide when you can sue, what you can sue for, and the \nprocedures you have to follow.\n  In almost every State there has been a system that has developed over \nthe years to handle these cases. States regularly change and update \ntheir laws. The States try to strike a balance to protect patients, \npreserve their hospitals and doctors and other medical providers, \nensure that those who are injured have a chance for compensation, and \nmanage the cost of their system.\n  At least twenty-eight States, as of last year, have decided to impose \ncaps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. A long time \nago, before I came to Congress, I used to be a practicing lawyer in \nSpringfield, IL, and I handled medical malpractice cases. So I do not \nprofess to be an expert, nor even have current knowledge of medical \nmalpractice, but I did in a previous life have some experience. I \ndefended doctors, when they were sued, for a number of years on behalf \nof insurance companies, and I represented plaintiffs who were victims \nof medical negligence. So I have been on both sides of the table. I \nhave been in the courtroom. I have gone through the process.\n  Here is what it comes down to. If you are a victim of medical \nmalpractice, medical negligence, the jury can give you an award, which \nusually includes a number of possibilities: pay your medical bills, pay \nfor any lost wages, pay for any additional expenses that may be \nassociated with the court case, and pay for pain and suffering. Those \nare the basic elements that are involved in a medical malpractice \nlawsuit.\n  The pain and suffering part of it--it is pain, suffering, loss of a \nspouse or child, loss of fertility, scars, and disfigurement--is an \narea where many States have said: We want to limit the amount you can \nrecover for pain and suffering, what they call noneconomic losses. It \nis not medical bills. It is not lost wages. So my State, for example, \nhas a limitation of $500,000 on noneconomic damages in a medical \nmalpractice case, recently enacted by our general assembly. In the \nState of Texas, it is $250,000. Those are so-called caps, limitations \non the amount of money a jury can award for pain and suffering, when \nthey find, in fact, you were a victim of medical negligence.\n  Some States have decided to establish caps on pain and suffering, how \nmuch you can recover; others have not. The reason many imposed caps was \nbecause they wanted to bring down the cost of medical malpractice \ninsurance for doctors and hospitals. Well, a number of States have done \nthat. At least twenty-eight States have done that, and we have been \nable to step back and take a look: How did it work? If you put a cap, a \nlimitation, on recovery for pain and suffering, noneconomic loss, does \nthat mean there will be lower malpractice premiums for doctors? In some \ncases, yes; in some cases, no.\n  Minnesota is an interesting example. Minnesota does not have caps on \ndamages. Yet it has some of the lowest malpractice premiums in \nAmerica. Twenty-five States, including Minnesota, use a certificate of \nmerit system which means before you can file a lawsuit you need a \nmedical professional to sign an affidavit that you have a legitimate \nclaim before you even get into the court. That is in Minnesota, it is \nin Illinois, and a number of other States to stop so-called frivolous \nlawsuits.\n\n  Some States such as Vermont have low malpractice premiums and don't \nhave any malpractice reforms. It is hard to track cause and effect here \nbetween tort reform, malpractice changes, and the actual premiums \ncharged physicians.\n  There are ways Congress can help States build on what already works \nfor each State. Senator Baucus, who is here on the floor and who is \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has worked with Senator Enzi \nto create incentives for State programs to look for innovative ways to \nreduce malpractice premiums and the incidence of medical negligence. I \nthink that is a good idea and I hope it will ultimately be included in \nthis bill.\n  One of the major considerations when it comes to malpractice reform \nis making sure we focus on real facts. One myth we hear over and over \nagain is about frivolous lawsuits flooding the courts. I have heard \nmany colleagues come to the floor and call it ``jackpot justice,'' \nfrivolous lawsuits, fly-by-night lawyers filing medical malpractice \nlawsuits. I am sure there is anecdotal evidence for each and every \nstatement, but when you look at the record, you find that malpractice \nclaims and lawsuit payouts are actually decreasing in America.\n  In 2008, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were 11,025 \npaid medical malpractice claims against physicians nationwide. One year \nin America, the total number of medical malpractice claims paid, \naccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, was 11,025. There are \n990,000 doctors in America, so roughly 1 percent of doctors is being \ncharged with malpractice\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\nand paying each year. This is a decrease from 2007 where the number was \n11,478. So the number of malpractice claims has gone down. The number \nof paid claims for every 1,000 physicians has decreased from 25.2 in \n1991 to 11.1 in 2008. That is a little over 1 percent of doctors \nactually paying malpractice claims.\n  Not only is the number of claims decreasing, but the amount they are \npaying to victims is decreasing as well. The National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners--not a group that is biased one way or the \nother when it comes to plaintiffs or defendants--said in 2003, \nmalpractice claim payouts peaked at $8.46 billion. In 2008 that number \nhad been cut in half. In 5 years it went down from $8.4 billion to $4 \nbillion. So rather than a flood of frivolous lawsuits, fewer lawsuits \nare being filed and dramatically less money is being paid out.\n  Incidentally, the New York Times in a summary of research in \nSeptember of this year found that only 2 to 3 percent of medical \nnegligence incidents actually lead to malpractice claims. So it is not \ncredible to argue that we have this flood of malpractice cases--they \nare going down--or this flood of payouts for malpractice in America. It \nhas been cut in half in 5 years.\n  A third key consideration in this debate is cost. One of the main \ngoals of pursuing health care reform is to try to reduce the cost to \nthe system and we want to try to do that in a way that won't compromise \nthe quality of care. There has been a lot of talk about the \nCongressional Budget Office report that was ordered up by Senator Hatch \non October 9. The Congressional Budget Office for years said they could \nnot put a pricetag on medical malpractice reform in terms of savings to \nthe system, but on October 9 they reported to Senator Hatch that they \ncould. Senator Hatch asked them what would be the impact on our health \ncare system if we had a Texas-style cap, which is $250,000 for pain and \nsuffering--I see the Senator from Texas on the floor and I hope I am \nquoting the Texas law correctly. He was a former Texas supreme court \njustice. Am I close?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Close.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Close. That is all I will get from the Senator from \nTexas, close. But the fact is that Senator Hatch said to the CBO, what \nif we had the Texas-style cap on every State in the Union, what would \nbe the net result? They came back and said there would be a savings of \nover $50 billion over the next 10 years. They said 40 percent of the \nsavings would come from lower medical liability premiums, 60 percent \nthrough reduced utilization of health care services.\n  I don't question the Congressional Budget Office reaching that \nconclusion. They worked hard to come up with their figures. But there \nare other ways to reach results they want to achieve of lowering \nmedical liability premiums and saving overall health care expenditures \nrather than adopting Federal damage caps. Keep in mind, these caps on \nwhat you can recover are for people who have been judged by a jury of \ntheir peers to have been victims. These are not people who have said I \nthink I was hurt. We are talking about people who have a right to \nrecovery in a lawsuit who are being told even though you were hurt, and \nsomebody did something wrong, we are going to limit how much you can be \npaid when it comes to these noneconomic losses.\n  The CBO analysis that Senator Hatch received went on to say:\n\n       Because medical malpractice laws exist to allow patients to \n     sue for damages that result from negligent health care, \n     imposing limits on that right might be expected to have a \n     negative impact on health outcomes.\n\n  They cited one study which found that a 10-percent reduction in costs \nrelated to medical malpractice liability would increase the Nation's \noverall death rate by .2 percent. By calculation that means that if the \nHatch proposal were applied nationwide, according to the CBO--and this \nis a cited study--4,853 more Americans would be killed each year by \nmedical malpractice--or more than 48,000 Americans over a 10-year \nperiod of time that the CBO examines. So if you accept their projection \non the savings for medical malpractice reform asked for by Senator \nHatch, you cannot escape the fact that they say yes, you will save \nmoney, but more Americans will die because there will be more \nmalpractice.\n  Let's look at the savings that can be achieved through reduced \nmalpractice insurance premiums. The CBO said a $250,000 Federal damage \ncap would reduce overall malpractice premiums by about 10 percent and \nwould reduce overall health care spending by .2 percent. Do we need a \nfederally mandated cap to achieve that? Malpractice insurance premiums \nare already going down. According to the Medical Liability Monitor's \ncomprehensive survey of premiums in the areas of internal medicine, \ngeneral surgery and OB/GYN: ``The most recent three years have shown a \nleveling and now a reduction in the overall average rate change'' for \nmedical malpractice premiums. There was a time in the early 2000s where \nmalpractice premiums were going up 20 percent a year, in 2003, 2004, \nand 9 percent in 2005. Since then they have gone down each year by less \nthan 1 percent in 2006, by .4 percent--I am sorry, .4 percent increase \nin 2007, but a 4.3 percent decrease in 2008. That is without any \nFederal cap on damages.\n  Let's also consider the issue of defensive medicine. Many people \nclaim that doctors do things such as order tests to cover themselves \nbecause they are afraid of being sued. I agree that there are \nundoubtedly some doctors who think that way. There was a famous article \nprinted in the New Yorker where a surgeon from Boston, Dr. Gawande, who \nwent to McAllen, TX--you probably saw this, Senator Cornyn--and he \nwanted to know in this article why in McAllen, TX, they were paying \nmore for Medicare patients than any other place in the United States. \nSo he visited with doctors and surgeons and hospital administrators to \nask them why. What is peculiar about that city and its elderly people? \nHe sat down with the doctors, and the first doctor said, Well, it is \ndefensive medicine. We are doing all of these extra tests and extra \ncosts to Medicare to cover ourselves, to protect ourselves. The doctor \nsitting next to him said, Oh, come on. With the Texas law, nobody is \nfiling malpractice lawsuits around here. We are doing these extra \nprocedures because it is a fee-for-service system. You are paid more \nwhen you do more. So at least in this case there was a dispute as to \nwhether this was truly defensive medicine or overbilling.\n  Dr. Carolyn Clancy, the director for the Agency of Healthcare \nResearch and Quality in the Department of HHS, has called medical \nerrors a national problem of epidemic proportions. According to that \nagency, the rate of adverse events has risen about 1 percent in each of \nthe past 6 years. The Institute of Medicine estimated in 1999 that up \nto 98,000 people died in America due to preventable medical errors. \nThese medical errors cost a lot. A 2003 study published in the Journal \nof the American Medical Association found the medical errors in U.S. \nhospitals in the year 2000--just 1 year--led to approximately 32,600 \ndeaths, 2.4 million extra days of patient hospitalization, and an \nadditional cost of $9.3 billion.\n\n  I wish to also say a word about the medical malpractice insurers. \nRemember, insurance companies and organized baseball are the only two \nbusinesses in America exempt from the antitrust laws. What it means is \nthat insurance companies can literally legally sit down and collude and \nconspire when it comes to the prices they charge, and they do. They \nhave official organizations--one used to be known as the Insurance \nServices Offices--that would sit down to make sure every insurance \ncompany knew what the other insurance company was charging, and they \ncould literally work out the premiums, how much they charge.\n  The same thing was true in market allocation. Insurance companies, \nunlike any other business in America, can pick and choose where they \nwill do business: Company X, you take St. Louis; company Y, you take \nChicago; company Z, you get Columbus, OH. They can do it legally.\n  So the obvious question is: If this is not on the square in terms of \nreal competition from health insurance companies, are these companies, \nin fact, paying out the kind of money they should?\n  Let me see if I can find a chart here. My staff was kind enough to \nbring these out. Well, I can't. They are great charts, but I can't find \nthe one I am looking for at this moment.\n  According to the information of the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, in 2008, medical malpractice insurers charged $11.4 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\nin premiums, but only paid out $4.1 billion in losses. In other words, \nthey took in $7 billion more than they paid out in losses. That is a \nloss ratio of 36 percent, which means they are basically collecting $3 \nfor every $1 they pay out--pretty close. How does that compare to the \nrest of the insurance industry? Well, it turns out that private \nautomobile liability insurance had a loss ratio of 66 percent, a payout \nof $2 out of every $3; homeowners, 72 percent, workers comp insurance, \n65 percent. These medical malpractice insurance companies are holding \nback premiums and not paying them out. It reached a point in my State \nwhere our insurance commissioner ordered that they declare a dividend \nand pay back some of the premiums they had collected from doctors and \nhospitals when it came to malpractice insurance.\n  But rather than get lost in statistics, as important as they are, I \nthink it is important that we also talk about the real life stories \nthat are involved in medical malpractice. I hear these terms such as \n``frivolous lawsuits'' and ``jackpot justice'' and people taking \nadvantage of the system, but let's not forget the real life stories \nthat lie behind medical malpractice. Let me show my colleagues a \npicture here of a couple. This is Molly Akers of New Lenox, IL, a \nlovely young lady, with her husband. Molly Akers had a swelling in her \nbreast and went to her doctor who performed a biopsy that showed she \nhad breast cancer. Molly had several mammograms which found no evidence \nof a tumor, but the doctors decided that despite the mammograms, she \nmust have a rare form of breast cancer. They recommended a mastectomy, \nremoving Molly Akers' right breast. After the operation, the doctor \ncalled her into the office and said that on further review, she never \nactually had breast cancer. The radiologist had made a mistake. He \nreviewed her slides and accidentally switched Molly's slides with \nsomeone else. Molly was permanently disfigured by an unnecessary \nsurgery. She said afterwards:\n\n       I never thought something like this could happen to me, but \n     I know now that medical malpractice can ruin your life.\n\n  By the way, that other woman whose slides were switched with Molly's \nwas told she was cancer free. What a horrific medical error that turned \nout to be.\n  This next picture is of Glenn Steinberg of Chicago. He went into \nsurgery for the removal of a tumor in his abdomen. Ten days after the \nsurgery, while still in the hospital, Glenn was having severe \ngastrointestinal problems. The doctors x-rayed his abdomen where the \noriginal surgery took place, and they found a 4-inch metal retractor \nfrom the surgery lodged against his intestine. A second surgery was \nperformed to remove the metal piece, during which Glenn's lungs \naspirated, and he died later that night.\n  Glenn's wife, Mary Steinberg, lost her husband. She said:\n\n       Not a day goes by that I don't miss Glenn's companionship \n     and the joy he brought to our household. Because of gross \n     negligence, he was not here to support me when my son went \n     off to serve our country in Iraq.\n\n  In this photo is a group of kids, including Martin Hartnett of \nChicago. When Martin's mom Donna arrived at the hospital to deliver, \nher labor wasn't progressing. Her doctor broke her water and found out \nthat it was abnormal.\n  Rather than considering a C-section, Donna's doctor started to \nadminister a drug to induce contractions. Six hours later, she still \nhadn't delivered, but her son's fetal monitoring system began \nindicating that he was in severe respiratory distress. The doctor \nfinally decided it was time to perform an emergency C-section, but it \nwas another hour before Donna was taken into the operating room.\n  During that time, the doctor failed to administer oxygen or take \nimmediate steps to help Martin breathe. After he was born, Martin was \nin the intensive care unit for 3 weeks. Later, Donna learned that \nMartin had substantial brain damage and cerebral palsy--a direct result \nof the doctor's failure to respond to indications of serious oxygen \ndeprivation and delivery in a timely manner.\n  Donna's doctor told her not to have any more children because there \nwas a serious problem with her DNA, which could result in similar \ndisabilities in any of her future kids. Since then, Donna has given \nbirth to three perfectly healthy sons.\n  Donna sued the doctor responsible for Martin's delivery and received \na settlement. She is thankful she has money from the settlement to help \ncover the costs associated with Martin's care that aren't covered by \nhealth insurance, such as the wheelchair-accessible van that she bought \nfor $50,000 and the $100,000 she spent making changes to her home so \nher son can get around the house in a wheelchair.\n  What would Donna have done without the money from that settlement? It \nis a scary thought because Martin is going to require a lifetime of \ncare. When we put caps on recoveries and say there is an absolute limit \nto how much someone who has created a problem has to pay out, we have \nto think about it in terms of real-life stories, such as Martin's. \nMartin will live for a long time, and he is going to need help. \nSomebody needs to be responsible for that. The person who caused this \nshould be responsible for it. That is pretty basic justice in America.\n  When you establish an artificial cap on noneconomic losses for pain \nand suffering, then you are saying there is a limit to how much can be \npaid. I recall the case of a woman in Chicago who went into a prominent \nhospital--one that I have a great deal of respect for--to have a mole \nremoved from her face--a very simple mole removal. They gave her a \ngeneral anesthesia. In the course of that anesthesia, they gave her \noxygen. The oxygen tank--in the administration of it--caught fire, \nliterally burning off her face. She went through repeated \nreconstructive surgeries. I have met her. There was scarring and, as \nyou can imagine, a lot of pain. Was $250,000 too much money for that, \nfor what she went through? Her life will never be the same. That is the \nkind of disfigurement covered by noneconomic losses that would be \nlimited by medical malpractice caps.\n  There are better ways to do this. We can, in fact, reduce the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance. We can, in fact, reduce medical errors. \nWe should not do it at the expense of innocent victims--people who went \nin, with all the trust in the world, to doctors and hospitals and had \nunfortunate and tragic results.\n  Every time I get up to speak on this subject I always make a point of \nsaying--and I will today--how much I respect the medical profession in \nAmerica. There isn't one of us in this Chamber, or anyone watching \nthis, who can't point to men and women in the practice of medicine who \nare true heroes in their everyday lives, who sacrifice greatly to \nbecome doctors, and who work night and day to get the best results for \ntheir patients. They richly deserve not only our praise but our \nrespect.\n  But there are those who make mistakes--serious mistakes. There are \ninnocent victims who end up with their lives changed or lost because of \nit. We cannot forget them in the course of this debate. This is about \nmore than dollars and cents. It is about justice in this country. I \nurge my colleagues, when the issue of medical malpractice comes before \nus, to remember the doctors but not to forget the victims and their \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, while our colleague from Illinois is \nstill on the Senate floor, I always enjoy listening to him. He is one \nof the most effective advocates, and he is an outstanding lawyer. He \nand I frequently disagree, but I always enjoy listening to his \narguments. That isn't what I came to talk about, but I am glad I \nhappened to be here when he talked about the successful effort we have \nhad in Texas, through medical liability reform laws, to make medical \nliability insurance more affordable for physicians and, as a \nconsequence, increase the number of doctors who have moved to our \nState, including rural areas, which has increased the public's access \nto good, quality health care. We have seen, in 100 counties, where they \ndidn't even have an OB-GYN, or obstetrician--a doctor who delivers \nbabies--after medical liability reform, that has changed dramatically, \nalong with a number of other high-risk specialties that have moved to \nthese counties where they were previously afraid to go for risk of \nlitigation and what that might mean to their future and career.\n\n[[Page S12112]]\n\n  This is an important topic. We will talk about it more. I appreciate \nthe Senator raising the issue. We have a different view about it. If we \ncan save $54 billion and still allow each of these people who were \nharmed by medical negligence to recover--which, in fact, they would be \nunder the Texas cap on noneconomic damages--each of these individuals \nwould be able to recover their lost wages, their medical bills, and \nthey would be able to receive large amounts of money for pain and \nsuffering--I am sure not enough to compensate them for what they have \nbeen through. But no one should understand that these individuals would \nsomehow be precluded or that the courthouse doors would be shut to \npeople who are victims of medical negligence.\n  There needs to be some reasonable limitations that will help, in the \nend, make health care more accessible, which is what we are talking \nabout.\n  I want to focus briefly on the cuts to Medicare in this new, huge \npiece of legislation we are considering. Of course, we are told by the \nCBO that as a result of Medicare cuts and the huge number of tax \nincreases this bill is ``paid for.'' In other words, assuming the \nassumptions that the CBO took into account, which span for a 10-year \nbudget window and are almost never true in the end--but if you take it \non faith that we are going to raise taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion and cut \nMedicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, they say this is a budget-neutral bill--\nnotwithstanding the fact that it spends $2.5 trillion over 10 years--\nbasically, what we are saying to America's seniors, those already \nvested in the Medicare Program, is that we are going to take $464 \nbillion that would go into the Medicare Program and we are going to use \nit to create a new government entitlement program.\n  Our record of fiscal responsibility, when it comes to entitlement \nprograms, is lousy, to say the least. We know Medicare, Social \nSecurity, which is another entitlement program, and Medicaid have run \nup tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities. Most of them \nare riddled with fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  The question I have, and I think many have, is why in the world would \nyou take money out of the Medicare Program that is scheduled to go \ninsolvent in 2017, that has tens of millions of dollars in unfunded \nliabilities--why would you take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare to \ncreate yet another entitlement program that, no doubt, will have many \nof the problems we see now under our current entitlement programs? It \njust doesn't make sense, if you are guided by the facts.\n\n  Of course, our colleagues on the floor have said: We can cut $465 \nbillion out of Medicare and, you know what, Medicare beneficiaries \nwould not feel a thing.\n  Well, I don't think that is possible when you cut $135 billion in \nhospital payments, when you cut $120 billion out of Medicare Advantage \non which 11 million seniors depend, on which they depend for their \nhealth care, or when you cut $15 billion from payments to nursing \nhomes, another $40 billion in home health care. I think one of the most \neffective ways of delivering low-cost health care is in people's homes. \nYou cut $40 billion from that, and you cut $8 billion from hospice, \nwhich is where people go during their final days in their terminal \nillness.\n  Some of my colleagues claim these cuts would not hurt patients, but \nmany people, including me, disagree. As a matter of fact, to quote \nPresident Obama's own Medicare actuary, he said providers might end \ntheir participation in the program. In other words, as in Medicare now, \nin my State, 58 percent of doctors will see a new Medicare patient \nbecause reimbursements--payments to providers--are so low, which means \nthat 42 percent will not see a new Medicare patient.\n  In Travis County, Austin, TX, the last figures showed that only 17 \npercent of physicians in Travis County will see a new Medicare patient \nbecause reimbursement rates are so low. Yet we are going to take money \nfrom Medicare to create a new entitlement program. There is no question \nin my mind that providers--in the words of the Medicare actuary--might \nbe hedging their bets. I think he is hedging his bets. He also said \nmany will end their participation in the program and thus jeopardize \naccess to care for beneficiaries.\n  We have heard some of the debate earlier about when our side of the \naisle made proposals to fix some of the problems with the Medicare \nProgram--not to create a new entitlement program--by taking this amount \nof money, $464 billion, from it. When we tried to fix it earlier, some \ncolleagues, including the majority leader, called those cuts immoral \nand cruel. To quote President Obama on the campaign trail, he was one \nof those who criticized Senator McCain for some of the proposals he \nmade to try to fix the broken Medicare Program.\n  As we have heard from a Texas Hospital Association, the Medicare cuts \nto hospitals simply will not work because--and this is another sort of \naccounting trick that in Washington, DC, and in Congress people think \nwe can get away with and fool the American people about what is \nactually happening. People are a lot smarter than I think Members of \nCongress sometimes give them credit for. Under the Senate bill, the \nexpanded coverage doesn't start until 2014. But the hospital cuts begin \nimmediately.\n  I have talked about the broken Medicare Program and, frankly, I think \na lot of people would rather see us fix Medicare and Medicaid before we \ncreate yet another huge entitlement program that is riddled with fraud, \nthat is on a fiscally unsustainable path, and one that, frankly, \npromises coverage but ultimately denies access to care because of \nunrealistically low payments to providers. We are going to make that \nworse if this bill passes, not better.\n  Well, this bill also includes something else that I think the public \nneeds to be very aware of. It uses not only budget gimmicks so that our \nfriends who support this bill can say that it extends the life of the \nMedicare trust fund for a few years, the problem is it doesn't solve \nthe fundamental imminent bankruptcy of Medicare. That is one of the \nreasons the bill sponsored by the distinguished majority leader creates \na new, unaccountable, unelectable board of bureaucrats to make further \ncuts to Medicare Programs.\n  After the Reid bill pillages Medicare for $\\1/2\\ trillion, as I said, \nto pay for a new entitlement, it creates a board of unelected, \nunaccountable bureaucrats, the so-called Medicare advisory board, which \nsounds pretty innocuous, but they have been given tremendous power--to \nmeet budget targets--another $23 billion in the first years alone.\n  If Congress doesn't substitute those cuts with other cuts to \nproviders or benefits, the board's Medicare cuts would go into effect \nautomatically. That would mean Medicare patients, physicians, \nhospitals, and everyone else who depends on Medicare would have no say \nin what happens to personal medical decisions because they would just \nbe cut and shut down by this unelected, appointed board.\n  The government-charted boards of experts we have in existence today \nare not always right. We may remember the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, so-called MedPAC, which was created by Congress in 1997, \nhas recommended more than $200 billion in cost cuts in the last year \nalone that Congress has not seen fit to order. In other words, this \nMedPAC board makes recommendations, and Congress is then left with the \noption in its wisdom to act to make those cuts. Congress has said no to \nthe tune of $200 billion in the last year alone.\n  Then there is another relatively notorious board of experts--\nunaccountable, faceless, nameless bureaucrats--that we have learned a \nlittle bit about in the last few days: the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force. They are supposed to recommend preventive services but just \nrecently said that women under the age of 50 do not need a mammogram to \nscreen for breast cancer. Respected organizations, such as the American \nCancer Society and the Komen Advocacy Alliance, disagree based on their \nown rigorous review of the latest medical evidence.\n  As the father of two daughters, I can tell you, I do not want my wife \nor my daughters restricted in their access to diagnostic tests that may \nsave their lives if their doctor recommends, in his or her best medical \njudgment, that they get those tests. Yet what we will have in the \nfuture, if the medical advisory board is passed, is an unelected, \nunaccountable board of bureaucrats\n\n[[Page S12113]]\n\nthat can make cuts, based on expert advice, which will ultimately limit \naccess to diagnostic tests, including tests such as mammograms, which \nbecame very controversial. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \ncame out immediately and said: We will never allow that to go into \neffect.\n  Not even the Secretary of Health and Human Services, under this \nprovision, could reverse the decision of this unelected, unaccounted \nboard which may well--I would say probably will in some cases--limit a \nperson's access to diagnostic tests and procedures that could save \ntheir life even though their personal physician, in consultation with \nthat patient, may say: This is what you need. When you give that power \nto the government, not only to render expert advice but then to decide \nwhether to pay or not to pay for a procedure, then the government--\nnamely, some bureaucrat in Washington, DC--is going to make the \ndecisions based on a cost-benefit analysis.\n  OK, on a cost analysis, we can afford, according to the decision of \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, to lose women to breast \ncancer--women between the age of 40 and 49--because we don't think they \nneed a mammogram. And on a cost-benefit analysis, they may say: Tough \nluck. But that is not where we should go with this legislation.\n  Many health care providers are concerned about the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission. According to a letter from 20 medical speciality \ngroups, they said:\n\n       We are writing today to reiterate our serious concerns with \n     several provisions that were included in the health care \n     reform bill . . . and to let you know that if these concerns \n     are not adequately addressed when the health care reform \n     package is brought to the Senate floor, we will have no other \n     choice but to oppose the bill.\n\n  Included in those concerns was the ``establishment of an Independent \nMedicare Commission whose recommendations could become law without \ncongressional action . . . ''\n  According to a letter from the American Medical Association today:\n\n       AMA policy specifically opposes any provision that would \n     empower an independent commission to mandate payment cuts for \n     physicians. . . . Further, the provision does not apply \n     equally to all health care stakeholders, and for the first \n     four years significant portions of the Medicare program would \n     be walled off for savings . . .\n\n  This is an example of another trade association that basically \ndecided to cut a deal with the administration behind closed doors, and \nthey have been prevented from some of these cuts under this Medicare \nCommission while physicians have not been accorded similar treatment, \nand they do not think it is fair. They think it is unfair, and I agree \nwith them.\n  This letter goes on to say:\n\n       In addition, Medicare spending targets must reflect \n     appropriate increases in volume that may be a result of \n     policy changes, innovations that improve care, greater \n     longevity, and unanticipated spending for such things as \n     influenza pandemics. These are critical issues with the \n     potential for significant adverse consequences for the \n     program, which must be properly addressed through a \n     transparent process that allows for notice and comment.\n\n  Sounds to me as if the American Medical Association thinks this is a \nlousy idea, and I agree with them.\n  Artificial budget targets that the Medicare advisory board would have \nto meet leave virtually no room for medical innovation. It is \nunbelievable what medical science in America and across the world has \ndone to increase people's quality of life--their longevity as a result \nof heart disease, for example. People who would have died in the \nseventies are today living healthy because they are taking prescription \nmedications to keep their cholesterol in check, and they have access to \ninnovative surgical procedures, such as stents and other things that \ncan not only improve their quality of life but their longevity as well.\n  If we have the Medicare advisory board saying: We are not going to \npay for some of these things, it will crush medical innovation and have \na direct impact on quality of life and longevity. What if we find a \ncure for Alzheimer's in 2020, but because this board says: It is too \nexpensive, we are not going to pay for it, you are out of luck. What if \nthere are things we cannot anticipate today, which we know there will \nbe because who ever heard of the H1N1 virus or swine flu just a year \nago?\n  Some of my colleagues have said an ``independent board,'' such as the \nMedicare advisory board, would insulate health care payment decisions \nfrom politics. But the very charter of the Medicare advisory board was \nthe result of a deal cut behind closed doors with the White House, a \npolitical deal, and it has a lot of reasons why, as we can tell, I \ndon't think it is going to work well.\n  According to Congress Daily:\n\n       Hospitals would be exempt from the [board's] ax, according \n     to the committee staff and hospital representatives, because \n     they already negotiated a cost-cutting agreement with [the \n     chairman of the Finance Committee] and the White House. \n     ``It's something that we worked out with the committee, which \n     considered our sacrifices,'' said Richard Coorsh, spokesman \n     for the Federation of American Hospitals. A committee aide \n     and a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association \n     reiterated that hospitals received a pass--\n\n  They were protected from 4 years of cuts--\n\n     based on the $155 billion cost-cutting deal already in place.\n\n  Is that the kind of politics we want to encourage behind closed \ndoors--deals cut to protect one sector of the health care industry and \nsacrifice another while denying people access to health care? That is \nthe kind of politics I would think we would want to avoid.\n  The truth is, the Reid bill gives more control over personal health \ndecisions to Washington, DC, where politics will always play a role in \ndetermining winners and losers when the government is in control \nbecause people are going to come to see their Members of Congress and \nsay: Will you help us? We are your constituents. And Members of \nCongress are always going to try to be responsive, if they can, within \nthe bounds of ethics to their constituents.\n  This needs to be not a process that is dictated by politics but on \nthe merits and on the basis of preserving the sacred doctor-patient \nrelationship. If we really want to insulate health care from politics, \nwe need to give more control to patients--to patients, to families, to \nmothers and fathers, sons and daughters--to make health care decisions \nin consultation with their physician, not nameless, faceless, \nunaccountable bureaucrats.\n  I filed an amendment to completely strike the Medicare advisory board \nfrom the Reid bill. I urge my colleagues to support it at the \nappropriate time. The Medicare advisory board empowers bureaucrats to \nmake personal medical decisions instead of patients, whose power to \ndetermine their own future, in consultation with their doctor, we ought \nto be preserving.\n  The Medicare advisory board is an attempt to justify the $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion pillaging of Medicare from America's seniors to create a new \nentitlement program. We should fix Medicare's nearly $38 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities, not steal from a program that is already \nscheduled to go insolvent in 2017.\n  At a time of insolvent entitlement programs, record budget deficits, \nand unsustainable national debt, this country simply cannot afford a \n$2.5 trillion spending binge on an ill-conceived Washington health care \ntakeover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it is the tradition in this body that a \nperson seeking recognition gets recognized, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is, and I say the Senator from California \nwas here earlier.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might, Madam President, my understanding was we \nalternate, go from side to side. I have been sitting here waiting.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of remarks of the Senator from California, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I admire the Senator's gentility. I \nthank him very much.\n  I rise to say a few words on behalf of the Mikulski amendment, but \nbefore I do, I wish to make a generic statement.\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\n  Those of us who are women have essentially had to fight for virtually \neverything we have received. When this Nation was founded, women could \nnot inherit property and women could not receive a higher education. In \nfact, for over half this Nation's life, women could not vote. It was \nnot until 1920, after perseverance and demonstrating, that women \nachieved the right to vote. Women could not serve in battle in the \nmilitary, and today we now have the first female general. So it has all \nbeen a fight.\n  Senator Mikulski and Senator Boxer in the House in the 1980s carried \nthis fight. Those of us in the 1990s who came here added to it. You, \nMadam President, have added to it in your remarks earlier. The battle \nis over whether women have adequate prevention services provided by \nthis bill. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Boxer for their \nleadership and for their perseverance and their willingness to discuss \nthe importance of preventive health care for women. Also, I thank \nSenator Shaheen, Senator Murray, and Senator Gillibrand, joined by \nSenators Harkin, Cardin, Dodd, and others, for coming to the floor and \nhelping women with this battle.\n  The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these \nneeds often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend \n68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most \npeople don't know that, but it is actually true. So we believe all \nwomen--all women--should have access to the same affordable preventive \nhealth care services as women who serve in Congress, no question. The \namendment offered by Senator Mikulski--and she is a champion for us--\nwill ensure that is, in fact, the case. It will require insurance plans \nto cover at no cost basic preventive services and screenings for women. \nThis may include mammograms, Pap smears, family planning, screenings to \ndetect postpartum depression, and other annual women's health \nscreenings. In other words, the amendment increases access to the basic \nservices that are a part of every woman's health care needs at some \npoint in her life.\n  Let me address one point because there is a side-by-side amendment \nsubmitted by the Senator from Alaska. Nothing in our bill would address \nabortion coverage. Abortion has never been defined as a preventive \nservice. The amendment could expand access to family planning \nservices--the type of care women need to avoid abortions in the first \nplace.\n\n  As I mentioned, the Senator from Alaska has offered an alternative \nversion of this proposal. But regardless of the merits or problems with \nher proposal, it remains a kind of budget buster. According to the CBO, \nthe amendment would cost $30.6 billion over 10 years. Adopting this \namendment would require us to spend some of the surplus raised by the \nCLASS Act or some of the budget surpluses in the bill. The underlying \nbill, as written, reduces the budget deficit by $130 billion in the \nfirst 10 years and as much as $650 billion in the second 10 years. This \nis a very important thing, in my view, and we need to maintain these \nsavings. The Mikulski amendment would do that. It costs $940 million \nover 10 years as opposed to the $24 billion to $30 billion in the \nMurkowski amendment.\n  The Mikulski amendment is, I believe, the best way to expand access \nto preventive care for women, while keeping this bill fiscally \nresponsible.\n  We often like to think of the United States as a world leader in \nhealth care, with the best and the most efficient system. But the facts \nactually do not bear this out. The United States spends more per capita \non health care than other industrialized nations but in fact has worse \nresults. According to the Commonwealth Fund, the United States ranks \nNo. 15 in avoidable mortality. That means avoidable death. This \nanalysis measures how many people in each country survive a potentially \nfatal yet treatable medical condition. The United States lags behind \nFrance, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Australia, Canada, and several \nother nations.\n  According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \nNo. 24 in the world in healthy life expectancy. This term measures how \nmany years a person can expect to live at full health--robust health. \nThe United States again trails Japan, Australia, France, Sweden, and \nmany other countries.\n  These statistics show we are not spending our health care resources \nwisely. The system is failing to identify and treat people with \nconditions early on that can be controlled. Part of the answer, without \nquestion, is expanding coverage. Too many Americans cannot afford basic \nhealth care because they lack basic health insurance. But another piece \nof the puzzle is ensuring this coverage provides affordable access to \npreventive care--the ability to be screened early--and that is what the \nMikulski amendment will accomplish.\n  Women need preventive care--screenings and tests--so that potentially \nserious or fatal illnesses can be found early and treated effectively. \nWe all know individuals who have benefitted from this type of care--a \nmammogram that suddenly identifies an early cancer before it has spread \nor before it has metastasized; a Pap smear that finds precancerous \ncells that can be removed before they progress to cancer and cause \nserious health problems; cholesterol testing or a blood pressure \nreading that suggests a person might have cardiovascular disease which \ncan be controlled with medication or lifestyle changes. This is how \nhealth care should work--a problem found early and addressed early. The \nMikulski amendment will give women more access to this type of \npreventive care.\n  Statistics about life expectancy and avoidable mortality can make it \neasy to forget that we are talking about real patients and real people \nwho die too young because they lack access to health care. Physicians \nfor Reproductive Choice and Health shared the following story, which \ncomes from Dr. William Leininger in California, and here is what he \nsays:\n\n       In my last year of residency, I cared for a mother of two \n     who had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23. At \n     that time, she was covered by her husband's insurance, but it \n     was an abusive relationship and she lost her health insurance \n     when they divorced. For the next 5 years, she had no health \n     insurance and never received follow-up care, which would have \n     revealed that her cancer had returned. She eventually \n     remarried and regained health insurance, but by the time she \n     came back to see me, her cancer had spread. She had two \n     children from her previous marriage, and her driving \n     motivation during her last rounds of palliative care was to \n     survive long enough to ensure that her abusive ex-husband \n     wouldn't gain custody of her children after her death. She \n     succeeded. She was 28 years old when she died.\n\n  Cases like these explain why the United States trails behind much of \nthe industrialized world in life expectancy. For this woman, divorce \nmeant the loss of her health coverage, which meant she could not afford \nfollowup care to address her cancer--a type of cancer that is often \ncurable if found early. And that is where prevention comes in. So this \ntragic story illustrates the need to improve our system so women can \nstill afford health insurance after they divorce or lose their jobs. \nAnd it shows why health reform must adequately cover all the preventive \nservices women need to stay healthy.\n  The Mikulski amendment is a fight--I am surprised, but it is a \nfight--but it will help expand access to preventive care while keeping \nthe bill fiscally responsible. To me, it is a no-brainer. If you can \nprevent illness, you should. In and of itself it will end up being a \ncost savings. So I have a very difficult time understanding why the \nother side of the aisle won't accept a measure that is more fiscally \nresponsible by far than their measure, will do the job, and will give \nwomen preventive care and begin to change that statistic which shows \nthat, among other nations, we do so badly.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for coming to the floor and speaking \nout on this, and I hope there are enough people in this body who \nrecognize that virtually everything women have gotten in history has \nbeen the product of a fight, and this is one of those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nRepublican speaker be the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point I rise to speak generally \nabout\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nthe bill and specifically about this Medicare proposal--the proposal in \nthe bill and the motion that has been offered by Senator McCain, which \nI think is an excellent idea.\n  Let's start with the size of this bill. It is unusual that we would \nbe considering a bill of this size and not have had more time to take a \nlook at it, but the bill itself--and I am glad that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee has essentially agreed with this earlier today--costs \n$2.5 trillion when it is fully implemented--$2.5 trillion. When my \nbudget staff took a look at this bill--and we only had a brief time to \ndo it, obviously, last week--and came up with that number, people on \nthe other side of the aisle said, regrettably: No, that is a bogus \nnumber. The number is $840 billion, it is not a $2.5 trillion bill. \nHowever, it is $2.5 trillion when it is fully implemented. When the \nprogrammatic activity of this bill is under full steam, over a 10-year \nperiod, it will cost over $2.5 trillion. That is huge--huge.\n  In an earlier colloquy, I heard the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--who does such a good job as chairman--make the point: Well, \nit is fully paid for. It is fully paid for in each 10-year period. That \nis true, literally. I give him credit for that. But two questions are \nraised by that fact. The first is this: Why would you expand the \nFederal Government by $2.5 trillion when we can't afford the government \nwe have?\n\n  The resources that are being used to pay for this, should they ever \ncome to fruition, are resources which should probably be used to make \nMedicare solvent or more solvent or, alternatively, to reduce our debt \nand deficit situation, as we confront it as a nation. We know for a \nfact that every year for the next 10 years--even before this bill is \nput in place--we are going to run a $1 trillion deficit every year, \nbecause that is what President Obama has suggested. We know for a fact \nthat our public debt is going to go from 35 percent of our gross \nnational product up to 80 percent of our gross national product within \nthe next 6 years without this bill being passed. We know we are in a \nposition where we are headed down a road which is basically going to \nhand to our children a nation that is fiscally insolvent because of the \namount of debt put on their back by our generation through spending and \nnot paying for it.\n  So why would we increase the government now by another $2.5 trillion \nwhen we can't afford the government we have? That is the question I \nthink we have to ask ourselves. Isn't there a better way to try to \naddress the issue of health care reform without this massive expansion \nof a new entitlement--creating a brandnew entitlement which is going to \ncost such an extraordinary amount of money and dramatically expand \nMedicaid, which is where most of the spending comes from in this bill--\na massive expansion of Medicaid and a massive new entitlement created \nthat we don't have today?\n  This bill, when it is fully implemented, will take the size of the \nFederal Government from about 20 percent of GDP or a little less--where \nit has historically been ever since the post-World War II period--up to \nabout 24 or 25 percent of GDP. To accomplish that, and claim you are \nnot going to increase the deficit, requires a real leap of faith. \nBecause it means that to pay for this--and this is why the McCain \nmotion is so important--you are going to have to reduce Medicare \nspending by $1 trillion, when this bill is fully implemented--$1 \ntrillion over a 10-year window. In fact, during the period from 2010 to \n2029, Medicare spending will be reduced in this bill by $3 trillion.\n  Those dollars will not be used to make Medicare more solvent. And we \nknow we have serious problems with Medicare. Those dollars will be used \nto create a brandnew entitlement and to dramatically increase the size \nof government for people who do not pay into the hospital insurance \nfund; for people who have not paid Medicare taxes, for the most part \nbut, rather, for a whole new population of people going under expanded \nMedicaid and people getting this new entitlement under the public plan. \nSo if you are going to reduce Medicare spending in the first 10 years \nby $450 billion, and the second 10 years fully implemented--there is \nsome overlap there, but fully implemented $1 trillion, and then over a \n19-year period, the two decades, by $3 trillion, instead of using those \nmonies--those seniors' dollars--to try to make Medicare more solvent, \nthey are going to be used for the purposes of expanding and creating a \nnew entitlement and expanding Medicaid.\n  This is hard to accept as either being fair to our senior population \nor being good policy from a fiscal standpoint. Why is that? Because if \nwe look at the Medicare situation, we know Medicare as it is structured \ntoday has an unfunded liability of $55 trillion--$55 trillion. That \nmeans in the Medicare system we do not know how we are going to pay $55 \ntrillion worth of benefits we know we are now obligated for.\n  The answer we get from the other side of the aisle is: Well, this $55 \ntrillion number goes down, because this bill cuts Medicare and, \ntherefore, the benefit structure reduces. But do the revenues, or the \nreduction in that, go toward the purpose of making Medicare more \nsolvent? No. Those monies are taken and spent. Those monies are taken \nand used to create a larger government. They aren't used to reduce the \ndeficit or to reduce the debt, all of which is being driven, in large \npart, by this $55 trillion worth of unfunded liability as we go \nforward. No, they are being used to create a brandnew entitlement which \nhas nothing to do with seniors, and a brandnew entitlement which is \ngoing to be paid for, in large part, by seniors, or by a reduction in \ntheir benefit structure.\n  That makes very little sense, because essentially you are taking \nmoney out of the Medicare system and using it to expand the government, \nwhen in fact what we should be doing, if you are going to take money \nout of the Medicare system, is you should be using it to reduce the \nobligations of the government--the debt obligation--so the Medicare \nsystem becomes more affordable. That is not the goal here, however.\n  Then, of course, there is the practical aspect of this. We know these \ntypes of proposals are plug numbers to a great degree, because we know \nthis Congress is not going to stand up to a $\\1/2\\ trillion cut in \nMedicare over the next 10 years and a $3 trillion cut in Medicare over \nthe next 20 years. Why do we know that? I know it from personal \nexperience. I was chairman of the Budget Committee the last time we \ntried to address the fact that we have an outyear liability in Medicare \nthat is not affordable--this $55 trillion number. We know it is not \naffordable. We know we have to do something about it. So I suggested, \nwhen I was chairman of the Budget Committee, that we reduce Medicare \nspending, or its rate of growth--not actual spending, its rate of \ngrowth--by $10 billion over a 5-year period, less than 1 percent of \nMedicare spending. My suggestion was that we do that by requiring--\nprimarily we get most of that money by requiring senior citizens who \nare wealthy to pay a reasonable proportion of their Part D premium and \nthen take those moneys and basically try to make Medicare a little more \nsolvent with it. We got no votes from the other side of the aisle--\nnone, zero--on that proposal.\n\n  Now they come forward with a representation that they are going to \nreduce Medicare spending and benefits to seniors by $3 trillion over \nthe next 20 years and $400-some-odd billion over the next 10 years, and \nthey expect this to be taken seriously? Of course not. This is all \ngoing to end up being unpaid-for expenditures in expansion of these \nprograms.\n  These brandnew entitlements that are being put in this bill and this \nexpansion of other entitlements that do not deal with Medicare, by the \nway, are going to end up being in large part paid for by creating more \ndebt and passing it on to our children. As I mentioned earlier, that is \na fairly big problem for our kids. They are going to get a country, as \nit is today, that has about $70 trillion in unfunded liability just in \nthe Medicare and Medicaid accounts, to say nothing of the other \ndeficits we are running up around here. Now we are going to throw \nanother huge amount on their backs.\n  Some percentage of this $2.5 trillion--probably a majority of it--\nwill end up being added to the deficit and debt as we move out into the \noutyears even though it is represented that it is not going to be. The \nonly way you can claim you are going to pay for this, of course, is \nwith these Medicare cuts and\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\nthese tax increases that are in this bill, and these fee increases. We \nare going to spend a little time on the tax increases and fee increases \nand the speciousness of those proposals, but right now we are focusing \non Medicare.\n  In any event, what we have is a bill that takes government and \nexplodes its size. We already have a government that is pretty big--20 \npercent of our economy. You are exploding it to 24 percent of our \neconomy, and then you are saying you are going to pay for that by \ndramatically reducing Medicare spending? It does not make any \nphilosophical sense, and it certainly does not pass the test of what \nhappens around here politically.\n  In addition, there is the issue of how this bill got to a score in \nthe first 10 years that made it look as if it was more fiscally \nresponsible. I have heard people from the other side. Again, I respect \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee for acknowledging that this bill, \nwhen fully implemented, is a $2.5 trillion bill. But a lot of folks are \nclaiming this is just an $843 billion bill, that is all it is in the \nfirst 10 years, that is all it costs. There are so many major budget \ngimmicks in this bill that accomplish that score that Bernie Madoff \nwould be embarrassed--embarrassed by what this bill does in the area of \ngamesmanship.\n  Let's start with the fact that it begins most of the fees, most of \nthe taxes, and most of the Medicare cuts in the first year of the 10 \nyears, but it does not begin the spending on the new program, the new \nentitlements, until the fourth and fifth year. So they are matching 4 \nand 5 years of spending against 10 years of income and Medicare cuts \nand claiming that therefore there is a balance.\n  Ironically, it is represented and rumored--and I admit this is a \nrumor--that originally they were going to start the spending in the \nthird year under this bill. Of course, nobody knew what the bill was \nbecause it was written in private and nobody got to see it. But then \nthey got a score from CBO that said it didn't work that way, so they \nsimply moved the spending back a year and started it in the fourth \nyear. They sent it back to CBO, and CBO said: If you take a year of \nspending out in the 10 years and you still have the 10 years of income \nfrom the taxes, fees, and cuts in Medicare, you get a better score. We \nwill give you a better score. You will get closer to balance. It is a \npretty outrageous little game of hide the pea under the shell.\n  This is probably the single biggest--in my experience, and I have \nbeen on the Budget Committee for quite a while--in my experience, it is \nthe single biggest gaming of the budget system I have ever seen around \nhere. But it is not the only one; there is something here called the \nCLASS Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for \npurposes of a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the current cost of our health care across the \nboard in this country, without this bill?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is about 16 to 17 percent of our gross national \nproduct.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is $2.5 trillion?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is saying they are going to add, if you \nextrapolate it out over another 10 years, $2.5 trillion.\n  Mr. GREGG. It takes the spending from 16 to 17 percent to about 20 \npercent of GDP.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I understand my colleague correctly, he is saying, to \nreach this outlandish figure of $843 billion, literally they do not \nimplement the program until 2014 and even beyond that to a degree, but \nthey do implement the tax increases?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Utah, of course, being a senior member of \nthe Finance Committee, is very familiar with those numbers, and that is \nabsolutely correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that one of the budget gimmicks my colleague is talking \nabout?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think that is the biggest in the context of what it \ngenerates in the way of Pyrrhic, nonexistent savings because it \nbasically says we are really not spending--because it doesn't fully \nimplement the plan in the first year, it says we are not spending that \nmuch money. In fact, we know that when the plan is fully implemented, \nit is a $2.45 trillion not a $840 billion bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Am I correct that the Democrats have said--and they seem \nto be unified on this bill--that literally this bill is budget neutral? \nBut as I understand it, in order to get to the budget neutrality, they \nare socking it to a program that has about $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities called Medicare--to the tune of almost $500 billion or $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in order to pay for this? Am I correct on that? No. 2, who \nis going to lose out when they start taking $500 billion out of \nMedicare? And what are they going to do with that $500 billion? Are \nthey going to put it into something else? Are they using this just as a \nbudgetary gimmick? What is happening here? As the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee today, you really could help all of us understand this \nbetter.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. If I can first answer the question of the Senator from \nUtah, and then I will be happy to answer the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The Senator from Utah basically is correct in his assumption. \nEssentially, they are claiming an approximately $400-some-odd billion \nsavings in Medicare over 10 years which they are then using to finance \nthe spending in this bill over the last 5 years, 5 to 6 years of the \n10-year window. In the end, after you fully implement this bill and you \nfully implement the Medicare cuts, it represents $3 trillion of \nMedicare reductions over a 20-year period.\n  Where does it come from? It comes from two different accounts, \nprimarily. One is, just about anybody who is on Medicare Advantage \ntoday--about 25 percent of those people will probably completely lose \ntheir Medicare Advantage insurance, and it is 12,000 people in New \nHampshire, so say 4,000 people.\n  Mr. HATCH. How many people on Medicare are on Medicare Advantage?\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe 11 million people.\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be what percentage of people on Medicare?\n  Mr. GREGG. About 25 percent of those people will lose their Medicare \ninsurance under this proposal, mostly in rural areas. And second, \nbecause there is $160 billion of savings scored. You can't save that \ntype of money in Medicare Advantage unless people don't get the \nMedicare Advantage advantage.\n\n  Second, it comes in significant reductions in provider payments. How \ndo provider payments get paid for when they are cut, I ask the Senator \nfrom Utah. I suspect it is because less health care is provided.\n  Mr. HATCH. How does that affect the doctors?\n  Mr. GREGG. It certainly affects the hospitals, and it probably \naffects the doctors. I have heard the Senator from Montana say they are \ngoing to straighten out the doctor problem down the road, but that is \nanother $250 billion of spending which we don't know where they are \ngoing to get the money from. But, yes, it would affect, in my opinion, \nall providers--doctors, hospitals, and other people who provide health \ncare to seniors. You cannot take $450 billion out of the Medicare \nsystem and not affect people's Medicare.\n  Mr. HATCH. Am I wrong in saying Medicare is already headed toward \ninsolvency and that it has up to almost $38 trillion in unfunded \nliability over the years for our young people to have to pay for?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Utah is correct again. The Medicare \nsystem is headed toward insolvency, and it goes cash-negative in 2013, \nI believe--maybe it is 2012--in the sense that it is paying out less \nthan it takes in, and it has an unfunded liability that exceeds, \nactually, $38 trillion now. I think it is up around----\n  Mr. HATCH. Then how can our friends on the other side take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion out of Medicare, which is headed toward insolvency, to use for \nsome programs they want to now institute anew?\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Utah has asked one of the core \nquestions about this bill. Why would you use Medicare savings, \nreductions in Medicare benefits, which will definitely affect \nrecipients, for the purposes of creating a new program rather than for \nthe purposes of making health care more solvent if you are going to do \nthat in the first place? And are these savings ever going to really \ncome about? One wonders about that also.\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I heard someone say today on the floor--I don't know who \nit was, I can't remember--that Medicare Advantage really isn't part of \nMedicare. Is that true?\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, I would yield to the Senator from Utah on that \nissue--not the floor but yield on that question because I think the \nSenator from Utah was there when Medicare Advantage was drafted as a \nlaw.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was there in the Medicare modernization conference, \nalong with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, \nand others, when we did that because we were not getting health care to \nrural America. The Medicare+Choice plan didn't work. Doctors would not \ntake patients. Hospitals could not pay; they could not take patients. \nThere were all kinds of difficulties in rural America. So we did \nMedicare Advantage, and all of a sudden we were able to take care of \nthose people. Yes, it costs a little more, but that is because we went \ninto the rural areas to do it.\n  But this would basically decimate Medicare Advantage, wouldn't it, \nwhat is being proposed here? And that is part of Medicare.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe it is a legal part of Medicare, Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Mr. HATCH. No question about it.\n  Mr. GREGG. And this would have a massively disruptive effect on \npeople who get Medicare Advantage because you are going to reduce it--\nthe scoring is there will be a reduction in Medicare Advantage payments \nof approximately $162 billion, I believe it is, and there is no way you \nare going to keep getting the advantages of Medicare Advantage if you \nhave that type of reduction in payments.\n  Mr. HATCH. How can they take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare? That is \nnot all Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is only part of that, \nthe deductions they will make there. But how can they do that and still \nrun Medicare in a solvent, constructive, decent, and honorable fashion?\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will allow me to respond, the problem here \nis we have rolled the Medicare issue into this major health reform \nbill--or the other side has--and they have used Medicare as a piggy \nbank for the purposes of trying to create a brandnew entitlement which \nhas nothing to do with senior citizens. Yes, Medicare needs to be \naddressed. It needs to be reformed. The benefit structure probably has \nto be reformed. But we should not use those dollars for the purposes of \nexpanding the government with a brandnew entitlement. We should use \nthose dollars to shore up Medicare so we don't have this massive \ninsolvency.\n  Mr. HATCH. You mean they are not using this $500 billion to shore up \nMedicare and to help it during this period of possible insolvency with \na $38 trillion unfunded liability? They are not using it for that \npurpose?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. For what purpose are they using it?\n  Mr. GREGG. They are using to fund the underlying bill, and the \nunderlying bill expands a variety of initiatives in the area of \nMedicaid and in the area of a brandnew entitlement for people who are \nuninsured to subsidize the government plan.\n  Mr. HATCH. You were going to talk about the CLASS Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. The CLASS Act is another classic gimmick of budgetary \nshenanigans which I would like to speak to, briefly. I know the Senator \nfrom Montana had a question or maybe he has gone past that point and we \nhave answered all his questions. I can move on to the CLASS Act.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to hear you talk about the CLASS Act. I am \nno fan of the CLASS Act myself so why don't you proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his forthrightness on that. The \nCLASS Act needs to be explained. It is a great title. We come up with \nthese wonderful ``motherhood of titles.'' We attach them to things and \nthen suddenly they take on a persona that has no relationship to what \nthey actually do. The CLASS Act is a long-term care insurance program \nwhich will be government run. It is another takeover of private sector \nactivity by the Federal Government. But what is extraordinarily \nirresponsible in this bill is, we all know in long-term care insurance \nthat you buy it when you are in your thirties and your forties. You \nprobably don't buy it when you are in your twenties. You buy it in your \nthirties, forties, and fifties. You start paying in premiums then. But \nyou don't take the benefits. The cost of those insurance products don't \nincur to the insurer until people actually go into the retirement home \nsituation, which is in their late sixties and seventies, most likely \neighties in our culture today, where many people are working well into \ntheir seventies. So there is a large period of people paying in, and \nthen 30 or 40 years later, they start to take out.\n  What has happened in this bill, which is a classic Ponzi scheme--in \nfact, ironically, the chairman of the Budget Committee did call it a \nPonzi scheme, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad--they are \nscoring these years when people are paying into this new program and, \nbecause the program doesn't exist, everybody who pays into it, starting \nwith day one, the beneficiaries of that program aren't going to occur \nuntil probably 30 or 40 years later. They are taking all the money that \nis paid in when people are in their thirties, forties, fifties, and \nsixties as premiums. They are taking that money and they are scoring it \nas revenue under this bill and they are spending it on other \nprogrammatic initiatives for the purposes of claiming the bill is \nbalanced. It adds up to about $212 billion over that 20-year period, \n2010 to 2029.\n  OK. So you spend all the premium money. What happens when these \npeople do go into the nursing home, do require long-term care when they \nbecome 75, 80, 90 years old? There is no money. It has been spent. It \nhas been spent on something else, on a new entitlement, on expanding \ncare to people under Medicaid, on whatever the bill has in it. So we \nare going to have this huge bill that is going to come due to our kids \none more time. We already are sticking them with $12 trillion of debt \nright now, and we are going to raise the debt ceiling, sometime in the \nnext month, to, I don't know what it is going to be, but I have heard \nrumors it may be as high as 13 more trillion. We know we have another \n$9 trillion of debt coming at us just by the budgets projected for the \nnext 10 years. Now we are going to, 30 years from now, have this huge \nbill come in as the people who decided to buy into the CLASS Act \nsuddenly go into the retirement home. There will not be any money there \nfor them. It is gone. It will have been spent by a prior generation to \nmake this bill balanced.\n  The CLASS Act has been described as a Ponzi scheme relative to its \neffect on the budget. It is using dollars which should be segregated \nand protected under an insurance program. If this were an insurance \ncompany, for example, they would actually have to invest those dollars \nin something that would be an asset which would be available to pay for \nthe person when they go into the nursing home so they are actuarially \nsound. But that is not what happens under this bill. Under this bill, \nthose dollars go out the door as soon as they come in for the purposes \nof representing that this bill is in fiscal balance. It is not. It is \nnot in fiscal balance, obviously.\n  Even if you were to accept these incredible activities of budgetary \ngimmickry, the fundamental problem with this bill is it grows the \ngovernment by $2.5 trillion, and we can't afford that when we already \nhave a government that well exceeds our capacity to pay for it. \nInevitably, we will pass on to these young pages, as they go into their \nearning careers and raise their families, a government that is so \nexpensive, they will be unable to buy a home, send their kids to \ncollege or do the things they wish to do that give one a quality of \nlife.\n  I have certainly taken more than my fair share of time at this point. \nThe Senator from Louisiana was going to go next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has been a very interesting discussion, \nlistening to the Senator from New Hampshire. Several points. One, the \nunderlying bill is clearly not a net increase in government spending on \nhealth care. The numbers are bandied about by those on the other side--\n$1 trillion, $2.5 trillion, et cetera. I do acknowledge and thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire for saying, yes, it is all paid for. He did \nsay that. He did agree this is all paid for. So I just hope when other \nSenators on that side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\nstart talking about this big cost, $1 trillion, $2 trillion, whatever, \nthat they do admit it is paid for. The ranking member of the Senate \nBudget Committee flatly said: Yes, it is all paid for. I would hope \nother Members on that side of the aisle heed the statement of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, for saying it is all paid for.\n  But don't take my word for it or his word. It is what the CBO says. \nIn fact, let me quote from a letter to Senator Reid not too long ago:\n\n       The CBO expects that during the decade following the 10-\n     year budget window, the increases and decreases in Federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care stemming from this \n     legislation would roughly balance out so that there would be \n     no significant change in that commitment.\n\n  That is, a commitment to health care, to government health care \nspending, no change basically. It is flat. Although it is a little \nbetter than flat because the subsequent CBO letter has said the \nunderlying bill achieves about $130 billion in deficit reduction over \n10 years and one-quarter of a percent of GDP reduction in the next 10 \nyears. The Senator from New Hampshire talks about large deficits this \ncountry is facing. That is true. Frankly, all of us in the Senate have \na responsibility to try to reduce that budget deficit as best and as \nreasonably as we possibly can. Bear in mind, this underlying health \ncare bill helps reduce the budget deficit. Sometimes people on the \nother side like to suggest that $1 trillion over 10 years will add to \nthe budget deficit. Again, we have definitely established it does not \nadd to the budget deficit at all, not one thin dime.\n\n  In addition, we actually reduce the budget deficit through health \ncare reform, through this underlying legislation. We all know the \nMedicare trust fund is in jeopardy, in part, because baby boomers are \nretiring more but also because health care costs are going up at such a \nrapid rate. That is health care costs for everybody. It is health care \ncosts for me, for every Senator, for every senior, for businesses. \nLet's not forget, we spend in America about 60 percent more per person \non health care than the next most expensive country, about 50 to 60 \npercent more per person. The trend is going in the wrong direction. We \nare going to spend about $33 trillion in America on health care over \nthe next 10 years. That is going to be somewhat evenly divided between \npublic expenditures and private. Every other country in the world has \nfigured out ways to limit the rate of growth of increase in health care \nspending. We haven't. We are the only industrialized country--in fact, \ndeveloping country--that hasn't figured out how to get some handle on \nthe rate of growth of increase in health care spending.\n  One could say: Gee, let's forget about it. Just let the present trend \ncontinue. We all bandy about different figures. One I am fond of at \nleast remembering is the average health care insurance policy in \nAmerica today costs about $13,000. If we do nothing over 8 years, it \nwill be $30,000. That is a much higher rate of increase than income for \nAmericans. It means the disparity between wages of the average American \nand what they are paying on health care will widen all the more if we \ndo nothing. We have to do something. This legislation is a good-faith \neffort to begin to get a handle on the rate of growth of spending in \nthis country.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was being honest, frankly. Some on the \nother side are being not quite so honest. He is basically saying: Yes, \nit is true we are not cutting beneficiary cuts, although he talks about \nMedicare Advantage. Let me point out that there is nothing in this \nlegislation that requires any reductions in any beneficiary cuts. In \nfact, guaranteed benefits under Medicare are expressly not to be cut \nunder the express language of this bill. The portion we are talking \nabout is Medicare Advantage. The fact is, there is nothing in this bill \nthat requires any cuts at all in Medicare Advantage payments. Those \nMedicare Advantage payments are in addition to the guaranteed Medicare \npayments, such as gym memberships, things such as that which are not \npart of traditional Medicare.\n  Why do I say there is nothing in there that requires cuts for those \nextras? That is because the decision on what benefits or what extras \nMedicare Advantage plans have to give the guaranteed benefits, that is \nby law. But the decision as to what extras should go to their members \nis a decision based not upon us in the government, in Congress, not \nupon the HHS Secretary; it is based on the corporate officers of these \ncompanies. They are overpaid, Medicare Advantage plans, right now. \nEverybody knows they are overpaid. Even they, privately, will tell you \nthey are overpaid. They are overpaid based upon legislation that \nCongress passed in 2003, the Medicare Part D, by setting these high \nbenchmarks. They are overpaid. The MedPAC commission also said they are \noverpaid to the tune of about between 14 and 18 percent. So the \nreductions that are provided for in this bill, in Medicare Advantage \nplans, the effect of those reductions is up to the officers of those \nplans.\n  They could cut premiums people otherwise pay. They could cut benefits \nto help themselves, help their salaries. They could cut stockholders. \nThey could cut administrative costs.\n  They can decide what they want to do. That is solely a decision of \nthe executives of Medicare Advantage plans. Private insurance plans is \nwhat they are. They are private insurance plans, so there is nothing \nhere that says the fringes, the extras, have to be cut at all. Those \nexecutives could keep those fringes and maybe have a little less return \nto their stockholders or maybe make some savings in their \nadministrative costs, maybe not increase their salaries. There is \nnothing here that requires those fringes, those extras, to be cut, \nnothing whatsoever.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says: Oh, it is about $400 billion to \n$500 billion of reduced payments to providers in this legislation. That \nis true. Well, let's look and see what the consequences of that are. \nFirst of all, that means the Medicare trust fund's solvency is \nextended. It is more flush with cash. I would think all Senators here \nwould like to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund. A good way to \ndo that is by what we are doing in this bill, saving about $450 billion \nover 10 years that otherwise would be paid to Medicare providers is not \nbeing paid, and those benefits inure to the trust fund.\n  There is no dispute--none whatsoever--that this legislation extends \nthe life of the Medicare trust fund by another 5 years. That is because \nof those changes in the structure and also because there are no cuts in \nbenefits. There are no cuts in benefits, I say to Senators. Although \nsometimes Senators on that side of the aisle like to either say or \nstrongly imply there are cuts in benefits, there are no cuts in \nbenefits. There are no cuts in the guaranteed benefits with the basic \nbenefits, and there are no required cuts for the fringes or the extras \nbecause the officers can make that decision not to cut, if they want \nto. That is their choice, as I have explained a few minutes ago.\n  Let's look to see what the other side proposed not too many years ago \nback in 1997. They proposed cutting the Medicare benefit structure, \ncutting payments to providers, big time--big time. They proposed a \n12.4-percent cut to providers back in 1997, when they were in charge. \nThey did that in part to save the Medicare trust fund, to extend the \nlife of the Medicare trust fund.\n  I have a hard time understanding why back then it was a good thing to \ndo, which was about three times more of a cut--let's see, twice as \nheavy a cut to Medicare providers back then, in 1997, than it is today. \nNobody over there has explained why it was the right thing to do back \nthen but not the right thing to do today, when the goal is the same. \nThe goal is the same; that is, to extend the solvency of the trust \nfund.\n  One could say--I think the Senator from New Hampshire did say--well, \nlet's take those savings, which do extend the solvency of the trust \nfund, but not--he said--provide another program. I think he wants to \nuse that to cut the deficit. That is what I think he wants to do.\n  That is a very basic, fundamental, values question I think this \ncountry should face; that is, do we want to set up a system where \nvirtually all Americans have health insurance? We are the only \nindustrialized country in the world that does not have a system where \nits citizens have health insurance--the only industrialized country\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\nin the world. It is a very basic question. I think we should ask \nourselves as Americans: In every other industrialized country, health \ninsurance, health care is a right. That is the starting point. In every \nother country that has a health care system, health care is a right--\nthat everybody should have health care.\n  Of course, it is true, people are different. Some are tall, some are \nshort. Some are very athletically endowed, some are not. Some are \nsmart, some are not so smart. But health care does not care--that is a \nway to put it--whether you are dumb, smart, tall, skinny. It affects \neverybody; that is, diseases affect everybody, and everybody needs \nhealth care regardless of your station in life, regardless of your \nincome, regardless of whether you are an egghead, you are brilliant, or \nan athlete. It makes no difference whatsoever. We are Americans.\n  I frankly believe other countries on that point have it right; that \nis, that they treat all their citizens basically equally because \ndisease is indiscriminate--who is going to get disease--accidents are \nindiscriminate--who is going to get in an accident--and so forth. So we \ncould take this $400 billion, $500 billion and reduce the deficit with \nit and forget any health insurance coverage. That would be an option. \nThat is a legitimate question we could ask ourselves. I frankly think \nthe better choice is to take that $400 billion, $500 billion, which \ndoes extend the solvency of the trust fund, and help set up a way, help \nset up a system so all Americans have health insurance. We do it in a \nway that reduces the budget deficit. We do it in a way that reduces the \nbudget deficit in the first 10 years and also in the next 10 years.\n  I again repeat, if trimming the rate of growth of provider payments \nwas OK back in 1997--that was twice as much as today back then to \nextend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund--why isn't it OK today \nto do half as much to extend the life of the trust fund, in this case \nfor 5 more years, and at the same time help provide health insurance \nbenefits for people who deserve it?\n  Let's not forget, hospitals want us to do this. They want everyone to \nhave health insurance. Doctors want us to have a system where everybody \nhas health insurance, whether it is Medicaid or it is private health \ninsurance. All the providers want it. The pharmaceutical industry does, \nthe home health industry does, the hospice industry does. The durable \nmedical equipment manufacturers want it. They all want it because they \nknow it is the right thing to do. They also know they are not going to \nget hurt.\n  I heard some reference here that some HHS actuary, commenting on the \nHouse bill, said, oh, gee, it might scare providers and whatnot, but we \nactually got subsequent information which showed that letter--that \nactuary admitted it is extremely variable, what he came up with. There \nare lots of factors he did not take into consideration. I also have \nstatements from hospital administrators saying no way are they going to \nbe allowed.\n  In fact, let's remind ourselves of this: It was not too many weeks \nago, a couple months ago--remember that meeting--when all the health \ncare providers and the insurance industry went to the White House? They \nwere all over there. What did they pledge to President Obama to help \nget health care reform passed? That they would cut their reimbursements \nby $2 trillion over 10 years. They would cut. They agreed to cut their \npayments that Uncle Sam makes to them in the health care system by $2 \ntrillion over 10 years. It was widely reported in the papers.\n  What did we do in this bill? We reduced the rate of increase in \npayments to providers, not by $2 trillion, not by $1 trillion, less \nthan $\\1/2\\ trillion over that same 10-year period. So if they could \ncommit back then to $2 trillion, you would think, my gosh, this is a \nquarter of that. That is not too bad and not going to hurt anybody, and \nproviders are not going to be leaving.\n  I might add too, I have a letter from AARP to the majority leader \ndated today. It has been handed to me. In part it says:\n\n       The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on \n     provider reimbursement reforms. . . . Most importantly, the \n     legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  This is a letter today from the American Association of Retired \nPeople. I will re-read that portion. It is addressed to Senator Reid:\n\n       The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on \n     provider reimbursement reforms. . . .\n\n  And, man, we need about a week or so to talk about all the reforms in \nthis bill that are so important so we have a better health care system \nfocusing more on quality than we currently do in the United States \nsystem. Again:\n\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  In the letter they also say:\n\n       AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare through \n     smart, targeted changes aimed at improving health care \n     delivery, eliminating waste and inefficiency, and \n     aggressively weeding out fraud and abuse.\n\n  That is important. It is very important. I might add, too, that every \nperson today who pays a Part B premium--every American today--every \nsenior today who pays that quarter, that 25 percent of Part B today, \npays also for the waste that is in the system today, especially under \nPart B. So if we get the waste out, we also will be able to reduce that \nPart B premium payment that seniors have to pay too. I think that is a \ngood thing.\n  So the more you dig into this bill, the more you see the good \nfeatures. I do not think all the good features have been pointed out in \nthis bill. One of our jobs here is to point out what they are, so when \nthis legislation passes--mark my words, this legislation is going to be \nenacted. It is going to be enacted, I will not say exactly when, but \ncertainly, if not this month, it will be signed by the President either \nthis month or next month--then Americans are going to start to see: Oh, \ngee, there is a lot in there that is good. I didn't know about that. \nThat is good. I like that. It may not be perfect, but they started in \nthe right direction. That is pretty good. They are going to like it.\n  I hear all these references to polls around here, and that is because \nof all the confusion, in part. But once it is passed and people look to \nsee what is in it--they will look to see what is in it because that is \nthe law. They are forced to look to see what is in it because that is \nthe law.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may say: \nYes, when they look to see what is in it, they will see how bad it is. \nI disagree. That is not my view. My view is, the more this legislation \nis subjected to the light of day, the disinfectant of sunshine, which \nshows what is in this bill, the more people are going to say: Hey, that \nwas a good thing they did back then in December or January.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a very important \ntopic on the floor right now, along with the Medicare issue; that is, \npreventive screenings and services, particularly for women. I want to \nfocus on a very specific and important example of that, which is breast \ncancer screening through mammography, and also through the practice of \nself-examination.\n  This is very timely because 2 weeks ago, a U.S. government-endorsed \npanel issued new recommendations on this topic, which I believe, along \nwith tens of millions of Americans, is a major step in the wrong \ndirection. I think we need to focus on this recent action and talk \nabout this and fix it in the context of this health care reform debate.\n  What am I talking about? Well, on Tuesday, November 17--literally \njust a couple weeks ago--the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which \nis an official government-sanctioned body--a task force about \npreventive medicine--issued new recommendations regarding breast cancer \nscreening for women, including the use of mammography.\n  These new recommendations they came out with a couple weeks ago are a \nbig step backward, a big retrenchment in terms of what the current \nstate of knowledge is and what their previous recommendations were. \nTheir new recommendations, just out 2 weeks ago, do four things that \ntake a big step back on breast cancer screening.\n  No. 1, for women between the ages of 40 and 49, rather than get a \nroutine mammogram every 2 years to screen for breast cancer, the task \nforce said: Forget about that. We do not recommend that anymore. We \nstep back from that recommendation.\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\n  No. 2, for women aged 50 to 74, the previous recommendation was to \nget a routine mammogram to screen against breast cancer every year. The \ntask force, 2 weeks ago, stepped back from that and said: No, every \nother year is probably good enough. So not every year: every other \nyear.\n  No. 3, for women over the age of 75, the previous recommendation was \nto have routine screening at least every 2 years. The new \nrecommendation from the task force steps back from that and says: No, \nwe do not recommend routine screening over the age of 75.\n  And, No. 4, the task force 2 weeks ago said: We no longer recommend \nbreast self-examination by women to detect lumps to get treatment \nearly. We do not believe in that. We do not think the science is clear \non that. We step back from that.\n  Those are four huge changes in their previous recommendations. Those \nare four huge, new recommendations completely at odds with what I \nbelieve is the clear consensus in the medical community and the \ntreatment community.\n  When I first read about these new U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nrecommendations, around November 17, I had the immediate reaction I \njust enunciated, but I said: I am not an expert. I am not a doctor. I \nam not a medical expert. I want to hear from folks who are much closer \nto this crucial issue than me. So my wife and I convened a roundtable \ndiscussion in Baton Rouge, LA. We had it on Monday, November 23. It was \nat the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center. They were very kind to host it. \nIt was cohosted by Women's Hospital in Baton Rouge. We had a great \nroundtable discussion featuring a lot of different people, including \noncologists, other MDs, other medical experts, and including, maybe \nmost importantly, several breast cancer survivors who literally lived \nthrough this issue themselves. Those breast cancer survivors were all \nwomen who got breast cancer and had it detected relatively early, in \ntheir forties. So they are exactly the group of people these new \nrecommendations would work against because the new recommendations say \ndon't get regular mammography screening in your forties.\n\n  Again, I was interested in hearing from the real experts, both \nmedical experts and the survivors, what they thought about it. I wasn't \nvery surprised, quite frankly, when they all had exactly the same \nreaction I did to these new U.S. Preventive Service Task Force \nrecommendations. Everybody to a person said this is a big step \nbackward. This will make us move in the wrong direction. Increased \nscreening, early detection is a leading reason we are winning \nincreasingly the fight against breast cancer. It is a leading reason we \nare doing so much better in this fight.\n  In that one room at the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center, in a sense \nwe had a snapshot through history and proof of the great gains we have \nmade, including through early screening because, as I said, we had \nthese survivors, all a supercause for celebration: Folks who had \ndetected their cancer, most of them relatively early; all of them first \ngot it and detected it either in their forties or some in their \nthirties. Unfortunately, in the same room, we had a life experience on \nthe other end of the spectrum going back 40-plus years. That is my wife \nWendy who lost her mother to breast cancer when she was 6 years old. \nOne of the reasons is simple and straightforward and directly related \nto what we are talking about.\n  Back in the late 1960s when Wendy lost her mom to breast cancer there \nwasn't this same routine. There wasn't this emphasis on screening. \nThere wasn't the recommendation for annual mammograms. There wasn't the \neducational push for self-examination. There wasn't that focus, and \nbecause of that, far more women, tragically, including Wendy's mother, \ndied.\n  We have made huge progress since then. Again, the very life \nexperiences in that one room in Baton Rouge proved that. The medical \ndoctors and the oncologists, the other experts, as well as the breast \ncancer survivors, all made that point.\n  So I am standing on the Senate floor to urge us to take focused, \nspecific action to legislatively repeal any impact of these new \nrecommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued in \nNovember.\n  This topic is on the Senate floor. It is on the floor through the \nMikulski amendment. There is probably going to be a Republican \nalternative to that Mikulski amendment. My concern is, in terms of \neverything on the floor now, none of it directly, specifically takes \nback the impact of those new recommendations. I think that is the first \nmatter we should all come together on, 100 to nothing, on this topic.\n  We can have a broader debate. We can have differences about the best \napproach to prevention and screening. But the first concrete, focused \nthing we should do right now on the Senate floor today is come \ntogether, 100 to nothing, to legislatively overrule any impact of those \nnew recommendations. That is, again, what I have been hearing from \nexperts not just in Baton Rouge, not just in that one room, but across \nthe country; experts in terms of oncologists, other medical doctors, \nleaders of the cancer associations across the country and, perhaps most \nimportantly, breast cancer survivors. I daresay that is what every \nMember of this body has heard from their States since those new \nrecommendations came out around November 17.\n  So, again, whatever we do in this broader debate, I have a very \nsimple, basic, focused suggestion. Let's show the American people we \ncan come together around something on which I believe we all agree.\n  There is an expression: It is mom and apple pie. Well, this should be \nconsidered mom and apple pie because it is literally about mom and our \nwives and our daughters and, obviously, half the population. So let's \ncome together around this issue, and let's legislatively overrule any \nlegal impact, any legal consequence of these new task force \nrecommendations of the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force.\n  That is what my Vitter amendment, No. 2808, does. I had hoped the \namendments on the Senate floor on this general topic would do that \nalready. Unfortunately, the one that is pending now, at least the \nMikulski amendment, does not do that. In fact, in some ways it points \nto the new recommendations of the task force and holds up those new \nrecommendations. Our current law holds up the current recommendations. \nI think because the new recommendations they promulgated around \nNovember 17 are so egregious, such a bad idea, because the consensus \naround the country starting with experts and oncologists is so clear \nthat we should negate any impact of them. So, again, my Vitter \namendment No. 2808, which is currently filed as a second-degree \namendment to the Mikulski amendment, would do that.\n  Let me be perfectly clear and read my text because it is very short:\n\n       For the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any \n     other provision of law, the current recommendations of the \n     United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast \n     cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be \n     considered the most current other than those issued in or \n     around November 2009.\n\n  So what it does is simple. It says we are erasing, we are canceling \nout, any effect of those new recommendations made by the task force in \nand around November 2009. We are saying that never happened because the \nconsensus is so clear against it.\n  Again, I expected the Mikulski amendment to do that directly. It \ndoesn't do that. It does other things about prevention, which is fine. \nWe can debate those points. We can have a discussion about that. But I \nthink we need to all come together to absolutely, categorically, \nspecifically, legislatively take back, overrule these new \nrecommendations.\n  I am certainly eager to work with everyone in this body starting with \nSenator Mikulski, starting with Senator Murkowski, whom I believe may \noffer a Republican alternative to include this language. I hope this \nlanguage, which seems to me is a no-brainer given the consensus on the \ntopic, can be included in both of those amendments. It should be just \naccepted and included in the Mikulski amendment. It should be accepted \nand included in the Murkowski amendment. That would be my goal so that \nwhatever happens on these votes, we come together in a unified way. \nLiterally, it would in essence be 100 to nothing, to say: No, time out. \nThese new recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nfrom November of\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\nthis year are a huge step backwards, a huge mistake. That is what the \nexperts are saying. That is what oncologists are saying. That is what \ncancer specialists are saying. That is what leaders of cancer \nassociations are saying. That is what, perhaps most importantly, breast \ncancer survivors are saying.\n  We can look at history in this country in the last several decades \nand happily point to real progress in this fight. One of the causes of \nthat good news, that improvement since the late 1960s when my wife \nWendy's mom passed away from breast cancer, clearly one of the \nunderlying reasons, clearly one of the leading causes is dramatic \nimprovement in this prevention and screening, using mammography, also \neducating about self-examination.\n  So, again, I have this second-degree amendment. My hope and my goal \nwould be that this language, which should be noncontroversial, would be \naccepted on it, as well as any Republican alternative, and that \nwhatever happens in terms of those votes, we come together and make \ncrystal-clear that this task force of unelected bureaucrats--didn't \ninclude a single oncologist, by the way--made a big mistake and we are \ngoing to make sure those new recommendations don't have any impact in \nterms of law, in terms of government programs, in terms of legal impact \non insurance companies.\n  Again, I look forward to working with everyone on the floor, \nincluding Senator Mikulski, including Senator Murkowski and others to \npass this language. It should be a no-brainer. It is mom and apple pie. \nLet's pass it and at least in this focused way come together and do the \nright thing in direct reaction to something that just happened 2 weeks \nago.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate Senator Vitter's \nempathy for victims of breast cancer, for people who obviously should \nbe tested for breast cancer, in many cases more frequently than they \nare. I am sorry about Wendy's mother's death from breast cancer.\n  I think, though, that Senator Vitter missed the larger point. While \nmost of us in this Chamber disagree with the finding of that Bush-\nappointed commission--committee, commission, task force--I think the \nbigger question is that a whole lot of the status quo which Senator \nVitter has defended, sort of ad hominem, the bigger question is under \nthe status quo so many women aren't getting tested for breast cancer. \nIt is estimated that 4,000 breast cancer deaths could be prevented just \nby increasing the percentage of women who receive breast cancer \nscreening.\n  That is why the Mikulski amendment is so important. It is important \nbecause in this country today, if you take a group of 1,000 women who \nhave breast cancer and who have insurance, and 1,000 women who have \nbreast cancer who don't have insurance, those who don't have insurance \nare 40 percent more likely to die. So the issue is that committee--I \nthink that commission made a mistake. We pretty much, most of us here, \nthink that commission made a mistake. I am not sure why those people \nwhom President Bush put on the commission made the decision they did. \nIt should have been oncologists sitting; Senator Vitter is right about \nthat.\n  The larger point is that women without insurance don't get tested, \nand women without insurance are 40 percent more likely to die of breast \ncancer than those with insurance. At the same time, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, in the State of Maryland, women typically pay more for \ntheir insurance than men do on the average.\n  So if we are going to do this right, it means we need insurance \nreform, which is what this legislation does. No more preexisting \nconditions, no more men and women who have their insurance canceled \nbecause they got too sick last year and had too many expenses and the \ninsurance companies practiced rescission and they cut them off. No more \nif I have insurance and if I have a child born with a preexisting \ncondition do I lose my insurance.\n  I come to the floor pretty much every day reading letters from people \nin Ohio--from Galion and Girard and Gallipolis and Lima, all over my \nState. Typically, people were pretty happy with their insurance if they \nhad written me a year ago, these people. But today these people writing \nfound out their insurance doesn't cover what they thought it did. They \nend up losing their insurance because of a preexisting condition. They \ncan't get insurance because they once had breast cancer. They have had \nthis discrimination against them because of gender or geography or \ndisability. That is what is important about the bill and what is \nimportant about the Mikulski amendment.\n  That is why I would hope Senator Vitter, as he is pushing for \nassistance for women with breast cancer--I applaud him for that--would \ngo deeper than just dismissing the recommendations of one government \ncommission and that, in fact, he would advocate for better testing, \nmore frequent testing for women who are not getting tested often enough \ntoday, and that the rates for women would be comparable to the rates \nfor men. That is, again, why the Mikulski amendment is so important.\n  I will repeat: The health reform legislation as is will finally put \nan end to discrimination, discrimination that charges women \nsignificantly higher premiums because they have had children.\n  It is considered a preexisting condition by some insurance companies \nif a woman had a C-section because she might get pregnant again and she \nis going to have another C-section and that costs more. A woman with a \nC-section has a preexisting condition. A woman who has been--in some \ncases, with some insurance companies' policies--victimized by domestic \nviolence has a preexisting condition because the boyfriend, the husband \nor whoever hit her the one time, the insurance companies would suggest, \nis going to do it again. So she has a preexisting condition. What kind \nof health care system is that?\n  That is why I suggest Senator Vitter support the Mikulski amendment \nand support this legislation. In fact, it will put rules on insurance \npolicies so people will be treated in a different way than they have \nbeen in the past.\n  Let me talk, for a moment, specifically about the Mikulski amendment \nand why it is so important. It will ensure that women are able to \naccess needed preventive care and screenings at no additional cost. One \nof the things, in spite of the McCain amendment--and I appreciated \nSenator Baucus's comments a minute ago about how ironic it is. I was in \nthe House of Representatives for 14 years and in the Senate now for the \nlast 3 or so. I have heard so many colleagues eviscerate Medicare. They \nhave tried to cut Medicare, privatize it, and come at it from all \ndifferent directions repeatedly over these last 15 years. Now they want \nto tell us they are the ones who want to protect Medicare. In fact, \nthis legislation saves money and saves lives, and this legislation \nsaves Medicare.\n  One of the things this legislation does for Medicare beneficiaries is \nit will begin to provide these preventive care screenings so seniors \nwill pay no copay. It is not cutting Medicare and services, as my \nfriends on the other side say--all those who are opposed to every part \nof the bill, most of whom have tried to slow this legislation down. We \ncannot even vote on the McCain amendment. We are ready to do it, but \nthe Republicans don't seem to want to move forward on this legislation.\n  Let me go back to why the Mikulski amendment makes so much sense. All \nhealth care plans would cover comprehensive women's preventive care and \nscreenings, requiring that recommended services be covered at no cost \nto women. We know that to get preventive screenings and care--if we \nmake them at no cost, the chances of people getting them are \nsignificantly higher. More than half of women delay or avoid preventive \ncare because of the costs. One in five women at age 50 has not received \na mammogram in the past 2 years.\n  That isn't because the Commission, appointed by the former President \nBush, made this decision; it is not because of their bureaucratic \ndecision that Senator Vitter rails about, and many of us agree with; it \nis not because 1 in 5 women age 50 has not received a mammogram; it is \nthat they don't have insurance, in most cases, and they cannot afford \nthe mammogram.\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\n  In 2009, some 40,000 women will lose their lives to breast cancer; \n4,000 breast cancer deaths, one-tenth of those could have been \nprevented by increasing these preventive screenings. These kinds of \nmammograms, this preventive care, and these doctor visits will be \ncovered for free for women.\n  This amendment would broaden the comprehensive set of women's health \nservices that health insurance companies must cover and pay for.\n  For instance, it would ensure that women of all ages are able to \nreceive annual mammograms, covered by their insurer. It would encourage \ncoverage of pregnancy and postpartum depression screenings, Pap smears, \nscreenings for domestic violence, and annual women's health screenings. \nIt makes so much sense. It would save the lives of women, and it means \nwomen would suffer from a lot less illnesses. It will save money for \nthe health care system because these illnesses will be detected much \nearlier, and women will get the kind of care they should. That is what \nthis whole legislation is about and what the Mikulski amendment will \nadd to.\n  This amendment will remove any and all financial barriers to \npreventive care so we can diagnose diseases and illnesses early--when \nwe have the best chance at being able to save lives, obviously.\n  Understand again, this legislation and the Mikulski amendment are \nsupported by the National Organization for Women, the National \nPartnership of Women and Families, the American Cancer Society Cancer \nAction Network, and all kinds of women's organizations. They understand \nthis is the best thing for women in this country.\n  I hope the Senate can proceed to a vote on this amendment. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will not just talk about the bad decision of this \nCommission--and most of us think it was a bad decision--but actually do \nsomething about it, something substantive, and give women in this \ncountry a fairer shake from health care insurance companies and cover \nthese preventive services and cancer screenings. It will make a big \ndifference if we can move forward and expand preventive health care \nservices to women.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to pick up where Senator Brown left \noff. I will describe one of my real patients, but I will not use her \nreal name. I will call her ``Sheila.'' Sheila was 32 years old. She \ncame in with a breast mass. I examined it and thought it was a cyst. I \nsent her to get an ultrasound, which confirmed a cyst. OK. We did a \nmammogram to make sure. The mammogram said it looks like a cyst. The \nstandard of care for somebody with a cyst is to watch it expectantly, \nunless it is painful, because 99 percent of them are benign cysts. I \nhad the good fortune to do a needle drainage on her cyst 3 days after \nshe had her mammogram. There were highly malignant cells within the \ncyst. She has since died.\n  The reason I wanted to tell the story about Sheila is because what \nthe Senator from Ohio, in supporting the Mikulski amendment, doesn't \nrecognize is, we don't allow the Preventive Services Task Force to set \nthe rules and guidelines. We do something worse: We let the Secretary \nof HHS set the guidelines.\n  The people who ought to be setting the guidelines are not the \ngovernment; they are the professional societies that know the \nliterature, know the standards of care, know the best practices; and, \nin fact, the Mikulski amendment doesn't mandate mammograms for women. \nIt leaves it to HRSA, the Health Resources Services Administration, \nwhich has no guidelines on it today whatsoever.\n  So what you are saying with the Mikulski amendment is, we want the \ngovernment to, once again, decide--all of us are rejecting what the \nPreventive Services Task Force has said, but instead we are going to \nshift and pivot and say we will let the HRSA decide what your care \nshould be.\n  The other aspect of the Mikulski amendment I fully agree with. I \ndon't think there ought to be a copay on any preventive services. I \nagree 100 percent. But the last place we ought to be making decisions \nabout care and process and procedure is in a government agency that, \nNo. 1, is going to look at cost as much as at preventive effectiveness.\n  If the truth be known, the Preventive Services Task Force, from a \ncost standpoint--as a practicing physician, I know how to read what \nthey put out--from a cost standpoint, it is exactly right. From a \nclinical standpoint, they are exactly wrong, because if you happen to \nbe under 50 and didn't have a screening mammogram and your cancer was \nmissed, to you, they are 100 percent wrong. You see, the government \ncannot practice medicine effectively. What we are trying to do in this \nbill throughout is have the government practice medicine, whether it is \nthe comparative effectiveness panel or the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission.\n  What we have asked is for the government to make decisions.\n  Let me tell you what that is. That is the government standing between \nme and my patient. It is denying me the ability to use my knowledge, my \ntraining, my 25 years of well-earned gray hair, and combine that with \nfamily history, social history, psychological history, where it might \nbe important, and clinical science, and me putting my hand on a patient \nsuch as I did Sheila. Most physicians would never have stuck a needle \nin that cyst, and she would not have lived the 12 years that she lived. \nShe would have lived 1 or 2 years. But she got 12 years of life because \nclinical judgment wasn't deferred or denied by a government agency.\n\n  There is a wonderful member of the British Parliament who happens to \nbe a physician. When we were debating the issue of the comparative \neffectiveness panel, which will be applied to whatever HRSA or the \nSecretary does, I asked him: What about the national institute of \ncomparative effectiveness in England? Here is what he said: As a \nphysician, it ruins my relationship with my patient because no longer \nis my patient 100 percent my concern. Now my patient is 80 percent my \nconcern and the government is 20 percent of my concern. So what I do is \nI take my eye off my patient 20 percent of the time to make sure I am \ncomplying with what the national institute of comparative effectiveness \nsays--even if it is not in my patient's best interest.\n  When we pass a bill that is going to subterfuge or undermine the \nadvocacy of physicians for their patients, the wonderful health care we \nhave in this country will decline. There are a lot of other things \nabout the bill I don't agree with. But the No. 1 thing, as a practicing \nphysician, that I disagree with is the very fact--the thing I am most \nopposed to as a practicing physician--I like best practices. I use \nVanderbilt in my practice. I like them. They make me more efficient and \nmake me a better doctor. But they are not mandated for me when I see \nsomething that in my judgment and in the art of medicine I get to go \nthe other way because I know what is best for my patient.\n  What we have in this bill is what we passed with the stimulus bill, \nthe comparative effectiveness panel--which is utilized in this bill--\nand we have the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission saying you have to \ncut. Where do we cut? Whose breast cancer screening do we cut next \nyear? When we have the Commission saying we have to, unless we act \naffirmatively in another way, we are dividing the loyalty of every \nphysician in this country away from their patients. They are no longer \na 100-percent advocate for their patients. This is a government-\ncentered bill. It is not a patient-centered bill.\n  Going back to the Mikulski amendment and what will come with the \nMurkowski amendment, the Murkowski amendment is far better. It does \neverything Mikulski does but doesn't divide the loyalty or advocacy of \nthe physician. Here is what it does. The Murkowski amendment says \nnobody steps between you and your doctor--nobody, not an insurance \ncompany, not Medicare or Medicaid. We use as a reference the \nprofessional societies in this country who do know best, whether it be \nfor mammograms and the American College of Surgeons, the American \nCollege of OB/GYNs, the American College of Oncology, the American \nAcademy of Internal Medicine or the American College of Physicians, \nwhich have come to a consensus in terms of what best practices are but\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\ndon't mandate what will or will not be paid for when, in fact, the art \nof medicine is applied to save somebody's life, such as Sheila's.\n  For you see, if this bill passed, Sheila would have lived 2 years \ninstead of 12. Ten years was really important to her family. She got to \nsee the children I delivered for her grow up. One of them she got to \nsee married.\n  If we decide the government is going to practice medicine, which is \nwhat this bill does--the government steps between the patient and their \ncaregiver, deciding in Washington what we will do--what you will have \nis good outcomes 80 percent of the time and disasters 20 percent of the \ntime. That is not what we want.\n  I do not deny that there are plenty of problems in my profession in \nterms of not being as good as we should be, of not having our eye on \nthe ball some of the time, of making mistakes some of the time. I do \nnot deny that. But what I do embrace is most people who go into the \nfield of medicine go in for exactly the right reason; that is, to help \npeople. It is so ironic to me that we have a bill before us that limits \nand discourages and takes away the most altruistic of all efforts, \nwhich is to do 100 percent the best right thing for your patient.\n  The reason having HRSA or the Secretary set guidelines is bad is \nbecause most patients do not fit the textbook. Here is what the \ntextbook says, but this patient has this condition, this history, and \nthis finding that are different. What we have done in this bill is, \nmultiple times, take the learned judgment of caregivers and say: You \nwill bow to what the Federal Government says; you will bow to what HRSA \nsays; you will bow to what the Secretary of HHS says. Seventy-five \ntimes in this bill, there are new programs created; 6,950 times in this \nbill are requirements for the Secretary to set up new rules and \nregulations. If you do not think that will put the government between \nyou and your care, you have no understanding of health care in this \ncountry and you have no understanding of the problems we face today \nbecause of Medicare and Medicaid rules that interrupt and limit the \nability for us to care in the best way for our patients.\n  I am for the prevention aspects of the Mikulski amendment. I think it \nis a great idea. As a matter of fact, it should not be just about \nwomen. It should be about screening for prostate cancer for men as \nwell. It should be about treadmills for people with high cholesterol. \nIt should be about true preventive measures. Why were they not \nincluded? Because what we have done under the Mikulski amendment is \n$892 million over 10 years. We want to do this for one group but we \nwill not do it for the other.\n  If you think the government will not get in between, let me give \nthree examples right now which violate Federal law today. The Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services today violates Federal law. They \nration the following three things:\n  If, in fact, you are elderly and you have a complication with your \ncolon and you are a high-risk patient to have a perforation if you were \nto have a colonoscopy--that is when we go in with a fiber optic light \nto look at the colon--Medicare denies the ability for you to have a CT \nautomated, camera-centered, swallowed-pill colonoscopy, which is \navailable. The technology is proven and is being used outside of \nMedicare. You cannot have a video colonoscopy by way of a remote-\ncontrol camera. Why did CMS eliminate that? They eliminated it because \nit costs too much. So if you are 87 years old and you have a mass in \nyour colon and you cannot have a regular colonoscopy, you cannot even \nbuy this procedure; it is against the law because Medicare forbids it.\n  No. 2--and this has happened to me numerous times--women with severe \nosteoporosis--a loss of calcium in their bones at 50 years of age--\ndiagnosed with a DEXA scan in a screening prevention so they do not get \na collapsed vertebra or break a hip, you put them on a medicine. The \nmedicines are expensive, there is no question, but they really do work. \nSome medicines work for some people; other medicines work for others. \nOnce you do a DEXA scan, under Medicare rules, you cannot do another \none for 2 years. So you cannot check to see if the medicine is working \nafter 6 months, to see if you see an improvement in the calcification \nof a woman's bones, because Medicare said it is too expensive and we \nare doing too many of them. Rather than go after the fraud in DEXA \nscans, what they did was ration the care.\n  Here we have a woman and you have diagnosed her properly. You have \nstarted her on the medicine, but you have to wait 2 years. What happens \nduring that period of time if you are given a medicine that is not \nworking effectively? Because it did not work in her case, you have to \nwait 2 years and her osteoporosis advances and she falls and breaks her \nhip because Medicare said we were doing too many of them?\n  Take what CMS did to all the oncologists in this country. They said \nwe are paying too much money for EPOGEN. EPOGEN is an acronym for \nerythropoietin, which is a chemical that is kicked out by your kidneys \nto cause you to make red blood cells. When you get chemotherapy for \nbreast cancer or colon cancer, like I have had, sometimes that \nchemotherapy not only kills your cancer but it kills your blood cells. \nBecause we were using too much EPOGEN, Medicare put out a rule \nrationing EPOGEN and said: Unless you have a hemoglobin of X amount, \nyou cannot get a shot of EPOGEN, and by the way, you cannot take your \nown money and buy it either. The doctor will get fined if he gives it \nto you if you don't meet the guideline. What happens? For 80 percent of \nthe patients, it worked fine. But for those patients who have other \ncomorbid--other conditions, such as congestive heart failure or chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease--emphysema--where significant drops in \nhemoglobin can cause organ failures in other parts of the body, there \nwas no exception made by CMS for a physician to make a judgment and \nsay: This rule should not apply here because this patient is going to \nend up in the hospital.\n  My oncologist told me a story of one of his patients who could not \nget EPOGEN. It ended up that their heart failure was exacerbated \nbecause they got anemic from the chemotherapy, ended up on a ventilator \nin ICU, and died. Why did they die? Because they got heart failure. Why \ndid they get heart failure? Because they got too anemic. Why did they \nget too anemic? Because Medicare would not allow the doctors to give \nthem the medicine.\n  What is wrong with the bill, what is wrong with the Mikulski \namendment is we rely on government bureaucracies to make the decisions \nabout care rather than the trained, learned, experienced, truly caring \ncaregivers in this country to make those decisions. Instead of going \nafter the fraud in Medicare, which is well in excess of $90 billion a \nyear, we decided we will ration care.\n  The authors of this bill are going to say: No, that is not true. But \nwhen I offered amendments in committee to prohibit rationing of \nMedicare services--to prohibit it--it was voted down. Every person who \nvoted for moving on this bill voted against the rationing. Why would \nthey do that? Because ultimately the feeling is: We know better. \nWashington knows better. We know your patients better. We know how to \npractice medicine better. We are going to take ivory tower doctors who \ndo not have real practices anymore, we are going to take retired \nresearchers, and we are going to tell you how to practice. And we are \ngoing to save money by limiting what you can get.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has said we do not truly cut \nMedicare Advantage, that the services are not reduced. The chairman's \nown bill, on page 869, subtitle C, part C--I won't go through reading \nit--reduces Medicare Advantage payments. The differential from $135 \nto--I will read it to the chairman. The chairman is shaking his head. \nLet me read it to him. Let me also reference what CBO has said. I will \nbe happy to yield to the chairman if he wants to talk now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As soon as I get the page number, I guess I would like to \nask the Senator from Oklahoma a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What page?\n  Mr. COBURN. Page 869, subtitle C, part C.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't have it with me right now, but there are no \nrequired reductions in fringes or extras--\n  Mr. COBURN. No required reductions in what?\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fringes, such as gym memberships, and extras such as \nthat. The bill basically provides that there be no reductions in \nguaranteed Medicare payments. There is a long list of what guaranteed \nMedicare payments are.\n  Even the Medicare Advantage companies, which are private companies \nwith officers and they have stockholders--they have to report to their \nboard of directors, and they have all these administrative costs, very \nhuge admin costs. The reductions to Medicare Advantage--the application \nof reductions to Medicare Advantage plans are at the discretion of the \nofficers. The officers can decide they are not going to cut the \nfringes; that is, the fringes and the extras that are beyond, in \naddition to the guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n  If an officer wants to, it is his discretion, I am assuming--\n  Mr. COBURN. Reclaiming my time, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record CBO 11/21/2009, which shows an average from $135 \ndown to $51 per month on the average Medicare Advantage beneficiary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE (MA) PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON\n  ENROLLMENT IN MA PLANS AND ON FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR ENROLLEES IN MA PLANS OF BENEFITS NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE\n                                                Under Current Law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Enrollment in MA Plans (millions)     Average Subsidy of Extra Benefits\n                                     --------------------------------------   Not Covered by Medicare  (dollars\n                                                                                         per month)\n                                             2009               2019       -------------------------------------\n                                                                                   2009               2019\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll Areas-..........................              10.6-              13.9-                87-                135\n    Areas with Bids that Average                   4.7-               6.9-               120-                172\n     Less than 100 Percent of\n     Spending Per Beneficiary in the\n     Fee-for-Service Sector-........\n    Areas with Bids that Average                   5.9-               7.0-                61-                 98\n     More than 100 Percent of\n     Spending Per Beneficiary in the\n     Fee-for-Service Sector-........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n                              Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Reduction in enrollment in MA plans,   Net reduction in   Average subsidy\n                                                      2019                  Medicare spending  of extra benefits\n                                     --------------------------------------     2010-2019        not covered by\n                                                                               Billions of       Medicare, 2019\n                                           Percent            Millions           dollars       Dollars per month\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll Areas-..........................               -18-              -2.6-               105-                 49\n    Areas with Bids that Average                   -29-               -2.0             \\a\\-62                 51\n     Less than 100 Percent of\n     Spending Per Beneficiary in the\n     Fee-for-Service Sector-........\n    Areas with Bids that Average                    -9-              -0.6-               -43-              47---\n     More than 100 Percent of\n     Spending Per Beneficiary in the\n     Fee-for-Service Sector-........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\a\\ The estimate of a $105 billion net reduction in Medicare spending over the 2010-2019 period reflects a $118\n  billion reduction in Medicare payments that would be offset, in part, by a $13 billion reduction in Part B\n  premium receipts.\nNote: Under current law, extra benefits include health care services net covered by Medicare, such as vision\n  care and dental care, and subsidies of beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs for Part B or Part D premiums or\n  cost sharing for Medicare-covered benefits. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, extra\n  benefits would include health care services not covered by Medicare and subsidies of beneficiaries' out-of-\n  pocket costs for cost sharing for Medicare-covered benefits.\n \n\n  Mr. COBURN. The fact is, if you like what you have, you cannot keep \nit, for 2.6 million Americans. You can say that is not true. That is \nwhat CBO says. Here are their numbers. They sent the report to the \nchairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is true--first of all, we need to back up. Isn't it \ntrue that the MedPAC commission came to the conclusion that the \nMedicare Advantage plans are overpaid?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. I agree with the chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is also true that it is their recommendation that the \nMedicare plans overpaid by the amount of 14 percent.\n  Mr. COBURN. I don't know the actual amount. I agree with the chairman \nthat they are overpaid.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is true. They are overpaid.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If they are overpaid, doesn't that necessarily mean there \nare reductions in payments attributable to each beneficiary by \ndefinition?\n  Mr. COBURN. I disagree with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If they are overpaid--\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is what I would say. This morning, the claim made by \nthe chairman and Senator Dodd is that Medicare Advantage is not \nMedicare. Medicare Advantage is Medicare law. It was signed into law. \nIt is a part of Medicare. The chairman would agree with that?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely. In 2003, I made the mistake and agreed to \ngive the Medicare Advantage plans way more money than they deserved. \nAnd as the Senator from Oklahoma has said, they are overpaid.\n  Mr. COBURN. I agree with the chairman. You won't hear that from me. \nHow did we get there? How did we get there? How did we get there, to \nwhere they are overpaid? We have an organization called the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services. They are the ones who let the contract, \nare they not? They, in fact, are. Twenty-five percent of the \noverpayment has to be rebated to CMS today; the Senator would agree \nwith that? Seventy-five percent for extra benefits, 25 percent \nrebate. How did we get to where they are overpaid? Because we have a \ngovernment-centered organization that is incompetent in terms of how \nthey accomplished the implementation of that bill.\n\n  What was said by Senator Dodd this morning--and I confronted him \nalready on it, but it bears repeating--is that the Patients' Choice Act \neliminates the dollars without eliminating the services because it \nmandates competitive bidding with no elimination in services for \nMedicare Advantage. So if you want to save money, competitively bid \nrather than go through eight pages of reductions year by year in the \npayments that go back to Medicare Advantage.\n  We have this complicated formula that nobody who listens to this \ndebate would understand. I know the chairman understands it because he \nhelped write it. But the fact is 2.6 million Americans, according to \nCBO, will see a significant change in their Medicare benefits. Medicare \nAdvantage is Medicare Part C. We have had a kind of a differential made \nthat it isn't really Medicare. It is Medicare. And 20 percent of the \npeople in this country who are on Medicare are on Medicare Part C--\nMedicare Advantage--and they like it. And why do they like it? Because \nmost of them don't have enough money to buy a supplemental Medicare \npolicy to cover the costs that are associated with deductibles and \ncopays and outliers. So I agree with the chairman that Medicare \nAdvantage is overpaid, but I disagree with the way you are going about \ngetting there.\n  I also disagree with taking any of the money that is now being spent \non Medicare Part C and creating another program. I think all that money \nought to be put back into the longevity of Medicare.\n  In case you don't understand how impactful that is, we now owe, in \nthe next 75 years--actually, we don't owe it, because none of the \nSenators sitting here will be around. Our kids are going to get to pay \nback $44 trillion in money for Medicare we will have spent, that we \nallowed to grow, in fraud, close to $100 billion a year and then did \nnothing about it. This bill does essentially nothing about that $100 \nbillion a year, or $1 trillion every 10 years. If we were to eliminate \nthat--which this bill does not--we would markedly extend the life and \nlower the debt that is going to come to our children.\n  That leads me to the other important aspect of the health care \ndebate. We know when you take out the funny accounting--the Enron \naccounting--in this bill, and you match up revenues with expenses, you \nare talking about a $2.5 trillion bill. The chairman of the\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\nFinance Committee readily admits he has it paid for, and CBO says you \nhave it paid for. But how does he pay for it? He pays for it with the \n2.6 million people who like what they have today and who are going to \nlose what they have today. He pays for it by raising Medicare taxes. \nThen the Medicare taxes he raises he doesn't spend on Medicare, he \nspends that on a new entitlement program. Think about what we are \ndoing. Is there a better way to accomplish what we are doing?\n  I thank the chairman for indulging me and allowing me to continue \nthis long. I will wind up with a couple of statements and then share \nthe floor with him.\n  You know, after practicing medicine for 25 years, I know we have a \nlot of problems in health care, and I appreciate the efforts of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee to try to find a solution for them. \nIt is not a bipartisan solution, but it is a solution. And it is a \nsolution that grows the government. It puts the government in charge of \nhealth care and creates blind bureaucracies that step between you and \nyour doctor. That is one way of doing it. But wouldn't a better way be \nto do the following: Let's incentivize people to do the right thing, \nrather than building bureaucracies and mandating how they will do it. \nWouldn't it be better to incentivize tort reform in the States? \nWouldn't it be better to incentivize physicians based on outcomes? \nWouldn't it be better to incentivize good behavior by medical supply \ncompanies, DME, drug companies, hospitals, physicians, through \naccountable care organizations, through transparency for both quality \nand price?\n  We don't have any of that in here. What we have is a government-\ncentered bureaucracy that, according to CBO figures, will add 25,000 \nFederal employees to implement this program--25,000. If you call the \nFederal Government, how long does it take you now to get an answer? Yet \nwe are going to add 25,000 employees just in health care. That is an \nextrapolation of the amount of agencies, dividing what CBO says per \nagency and per cost they will come up with. Wouldn't it be better to \nfix the things that are broken, rather than to try to fix all of health \ncare?\n  I heard one of my colleagues today say on the floor, and I think it \nis true, that people in America are upset with us, and I think rightly \nso. I apologize to the American people for my arrogance. I apologize to \nthe American people for the arrogance of this bill; the thinking that \nwe got it right; that we can fix it in Washington; that we don't have \nto listen to the people out there; that we don't have to listen to the \npeople who are actually experiencing the consequences of what we are \ngoing to do. I apologize for the arrogance of saying we can create a \n$2.5 trillion program and that we know best. Well, you know what, we \ndon't know what is best.\n  As Senator Alexander has said so many times, what needs to happen is \nwe need to start over. We need to protect the best of American \nmedicine. And what is the best? Well, if you get sick anywhere in the \nworld, this is the best place in the world to get sick, whether you \nhave insurance or not. If you have heart disease or atherosclerotic \ndisease, this is the best place in the world. It costs too much, there \nis no question, but it is the best place. If you have cancer, you are \none-third more likely to live and be cured of that cancer living in \nthis country than anywhere else in the world--for any cancer. It just \ncosts too much.\n  This bill doesn't address the true causes of the cost. What are the \ntrue causes of the cost? Well, No. 1, we know Medicare and Medicaid \nunderpay and so we get a cost shift that is $1,700 per year per family \nin this country. So you get to pay three taxes in this country on \nhealth care: You pay your regular income tax, which goes to pay for \nMedicaid, and it also now starting to pay for Medicare as well; you \nhave to pay 1.45 percent, plus your employer gets to pay 1.45 percent \nof every dollar you earn for Medicare; and then your health insurance \ncosts $1,700 more per year because Medicaid and Medicare don't \ncompensate for the actual cost of the care because of the government-\ncentered role that is played in terms of the mandates, the rules, and \nregulations.\n  We have a tort system in this country that costs upward of $200 \nbillion in waste a year, which is 8 percent of the cost. Ninety percent \nof all cases are settled with no wrong found at all on the part of \ncaregivers, and of the remaining 10 percent only 3 percent find \nanything wrong. Of 97 percent of all the cases, only 10 percent go to \ntrial, and 73 percent of that 10 percent are found in favor of the \nproviders. So we spend all this money practicing defensive medicine and \nthere is not one thing in this bill to fix that problem. That is 8 \npercent.\n  Take your health care premium, or your percentage of your health care \npremium, and apply 8 percent, and that is going down the drain because \nI am ordering tests you don't need but I need to protect myself in case \nsomebody tries to extort money from me with a lawsuit that I know is \ngoing to get thrown out, but I have to have it there to prove it. And \nthen we have inefficiencies.\n  Ultimately, what we need to do is to protect what is good, \nincentivize the correct behavior in what is wrong, and go after the \nfraud in health care with a vengeance--put doctors in jail, hospital \nadministrators in jail. Don't slap them with a fine and ban them from \nMedicare. Put them in jail. The people who are stealing our grandkids' \nmoney, up to $100 billion a year, need to go to jail. We play pay and \nchase. We pay everybody and then we try to figure out whether they \ndeserve to get paid. Nobody else does that, but the government does, \nand that is who we are getting ready to put in charge of another $2.5 \ntrillion worth of health care?\n  One of the reasons health care is in trouble in this country is that \n61 percent of all the health care is run through the government today. \nLook at TRICARE for our military, look at VA care, look at Indian \nhealth care, at SCHIP and Medicaid. There is an estimate of $15 billion \na year in fraud in New York City alone on Medicaid. That is one \nestimate, per year, in one city on Medicaid. And then Medicare. And we \nare going to say those are running so good that we ought to move \nanother $2.5 trillion, or 15 percent of health care, to where we are at \n76 percent of all health care is run by the government? I reject that \nout of hand until we can demonstrate we are good at what we do.\n  What we ought to be doing is turning it back. The private sector \nisn't the answer to everything. I agree with that. I can't stand 80 \npercent of the insurance bureaucrats I deal with. But at least I have a \nfighting chance, because they will call me back when I need to do \nsomething for a patient. I never get a call back from Medicare. They do \nnot call me back. The State doesn't call me back on Medicaid when I \nneed to do something. So I go on and do it and find somebody else to \npay for it. That is the kind of system we have today.\n  Think about the mothers in this country in a Medicaid system where 40 \npercent of the primary care doctors in this country won't see their \nchildren. That is Medicaid. That is realistic Medicaid today in our \ncountry. So they have a sick kid, but they can't get in to a doctor, \neven though they have insurance. They have Medicaid, but they can't get \nin. Why can't they get in? Because only 1 in 50 doctors last year who \ngraduated from medical school goes into primary care. We have created \nan abrupt shortage in primary care. And, No. 2, the payment is not \nenough to pay for the overhead to see the child. So you have a weepy \nwoman who is worried about her sick kid, and care is delayed if you \ncan't get in. It doesn't matter if you have Medicaid if you can't be \nseen. So what happens? She goes to the emergency room. What happens in \nthe emergency room? We spend three or four times as much as we should, \nbecause that is an emergency department. The doctor has no knowledge of \nthe child or the mother. He doesn't want to get sued, so we have a 40-\npercent defensive medicine cost in the emergency room.\n  The answer is not more government health care. The answer is creating \nthe incentives for people to do the right thing. The only way we get \nthings under control in health care in this country and the only way we \ncreate access for people in this country is to decrease the cost of \nhealth care. This bill doesn't decrease the cost of health care. If we \nwant to make sure we do what is best for American medicine while we fix \nwhat is wrong, we will do it one significant part at a time. I can't \nimagine dealing with thousands, tens of thousands of more bureaucrats \nin\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\nhealth care, and I can't imagine the impact it is going to have between \nme and my patients. It is going to severely impact them. Do I want \neverybody in this country to have available care? Yes; 15 percent of my \npractice was gratis, for people who had no care, who had no money. That \nis true with a lot of physicians out there in this country. It is true \nwith a lot of labs. It is true with a lot of hospitals. It is true with \na lot of the providers in this country. They are caring people.\n\n  We are going to tie them up. We are going to put regulations and \nropes around them. We are going to mandate rules and regulations, and \nwe, in our arrogant wisdom, are going to tell Americans how they are \ngoing to get their health care. I certainly hope not. But I am not \nthinking about me. I am thinking about our kids and our grandkids.\n  I will end with one last comment. Thomson-Reuters, in a study put out \nOctober 9 of this year--it is a very well-respected firm--their \nestimate of the $2.4 trillion that we spend on health care per year in \nthis country is that between $600 and $850 billion of it is pure waste. \nDefensive medicine costs and malpractice is between $250 billion to \n$325 billion by their estimate. Not one thing in this bill to address \nthat--not one thing.\n  Fraud, there is between $125 and $175 billion per year--insignificant \nin this bill, $2 billion to $3 billion.\n  Administrative inefficiency, 17 percent--between $100 and $150 \nbillion wasted on paperwork in health care every year.\n  Provider errors--that is me--between $75 and $100 billion; that is \neither wrong diagnosis or failure to treat appropriately. It is the \nsmallest of all.\n  What are we doing? We are going to tell the providers--the hospitals, \nthe medical device companies, the drug companies, the doctors, the \nradiologists, the labs, the physical therapists--we are going to tell \nthem how to do it. That is not where the problem is.\n  My hope is that the American people will come to their senses and \nsay: Wait a minute. Slow down. Stop. Fix the important things. Fix the \nworst thing first, the next thing second, the next thing third, the \nnext thing fourth. The unintended consequences of this bill are going \nto be unbelievable. Nobody is smart enough to figure all this out--\nnobody. Nobody on my staff, nobody on the Finance Committee, nobody in \nMajority Leader Reid's office can predict all the unintended \nconsequences that are going to come about because of this bill.\n  The chairman has been awfully patient, and I see my colleague here to \noffer an amendment. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to share a few thoughts \nabout our health care proposal and also to address the amendment of my \ngood friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. We have heard the word \n``arrogant'' echo in this Chamber. ``The bill before us is arrogant.''\n  I come to it with a somewhat different perspective. For 10 years, as \na representative of a working class neighborhood back in Oregon, as a \nState legislator, I have heard a lot of stories from America's working \nfamilies--from the working families in my House district back home, a \nlot of stories regarding health care. There is a lot of concern that \nthey can't afford health care. There is a lot of concern that their \nchildren do not have appropriate coverage. There is a lot of concern \nthat their health care is tied to their job, and if they lose their job \nthey are going to lose their health care.\n  There is a huge amount of stress for America's families who \nunderstand if you have health care you have to worry about losing it, \nand if you don't have it you have to worry about getting sick. That is \nwhy we are here today in this Chamber debating health care, because so \nmany of us have heard from our constituents, so many of us know from \nour personal experience what a dysfunctional, broken health care system \nwe have in America.\n  Sometimes, listening to this conversation on the Senate floor, you \nwould think this is a rather complicated debate. But the heart of this \nbill is not that complicated. The heart of this bill is that every \nsingle American should have access to affordable, quality health care, \nand that we can take a model that has worked very well for the Federal \nemployees of our Nation, a model that encourages competition, a model \nthat says let's create a marketplace where every individual, every \nsmall business that currently struggles to get health care and has to \npay a huge premium for health care--enable them to join a health care \npool that will negotiate a good deal on their behalf.\n  I think every American who has tried to get health care on their own, \nevery small business that is paying a 15- to 20-percent premium because \nthey don't have the clout of a large business, understands if they \ncould join with other businesses, if they could join with other \nindividuals, they would get a lot better deal.\n  Americans understand if there is a large pool of citizens who are \nseeking health insurance that insurers are going to be attracted to \nmarket their goods. We have seen that in the Federal employees system, \nwhere insurers come and compete. It turns the tables. It takes the \npower away from the insurance companies and it gives the power to the \nAmerican citizen because now the citizen is in charge. Now the citizen \ngets to choose between health care providers instead of having to \nsearch for anyone from whom they can possibly get a policy.\n  I do not find that it is arrogant to try to create a system in which \nindividuals and small businesses get health care that is more \naffordable. I don't find that a bill that says we are going to invest \nin prevention is arrogant, that is smart. I don't find a bill that says \nwe are going to create incentives to do disease management arrogant, so \nsomeone suffering from diabetes has the disease managed rather than \nending up with an expensive amputation of their foot. That is \nintelligent, that is not arrogant.\n  I don't find that having a bill that says every single American is \ngoing to find affordable health care, and if they are too poor to \nafford it we will provide a subsidy to assist them, to get everyone in \nthe door, that is not arrogant. That is saying we are all in this \ntogether as citizens and that health care is a fundamental factor in \nthe quality of life. It is a fundamental factor in the pursuit of \nhappiness. It is not arrogant to find for fundamental access to health \ncare.\n  I rise specifically to address the amendment offered by my good \nfriend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. The legislation we are \nconsidering has many parts that make health care more affordable and \navailable, that expand access; many parts to hold insurance companies \naccountable. But a big part of health care reform also deals with \nhelping people avoid illness or injury in the first place. That is what \nSenator Mikulski's amendment does and why it is so important that it be \nincluded in this package.\n  Preventive screening saves lives. That is a fact. Early detection \nsaves lives. That is a fact. Too many women forgo both because of the \ncost.\n  I want to share a story from a physician in Oregon. The physician is \nDr. Linda Harris. I am going to quote her story in full. It is not that \nlong. She says:\n\n       I work one day a week at our county's public health \n     department. There I met Sue, a 31-year-old woman who came in \n     with pelvic pain and bleeding. She proved to have extremely \n     aggressive cervical cancer that was stage IV when I diagnosed \n     it.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       When Sue was 18 she had a tubal ligation after she gave \n     birth to her only child. As a single mom she did not have the \n     financial resources to have more children. She concentrated \n     on raising her daughter. Sue always worked, sometimes 2 jobs \n     at once, but never the kind of job that offered health \n     insurance. But because she had a tubal ligation she did not \n     qualify for our State's family planning expansion project \n     that provides free annual exams, Pap smears and contraceptive \n     services to many of our clients.\n\n  The doctor continues:\n\n       Cervical cancer is an entirely preventable disease. Pap \n     smears almost always find it in its preinvasive form, but Sue \n     never came in for a Pap smear or an annual exam. Her lack of \n     affordable access to basic health care proved fatal. When Sue \n     died of cervical cancer her daughter was 13.\n\n  That is the completion of the story that the doctor shared. Sue \nshould not be viewed as a statistic in a broken health care system. \nBut, instead, we\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\nshould take her story to heart, about the importance of preventive \nservices. Sue is one of 44,000 Americans who die each year because they \nlack insurance, according to a recent Harvard Medical School study.\n  Let me repeat that statistic because I think it is hard to get your \nhands around--44,000 Americans die each year because they lack \ninsurance. I don't think it is arrogant to say we should build a health \ncare system that gives every single American access to affordable, \nquality care so that 44,000 of our mothers and fathers, our sons and \nbrothers, our daughters, our wives, our sisters--so that 44,000 of them \ndo not die each year because they lack insurance.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment will help keep this tragedy from \nhappening to our families. To put it plainly, it will save lives. It \ndoes this by allowing the Health Resources and Services Administration \nto develop evidence-based guidelines to help bridge critical gaps in \ncoverage and access to affordable preventive health services--the same \napproach the bill takes to address gaps in preventive services for \nchildren. This will guarantee women access to the kinds of screenings \nand tests that can prevent illnesses or stop them early.\n  As the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network notes:\n\n       Transforming our broken ``sick care'' system depends on an \n     increased emphasis on detection and early prevention, \n     enabling us to find diseases when they are easier to survive \n     and less expensive to treat.\n\n  That last point is also important. Treating illnesses also saves \nmoney. With so much emphasis on the cost of health care, we should all \nagree that it is common sense to include reforms that lower health care \ncosts for all Americans.\n  I was noticing that her amendment has a long list of organizations \nstating how important this is--the National Organization for Women, the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, the Religious Coalition \nfor Reproductive Choice, the American Cancer Society-Cancer Action \nNetwork, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health \nAssociation.\n  I applaud Senator Mikulski for offering this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to remember the 44,000 Americans who die every year because \nthey do not have access to insurance, because they do not have access \nto preventive services, and vote to include this important reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto engage in colloquy with my Republican colleagues on an amendment I \nwill be discussing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion this week certainly, and last week, with the announcement \nfrom the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the USPSTF, of their \nrecommendations as they relate to mammograms and recommendation that \nwomen under the age of 50 do not need to be screened until they reach \nage 50, and then on attaining the age 50, every other year after that.\n  When these recommendations came out on November 16, it is fair to say \nthey generated a level of controversy, a level of discussion and a \nlevel of confusion around the country by women from all walks of life. \nFor many years now, women have operated under what we knew to be the \nstandards, the protocols. If you had a history of breast cancer in your \nfamily, you took certain steps earlier, but the general recommendation \nwas out there. Certainly, the guidelines we had been following, the \nassurances we were seeking as women were that we would be encouraged to \nengage in these screenings on an annual basis. They gave us all a level \nof confidence. When these new recommendations, these new guidelines \ncame out just a couple weeks ago, I do think the level of confusion, \nthe level of anxiety that was raised because of this announcement \nbrought a focus to some of what we are talking about when we discuss \nhealth care reforms and should the government be involved in our health \ncare.\n  I know I have received e-mails from friends, from relatives, \ngirlfriends I haven't heard from in a while, talking with women, \ngenerally, about what do they think about this. I would hear story \nafter story of the woman who discovered, at age 39, a lump, something \nthat was off, something that was not right, and then the stories \nsubsequent to that, the steps she took as an individual with her \ndoctor. Again, the announcement that we now have these guidelines that \nthis preventative screening task force has put in place and everything \nwe thought we knew and understood about what we should be doing with \nour health has been unsettled brings us to the discussion today.\n  We have an amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland. I would \nlike to offer a little bit later an amendment, but I would like to \nspeak to the amendment now, if I may. I am proposing this as a side-by-\nside to the Mikulski amendment. This is designed to allow for an \nopenness, a transparency on preventative services, not just mammograms. \nI don't want to limit it to only mammograms, because we know that \npreventive services in so many other aspects of our health are also \nequally key and also equally important. What I am looking to do with my \namendment is to rely on the expertise, not of a government-appointed \ntask force but to rely on the expertise of medical organizations and \nthe experts, whether they are within the college of OB/GYNs or surgeons \nor oncologists, rely on them and their expertise to determine what \nservices, what preventive services should be covered.\n  What we are seeking to do is allow for a level of information so an \nindividual can select insurance coverage based on recommendations by \nthese major professional medical organizations on preventative health \nservices, whether it is mammography or for cervical cancer screening.\n  I think we learned from the announcement from the USPSTF, the \nPreventive Services Task Force, that when we have government engaging \nin the decisions as to our health care and what role they actually \nplay, there is a great deal of concern and consternation. I have heard \nfrom many colleagues on both sides of the aisle: That task force was \nwrong. We think they have made a mistake in their recommendations.\n  What we are intending to do with this amendment is keep the \ngovernment out of health care decisionmaking and allow the spotlight to \nbe shown on the level of prevention coverage that patients will get \nunder their health care plan, rather than relying on unelected \nindividuals, basically individuals who are appointed by an \nadministration to serve as part of this panel of 16, on the Preventive \nServices Task Force. My amendment specifies that all health plans must \nconsult the recommendations and the guidelines of the professional \nmedical organizations in determining what prevention benefits should be \ncovered by all health insurance plans.\n  I know at least those of us who are on the Federal employees health \nbenefits have an opportunity to subscribe to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nplan. This is their booklet that is out for 2010. This is under their \nstandard basic option plan. Turn to preventive care for adults that is \ncovered. They provide, under this particular plan, for cancer \ndiagnostic tests and screening procedures for colorectal cancer tests, \nfor prostate cancer, cervical cancer, mammograms, ultrasound, abdominal \naneurysm. There is a list we can look to.\n  What we don't see laid out in this booklet or any of the other \npamphlets that outline given plans out there is, OK, for instance, the \nbreast cancer test, is there an age restriction. I am told under Blue \nCross there is not. But it doesn't indicate that there. What do the \nexperts recommend? It is not clear from what we receive. So what my \namendment would do, in part, is to allow for this information to be \ndirectly made available to patients, to individuals who are looking at \nthe plans, to make a determination as to what they will select.\n  If you go to the Web sites of these professional medical \norganizations, for instance, the American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, they recommend that cervical cancer screening should \nbegin at age 21 years, regardless of sexual history. Cervical cytology \nscreening is recommended\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\nevery 2 years for women between the ages of 21 and 29. The American \nSociety of Clinical Oncology, as to the recommendations for \nmammography, urges all women beginning at age 40 to speak with their \ndoctors about mammography, to understand the benefits and potential \nrisks. By age 50, at the latest, they should be receiving mammograms. \nThe American College of Surgeons, in their recommendations, recommend \nthat women get a mammogram every year starting at age 40.\n  As an individual who is looking to make a determination as to what \nthe experts are saying out there, what is being recommended, I would \nlike to know that this information is made available to me to help me \nmake these decisions. What our amendment would require is the plans \nwould be required to provide this information directly to the \nindividuals through the publications they produce on an annual basis. \nWhat we are talking about now is the doctors. It is the specialists who \nwill be recommending what preventative services to cover, not those of \nus here in Washington, DC, in Congress, not the Secretary of Health and \nSocial Services, who may or may not be a doctor or a medical \nprofessional, not a task force that has been appointed by an \nadministration. We are trying to take the politics out of this and put \nit on the backs of the medical professionals who know and understand \nthis. This is where I think we want to be putting the emphasis. This is \nwhere we want to be relying on the professionals, not the political \nfolks.\n  Additionally, my amendment ensures that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services shall not use any recommendations made by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force to deny coverage of any items or \nservices. This is the crux of so much of what we are discussing right \nnow with these latest recommendations that came out by USPSTF. The big \nconcern by both Republicans and Democrats and everyone is the insurance \ncompanies are going to be using these recommendations now to deny \ncoverage to women under 50 or to a woman who is over 50, if she wants \nto have a mammogram every year; that she would only be allowed coverage \nfor those mammograms every other year rather than on an annual basis. \nWe want to take that away from the auspices, if you will, of the \ngovernment. To suggest that we will deny coverage based on the \nrecommendations of this government task force is not something I think \nmost of us in this country are comfortable with.\n  We specify very clearly that the Secretary cannot use any \nrecommendations from the USPSTF to deny coverage of any items or \nservices. We also include in the amendment broad protections to \nprevent, again, the bureaucrats, the government folks at the Department \nof Health and Human Services, from denying care to patients based on \nthe use of comparative effectiveness research.\n  Finally, we include a provision that ensures that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services may not define or classify abortion or \nabortion services as preventative care or as preventative services.\n  This amendment is relatively straightforward. It relies, essentially, \non the recommendation of practicing doctors, as opposed to the \nbureaucrats, to the politicians, to those in office. My amendment \naddresses the concern that the government will make coverage \ndeterminations for your health care decisions. What we are doing here, \nquite simply, is making it transparent, making clear that the \npreventive services recommended by the professional medical \norganizations are visible, are transparent. We require the insurance \ncompanies to disclose that information that is recommended and, again, \nrecommended by the professionals.\n  This is a good compromise. It basically keeps the government out, and \nit keeps the doctors in. It requires the insurance companies to \ndisclose the information to potential enrollees and allows for, again, \na transparency that, to this point in time, has been lacking.\n  It has been suggested by at least one other Member on the floor \nearlier that my amendment would cost somewhere in the range of $30 \nbillion. I would like to note for the record, we have not yet received \na score on this. We fully believe it will be much less than has been \nsuggested. When the statement was made, it was not with a full view of \nthe amendment we have before us and is not consistent with that. I did \nwish to acknowledge that as we begin the discussion on my amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nAlaska for the tremendous work she has done on this issue and for the \ndozens of people she has talked to over the last couple days to try to \ncome up with an amendment that would actually solve the problem \neverybody has been talking about.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Maryland recognizing this major flaw in \nthe bill, and it is in the bill. The U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce is in the bill. That is exactly the group that specified this new \npolicy on mammograms that has upset people all across the country. It \nupset everybody so much that we have an amendment on the floor by the \nSenator from Maryland reacting to that and reacting to the fact that it \nis in the bill at the current time.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from Alaska coming up with a plan that \nactually is more comprehensive than the amendment from the Senator from \nMaryland because the Senator has had a little bit longer to work on it. \nI appreciate the words the Senator has in there that ``you cannot \ndeny.'' The Senator is on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee with me, and I know we have worked on this issue in \ncommittee. I hoped this kind of a realization would have been made at \nthat time. We had some amendments where you could not deny based on \nthis or the comparative effectiveness or could not prohibit based on \nit. We know all those amendments failed, meaning there was probably \nsome intention to deny or to prohibit based on these groups.\n  So I appreciate the Senator bringing up the fact that it is the \ncaregivers who will have some say in this so Washington cannot come \nbetween you and your doctor. I wish the Senator would go into a little \nbit of some of her background from Alaska because the Senator and \nAlaska have been very involved in breast cancer for a long time, and \npeople ought to be aware of the kind of services that are available out \nthere and what the costs of those services are.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate the question from my colleague from \nWyoming. The Senator knows, coming from a rural State, that our health \ncare costs are typically higher, and it is not just an issue of cost, \nbut it is an issue of access, and particularly in my State, where most \nof our communities are not connected by roads, it is very difficult to \ngain access to a provider. It is even more difficult to gain access, \nfor instance, to mammography units.\n  I have been involved in this issue, in terms of women's health and \ncancer screening, for many decades now, primarily because my mother got \nstarted in it back when I was still in high school and saw a need to \nprovide for breast cancer screening for women in rural areas, where \nthey could not afford to fly into town, as we would call it, for the \nscreenings. So she engaged in an effort--and continues to this day--to \nraise money for not only mobile mammography units but to figure out how \nwe move those units from village to village.\n  Essentially, what they have been able to do, over the years, is you \nput that mobile mammography unit on the back of a barge and you take it \nup and down the river and you stop in every village and offer free \nscreenings for women. You fly it into a village, where you are not on a \nriver. We have been making this effort, again, for decades, working, \nchipping away slowly at the issue of breast cancer. We recognize it in \nour State. Particularly with our Alaska Native populations, we see \nhigher levels of breast cancer than we would like. We are trying to \nreduce that.\n  But when these recommendations came out several weeks ago from the \nUSPSTF, I will tell you, there was a buzz around my State amongst women \nabout: Well, now what do I do? Where do I go? Do I need to go in for my \nscreening? What should I do?\n  There is an article that was actually in the news just, I guess, a \ncouple weeks ago, and it cites a comment from a doctor. Her comment \nwas, the new recommendations were confusing patients who usually come \nin for their annual screenings. She said: My schedulers have called to \nschedule patients\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\nto come in for their followup mammogram, and they have been told: Well, \nI don't have to do that now. This government group says I don't have to \ndo that.\n  Mr. President and my colleague from Wyoming, maybe some do not. But \nwhat about those who are at risk? These are the ones whom I think we \nare continuing to hear from who say: Please, add some clarity to this.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know there is not any word that probably \nturns a family upside down as much as the word ``cancer,'' and it does \nnot matter which form of cancer it is. It is just drastic because we do \nnot know all the implications of it. Maybe someday we will. Maybe \nsomeday we will know how people get it, and we will be able to cure it \nwith a vaccine. But, so far, what we have are some mechanisms for \nputting it into remission.\n  One of the reasons I know how upsetting that is and how it turns the \nworld upside down is, 3\\1/2\\, 3\\3/4\\ years ago my wife was diagnosed \nwith colon cancer. She had screenings, but she listened to her body. \nShe said: Something is the matter here. She kept going to doctors. So \neven if they do not recommend the screenings, if your body is saying \nsomething is the matter, pursue it until you are either convinced \nnothing is the matter or a doctor finds what is the matter. That is the \nadvice she gives to everybody. These are things that need to be between \nthe patient and the doctor.\n  Now that she is in remission, one of the things the doctor \nrecommended was that she take Celebrex. That is something normally for \narthritic pain, but what they found was in some patients that will keep \npolyps from growing that will turn into cancer in the colon, and we \ndefinitely do not want that to recur again. So she is taking that. But \nit is a constant fight with making sure that is an approved medication \nand that it can be done and that it will be paid for.\n  If that were just a task force recommendation--first of all, since \nshe had the screening, they would say she does not have a problem and, \nlater, she would die from it. But she was able to listen to her body, \nget the treatment she needed, and now is continuing to get the \ntreatment without a task force saying: No, 99 percent of the people do \nnot need that. Her doctor and she are able to determine what she needs.\n  On other screenings, once you have cancer, there are other times you \nneed to have MRIs, other kinds of tests run. That, again, has to be up \nto the doctor and the patient to determine how often those are needed. \nAgain, I know from talking to a number of people whom I know--not just \nladies either--who have had cancer, once you have had cancer and you \nare in remission, you would actually prefer to have your screening a \nlittle bit earlier for the mental reassurance you get with it.\n  Again, from talking to people--and we have talked to more now because \nwe are trying to give some reassurances to them when this terrible word \ncomes up--when they go to the doctor, one of the first things that \nhappens is they weigh in, they take your blood pressure. When you are \nwaiting for a decision on how the blood test you got turned out or the \nMRI you got turned out or whatever it was, that blood pressure goes \nthrough the roof. Quite frequently, you cannot leave the doctor's \noffice until you have--you went there for the information, so, of \ncourse, you stay for the information, but they will not let you leave \nuntil they do the blood pressure test again, to make sure it goes down \nbelow the critical stage. That is how much impact this has on people.\n  So I am glad the Senator did something that goes a little bit \nfurther, covers a few more things, and makes sure people have access to \ntheir doctor, to the tests they need, and not to be relying on some \ngovernment bureaucracy to say: Well, in 99 percent of the cases or 85 \npercent of the cases--who knows how far down they will take it, \ndepending on what the costs are. We do not want that to happen.\n  I think the Senator's amendment allows patients to get these \npreventive benefits and stops government bureaucrats and outside \nexperts from ever blocking patients' access to those types of services.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Maryland who put up an amendment. I do \nnot think it meets that standard. They still rely on government experts \ncalled the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to decide what \npreventive benefits should be covered under private health insurance. \nThis is the same Preventive Services Task Force that made this decision \nthat women under the age of 50 should not receive annual mammograms.\n\n  In fact, I think I even remember in there that they were not \nnecessarily recommending self-examination. Most people I know who are \nvery young discovered it with self-examination. I certainly would not \nwant them to quit doing that because there is a recommendation from \nsomebody who does not understand them or their body.\n  Patients do want to receive preventive screenings. Sometimes they are \na little reluctant to do it because nobody wants the possibility of \nhearing that word given to them.\n  Americans should be able to get screened for high blood pressure and \ndiabetes when a doctor recommends they get these tests. I think the \nSenator and I agree they should be able to get colonoscopies, prostate \nexams, and mammograms, so they can prevent deadly cancers from \nprogressing to the point where they are no longer curable. Many of \nthese diseases are preventable or curable or can be put into remission \nif they are discovered early enough.\n  I think we agree with Senator Mikulski's goal that all Americans \nshould be able to get preventive benefits, but we disagree that her \namendment achieves that stated goal. Her amendment does not ensure \naccess to mammograms for women who are under the age of 50. Part of \nthat I am taking from an Associated Press article.\n  As most Americans know, last month the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce revised the recommendations for screening for breast cancer, \nadvising women between the ages of 40 and 49 against receiving routine \nmammograms and women ages 50 and over to receive a mammogram just once \nevery 2 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force lowered its \ngrade for these screenings to a C.\n  That sparked the political firestorm, as many women became confused \nabout what services they could get and when they could get them. The \nhealth care bills before Congress further confused the issue because \nthey rely heavily on the recommendations of the task force. That is \nwhat is in the bill. The underlying Reid bill says--and the Mikulski \namendment restates--that all health plans must cover preventive \nservices that receive an A or B grade from the task force. Let's see, \nwe just said that was a C grade.\n  Because breast cancer screenings for women under the age of 50 are no \nlonger classified by the task force as an A or B, plans would not have \nto cover those services. So Senator Mikulski drafted an amendment to \ntry to fix this problem, but I think it confuses the matter some more.\n  I say to the Senator, I appreciate the effort you have gone to, to \ntry to clarify that and expand it to some other areas--and to not add \nanother layer of bureaucracy--by saying that all services and \nscreenings must be covered by health plans.\n  However, the previous amendment does not have any guidelines that are \nspecifically for women or prevention.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If I may comment on the Senator's last statement, this \nis very important for people to understand. There has been much said \nabout the Mikulski amendment and what it does or does not do. But it is \nvery important for women to understand the Mikulski amendment will not \nprovide for those mammograms for women who are younger than age 50. Her \namendment specifically provides that it is ``evidence-based items or \nservices that have in effect a rating of `A' or `B' in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force.''\n  So you go to the task force report, and as the Senator has noted, \nwomen who fall between the ages of 40 and 49 receive a grade of a C, \nand the recommendation is, specifically: Do not screen routinely. \nIndividualized decision to begin biannual screening, according to the \npatient's context and values. But they have received a C designation by \nUSPSTF.\n  According to the Mikulski amendment, those women who are younger than \n50 years of age will not be eligible\n\n[[Page S12130]]\n\nor will not be covered under the mandatory screening requirement she \nhas set forth in her amendment.\n  I think where she was trying to go was to ensure that these \nrecommendations would not be used to deny coverage. She adds a \nparagraph stating that nothing shall preclude health plans from \ncovering additional services recommended by the task force that are \neither not an A or a B recommendation. But the amendment does not \nrequire plans to cover services that are not an A or a B. In other \nwords, if you are 45 years of age, you are in this C category, and the \namendment does not require, then, that your preventive screening \nservices be covered. So for those women who are in this age group--\nCongresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz just went through a recent bout \nof cancer, and I think that was diagnosed at age 41. For those women \nwho fall into this category, this amendment the Senator from Maryland \nhas introduced does not address the concerns that have been raised by \nthese recommendations coming out of this preventive task force. Again, \nI think we need to understand that what this amendment specifically \nallows for is first-dollar coverage for immunizations for children, \nchildren's health services as outlined with the HRSA--Human Resources \nServices Administration--guideline. But, in fact, the requirement to \nprovide for screening coverage for women who are not in this A or B \ncategory--in other words, anybody younger than 50--we need to \nunderstand is not covered through this.\n\n  Our amendment, through allowing for a level of transparency, ensures \nthat when you go to obtain your insurance, you can see very clearly \nwhat the professional medical organizations recommended are the \nguidelines and then what your insurer is proposing to offer you for \nyour coverage. If it is not coverage you like, then shop around. This \nis what this insurance exchange is supposed to be all about.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Alaska also.\n  Isn't it true that the Senator's amendment ensures that the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services won't be able to deny any of these \nservices based on any recommendation? That is one of the things we have \nbeen concerned about. Again, that is an unelected bureaucrat who could \ncome between you and your doctor and your health care. I know the \nSenator has covered that in her amendment, too, and I do appreciate it.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It states very clearly on the second page that the \nSecretary shall not use any recommendation made by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to deny coverage and items serviced by a group \nhealth plan or a health insurance issuer. So, yes, we make it very \nclear that these recommendations from the USPSTF cannot be used to deny \ncoverage.\n  I think the opportunity to have medical professionals, as this USPSTF \nis comprised of--we should have an entity that is kind of looking out \nand seeing what best practices are. But then that entity should not be \nthe one that causes a determination as to whether coverage is going to \nbe offered. You can use that as a resource, most certainly, just as we \nuse as a resource the recommendation from, say, for instance, the \nAmerican Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nCollege of Surgeons, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, but it \nis not going to be the determining factor. I think that is where we \nneed to make that separation, where my amendment separates from Senator \nMikulski's.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also appreciate that the Senator from \nAlaska makes sure they can't deny care based on comparative \neffectiveness research, which actually was part of the stimulus bill \nthat was run through at that point in time, and finally that the \nSenator's amendment includes a commonsense provision that would \nprohibit the Secretary from ever determining that abortion is a \npreventive service.\n  So I hope all of my colleagues, whether they are pro-life or pro-\nchoice, would support this change to ensure that the controversial \nissues don't sidetrack the debate on the preventive issues because what \nwe are talking about is the preventive issues, and I appreciate the \nSenator covering that.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I am glad the Senator mentioned the issue of the \nabortion services. I think there is a vagueness in the amendment \nSenator Mikulski has offered. Some have suggested that it would allow \nthose in the Human Resources Services Administration, HRSA, to define \nabortions as a preventive test, which could provide that health \ninsurance plans then be mandated to cover it. That has generated some \nconcern, obviously. Some have opposed the amendment, saying that if \nCongress were to grant any executive branch entity sweeping authority \nto define services that private plans must then cover, merely by \ndeclaring a given service to constitute preventive care, then that \nauthority could be employed in the future to require all health plans \nto cover abortions.\n  So all we are doing with my amendment is just making very clear there \nare no vagaries, there is no second-guessing. It just makes very clear \nthat the Secretary cannot make that determination that preventive \nservices are to include abortion services.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as I said before, my wife says that she had \nprobably never mentioned the word ``colon'' twice in her whole life, \nand since then she has become an encyclopedia for people who have a \nvery similar problem. She had a colonoscopy a short time before. She \nwas still having problems, and they had said there is no problem, but \nshe kept getting it checked until she found that there was a problem. \nSo people need to listen to their bodies, and they need to listen to \ntheir doctors, and they shouldn't have a bureaucrat coming in between \nthat. So I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator for the dialog here today. I think \nthis is an important part of our discussion as we debate health care \nreform on the floor. We have had good conversations already yesterday \nand today about the cuts to Medicare, the impact we will feel as a \nnation if these substantive cuts advance. But I think this discussion--\nand we are narrowing it so much on what the recommendations have been \nfrom this task force, but I think it is a good preview of what the \nAmerican people can expect if we move in the direction of government-\nrun health care, of bureaucrats, whether it is the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services or whether it is task forces that have been \nappointed by those in the administration, who are then able to make \nthat determination as to what is best for you and your health care and \nyour family's health care.\n  I think the discussion we have had today about ensuring that it is \nnot best left to these entities, these appointed entities to make these \ndeterminations, but let's leave it to--or let's allow the information \nto come to us from the medical professionals. Senator Coburn has spoken \nso eloquently on the floor about relying on those who really know and \nunderstand, who live this and who practice this, rather than us as \npoliticians who want to be doctors. I don't want to be a doctor. I want \nto be able to rely on the good judgment of a provider I trust, and I \nwant him or her to be able to make those decisions based on their \nunderstanding of me and my health care needs and what is best for me \nand what the best practices are that are out there, rather than having \na task force telling them: That is the protocol for Lisa. She is 52. \nShe is able to get a mammogram every other year now. I want to know \nthat it is me and my doctor who are making these decisions.\n  I hope Members will take a look at the amendment I will offer and \nconsider how it allows for truly that kind of openness, that kind of \ntransparency, and gives individuals the freedom of choice in their \nhealth care that I think we all want.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Stabenow, Senator Dodd, and I be allowed to engage \nin a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Presiding Officer. I am delighted to be \non the floor, along with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, who has worked \nso hard on these issues.\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\n  I am sure I am not going to be the only person to say this, but I \nwould like to respond briefly to the colloquy that just took place \nbetween the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Alaska because, \nas I understand it, the Mikulski amendment provides for preventive \nservices that are in the A and B category as a floor, not a ceiling, at \na minimum, and it instructs the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration to provide recommendations and guidelines for \ncomprehensive women's preventive care and screenings. Once that is \ndone, then all plans would be required to be totally apart from the A \nor the B.\n  In terms of the Health Resources and Services Administration being an \nentity that wants to get between you and your doctor, these are \nactually scientists, not bureaucrats. It is an independent panel.\n  I think it comes with some irony to hear the concern expressed on the \nother side of the aisle repeatedly about bureaucrats coming between \nAmericans and their doctors and telling them what care they can and \ncannot have when my experience in Rhode Island leading up to this \ndebate, the Presiding Officer's experience in Illinois leading up to \nthis debate, Senator Stabenow's experience in Michigan leading up to \nthis debate--all of our experience in our home States leading up to \nthis debate--has been that the problem has been that the private for-\nprofit insurance industry is out there denying care every chance it \ngets.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Illinois was presiding when I \ntold the story of a family member of mine who died recently who was \ndiagnosed with a very serious condition. He went to the National \nInstitutes of Health to get the best possible treatment. He got the \nbest specialist on his particular diagnosis in the country, and when he \ntook that back to New York, his insurance company said: I am sorry, \nthat is not the indicated care. That is just one experience I have had. \nHundreds of Rhode Islanders have been in touch with me about their \nnightmare stories over and over again, whether it is because you have a \npreexisting condition and they won't insure you; or once you get \ndiagnosed, they won't authorize your doctor to proceed with the care \nyou need; or even if you go ahead and get the care, they will do \neverything they can to avoid paying the doctor and create every kind of \nadministrative, bureaucratic headache for the doctor. The private \ninsurance industry is standing between you and the care you need.\n  I have not once--not once since I have been here--heard anybody on \nthe other side of the aisle express any concern about the bureaucrat \nbetween you and your doctor as long as it is an insurance company \nbureaucrat. It seems to me they actually approve of bureaucrats getting \nbetween you and your doctor as long as it is a bureaucrat who is an \ninsurance company bureaucrat who has a profit motive to deny you health \ncare. Then it is OK. Then they don't complain. But when it is \nindependent scientists working hard to generate the best science that \ncan be done so that people get the best information to make decisions, \nthen suddenly we hear about bureaucrats.\n  I think the people listening to this should have that history in mind \nas they evaluate this claim that we are trying to put bureaucrats \nbetween Americans and their doctors. By stripping the abuses away from \nthe insurance company, this bill does more to relieve that problem than \nany other piece of legislation I can think of.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island because I \ncouldn't agree more with what he just said in terms of who is standing \nbetween, in this case, a woman and her doctor or any patient and their \ndoctor.\n  Right now, I assume the Senator would agree with me that the first \nperson, unfortunately, the doctor may have to call is the insurance \ncompany to see whether he can treat somebody, to see what it is going \nto cost, is it covered. Right now, we know that half the women in this \ncountry, in fact, postpone, delay getting the preventive care they need \nbecause they can't afford it. So the amendment from the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland is all about making sure women can get the \npreventive care we need, whether it is the mammogram, whether it is the \ncervical cancer screenings, whether it is focused on pregnancy.\n  Would the Senator from Rhode Island agree that right now in the \nmarketplace, I understand that about 60 percent of the insurance \ncompanies in the individual market don't cover maternity care?\n  They don't cover prenatal care. They don't cover maternity care, \nlabor and delivery, and health care through the first year of a child's \nlife. That is standing between a woman, her child, and her doctor. That \nis the ultimate standing between a woman and her doctor, since they \nwere not going to cover that.\n  I think one of the most important things we are doing in this \nlegislation is to have as basic coverage--something as basic as \nmaternity care. When we are 29th in the world in the number of babies \nthat make it through the first year of life, that live through the \nfirst year of life, that is something we should all be extremely \noutraged about, concerned about.\n  This legislation is about expanding health care coverage, preventive \ncare, making sure babies and moms can get prenatal care, that babies \nhave every chance in the world to make it through the first year of \nlife because we have adequate care there. Yet the ultimate standing \nbetween a woman and her doctor is the insurance company saying: We \ndon't think maternity coverage is basic care.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is the business model of the private health \ninsurance industry now. They want to cherry-pick out anybody who might \nbe sick, and that is why we have the preexisting condition exclusion.\n  Then they have an absolute army of insurance company officials whose \njob it is to deny care. I went to the Cranston, RI, community health \ncenter a few months ago. It is a small community health center \nproviding health care in the Cranston, RI, area. It doesn't have a \ngreat big budget. I asked them how difficult it is to deal with the \ninsurance companies in order to get approval and get claims paid. They \nsaid: Well, Senator, 50 percent of our personnel are engaged not in \nproviding health care but in fighting with the insurance industry to \nget permission for care and to get claims paid.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator repeat that to me? That is astounding. \nHe said 50 percent?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes. Half of the staff of the community health center \nwas dedicated to fighting with the insurance industry, and the other \nhalf was actually providing the health care.\n  In addition, they had to have a contract for experts, consultants, to \nhelp fight against the insurance industry. That was another $200,000--\n$200,000 for a little community health center, plus half of their \nstaff.\n  What we have seen in the past 8 years is that the administrative \nexpense of the insurance industry has doubled. That is what they are \ndoing. It is like an arms race. They put on more people to try to \nprevent you from getting care because it saves them money when they do. \nThey have a profit motive to deny people.\n  In the case of a member of my family whom they tried to deny, he had \nthe fortitude to fight back and eventually they caved. But for every \nperson like him who fights and gets the coverage they paid for and are \nentitled to, some will be too ill, too frightened, too old, too weak, \ntoo confused, or some simply don't have the resources, when they are \nburdened with a terrible diagnosis like that, to fight on two fronts. \nSo they give up and the insurance company makes money.\n  It is systematized. Not once have I heard anybody on the other side \nof the aisle in the Senate complain about that. It is a scandal across \nthis country. It is the way they do business. I don't think there is a \nperson on the Senate floor who hasn't heard a story of a friend or a \nloved one or somebody they know and care about who has been through \nthat process. It is not hypothetical. It is happening now, and it is \nhappening to all of us. But it is only when we come in and try to fight \nthat suddenly this concern is raised, this ``oh my gosh, you are going \nto get bureaucrats.'' But they happen to have no\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\nprofit motive. They will work for the government and will be trying to \ndo the right thing and be experts. But suddenly it is no good.\n  Ms. STABENOW. As the Senator has said eloquently, we have all had \nsituations like this happen in our families. Everybody listening and \neverybody involved in the Senate family has certainly had that happen \nto us. I have found it very interesting; every Tuesday morning we \ninvite people from Michigan who are in town, to come by and we do \nsomething called ``Good Morning, Michigan.''\n  Not long ago, a woman came in and said:\n\n       I'm finally excited. I am 65 and now I can choose my own \n     doctor because I am going to be on Medicare.\n\n  Medicare is a single-payer, government-run health care system. I \ncould not get my mother's Medicare card away from her if I had to \nwrestle her to the ground because, in fact, it has worked. It is \nfocused on providing health care. That is their mission.\n  One of the things I think is indicative of the whole for-profit \nhealth care system--by the way, we are the only ones in the world who \nhave a for-profit health care system--is when they talk as an industry, \nthey talk about the ``medical loss ratio.'' The medical loss ratio is \nhow much they have to pay out on your health care. So the language of \nthe insurance industry--now, it is different if there is a car accident \nor if your home is on fire. We understand you don't want to pay out for \na car accident or for a home fire. But in this case, we have an \ninstitution set up, through which most of us--we have over 82 percent \nof us in the private for-profit insurance market through our employers. \nWe are in a system where the provider, the insurance company, calls it \na ``medical loss'' if they have to pay out on your insurance. I think \nthat alone is something that, to me, sends a very big red flag, if they \nare trying to keep their medical loss ratio down.\n  We have in this legislation been doing things to keep that up. We \nwant them to be paying out for most of the dollars paid on a premium in \nhealth care so the people are getting the health care they are paying \nfor. That is what this legislation is all about. But as my friend from \nRhode Island has indicated, point by point, when we look at every \namendment in the Finance Committee--I would say virtually every \namendment from our colleagues on the Republican side--and when we look \nat the amendments so far on the floor of the Senate, the first two \nbeing offered are about protecting the for-profit insurance companies, \nmaking sure excessive payments that are currently going out for for-\nprofit companies under Medicare continue; making sure we are protecting \nthe industry's ability--not the doctor's ability to decide what care \nyou need, when you need it, and so on, but the insurance company's \nability to decide what they will pay for, what is covered, when you \nwill get it--and, by the way, if you get too sick, they will find a \ntechnicality and they will drop you.\n  All of those things we are addressing are to protect patients, \nprotect taxpayers, consumers, in this legislation. Would the Senator \nnot agree?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I do.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The sign behind the Senator is right. It is about \nsaving lives, money, and Medicare.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As the Senator noted, there is an astonishing \nsimilarity between the interests of the private health insurance \nindustry and the arguments made by our friends on the other side on the \nfloor. It is amazing. They are identical, virtually, to one another. I \nhave yet to hear an argument about health care coming from the other \nside of the aisle that does not reflect the interests and the welfare \nof the private insurance industry, about which for years I never heard \nthem complain while they were denying care.\n  We have another example beyond Medicare. I am struck that today is \nthe first day since the President's speech in which he announced \nanother 30,000 men and women will be going over to Afghanistan in \naddition to the ones there. All of us in the Senate and in America are \nproud of our soldiers. We wish them well. Those of us who have visited \nAfghanistan know how challenging an environment it is and how difficult \nit is to be away from one's family. There can be no doubt in our minds \nthat we want the best for our men and women in the service. Everybody \nagrees we want the best for them. Our friends on the other side also \nwant the best for them.\n  When we give them health care, what do we give them that we think is \nthe best? We give them government health care through TRICARE and \nthrough the Veterans' Administration. I have not heard a lot of \ncomplaining about that, about stripping our veterans out of the \nVeterans' Administration and letting them go to the tender mercies of \nthe private health insurance industry because when there is not an \nissue that involves the essential interests of the private health \ninsurance industry, then they will do the right thing and recognize \nthat is best for our service men and women. That is best for our \nveterans and, of course, we all support that. It makes perfect sense. \nIt belies the arguments we are hearing today.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I totally agree with the Senator. I thank him for his \ncomments. What I find even more perplexing is that what we have on the \nfloor is not a single-payer system, even though some of us would \nsupport that. It is not. It is, in fact, building on the private system \nbut creating more accountability. We are not saying there would not be \na private insurance industry. What we are doing is saying that small \nbusinesses and individuals who cannot find affordable insurance today \nshould be able to pool together in a larger risk pool. That has been, \nin fact, a Republican and Democratic idea going back years.\n  We are saying if they want to be able to ask us to cover these folks, \nwe are saying to the insurance companies they have to stop the \ninsurance abuses. We are not saying they can't offer insurance. In \nfact, this is a model like the Federal employee health care model, \nwhere people who don't have insurance today can get a better deal in a \ngroup pool, like a big business and a small business and individuals \nwill purchase from private insurance companies. Many of us believe \nthere ought to be a public option in there as well. But we are talking \nabout private insurance companies participating.\n  All we are saying is, wait a minute. If you are going to have access \nto the individuals that now will have the opportunity to buy insurance, \nwe want those rates to be down, and we want them to be affordable. We \nwant to make sure there are no preexisting conditions. We want to know \nthat if somebody pays a premium every month, and then somebody gets \nsick, that they don't get dropped on some technicality. We want to make \nsure that women aren't charged twice as much as men, which in many \ncases is happening today. Sometimes there is less coverage. We want to \nmake sure maternity care is considered basic, that women's health is \nconsidered a basic part of a health insurance policy. We are not saying \nwe are eliminating the private sector. We are not going to the VA model \nor even the Medicare model.\n  This is reasonable, modest, and should be widely supported on a \nbipartisan basis. These ideas have come from both Democrats and \nRepublicans over the years, and yet we still get arguments that are \nwholly and completely protecting the interests of an industry that we \nare, in fact, trying to engage and provide affordable health care \ninsurance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, who has the floor? We are all talking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized. A \ncolloquy was going on and it was terrific.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask my colleagues, is it not true that basically in \nAmerica, although all of America spends about $2.5 trillion on health \ncare, basically it is 50/50. It is 41 or 42 percent public and about 60 \npercent private. We in America have roughly a 50-50 system today; is \nthat right?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I say to our colleague that I believe that is the case. \nIn my State, we have 60 percent in the private market through \nemployers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This legislation before us basically retains that current \ndivision. What we are doing is coming up with uniquely American ideas. \nWe are not Great Britain, France, or Canada. We are roughly 50-50--a \nlittle more private in fact. In 2007, it was 46 percent public and \nabout 54 percent private. Roughly, that is where we are. It might \nchange ever so slightly. But we are not those other countries, we are \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\n  This legislation before us maintains that philosophy; is that \ncorrect?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. In fact, I think it invites the private \nsector to participate in a new marketplace.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may interject, I add that it is a relatively \nfamiliar American principle to put public and private agencies side by \nside in competition, in fair competition, and let the best for the \nconsumer win. We see it in public universities. Many of us have States \nwith public universities that we are very proud of. They compete with \nprivate universities. I think every one of us has a public university \nin our State, and it is a model that works very well in education. Many \nof us--unfortunately not in Rhode Island--have public power authorities \nthat compete with the private power industry.\n  In fact, some of the most ardent opponents of a public option go home \nand buy their electricity from a public electric cooperative or a \npublic power authority. We see it in workers compensation insurance. A \nlot of health care is delivered through workers compensation insurance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. But isn't that a pretty good system--don't put too many \neggs in one basket? Doesn't each keep the others on their toes a little \nbit?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think it is the oldest principle of competition, as \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee pointed out.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Doesn't this legislation provide for more competition \nthan currently exists?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think it does.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For example, with exchanges, with health insurance market \nreform and with the ratings reform.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. All of those, and a public option. All of that adds \nto a better environment. One of the interesting things about this is \nyou only have a good and fair market. America is founded on market \nprinciples. We all believe in market principles. One of the things \nabout the market is that people will cheat on it if there are not rules \naround the market. If you don't make sure that the bread is good, \nhonest, healthy bread, some rascal will come and will sell cheap, \nlousy, contaminated bread in the market. You have to have discipline \nand walls to protect the integrity of the market.\n  That is what the health insurance market has lacked. That is overdue. \nI think it will enliven the market in health insurance and animate the \nmarket principle.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask my colleagues, is there anything in this \nlegislation which will interfere with the doctor-patient relationship; \nthat is, to date people choose their own doctors, whichever doctor they \nwant. They can, by and large, go to the hospital they want, although \nthe doctor may send them to another hospital. Is there anything in this \nlegislation that diminishes that freedom of choice patients would have \nto choose their doctor?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Nothing.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may add, I think one of the most telling ways to \napproach that is the fact that the American Medical Association, the \nphysicians in this country, support what we are doing. They are the \nlast ones who would support putting somebody--somebody else, I should \nsay, because I believe we have insurance company bureaucrats frequently \nbetween our doctors and patients--but they would not be supporting us \nif it were doing what we have been hearing it is doing.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What about the procedures doctors might want to choose \nfor their patients? Is there anything in this legislation which \ninterferes with the decision a physician might make as to which \nprocedure to prescribe, in consultation with his or her patient?\n  Ms. STABENOW. As a member of the Finance Committee with the \ndistinguished chairman, we have heard nothing. We have written nothing \nthat would in any way interfere with procedures. In fact, I believe \nthrough the fact we are making insurance more affordable, we are going \nto make more procedures available because more people will be able to \nafford to get the care they need.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The American Academy of Family Physicians and the \nAmerican Nurses Association support this legislation because they know \nthat instead of interfering between the doctor and the patient, we are \nactually lifting out the interference that presently exists at the \nhands of the private insurance for-profit industry between the patient \nand the doctor. They want to see this, and that is one of the important \nreasons.\n  Another important reason, something the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee is very responsible for, beginning all the way back \nat the start of this year when the Finance Committee, under his \nleadership, had the ``prepare to launch'' full-day effort on delivery \nsystem reform.\n  What you will see is doctors empowered in new ways to provide better \ncare, to have better information.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might ask my friend--that is very true--Could he \nexplain maybe how doctors may be, in this legislation, empowered to \nhave better information to help them provide even better care? What are \nsome of the provisions?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There are a great number of ways and much of it is \nthanks to the chairman's leadership and Chairman Dodd on the HELP \nCommittee. We put together a strong package melded by Leader Reid. The \nmain ingredients are taking advantage of electronic health records so \nyou are not running around with a paper record, you are not having to \nfill out that clipboard again, they are not having to do another \nexpensive MRI because they cannot access the one you had last week. If \nyou have drugs you are taking, the drug interactions that might harm \nyou will be caught by the computer and signal the doctor so they can be \naware of it and make a decision whether to change the medication. The \nelectronic health record is a part of that.\n  Investment in quality reform is a huge issue. Hospital-acquired \ninfections are prevalent throughout this country. They cost about \n$60,000 each on average. They are completely preventable. Nobody knows \nthis better than Senator Stabenow from Michigan because it was in her \nhome State that the Keystone Project began, which has since migrated \naround the country. It has gone statewide in my home State through the \nRhode Island Quality Institute. It has been written up by the health \ncare writer Dr. Atul Gawande in the New Yorker magazine. What the \ninformation from Senator Stabenow's home State of Michigan shows is \nthat in 15 months, they saved 1,500 lives in intensive care units and \nover $150 million by better procedures to prevent hospital-acquired \ninfections.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may add to that--and I thank the chairman for \nputting in language on the Keystone initiative in the bill--in this \nbill, we are, in fact, expanding what has been learned about saving \nlives and saving money by focusing on cutting down on infections in the \nintensive care units, by focusing on surgical procedures, things that \nactually will save dollars, don't cost a lot, and save lives. But they \ninvolve thinking a little differently, working a little bit differently \nas a team. Our physicians, hospitals, and nurses have found that if \nthey made quality a priority, it became a priority.\n  There are so many things in this legislation that will save money, \nsave lives, increase quality, and that is what this is all about, which \nis why so broadly we see the health care community, all the providers, \nnurses, doctors, and so on, supporting what we are doing.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is important not to overpromise because some \nof these initiatives, some of these programs will take a little time to \ntake effect. In fact, some of the provisions do not take effect for a \ncouple, 3 years. But still, wouldn't my colleagues agree that some of \nthese are going to probably yield tremendous dividends in the future, \nespecially generally the focus on quality, not outcomes, reimbursing \nphysicians and hospitals based on quality, not outcomes, the pilot \nprojects, the bundling, the counter care organizations and other \nsimilar efforts in this legislation. One of the two or both may want to \ncomment on that point. I think it is a point worth making.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is a very important point. Again, this is not \nsomething that emerged suddenly or overnight. The distinguished Senator \nfrom the Finance Committee has been working hard on this a long time, \nback even before ``prepare to launch,'' which is an early reflection of \nthe work he has been doing.\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\n  As we look at this bill, and as people who have been watching this \ndebate have seen, this legislation saves lives, saves money, and saves \nmedicine. We can vouch for that through the findings of the \nCongressional Budget Office. But the Congressional Budget Office has \nbeen very conservative in its scoring.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Very.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There is a letter the CBO wrote to Senator Conrad. \nThere is testimony and a colloquy he engaged in with me in the Budget \nCommittee that makes clear that beyond the savings that are clear from \nthis legislation, there is a promise of immense further savings. What \nhe said is:\n\n       Changes in government policy--\n\n  Such as these----\n\n     have the potential to yield large reductions in both national \n     health expenditures and Federal health care spending without \n     harming health. Moreover, many experts agree on some general \n     directions in which the government's health policies could \n     move.\n\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has developed those general \ndirections through those hearings and it is now in the legislation. But \nthe conclusion he reaches is:\n\n       The specific changes that might ultimately prove most \n     important cannot be foreseen today and could be developed \n     only over time through experimentation and learning.\n\n  The MIT report that came out the other day, Professor Gerber, Dr. \nGerber said the toolbox to achieve these savings through \nexperimentation and learning is in this bill. I think his phrase was \neverything you could ask for is in this bill.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee knows better \nthan I do, there are big numbers at stake here. If you look at what \nPresident Obama's Council on Economic Advisers has estimated, there is \n$700 billion a year--when we talk numbers, we usually multiply by 10 \nbecause it is a 10-year window. So when people say there is this much \nin the bill, it is over 10 years. This is 1 year, $700 billion in \nwaste.\n  The New England Health Care Institute estimated $850 billion annually \nin excess costs and waste. The Lewin Group, which has a relatively good \nopinion around here, and George Bush's former Treasury Secretary, \nSecretary O'Neill, have estimated it is over $1 trillion a year. So \nwhether it is $700 billion or $850 billion or $1 trillion, even if \nthese tools in the toolbox that we will refine through learning and \nexperimentation achieve only a third, it is $200 billion or $300 \nbillion a year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right. Some people are worried, perhaps, gee, there they \ngo back there in Congress. They talk about waste--which is good; we \nwant to get rid of waste. But then when they talk about waste, they \ntalk about cutting out the waste, some think: Gee, if they are cutting \nout the waste and they are cutting health care reimbursements, gee, \nwon't that hurt health care in America? Won't that harm health care in \nAmerica? Won't that reduce quality? If they are cutting so much, $600 \nbillion, $700 billion, $800 billion--that is a lot of money--aren't \nthey going to start cutting quality health care in America?\n  I see my good friend, the chairman of the HELP Committee, on the \nfloor. He may want to join in this discussion as well, adding different \npoints as to why the legislation we are putting together increases \nquality, does not cut quality, but it increases quality at the same \ntime it reduces waste. I wonder if my colleagues might comment on all \nof that because it is an extremely, I think, important point to drive \nhome our legislation improves quality health care.\n  Mr. DODD. I was going to raise the point, I say to my colleague and \nchairman of the Finance Committee, that there are a lot of good things \nabout our health care system. We want to start off acknowledging that \nour providers, doctors do a magnificent, wonderful job. But we also \nknow the system is fundamentally broken because it is based on quantity \nrather than quality.\n  That is my question. There is a question mark at the end of it. It is \nmy opinion that is what it is. In other words, doctors and hospitals--\nthe system--are rewarded based on how many patients you see, how many \nhospital beds are filled, how many tests get done, how many screenings \nare provided along the way. So it is all based on quantity. The more \nquantity you have, the system survives. Inherent in that is the \nquestion, if that is what drives the system, only quantity, then \nobviously what you are going to end up doing is have a sick care \nsystem, not a health care system.\n  If we asked, what are you trying to do over all--to fundamentally \nshift from a quantity-based system to a quality-based system where we \ntry to keep people out of doctors' offices, out of hospitals, out of \nsituations where they need to be there. That is what we are trying to \nachieve. To do that, we need to incentivize the system in reverse. The \nincentives today are to fill all these places. We are trying to \nincentivize by keeping people healthier, living a better health style, \nstopping smoking, losing weight, eating better food--all of these \nthings that are not only good for you but overall save money. Am I \nwrong?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think my colleague is exactly right. As he was \nspeaking, I was thinking of that article a lot of us have referred to \noften, the June 1 New Yorker article by Atul Gawande, comparing El \nPaso, TX, and McAllen, TX. They are both border towns. In El Paso, \nhealth care expenditures per person are about half what they are in \nMcAllen. And yet the outcomes in El Paso are better than they are in \nMcAllen.\n  One might ask: Why in the world is that happening? Why is there twice \nas much spent in McAllen than El Paso and the outcomes are different? \nThe answer is we have a system which allows the McAllens in the system, \nthat allows payment in basic quantity and volume as opposed to quality.\n  I believe it depends on the community what the culture is. Some \ncommunities have a culture of patient-focused care. The current system \nallows that, but, unfortunately, if the culture in the community is \nmore to make money, our reimbursement system today allows for that as \nwell. So I think one of the things we are trying to do is to get more \nquality in the system--reimbursement to pay doctors and hospitals--more \nquality, as you have said--and that is going to even out a lot of the \ngeographic disparities that have occurred in the country over time and \nso the quality will increase and the cost and the waste will decrease.\n\n  Mr. DODD. One last question I wished to raise, if I could, because \nour colleague from Montana said something yesterday that I think \ndeserves being repeated, as I understood him, on the point he just made \nabout the Gawande piece, which did that comparison between McAllen, TX, \nin Hidalgo County, which is the poorest county in the United States, \nand El Paso, and then I think you talked about Minnesota as well.\n  There is a fellow by the name of Don Berwick, a doctor who is an \nexpert on integrated care, and one of the things he says--and I think \nyou said this yesterday it deserves being repeated--it isn't just at \nthe Cleveland Clinic or the Mayo Clinic where this happens--that kind \nof culture that exists at community hospitals and small hospitals all \nover the country where they have figured out integrated care; that is \nwhere doctors and hospitals have figured out how to provide services \nand reduce costs.\n  I have 31 hospitals in my State, and similar to all our colleagues, I \nhave been visiting many of them and talking to people. Manchester \nCommunity Hospital is a very small hospital in Manchester, CT--a \ncommunity hospital--and they have reduced costs and increased quality \nbecause they have figured out, between the provider physicians and the \nhospital, how to do that. My point is--and your point is--this is \nhappening all across America in many places, and we need to be \nrewarding that when it occurs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is no doubt about that. In fact, it is interesting \nthe Senator mentioned his name because not too long ago I asked him \nthat question. I said: Why, Dr. Berwick, is it that in some communities \nthey get it and some they do not? His answer was that sometimes there \nis somebody--maybe it is a hospital or someone who is a pretty dominant \nplayer--who kind of starts it out and gets it right, and that is true.\n  He invited 10 integrated systems to Washington, DC, to kind of talk \nover what works and what doesn't work.\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\nThese are not the big-named institutions; they are the lesser named \ninstitutions. In fact, one of them I can probably say is the Billings \nClinic, in Billings, MT--not too widely known, but they participated \nlast year--the same process and integration with the docs, the acute \ncare, and the postacute care. They have significantly cut costs, they \nhave significantly improved the quality, and they are very proud of \nwhat they have done.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I offer a specific example from the bill as an \nillustration of this?\n  One of the very few areas in which the Congressional Budget Office is \nprepared to document savings from these quality improvements is in the \narea of hospital readmissions. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nworked very hard to get hospital readmission language in his bill, I \nthink we had it in the HELP bill as well, Chairman Dodd, and it is in \nthe bill Leader Reid put together. What it does is it strips, over 10 \nyears, $7 billion--I think is the number--$7 billion of money that \nhospitals would otherwise be paid when somebody gets out of the \nhospital and is readmitted within 30 days for the same condition.\n  The reason they are willing to apply those savings is because now you \ncan demonstrate that if you have better prerelease planning, then \npeople will go out and they will do better on their own. They will do \nbetter at home or they will do better in a nursing home, and therefore \nthey will not come back. So you save lives because the health care is \nbetter, and you save money because they do not come back to the \nhospital. You improve on the front end. The hospital will do that. They \nwill invest and improve on the front end because they don't want to pay \non the back end if they are not recovering their costs with the \nreadmission. It is a win-win for everyone. The individual American who \nhas to be readmitted to the hospital and undergo, once again, all the \nprocedures and all the risks that being in a hospital entails because \nhe or she didn't get a proper discharge plan is not helped out by \nhaving to go back to the hospital.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have very direct experience in this. My mother was in \nthe hospital 3 years ago--in another hospital, not the Billings \nClinic--and there was no discharge plan. There was no way to help \ndeliver health care for her when she left the hospital and went into a \nrehab center--sort of a nursing home. Sure enough, she didn't get the \nproper meds, she didn't get the proper attention, the doctor did not \nsee her every day or after that, and, lo and behold, she had to be \nreadmitted to the hospital. She had a gastrointestinal issue, and, sure \nenough, they took care of her back in the hospital. But once she was \ndischarged, they did it right. They improved upon the mistakes they had \nmade.\n  So I saw it firsthand, and it irritated the dickens out of me, \nfrankly, in seeing how they did not pay sufficient attention to my \nmother. If this happens to my mother, my gosh, I bet it is even worse \nin lots of other situations.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleagues will yield, I wished to thank Senator \nWhitehouse, who was on our committee for the duration of our markup and \nhe did a stunning job. He was a very valuable member of the committee \nand he made some wonderful suggestions to our bill all the way through \nthe process.\n  I was told the other night by a friend of mine--Jack Conners, who is \nvery involved in Boston and sits on the board and chairs the board of \nthe hospitals in Boston--I think my colleague from Rhode Island may \nrecognize the name--the average elderly person discharged from the \nhospital gets, on average, four medications--on average. Within 1 \nmonth, that individual, in most cases living alone, maybe with someone \nelse, but on in years and so less capable of understanding it all, is \nbasically not taking the four medications--or only taking parts of \nthem--and finding themselves right back in the hospital as a \nreadmission.\n  In our bill, we do a little bit to address that, and I think there is \nsome effort in the Finance Committee bill through telemedicine--there \nare ways now through technology to provide some advice. This might not \nbe a bad idea in terms of employment issues. It wouldn't take much to \ntrain people to be a home health care provider and to stop in. Your \nmother was in a nursing home, but most people end up in their \napartment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, she is now home and getting great attention. I made \nsure of that.\n  Mr. DODD. We could help people who are being discharged, and the \nsavings, by employing some people to do it, I think, would vastly be \nless than the cost of sending them back to the hospital.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. An example of that. I was talking to the head of Denver \nHealth. It is an integrated system. I have forgotten the name, but she \nwas so enthusiastic about the integration she performed with Denver \nHealth. I will give you one small example, and it is one you just \nmentioned. She said: We have patients here--heart patients--and when \nthey are discharged we ask them: Are you taking your meds? Are you \ncontrolling your blood pressure? Are you taking your medication to \ncontrol your blood pressure?\n  They say: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I am taking my meds.\n  She says: Well, why is your blood pressure so high?\n\n       The response is: Well, I, I, I. Because they are \n     integrated, they check with their pharmacy, which is part of \n     their system, to check the refill rate of the patients. Sure \n     enough, they find their patient's refill history shows they \n     were not taking their meds. So they get the patients back and \n     they say: You are not taking your meds.\n\n  They say: Oh, I guess I wasn't.\n  They tell them: We are checking on you.\n  So, sure enough, they take their meds, and they have a much better \noutcome, generally, with their cardio patients because of that \nintegration.\n  Mr. DODD. It works.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Part of what the distinguished chairman worked so \nhard on was to put in place the program so we will be able to begin to \nreimburse doctors for those kinds of discussions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Right now, our payment system is driving them away \nfrom having that kind of simple discussion. It doesn't always support \nthe electronic prescribing that would let you know they are not picking \nup their meds. But President Obama did a great job on that, with the \nelectronic health record funding he put through.\n  But this question of doing what you are paid to do, if all you are \npaid for are procedures, then the hospital doing the discharge summary, \nif they couldn't get paid for that, but they did get paid when the \nperson came back and was readmitted and maybe $40,000, $50,000 a day, \nit doesn't take too long to figure out where their effort is going to \nbe. It is not going to be in those areas that save money for the system \nbut hurt them financially because we have set up the payment system \nwith all these perverse incentives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know how much longer my colleague wanted to \nspeak, but some time ago I know Senator Hatch wanted to speak at 5 \no'clock, so I am trying to be traffic cop here.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could, Mr. Chairman, make the case--because I think it \nneeds to be said and, unfortunately, over, over, and over again--\nbecause it is argued on the other side that we are cutting back on \nproviders of the hospitals, for instance. That is accurate. We are \ndoing that. If that is all we were doing, the complaint would have \ngreat legitimacy. But what we have done in this bill is to try to \ncreate a justification for that and provide the resources that make \nthose savings reasonable. If you are having fewer readmissions in a \nhospital, which the hospitals support, if you are doing the kinds of \nthings we are talking about to keep people healthy so they do not go \nback in, then these numbers become realistic numbers.\n  It is not just saying we are cutting out funding. We are improving \nsystems in bill. People pick up the bill all the time and say: Look at \nall the pages. It is because a lot of thought has gone into this to do \nexactly what Senator Whitehouse and the chairman of the committee \ntalked about all day yesterday. This isn't just a bunch of language \nhere. It goes to the heart of this and how we intend to accommodate the \ninterests of the individual by improving their quality and \nsimultaneously reducing the cost.\n  Everyone has made those claims that is what we need to do--increase \nquality, reduce cost, increase access. So\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\nyou can't just say it and not explain how you do it. What we have done \nin our bill is explain how we do that, how we increase access, how we \nimprove quality for the individual and institutions and simultaneously \nbring down cost. That is what we spent the last year working on, to \nachieve exactly what is in these pages that people weigh and pick up \nall the time. If they would look into them, they would see the kind of \nachievements we have reached.\n  Those achievements have been recognized by the most important \norganizations affecting older Americans--AARP and the Commission to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare. They have examined this. These \nare not friends of ours. These are people who objectively analyze what \nwe are doing, and it is their analysis, their conclusion, reached \nindependently, along with many others, that we have been able to reduce \nthese costs, these savings, in this bill and simultaneously increase \naccess and improve quality.\n  That has been the goal we have all talked about for years. This bill \ncomes as close to achieving the reality of those three missions than \nhas ever been done by this Congress, or any Congress for that matter. \nSo when people talk about these cuts in Medicare, they need to be \nhonest enough for people to realize what we have done is to stabilize \nMedicare, extend its solvency, and guarantee those benefits to people \nwho rely on Medicare. That has all been achieved in this bill.\n  So when people start with these scare tactics and language to the \ncontrary, listen to those organizations who don't bring any political \nbrief to this, who don't have an R or a D at the end of their names. \nTheir organizations are designed, supported, financed by, and applauded \nby the very individuals who count on having a solid, sound Medicare \nsystem. These organizations unanimously--unanimously--have said that \nguaranteed benefits in this bill remain intact. We stabilize Medicare, \nand we provide the kind of programs that will save lives and increase \nthe quality of life for people. It is not only about staying alive but \nthe quality of life and being able to live a quality life, \nindependently, for as many years as possible.\n  At the end of the day, we all die one at a time in this country. No \nmatter what else we do, that is the final analysis. But to the extent \nyou can extend life and improve the quality of life and save the kind \nof money we ought to, that is the goal of this bill, and we largely \nachieve it.\n  I applaud, again, the Finance Committee, and the chairman, Max \nBaucus, who helped us get through and navigate these very difficult \nwaters, and I thank our colleague from Rhode Island for his \narticulating these issues as well as his contributions during the HELP \nCommittee proceedings on this bill. He brought many sound and very \npositive ideas to the table.\n  I wish to take a minute or two as well, if I could, to respond to our \ncolleague and friend from New Hampshire, who, at some length, talked \nabout his problems with what we call the CLASS Act that was part of our \nHELP Committee bill. I wish to briefly address those comments.\n  The CLASS Act was an issue Senator Kennedy championed for many \nyears--the idea of providing an independent, privately funded source of \nassistance to people who become disabled but who want to continue \nworking and earn a salary; who do not want to be limited by the \nconstraints of a Medicaid system, which is very undesirable. Not a \nnickel of public moneys are used. Individuals make the contribution. If \nit vests for 5 years, and if you are faced with those kinds of \ndisability issues, you can then collect approximately $75 per day to \nprovide for your needs--maybe a driver, maybe someone providing meals--\nbut you then have the opportunity to continue working as an individual, \nwithout any limitations on what you can make or earn.\n  Again, no public money is involved. It builds up. Thanks to Judd \nGregg in our committee it is actuarially sound. He offered an amendment \nwhich insisted on the actuarial soundness of this program. The CLASS \nAct assists individuals who need long-term services and supports with \nsuch things as: assisted transportation, in-home meals, help with \nhousehold chores, professional help getting ready for work, adult day \ncare, and professional personal care. It also saves about $2 billion in \nMedicaid savings. There are very few provisions which almost \ninstantaneously do that.\n  Again, these dollars have to remain for just this purpose. You cannot \nraid this fund for any other purpose--which was a concern legitimately \nraised by some, that this $75 billion may be used for other purposes. \nWe have attempted to write into this legislation prohibitions to keep \nthese moneys from being offered for any other purpose.\n  In fact, Senator Gregg, when he offered his amendment, said:\n\n       I offered an amendment, which was ultimately accepted, that \n     would require the CLASS Act premiums be based on a 75-year \n     actuarial analysis of the program's costs. My amendment \n     ensures that instead of promising more than we can deliver, \n     the program will be fiscally solvent and we won't be passing \n     the buck--or really passing the debt--to future generations. \n     I'm pleased the HELP Committee unanimously accepted this \n     amendment.\n\n  Which we did. I hear some of my colleagues say this bill did not have \nanything but technical amendments of the 161 Republican amendments I \ntook during committee markup--this was one of the amendments, Senator \nGregg's amendment, which we accepted unanimously. My colleague from \nUtah was of course a member of the committee. He diligently paid \nattention to every amendment that was offered and I know remembers as \nwe adopted one of his amendments dealing with biologics in the \ncommittee that Senator Kennedy strongly supported in conjunction with \nSenator Hatch. But this CLASS Act is a unique and creative idea. We \nthank our colleague from Massachusetts, no longer with us, for coming \nup with and conceptualizing this idea that individuals, with their own \nmoney, contributing to a fund, could eventually draw down to provide \nthese benefits should they become disabled. Individuals often want to \ncontinue working and being self-sufficient without getting into \nMedicaid, which limits your income, restrains you entirely.\n  Here is a totally privately funded program, no public money, just \nwhat you are willing to contribute over a period of years to protect \nagainst that eventuality that you might become disabled, so you can \ncontinue to function.\n  I have one case here, Sara Baker, a 33-year-old woman in my home \nState of Connecticut living in Norwalk. Two years ago Sara's mother, \nwho was only 57 years old at the time, suddenly suffered a massive \nstroke. The stroke left the right side of her body completely \nparalyzed. She lost 100 percent of her speech. Sara recalls that \nfateful day when she got the call. I will quote her:\n\n       I was living out west in Arizona--working, dating--living \n     and loving my life. Then . . . I got the phone call. . . . In \n     seconds, literally, my entire world fell apart. I swear I can \n     still feel that feeling through my whole body when I think \n     about it. So there I was in a state of complete and total \n     lunacy, getting on a plane with one suitcase--home to \n     Connecticut. Guess what? I never went back.\n\n  Sara's mother was transferred to a rehab hospital. Sara went to the \nhospital every single day for 2 months to be at her mother's side as \nshe went through therapy. Sara's mother had worked as an RN for 17 \nyears. Her mom and the hospital social worker both agreed, her health \ninsurance was ``as good as they come.''\n  However, when it comes to long-term care, they don't come as good. \nHer mother was abruptly discharged from the rehab hospital after 60 \ndays, when her insurance company decided she had made enough \n``progress.''\n  Sara went 9 months without working, dipped into what savings she had, \nand then went into debt to provide the long-term services and supports \nher mother needed.\n  As she recalled, and I will quote her again:\n\n       I made the whole house wheelchair accessible. I became a \n     team of doctors, nurses, aides, and a homemaker. I helped her \n     shower, get dressed, cut food, gave medicine, took her blood \n     pressure. . . . What would have happened if I wasn't there? \n     Basically, one of two things--I could have hired someone to \n     come to the house, all out of pocket of course, or the State \n     could have depleted her assets--her home, savings, \n     everything--and she would have been put in a nursing home \n     funded by Medicaid.\n\n  Stories like Sara's are not the exception, unfortunately. They happen \nevery minute of every day, all across our country. They are common in \nmy State\n\n[[Page S12137]]\n\nas well as any other State in the Nation. At any moment any one of us \nor someone we love can become disabled and need long-term services.\n  We also have an aging population. In my home State of Connecticut, \nthe number of individuals 85 and over, the population most likely to \nneed long-term care, will grow by more than 70 percent in the next 20 \nyears.\n  Families such as Sara's are doing the right thing. They take care of \neach other, as most people understand we all would try and do. They do \nwhatever they have to do. But the cost of long-term care can be \ndevastating on middle-class working families. While 46 million \nAmericans lack health insurance, more than 200 million lack any \nprotection against the costs of long-term care. The CLASS Act will help \nfill that gap. It doesn't solve it all. It helps fill a gap. It is an \nessential part of health care reform. The CLASS Act will establish a \nvoluntary--purely voluntary, there are no mandates on employers, no \nmandates on employees, no mandates on anyone--national insurance \nprogram.\n  If you decide, only you decide, voluntarily to contribute and \nparticipate in this, it happens. It is a long-term care insurance \nprogram financed by premium payments collected through payroll at the \nrequest of the individual, not a mandate on the employer. When \nindividuals develop functional limitations, such as Sarah's mother, \nthey can receive a cash benefit in the range of $75 a day, which comes \nto over $27,000 a year.\n  It is not intended to cover all the costs of long-term care but it \ncould help many families like Sarah's. It could pay for respite care, \nallowing family caregivers to maintain employment. It could pay for \nhome modifications. It could pay for assistive devices and equipment. \nIt could pay for personal assistance services--allowing individuals \nwith disabilities to maintain their independence, and community \nparticipation. It could allow individuals to stay in their homes versus \nhaving to go to a nursing home. It would prevent individuals from \nhaving to impoverish themselves by selling off everything they have, to \nthen go through that title XIX window and become Medicaid recipients \nand then be constrained on what they could possibly earn.\n  Think about what if this young woman Sara had a family living out \nWest, her own children instead of being single, how would she have done \nthat? How would she have been able to pack up a whole family and move \nfrom the West to the East to take care of her mother in those days? \nMany families face these issues every day.\n  So while this proposal is not going to solve every problem, it is a \nvery creative, innovative idea that does not involve a nickel of public \nmoney, not a nickel. It is all voluntary, depends upon the individual \nwilling to make that contribution, to provide that level of assistance, \nLord forbid they should end up in a situation where they find \nthemselves disabled and need some long-term services to allow them to \nsurvive and be part of their community life, including going back to \nwork, without impoverishing themselves, selling off everything they \nhave in order to make themselves qualified for Medicaid assistance.\n  I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts. There are a lot of great \nthings he did over the years. He was a champion of so much when it came \nto working families and their needs in health care. But this idea, the \nKennedy idea of the CLASS Act, is one that has a wonderful legacy to \nit. It is the heart of this bill. It has been endorsed and supported by \nover 275 major organizations in the country. I have never seen a \nproposal such as this receive a level of support across the spectrum \nthat the CLASS Act is getting.\n  I know there will be those who try to take this out of the bill. I \nwill stand here hour after hour and defend this very creative, \ninnovative idea that can make a difference in the lives of millions of \nour fellow citizens, not only today but for years to come.\n  I again thank Senator Kennedy and his remarkable staff who did such a \nwonderful job on this as well, and I thank Senator Gregg, even though \nhe is critical of the program. Senator Gregg's ideas were adopted \nunanimously in our markup of the bill and provided the actuarial \nsoundness of this proposal for a long 75 years to come. For that we are \ngrateful to him, for offering those amendments which were adopted by \nevery Republican and every Democrat on the committee at the time of our \nmarkup last summer.\n  I see my colleague from Utah, and I have great respect for my friend \nfrom Utah. He and I have worked on so many issues together. Either he \nwould get me in trouble politically or I would get him in trouble \npolitically when we went to work on things. The very first major piece \nof legislation I ever worked on in the Chamber was to establish some \nFederal support for families who needed it for childcare. It was a \nlong, drawn-out battle, but the person who stood with me almost a \nquarter of a century ago to make that happen--and today it has almost \nbecome commonplace for people to get that kind of assistance--but as \nlong as I live, I will never forget I had a partner named Orrin Hatch \nwho made that possible. Whatever differences we have--and that is not \nthe only thing we have worked on together, but it was the very first \nthing I worked on and he joined me in that effort--it became the law of \nthe land and today millions of families manage to navigate that \ndifficult time of making sure their families are going to get proper \ncare and attention while they go out and work hard and try to provide \nfor them as well. I thank him for that and many other things as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. There is no question \nhe is a great Senator. I have always enjoyed working with him and we \nhave done an awful lot together. I want to compliment Senator \nWhitehouse too, a terrific human being and great addition to this \nSenate and I have a lot of respect for him. He gives me heartburn from \ntime to time, as does Senator Dodd. On the other hand, they are great \npeople and very sincere. Our chairman of the committee, Max Baucus, is \na wonderful man. He is trying to do the best he can under the \ncircumstances. I applaud him for it. Senator Stabenow from Michigan and \nI have not seen eye to eye on a lot of things, but we always enjoy \nbeing around each other.\n  This is a great place, there is no question about it. We have great \npeople here. But that doesn't make us any less unhappy about what we \nconsider to be an awful bill.\n  But right now, today, let me talk about a few specific things. Today \nthe senior Senator from Illinois came to the floor and spoke about my \nefforts to reduce the costs associated with medical malpractice \nliability. I don't think his statement should go unanswered. Not only \nwere a number of his statements simply incorrect as factual matters, \nbut some of them even bordered on being offensive. I am not offended, I \ncan live with it, I can take criticism, but some of them I think were a \nlittle bit over the top.\n  First of all, he referred to the recent letter I received from the \nCBO which indicated that the government would realize significant \nsavings by enacting some simple tort reform measures. I don't know \nanybody in America who has any brains who doesn't realize we have to do \nsomething about tort reform when it comes to health care. According to \nthe CBO, these measures would reduce the deficit by $54 billion over 10 \nyears. That is a lot of money. Private sector savings would be even \nmore significant. According to the CBO, we would likely see a reduction \nof roughly $125 billion in private health care spending over the same \n10-year period, and that, in my view, is a low estimate. Democrats \napparently want the American people to think these numbers are so \ninsignificant that this issue should be ignored in this health care \nbill, and I have to respectfully disagree.\n  I may be one of the few Senators in this body who actually tried \nmedical malpractice cases. I actually defended them. I defended \ndoctors, hospitals, nurses, health care practitioners. I understand \nthem.\n  There are cases where there should be huge recoveries. I would be the \nfirst to admit it. I saw the wrong eye taken out, the wrong leg taken \noff, the wrong kidney. You only have two of each of those. You bet your \nbottom dollar we settled those for significant amounts of money. But I \nalso saw that the vast majority of the cases were frivolous,\n\n[[Page S12138]]\n\nbrought to get the defense costs which then only ranged from $50,000 to \n$200,000, depending on the jurisdiction. If a lawyer can get a number \nof those cases they can make a pretty good living by bringing those \ncases just to get the defense costs, which of course adds to all the \ncosts of health care. There is no use kidding about it.\n  Furthermore, Senator Durbin, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, \ncited the same CBO letter in order to claim that the tort reform \nmeasures supported by many on my side of the aisle would cause more \npeople to die.\n  Give me a break.\n  I can only assume he is referring to the one paragraph in the CBO \nletter that addresses the effect of tort reform on health outcomes. In \nthat single paragraph the CBO referred to three studies. One of these \nstudies indicated that a reduction in malpractice lawsuits would lead \nto an increase in mortality rates--one of the three.\n  The other two studies cited by the CBO found that there would be no \neffects on health outcomes and no negative effects could be expected. \nSo, let's be clear, the CBO did not reach a conclusion in this case. \nThese studies were cited only to show that there is disagreement in \nthis area and, once again, the majority of the studies cited said there \nwould be no negative effects on health outcomes. Apparently, omitting \ndata and studies that disagree with your conclusions is becoming common \npractice among policy makers these days.\n  In his speech earlier today, the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nalso discounted the prominence of defensive medicine in our health care \nsystem, saying only that ``some doctors'' perform unnecessary and \ninappropriate procedures in order to avoid lawsuits. Once again, the \nfacts would contradict this generalization. A number of studies \ndemonstrate this. For example, a 2005 study of 800 Pennsylvania \nphysicians--where I used to practice law--in high-risk specialties \nfound that 93 percent of these physicians had practiced some form of \ndefensive medicine. That was published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, June 1, 2005.\n  In addition, a 2002 nationwide survey of 300 physicians--this is the \nHarris Interactive ``Fear of Litigation Study''--found that 79 percent \nof physicians ordered more tests than are necessary. Think about that. \nIf 79 percent are ordering more tests than are necessary, you can \nimagine the multibillions of dollars in unnecessary defensive medicine \nthat comes from that. But that is not the end of that ``Fear of \nLitigation Study.'' Seventy-four percent of physicians referred \npatients to specialists who, in their judgment, did not need any such \nreferral. Think about it--referring people to specialists that they \nknew they didn't need. Think of the cost, the billions of dollars in \ncost. Fifty-two percent of physicians suggested unnecessary invasive \nprocedures. The word ``invasive'' is an important word. Fifty-two \npercent. Why? Because they are trying to protect themselves by making \nsure that everything could possibly be done. Forty-one percent of \nphysicians prescribed unnecessary medications. This is a nationwide \nsurvey of 300 physicians.\n  The costs associated with defensive medicine are real--I would say \nunnecessary defensive medicine because I believe there are some \ndefensive medicine approaches that we would want the doctors to do but \nnot to the extent of these doctors ordering more tests than are \nnecessary, ordering more specialists than are necessary, suggesting \nunnecessary invasive procedures, unnecessary medications. This is the \nmedical profession itself that admits this.\n  In another study Pricewaterhouse found that defensive medicine \naccounts for approximately $210 billion every year or 10 percent of the \ntotal U.S. health care cost. Here are some more facts from the \nPricewaterhouse study. Of the $2.2 trillion spent every year on health \ncare in the United States, as much as $1.2 trillion can be attributed \nto wasteful spending--$1.2 trillion of $2.2 trillion. Yet, the \nDemocrats want to deny that unnecessary defensive medicine is being \nutilized to a significant extent. According to this study, defensive \nmedicine is the largest single area of waste in the health care system. \nIt is on par with inefficient claim processing and care spent on \npreventable conditions.\n  Yet, despite these overwhelming numbers--and I know some Democrats \nwill say that is Pricewaterhouse and they must have been doing it at \nthe expense of somebody who had an interest. Pricewaterhouse and other \naccounting firms generally try to get it right. They got it right here. \nThose of us who were in that business can attest to it.\n  Yet, despite these overwhelming numbers, my friends on the other side \nhave opted to overlook them and instead relate horrific stories \nassociated with doctors' malpractice, apparently trying to imply that \nRepublicans simply don't care about these truly tragic occurrences. \nHowever, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, in all the \nproposals that have been offered during this debate, there has not been \na single suggestion to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining the \ncompensation for actual losses they have incurred, not one suggestion \nthat they should. Instead, we have sought to impose some limits on the \nnoneconomic damages. All economic damages damages awarded for actual \nloss, past, present, and future--are fine, fair game. We've sought only \nimpose some limits on the noneconomic damages in order to define the \nplaying field, encourage settlement, and introduce some level of \npredictability to the system.\n  It is no secret that personal injury lawyers--some of them--are \nprolific political contributors to those politicians who fight against \ntort reform. With a Democratic majority and a Democrat in the White \nHouse, their lobbying efforts during this Congress have reached \nunprecedented levels. Given this reality, it is obvious why trial \nlawyers have not been asked to give up anything in the current health \ncare legislation.\n  Supporters of this health care bill will be asking the American \npeople to pay higher health care premiums, for seniors to give up \nMedicare Advantage, which 25 percent of them have enlisted in, for \nbusinesses to pay higher taxes, for medical device manufacturers to pay \nmore just to bring a device to the market that may save lives or make \nlives more worth living. The only group that has not been asked to \nsacrifice or change the way they do business happens to be the medical \nliability personal injury lawyers.\n  I would hope we would focus our efforts more on helping the American \npeople than on preserving a fund-raising stream for politicians. Sadly, \nthat doesn't appear to be happening in the current debate.\n  As I said, there are some very honest and decent attorneys out there \nwho bring cases that are legitimate where there should be high rewards. \nBut the vast majority, I can personally testify, are less than \nlegitimate and the resulting costs are costing every American citizen \nan arm and a leg. It is something we ought to resolve. We ought to \nresolve it in a way that takes care of those who truly have injuries \nand get rid of these frivolous cases driving up the cost for every \nAmerican.\n  Not too long ago, I talked to one of the leading heart specialists in \nWashington. He acknowledged, we all order a lot of tests and so forth \nthat we don't need, that we know we don't need. But we do it so that \nthe history we have of the patient shows we did everything possible to \nrule out everything that possibly could occur, even though we know we \ndon't need to do it. To be honest, under the current system of \nlawsuits, I don't blame them. They are trying to protect themselves.\n  We should also discuss the shortage of doctors we have going into \nhigh-risk specialties. We have areas in this country where you can't \nget obstetricians and gynecologists to the people. Law schools will \ntell you, at least the ones I know, that there aren't that many young \npeople going into obstetrics and gynecology today because they may not \nmake as much money and the high cost of medical liability insurance is \nso high that they really can't afford to do it. And, of course, they \ndon't want to get sued.\n  So much for that. I love my distinguished friend from Illinois, and \nhe knows it. I care for him. But let me tell you, I think he knows \nbetter. He knows that I know better. I would be the first to come to \nbat for somebody who was truly injured because of the negligence of a \nphysician. I don't have any problem with that at all.\n  I just thought I would make a few comments about this but, again, say\n\n[[Page S12139]]\n\nthat I understand some of the excesses that go on on the floor. But \nthat was an excess this morning, even though I know my dear friend is \nsincere and dedicated and one of the better lawyers in this body. \nHaving said that, I will end on that particular subject.\n  Let me once again take a few minutes to talk about the Medicare \nprovisions in this Democratic Party health care bill.\n  Throughout the health care debate, we have heard the President pledge \nnot to ``mess'' with Medicare. Unfortunately, that is not the case with \nthe bill before the Senate. To be clear, the Reid bill reduces Medicare \nby $465 billion to fund a new government program. Unfortunately, \nseniors and the disabled in the United States are the ones who suffer \nthe consequences as a result of these reductions. Everyone knows \nMedicare is extremely important to 43 million seniors and disabled \nAmericans covered by the Medicare Program.\n  Throughout my Senate service, I have fought to preserve and protect \nMedicare for both beneficiaries and providers. Medicare is already in \ntrouble today. The program faces tremendous challenges in the very near \nfuture. The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent by 2017, and the \nprogram has more than $37 trillion in unfunded liabilities. This is \ngoing to be saddled onto our children and grandchildren.\n  The Reid bill will make the situation much worse. Why is that the \ncase? Again, the Reid bill cuts Medicare to fund the creation of a new \ngovernment entitlement program. More specifically, the Reid bill will \ncut nearly $135 billion from hospitals--where are they going to get \nthis money?--$120 billion from Medicare Advantage, almost $15 billion \nfrom nursing homes, more than $40 billion from home health care \nagencies, and close to $8 billion from hospice providers. These cuts \nwill threaten beneficiary access to care as Medicare providers find it \nmore and more challenging to provide health services to Medicare \npatients. Many doctors are not taking Medicare patients now because of \nlow reimbursement rates.\n  Let me stress to my colleagues that cutting Medicare to pay for a new \ngovernment entitlement program is irresponsible. Any reductions to \nMedicare should be used to preserve the program, not to create a new \ngovernment bureaucracy.\n  As I just said, the President has consistently pledged: We are not \ngoing to mess with Medicare. Once again, this is another example of a \nstraightforward pledge that has been broken over the last 11 months. \nMaybe you cannot blame the President because he is not sitting in this \nbody. The body is breaking it.\n  This bill strips more than $120 billion out of the Medicare Advantage \nProgram that currently covers 10.6 million seniors or almost one out of \nfour seniors in the Medicare Program. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, under this bill the value of the so-called ``additional \nbenefits,'' such as vision care and dental care, will decline from $135 \nto $42 by 2019. That is a reduction of more than 70 percent in \nbenefits. You heard me right: 70 percent.\n  During the Finance Committee's consideration of health care reform, I \noffered an amendment to protect these benefits for our seniors, many of \nwhom are low-income Americans and reside in rural States and rural \nareas. However, the majority party would not support this important \namendment. The majority chose to skirt the President's pledge about no \nreduction in Medicare benefits for our seniors by characterizing the \nbenefits being lost--vision care, dental care, and reduced hospital \ndeductibles--as ``extra benefits.''\n  Let me make the point as clearly as I can. When we promise American \nseniors we will not reduce their benefits, let's be honest about that \npromise. So we are either going to protect benefits or not. It is that \nsimple. Under this bill, if you are a senior who enjoys Medicare \nAdvantage, the unfortunate answer is, no, they are not going to protect \nyour benefits.\n  All day today, we had Members on the other side of the aisle claim \nthat Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare. This is absolutely--I \nhave to tell you, it is absolutely unbelievable. I would invite every \nMember making this claim to turn to page 50 of the ``2010 Medicare and \nYou Handbook.'' It says:\n\n       A Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice you \n     may have--\n\n  Get these words--\n\n       as part of Medicare.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       A Medicare Advantage is another health coverage choice you \n     may have as part of Medicare.\n\n  Hey, that is the Medicare ``2010 Medicare and You Handbook.'' Who is \nkidding whom about it not being part of Medicare?\n  So the bottom line is simple: If you are cutting Medicare Advantage \nbenefits, you are cutting Medicare.\n  I also heard the distinguished Senator from Connecticut this morning \nmention that the bureaucrat-controlled Medicare Commission will not cut \nbenefits in Part A and Part B. Well, once again, my friends on the \nother side are only telling you half the story. So much for \ntransparency. On page 1,005 of this bill, it states in plain English:\n\n       Include recommendations to reduce Medicare payments under C \n     and D.\n\n  I am just waiting for Members on the other side of the aisle to come \ndown and now claim that Part D is also not a part of Medicare. We all \nknow it is.\n  It is also important to note that the Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has told us in clear terms that this \nunfettered authority given to the Medicare Commission would result in \nhigher premiums.\n  It is important details such as these that the majority does not want \nus to discuss and debate in full view of the American people. They call \nit slow-walking. They call it obstructionism. Making sure we take \nenough time to discuss a 2,074-page bill that will affect every \nAmerican life and every American business is the sacred duty of every \nSenator in this Chamber. We will take as long as it takes to fully \ndiscuss this bill, and you can talk for a month about various parts of \nthis bill that are outrageous and some that are really good, too, in \nall fairness--not many, however.\n  I have heard several Members from the other side of the aisle \ncharacterize the Medicare Advantage Program as a giveaway to the \ninsurance industry. You know, when you cannot win an argument, you \nstart blaming somebody else. So they want a government insurance \ncompany to take the place of the insurance industry. Well, maybe that \nis too much. They want it to compete with the insurance industry. But \nhow do you compete with a government-sponsored entity? And there are \ncomments that the so-called government plan will cost more than the \ncurrent insurance businesses they are so criticizing. I am not happy \nwith the insurance industry either, but, by gosh, let's be fair.\n  Let me give everyone watching at home a little history lesson on the \ncreation of Medicare Advantage. I served as a member of the House-\nSenate conference committee which wrote the Medicare Modernization Act \nof 2003. The distinguished Senator from Montana would agree with me, it \nwas months of hard, slogging work every day to try to come up with the \nMedicare Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, this law \ncreated the Medicare Advantage Program. It gives people vision care, \ndental care, et cetera.\n  When conference committee members were negotiating the conference \nreport back then, in 2003, several of us insisted that the Medicare \nAdvantage Program was necessary in order to provide health care \ncoverage choices to Medicare beneficiaries. At that time, there were \nmany parts of the country where Medicare beneficiaries did not have \nadequate choices in coverage. In fact, the only choice offered to them \nwas traditional fee-for-service Medicare, a one-size-fits-all, \ngovernment-run health program.\n  By creating the Medicare Advantage Program, we were providing \nbeneficiaries with choice in coverage and then empowering them to make \ntheir own health care decisions as opposed to the Federal Government \nmaking them for them. Today, every Medicare beneficiary may choose from \nseveral health plans.\n  We learned our lessons from Medicare+Choice, which was in effect at \nthe time, and its predecessors. These plans collapsed, especially in \nrural areas, because Washington decided--\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\nagain, government got involved--to set artificially low payment rates. \nIn fact, in my home State of Utah, all of the Medicare+Choice plans \neventually ceased operations because they were all operating in the \nred. You cannot continue to do that. It was really stupid what we were \nexpecting them to do. I fear history could repeat itself if we are not \ncareful.\n  During the Medicare Modernization Act conference, we fixed the \nproblem. We increased reimbursement rates so all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, regardless of where they lived--be it Fillmore, UT, or \nNew York City--had choice in coverage. Again, we did not want \nbeneficiaries stuck with a one-size-fits-all, Washington-run government \nplan.\n  There were both Democrats and Republicans on that committee, by the \nway, and the leader was, of course, the distinguished Senator from \nMontana. I admire him for the way he led it, and I admire him for \ntrying to present what I think is the most untenable case here on the \nfloor during this debate. He is a loyal Democrat. He is doing the best \nhe can, and he deserves a lot of credit for sitting through all those \nmeetings and all of that markup and everything else and sitting day-in \nand day-out on the floor here.\n  Today, Medicare Advantage works. Every Medicare beneficiary has \naccess to a Medicare Advantage plan, if they so choose, and close to 90 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries participating in the program are \nsatisfied with their health coverage. But that can all change should \nthis health care reform legislation currently being considered become \nlaw.\n  In States such as Utah, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico--just to mention \nsome Western States--Wyoming, Montana--you can name every State--rural \nAmerica was not well served, and we did Medicare Advantage.\n  Choice in coverage has made a difference in the lives of more than 10 \nmillion Americans nationwide--almost 11 million Americans. The so-\ncalled ``extra benefits'' I mentioned earlier are being portrayed as \ngym memberships as opposed to lower premiums, copayments, and \ndeductibles.\n\n  To be clear, the Silver Sneakers Program is one that has made a \ndifference in the lives of many seniors because it encourages them to \nget out of their homes and remain active. It is prevention at its best. \nIt has been helpful to those with serious weight issues, and it has \nbeen invaluable to women suffering from osteoporosis and joint \nproblems. In fact, I have received several hundred letters telling me \nhow much Medicare Advantage beneficiaries appreciate this program. They \nbenefit from it. Their lives are better. They use health care less. \nThey do not milk the system. They basically have a better chance of \nliving and living in greater health.\n  Throughout these debates, throughout these markups, throughout these \nhearings that have led us to this point, every health care bill I know \nof has a prevention and wellness section in the bill that will \nencourage things such as the Silver Sneakers Program that has benefited \nsenior citizens so much and was not one of the major costs of Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Additionally, these beneficiaries receive other services such as \ncoordinated chronic care management, which is important, coordinated \nchronic care management for seniors; dental coverage--really important \nfor low-income seniors; vision care--can you imagine how important that \nis to people over 60 years of age? How about those who are over 70 or \n80 years of age? And hearing aids--can you imagine how important that \nis to our senior citizens? This program helps these seniors, and it \nhelps them the right way.\n  Let me read some letters from my constituents. These are real lives \nbeing affected by the cuts contemplated in the bill.\n  Remember, there is almost $500 billion cut by this bill from \nMedicare, which goes insolvent by 2017 and has an almost $38 trillion \nunfunded liability.\n  Let me read this letter from a constituent from Layton, UT:\n\n       I recently received my healthcare updater for 2010. I am in \n     a Med Advantage plan with Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Thanks to \n     the cuts in this program by Medicare, my monthly premiums \n     have risen by 49% and my office visit co-pay has increased \n     150%. Senator Hatch, I am on a fixed income and this has \n     really presented a problem for me and many others I know on \n     the same program. And, at my age I certainly can't find a job \n     that would help cover the gap. I worked all my life to enjoy \n     my retirement and thanks to the current economy I've lost a \n     lot of those monies that were intended to help supplement my \n     income.\n\n  This letter is from a constituent from Logan, UT, where the great \nUtah State University is:\n\n       Please stop the erosion of Medicare Advantage for seniors. \n     Very many of us are already denied proper medical and dental \n     care not to mention those who cannot afford needed \n     medications. Hardest hit are ones on Social Security who are \n     just over the limit for extra help but cannot keep up with \n     the rising medical costs that go way beyond the so-called \n     ``cost of living increases'' which we are not getting this \n     year anyway. If those in government who make these decisions \n     had to live as we do day to day, I think we would find better \n     conditions for seniors. The difference in decision making \n     changes when you are hungry and cold your own self.\n\n  Here is a constituent from Pleasant Grove, UT:\n\n       Please do not phase out the Medicare Advantage program, \n     senior citizens need it. Our supplement insurance rates go up \n     every year and our income does not keep pace with the cost of \n     living.\n\n  Here is a constituent from Salt Lake City, UT:\n\n       We met with our insurance agent this morning about the \n     increased costs of our Medicare Advantage plans due to the \n     health care reform bill now before Congress.\n       Our premium costs have already been significantly increased \n     with the coverage substantially decreased. We are in our 80s \n     and cannot afford these increases and are hurt by the \n     decreased coverage. We are writing to you to have you stop \n     the cuts and restore the coverage to Medicare Advantage \n     plans. This is an issue that is very important and very real \n     to us at this point in our lives. Please stop the cuts and \n     restore coverage.\n\n  I can't support any bill that would jeopardize health care coverage \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. I truly believe if this bill before the \nSenate becomes law, Medicare beneficiaries' health care coverage could \nbe in serious trouble.\n  I have been in the Senate for over 30 years--33 to be exact. I pride \nmyself on being bipartisan. I have coauthored many bipartisan health \ncare bills since I first joined the Senate in 1977. Almost everyone in \nthis Chamber wants a health care reform bill to be enacted this year. I \ndon't know of anybody on either side who would not like to get a health \ncare bill enacted.\n  On our side, we would like to do it in a bipartisan way, but this \nbill is certainly not bipartisan. It hasn't been from the beginning. We \nwant it to be done right. History has shown that to be done right, it \nneeds to be a bipartisan bill that passes the Senate with a minimum of \n75 to 80 votes. We did it in 2003 when we considered the Medicare \nprescription drug legislation, and I believe we can do it again today \nif we have the will and if we get rid of the partisanship. I doubt \nthere has ever been a bill of this magnitude affecting so many American \nlives that has passed this Chamber on an almost--or maybe in a \ncomplete--straight party-line vote. The Senate is not the House of \nRepresentatives. This body has a different constitutional mandate than \nthe House. We are the deliberative body. We are the body that has in \nthe past and should today be working through these difficult issues to \nfind clear consensus. True bipartisanship is what is needed.\n  In the past, the Senate has approved many bipartisan health care \nbills that have eventually been signed into law. I know a lot of them \nhave been mine, along with great colleagues on the other side who \ndeserve the credit as well. The Balanced Budget Act in 1997 included \nthe Hatch-Kennedy SCHIP program. How about the Ryan White Act. I stood \nright here on the Senate floor and called it the Ryan White bill. His \nmother was sitting in the audience at the time. How about the Orphan \nDrug Act. When I got here we found that there were only two or three \norphan drugs being developed. These are drugs for population groups of \nless than 250,000 people. It is clear that the pharmaceutical companies \ncould not afford to do the pharmaceutical work to come up with \ntreatments or cures for orphan conditions. So we put some incentives in \nthere; we put some tax benefits in there. We did some things that were \nunique. If I recall it correctly, it was about a $14 million bill.\n  Today we have over 300 orphan drugs, some of which have become \nblockbuster drugs along the line. They wouldn't have been developed if \nit\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\nhadn't been for that little, tiny orphan drug bill. That was a major \nbill when I was chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nThey now call it the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  How about the Americans With Disabilities Act. Tom Harkin stood \nthere, I stood here, and we passed that bill through the Senate. It \nwasn't easy. There were people who thought it was too much Federal \nGovernment, too much this, too much that. But Senator Harkin and I \nbelieved--as did a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans, as the \nfinal vote showed--that we should take care of persons with \ndisabilities if they would meet certain qualifications.\n  How about the Hatch-Waxman Act. We passed that. Henry Waxman, a dear \nfriend of mine, one of the most liberal people in all of the House of \nRepresentatives and who is currently the very powerful chairman of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee over there, we got together, put aside \nour differences, and we came up with Hatch-Waxman which basically \nalmost everybody admits created the modern generic drug industry.\n  By the way, most people will admit that bill has saved at least $10 \nbillion to consumers and more today, by the way, every year since 1984.\n  I could go on and on, but let me just say I have worked hard to try \nand bring our sides together so we can in a bipartisan way do what is \nright for the American people.\n  Let me just tell my colleagues, if the Senate passes this bill in its \ncurrent form with a razor thin margin of 60 votes, this will become one \nmore example of the arrogance of power being exerted since the \nDemocrats secured a 60-vote majority in the Senate and took over the \nHouse and the White House. There are essentially no checks or balances \nfound in Washington today, just an arrogance of power, with one party \nramming through unpopular and devastating proposals such as this, one \nafter another.\n  Well, let me say there is a better way to handle health care reform. \nFor months I have been pushing for a fiscally responsible and step-by-\nstep proposal that recognizes our current need for spending restraint \nwhile starting us on a path to sustainable health care reform. There \nare several areas of consensus that can form the basis for sustainable, \nfiscally responsible, and bipartisan reform.\n  These include:\n  Reforming the health insurance market for every American by making \nsure no American is denied coverage simply based on a preexisting \ncondition. Some of my colleagues on the other side have tried to blast \nthe insurance industry, saying they are an evil, powerful industry. We \nneed to reform them, no question about it, and we can do it if we work \ntogether.\n  Protecting the coverage for almost 85 percent of Americans who \nalready have coverage they like by making that coverage more \naffordable. This means reducing costs by rewarding quality and \ncoordinated care, giving families more information on the cost and \nchoices of their coverage and treatment options, and--I said it \nearlier--discouraging frivolous lawsuits that have permeated our \nsociety and made the lives of a high percentage of our doctors, \nespecially in those very difficult fields of medicine, painful and \nthose fields not very popular to go into today. And, of course, we \ncould promote prevention and wellness measures.\n  We could give States flexibility to design their own unique \napproaches to health care reform. Utah is not New York, Colorado is not \nNew Jersey, New York is not Utah, and New Jersey is not Colorado. Each \nState has its own demographics and its own needs and its own problems. \nWhy don't we get the people who know those States best to make health \ncare work? I know the legislators closer to the people are going to be \nvery responsive to the people in their respective States. I admit some \nStates might not do very well, but most of them would do much better \nthan what we will do here with some big albatross of a bill that really \ndoes not have bipartisan support.\n  Actually, in talking about New York, what works in New York will most \nlikely not work in Colorado, let alone Utah. As we move forward on \nhealth care reform, it is important to recognize that every State has \nits own unique mix of demographics. Each State has developed its own \ninstitutions to address its challenges, and each has its own successes. \nWe can have 50 State laboratories determining how to do health care in \nthis country in accordance with their own demographics, and we could \nlearn from the States that are successful. We could learn from the \nStates that make mistakes. We could learn from the States that cross-\nbreed ideas. We could make insurance so that it crosses State lines.\n  Can you imagine what that would do to costs? We could do it. But \nthere is no desire to do that today with this partisan bill.\n  There is an enormous reservoir of expertise, experience, and field-\ntested reform. We should take advantage of that by placing States at \nthe center of health care reform efforts so they can use approaches \nthat best reflect their needs and their challenges.\n  My home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive steps toward \nsustainable health care reform. They already have an exchange. They are \ntrying some very innovative things. By anybody's measure the State of \nUtah has a pretty good health care system. Is it perfect? No. But we \ncould help it to be, with a fraction of the Federal dollars that this \nbill is going to cost. This bill over 10 years is at least $2.5 \ntrillion, and I bet my bottom dollar it will be over $3 trillion. That \nis on top of $2.4 trillion we are already spending, half of which they \nclaim may be not well spent. We know a large percentage of that is not \nwell spent.\n\n  Like I say, my home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive \nsteps toward sustainable health care reform. The current efforts to \nintroduce the defined contribution health benefits system and implement \nthe Utah health exchange are laudable accomplishments.\n  A vast majority of Americans--I believe this to be really true--agree \na one-size-fits-all Washington government solution is not the right \napproach. That is why seniors and everybody else except a very few are \nup in arms about these bills. That is what this bill is bound to force \non us: a one-size-fits-all, Washington-run, controlled government \nprogram. I am not just talking about the government option. That is a \nsmall part of the argument today. If we pass this bill, we will have \nWashington governing all of our lives with regard to health care. I \ncan't think of a worse thing to do when I look at the mess they have \nmade with some very good programs.\n  Unfortunately, the path we are taking in Washington right now is to \nsimply spend another $2.5 trillion of taxpayer money to further expand \nthe role of the Federal Government. I just wish the majority would take \na step back, keep their arrogance of power in check, and truly work on \na real bipartisan bill that all of us can be proud of. They have the \nmedia with them selling this bill as less than $1 trillion. Give me a \nbreak. Between now and 2014, yes, they will charge everybody the taxes \nthey can get and the costs they can get, but the bill isn't implemented \nuntil 2014, and even some aspects not until 2015. That is the only way, \nwith that budgetary gimmick, they could get the costs to allegedly be \ndown below $900 billion. But even the CBO--certainly the Senate Budget \nCommittee--acknowledges that if you extrapolate--I think my colleagues \non the other side acknowledge that if you extrapolate it out over a \nfull 10 years, you have at least $2.5 trillion and in some \ncircumstances as much as $3 trillion.\n  How can we justify that? With the problems we have today, a $12 \ntrillion national debt, going up to $17 trillion if we do things like \nthis? How can we justify it? How can we stick our kids and our \ngrandkids and our great grandkids--my wife and I have all three, by the \nway, kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids. How can we stick them with \nthe cost of this bill? This is just one bill. I hate to tell you some \nof the other things that are being put forth in not only this body but \nthe other. How come we do it on bills that are totally partisan bills?\n  If we look at what has happened, the HELP Committee, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, came up with a totally \npartisan bill. Not one Republican was asked to contribute to it. They \njust came up with what they wanted to do. It was led by one staff on \nCapitol Hill. It is a very partisan bill. Then the House came up with \ntheir bill. Not one Republican, to\n\n[[Page S12142]]\n\nmy knowledge, had even been asked to help, and it is a tremendously \npartisan bill--both of which are tremendously costly too.\n  Then the distinguished Senator from Montana tried to come up with a \nbill that would be bipartisan in the Finance Committee, but in the end, \neven with the Gang of 6--and I was in the original Gang of 7, but I \ncouldn't stay because I knew what the bottom bill was going to be, and \nI knew I couldn't--I couldn't support it. So I voluntarily left, not \nbecause I wanted to cause any problems but because I didn't want to \ncause any problems. I found myself coming out of those meetings and \ndecrying some of the ideas that were being pushed in those meetings. I \njust thought it was the honorable thing to do to absent myself from the \nGang of 7. It became a Gang of 6 and then the three Republicans finally \nconcluded that they couldn't support it either.\n  But I will give the distinguished chairman from Montana a great deal \nof credit because he sat through all of that. He worked through all of \nit. He worked through it in the committee, but then it became a \npartisan exercise in committee by and large.\n  Yes, there were a couple of amendments accepted: My gosh, look at \nthat. Then what happened? They went to the majority leader's office in \nthe Senate, and they brought the HELP bill and the bill from the \nFinance Committee, and they molded this bill, this 2,074-page bill with \nthe help of the White House. Not one Republican I know of had anything \nto do with it, although I know my dear friend, the distinguished \nmajority leader, did from time to time talk with at least one \nRepublican, but only on, as far as I could see, one or two very \nimportant issues in the bill. There are literally thousands of \nimportant issues in this bill, not just one or two. There are some that \nare more important than others, but they are all important.\n\n  I am not willing to saddle the American people with this costly, \noverly expensive, bureaucratic nightmare this bill will be. I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side will listen, and I hope we can start over \non a step-by-step approach that takes in the needs of the respective \nStates that is not a one-size-fits-all solution, that both Republicans \nand Democrats can work on, which will literally follow the principles \nof federalism and get this done in a way that all of us can be proud \nof.\n  I don't have any illusions and, thus far, it doesn't look like that \nwill happen. But it should happen. That is the way it should be done. I \nwarn my friends on the other side, if they succeed in passing this bill \nwithout bipartisan support--if they get one or two Republicans, I don't \nconsider that bipartisan support. You should at least get 75 to 80 \nvotes on a bill this large, which is one-sixth of the American economy, \n17 percent of the American economy. You should have to get 75 to 80 \nvotes minimally. It would even be better if you can get more, as we did \nwith CHIP and other bills. On some we have gotten unanimous votes--on \nbills that cost money, by the way. Republicans have voted for them, \ntoo. Republicans will vote for a good bill even if it costs some money. \nWe are not about to vote for something costing $2.5 trillion to $3 \ntrillion. I don't think the American people are going to stand for it.\n  Beware, my friends, of what you are doing. I can tell you right now \nthis isn't going to work. I want to make that point as clear as I can.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as a lifelong public servant, I have \nalways believed in the fundamental greatness of this country. I am sure \nthis is a belief shared by every single one of my colleagues in this \nbody. It is what drove us to serve in the first place, just as it has \ndriven generations of Americans to serve in many capacities throughout \nour history. Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, we are \nunited by our underlying faith in the democratic process and our \nrespect for the people we have come here to represent. That is what \nmakes this country great, the belief that together we can make \nprogress. Together, we can shape our own destiny. That is why we gather \nhere in this august Chamber, to bring the voices of the American people \nto Washington, to the very center of our democracy.\n  Earl Warren, the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, articulated \nthis very well:\n\n       Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. \n     Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or \n     economic interests.\n\n  He said this in reference to a court case about elected \nrepresentatives at the State level, but his insight rings especially \ntrue here in the highest lawmaking body in the land.\n  I ask my colleagues to reflect upon this simple truth for a moment. \nWe address one another as ``the Senator from Illinois'' or ``the \nSenator from Texas'' or ``the Senator from Colorado'' or ``the Senator \nfrom Utah,'' but we do not speak for towns, or companies, or lines on a \nmap. Our solemn duty is to listen to the people we represent and give \nvoice to their concerns and interests here in Washington. We strive to \ndo this every day, but far too often partisan politics get in the way.\n  When it comes to difficult issues such as health care reform, the \nvoices of the people sometimes get lost in all of the talk about \nRepublicans versus Democrats, red States versus blue States. The media \ngets caught up in the horse race and, more often than we would wish, \nthe atmosphere of partisanship follows us into this Chamber.\n  As our health care reform bill has cleared the first hurdle and moved \nto the Senate floor, I urge my colleagues to listen to the people--not \njust to the party leadership--as they decide how to vote. If they shut \nout the health care insurance lobbyists, the special interests, and the \npartisan tug of war, they might be surprised at what they will hear \nfrom the American people.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the weight of consensus is hard to \nignore. Folks stop me on the streets, stop me in hallways outside of my \noffice, talk to me on airplanes; they call, write, and e-mail. They \ncontact me every way possible. The message is always the same: We need \nreal health care reform. They are telling me don't give up and don't \nback down. That is because the American people overwhelmingly support \nreform. They need health care reform now--not tomorrow or next year, \nthey need it now.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of the uninsured people in their own \nStates. Think about that. Who are the ones who are uninsured? These are \nthe folks who need reform the most. We have all heard at least a few of \nthe heartbreaking stories. Sadly, we will never be able to hear them \nall because there are too many. So it is time for us to listen and to \ntake a stand on their behalf. It is time to bring comprehensive health \ncare reform to every State in the Union, because in my home State of \nIllinois, 15 percent of the population is uninsured. In the most \nadvanced country on Earth, this is simply unacceptable. We need to \ndramatically expand access to quality, affordable health care. But it \nis not just a blue States issue, it is an American issue. This is a \nproblem that touches all of us. In fact, as we look across the map, we \nsee that many of our States that need the most help are actually the \nred States.\n  Eighteen percent of the people in Tennessee and Utah don't have \nhealth insurance and cannot get the quality care they need. The number \nof uninsured stands at 20 percent in Alaska, and it is nearly 21 \npercent in Georgia, Florida, and Wyoming. In Oklahoma, Nevada, and \nLouisiana, more than 22 percent of the total population is uninsured, \nand 24 percent without health insurance in Mississippi. More than a \nquarter of the population in New Mexico can't get health insurance. In \nthe great State of Texas, almost 27 percent of the population has no \nhealth coverage. These numbers speak for themselves. We need to expand \ncoverage to include more of these people.\n  A recent study conducted by Harvard University shows that the \nuninsured are almost twice as likely to die in the hospital as similar \npatients who do have insurance. This human cost is unacceptable, and \nthe financial cost is too much to bear.\n  While my friends on the other side seek to delay and derail health \ncare reform at this crucial juncture, this bill seeks to save the \nhealth of our citizens, to save the lives of Americans, and to save \nmoney in the way coverage is offered and delivered. By extending \ncoverage to these individuals and increasing access to preventive care, \nwe can\n\n[[Page S12143]]\n\ncatch illnesses before they become serious.\n  That is why I am proud to support provisions such as the amendment \noffered by my colleague from the great State of Maryland, Senator \nMikulski. This measure would guarantee women access to preventive care \nand health screenings at no cost. If more women could get regular \nscreenings and tests, such as mammograms, we can catch illnesses such \nas breast cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. We can keep more people \nout of the emergency rooms, we can save lives, and we can save money.\n  The best way to expand access is to create a strong public option \nthat will lower costs, increase competition, and restore accountability \nto the insurance industry.\n  I am fighting for every single Illinoisan to make sure they have \naccess to quality, affordable health care, and to make sure they have \nreal choices. I am fighting for every Illinoisan, because every one of \nus will benefit from comprehensive reform. But I recognize that those \nwho are uninsured need help the most, and they need it now.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this need and to think about how many \nof their constituents stand to benefit from our reform package.\n  It is no secret that my Republican friends seek to block and delay \nthis legislation. Many of them represent the so-called red States, \nwhere opposing health care reform is seen as a good political move. In \nthe cynical course of politics as usual, most of those red States will \nbe written off because they typically support the Republican Party. But \nnot this time. Health reform isn't about politics. It is not about one \nparty or the other. It is about the lives that are at stake here that \nwe are trying to help. It is about the people who suffer every day \nunder a health care system that fails to live up to the promises of \nthis great Nation.\n\n  When it comes to our health care legislation, a vote against reform \nis a vote against the people who so desperately need our help. That is \nwhy I am asking my Republican friends to rise above politics as usual \nwhen they make this choice.\n  Recently, some of my colleagues across the aisle have said our bill \nwould slash Medicare. This is simply not the case. There is no cut in \nMedicare--no $465 billion cut. Our bill would do nothing of the kind. \nThis is another cynical attempt to scare seniors into opposing health \ncare reform. We have had enough of that.\n  The truth is this: According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, health care reform will lower seniors' Medicare premiums by $30 \nbillion over the next 10 years by focusing on prevention and wellness, \nincreasing efficiency and making the program more cost effective.\n  Our Republican friends can choose to engage in partisan games and \nspread fear and disinformation about health care reform, they can turn \ntheir backs on the people they swore to represent, or they can cast \naside the tired constraints of partisanship and stand up for what is \nright. When they go home to the people who sent them to Washington, \nthey can look those people in the eye and say: I fought for you. I \nstood up to the special interests, the campaign donors, and the \npolitical forces that tried to block reform. I didn't vote like a \nSenator who represents a red State or a blue State; I voted like a \nSenator who represented your State and all the good, hard-working \npeople who desperately need this help.\n  That is the spirit that drove each of us to enter public service in \nthe first place. That is what makes this country great, the belief that \npolicy is decided by the interests of the people, not big corporations \nor political parties.\n  This country is more than just a set of lines on a map, and the more \nyou cross those lines, the more you learn that ordinary Americans don't \ncare who scores political points or who gets reelected. They care about \nresults. They care about real costs and real health outcomes.\n\n  It is time for us to deliver. It is time to stand for the uninsured, \nthe sick, the poor, and all those who cannot stand for themselves. I \nsay to my colleagues, it is time to come together on the side of the \nAmerican people and make health care reform a reality. This health care \nlegislation that is being debated on this floor will save lives, it \nwill save money, and it will save Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and my two \ncolleagues be able to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to start by talking about the \nbill in general.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion before he starts?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator give us an indication of how long he \nexpects the colloquy to last?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Maybe 40 minutes, somewhere in there.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk about this bill. I \nwish to make some general comments about it. First, following the \ncomments of my colleague from Illinois, he said there are not $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in Medicare cuts. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, there are $464 billion to $465 billion in Medicare cuts. So \nmaybe not quite $\\1/2\\ trillion, but we are certainly getting close.\n  There are, however, $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes in this bill, 84 \npercent of which will be paid by those making less than $200,000 a \nyear, a direct violation of the campaign pledge made by President \nBarack Obama, then-Candidate Obama.\n  This bill will result in increased premiums and health care costs for \nmillions of Americans. This is a massive government takeover of our \nhealth care system. As a matter of fact, according to the National \nCenter for Policy Analysis, in this 2,074 page bill--there are almost \n1,700, 1,697 to be exact--references to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, giving her the authority to create, determine, or \ndefine things relating to health care policy in this bill. Basically, \nwe are placing a bureaucrat in charge of health care policy instead of \nthe patient and the doctor making the choices in health care.\n  I believe we cannot just be against this bill. What I do believe in \nis a step-by-step approach, an incremental approach, some good ideas on \nwhich we should be able to come together.\n  I think both sides agree we should eliminate preexisting conditions. \nSomebody who played by the rules, had insurance, happened to get a \ndisease, they should not be penalized, charged outrageous prices, or \nhave their insurance dropped. I think we can all agree on that.\n  We should be able to agree that if you can buy auto insurance across \nState lines, you should be able to buy health insurance in the State \nwhere it is the cheapest. Individuals should be able to find a State \nthat has a policy that fits them and their family and be able to buy it \nthere. If you can save money and you happen to be uninsured, especially \ntoday, it seems to make sense. Let's have that as one of our \nincremental steps.\n  I also believe this bill covers some of it, but I believe we need to \nincentivize people to engage in healthier behaviors. Seventy-five \npercent of all health care costs are caused by people's behaviors. Let \nme repeat that. Three-quarters of all health care costs are driven by \npeople's poor choices in their behavior.\n  For instance, smoking. On average, it is around $1,400 a year to \ninsure a smoker versus a nonsmoker. For somebody who is obese versus \nsomebody with the proper body weight, it is about the same, $1,400 a \nyear. For somebody who does not control their cholesterol versus \nsomebody on regulating medication, it is several hundred dollars a \nyear. For somebody who does not control their blood pressure versus \nsomebody who does--let's give incentives through lower premiums to \nencourage people to engage in healthier behaviors. That will save money \nfor the entire health care system and our Country will have healthier \npeople with better quality lives.\n  Currently, big businesses, because of their number of employees, are \nallowed to take advantage of purchasing power. We ought to allow \nindividuals and small businesses to join together in\n\n[[Page S12144]]\n\ngroups to take advantage of that purchasing power. They are called \nsmall business health plans.\n  I believe my colleagues are going to talk about an idea they have, \nsomething I talked about for years, the idea of medical liability \nreform. There are several models out there. They are going to talk \nabout a loser pays model, which other countries have engaged in and \nthey do not have nearly the frivolous lawsuits nor the defensive \nmedicine we practice in this country.\n  How many doctors order unnecessary tests in the United States because \nof fear of frivolous lawsuits? Talk to any doctor, and they will tell \nyou every one of them orders unnecessary tests simply to protect \nthemselves against the possibility that a jury may say: Gee, why didn't \nyou order this test even though it was not indicated at the time?\n  That accounts for a large amount of medical costs. As a matter of \nfact, the Congressional Budget Office said $100 billion between the \nprivate and public sector would be saved with a good medical liability \nreform bill.\n  I believe we need a patient-centered health care system, not an \ninsurance company-centered health care system, not what this bill does, \na government-centered health care system, where bureaucrats are in \ncontrol of your health care. We need a patient-centered system.\n  Before us we have the Mikulski amendment. This is more of government-\ncentered health care. There is a report out based on prevention that \nindicates that mammograms should not be paid for, basically, for women \nunder 50 years of age, from 40 to 50 years of age, and women in the \nMedicare population age, the report indicates that they do not need \nannual mammograms. This was based mainly on cost. If you look at it \nfrom a cost standpoint, that is probably correct.\n  But think about it. If you are a woman and you get cancer and you \ncould have had a mammogram diagnose it a lot earlier, you sure would \nrather have had that mammogram rather than have that mammogram denied.\n  The Senator from Maryland has proposed an amendment to try to fix the \nproblem. The problem is, instead of one government entity determining \nwhether somebody is going to get coverage, the amendment turns it over \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Another government \nbureaucrat will determine whether something such as a mammogram will be \npaid for. According to the Associated Press, her amendment does not \neven mention mammograms.\n  Senator Murkowski and Senator Coburn have come up with an alternative \nthat actually puts the decision of whether to cover preventive services \nin the hands of experts in the field. Whether it be a mammogram for \nbreast cancer, or an MRI, which most people think is going to be better \nthan a mammogram for diagnosing breast cancer, or whether it is a test \nfor prostate cancer for men. Those kinds of things should be determined \nby experts in the field, not by government bureaucrats.\n  The various colleges--the American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecology, for instance, has come out with certain recommendations, \nalong with the American College of Surgeons. Those are the experts with \npeer-reviewed science. Those are the individuals who should determine \nwhat the recommendations are as to whether we pay for preventive \nservices, not government bureaucrats.\n  Unfortunately, the Mikulski amendment just gives that determination \nto a government bureaucrat. That is why we should reject the Mikulski \namendment, and adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Alaska, \nthe Murkowski amendment puts the decision making in the hands of the of \nthe experts, where that decision should be made.\n  Let me close with this point. We have seen a lot of comparisons where \nare people saying that other countries have a better health care system \nthan the United States. Let me give you the example of cancer survival \nrates.\n  This chart compares the average cancer survival rates in the European \nUnion and the United States, it makes the point as to whether a \ngovernment bureaucrat is making a health decision or the doctor and the \npatient are making the health treatment decision.\n  For kidney cancer, the European Union has a 56 percent 5 year \nsurvival rate; the United States, 63 percent survival rate after 5 \nyears. On colorectal cancer, about the same difference between the \nUnited States and the European Union. Look at breast cancer, 79 percent \nafter 5 years in the European Union; 90 percent in the United States. \nThe most dramatic difference is on prostate cancer, 78 percent survival \nafter 5 years in the European Union; 99 percent survival rate in the \nUnited States.\n  These are dramatic differences. Where would you rather get your \nhealth care if you had one of these cancers? The United States or \nEurope?\n  Canada, has even worse results than this. As a matter of fact, \nBelinda Stronach, a member of the Canadian Parliament, led the charge \nagainst a private system side by side with the government-run system in \nCanada. She did not want the private system.\n  Tragically, a couple years later, she developed breast cancer. Did \nshe stay in Canada to get treatment, where there is a government-run \nhealth care system? No. Where did she go? She came to the United \nStates. She was actually treated at UCLA. Why, because we have a \nsuperior system of quality in the United States.\n  We have a problem with cost. Some of the incremental steps I talked \nabout will address costs.\n  I wish to turn it over now to my colleagues who are going to talk \nabout medical liability reform. Let's look out for the patient instead \nof the trial lawyers in the United States. Their idea on a loser pays \nsystem, I think, has a lot of merit, and it is something this body \nshould consider very seriously.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Georgia, my good friend and \ncolleague.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding. Senator Graham and I do have an amendment we have filed today \nwith respect to reforming the health care system in a real, meaningful \nway. It is an amendment that deals with tort reform, and it is a true \nloser pays system. We are going to talk about that in a few minutes.\n  Before I get to that, I wish to go back to some of the points the \nSenator from Nevada has talked about. I particularly appreciate his \nwork on the mammogram issue, especially since this has been highlighted \nover the last couple weeks with regard to the recommendation that has \ncome out of the independent board that advises HHS. I thank him for his \nwork on that issue.\n  He is dead on. All of us know our wives are told every year, when \nthey reach a certain age, they need to have a mammogram to make sure. \nJust like we do every year, go in and get a physical, they need to get \ntheir mammogram. The Senator talks about those kinds of checkups \nproviding you with the kind of preventive health care that is going to \nhold down health care costs. I am a beneficiary of that. During a \nroutine medical examination in 2004, it was determined I had prostate \ncancer. I was very fortunate it was picked up when it was, at an early \nstage. Instead of having to go through a lot of expensive procedures I \nmight have had to go through, we were fortunate to be able to treat it. \nWe are working on getting cured.\n  Senator Ensign is exactly right, this is the kind of test we need to \nmake sure we encourage females to get and not put barriers in front of \nthem.\n  Medicare is such a valuable insurance policy and program that 40 \nmillion Americans today take advantage of it. Mr. President, 1.2 \nmillion Georgians are Medicare beneficiaries. Again, I am one of those \nwho is a Medicare beneficiary. So this is particularly important to me.\n  More importantly, in addition to these 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are in the country today, there are another 80 \nmillion baby boomers who are headed toward Medicare coverage.\n  We have an independent Medicare Commission that was established by \nCongress years ago that is required to come to Congress every year and \ngive Congress an update on the financial solvency of the Medicare \nProgram. The purpose of that bipartisan Commission is to allow this \nbody, along with our colleagues over in the House, the benefit of the \nwork they do every year in looking at the amount of revenues that come \nin, in the form of the Medicare tax, and the outlays that go out, in \nthe\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\nform of payments to medical suppliers for our Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In the spring of this year, 2009, the independent Medicare Trustees \nReport reported back to Congress and said that unless real, meaningful \nreforms are made in the Medicare system, Medicare is going to start \npaying out more in benefits than it takes in in tax revenues in the \nyear 2017.\n  Mr. President, what that means is that in 2017, Medicare is going to \nbe insolvent, and it is just a matter of time before Medicare goes \ntotally broke. And those individuals who are baby boomers, who have \nbeen paying into this program for 40 years, 50 years, or whatever it \nmay be, are all of a sudden going to reach the Medicare age, where they \nexpect to reap the benefits of the Medicare taxes they have been paying \nfor all these years, and guess what. Not only are benefits going to be \nreduced, but unless something happens, unless there is meaningful \nreform and it is done in the right way, there is not going to be a \nMedicare Program.\n  I want to go back to something the junior Senator from Illinois said \na few minutes ago. In talking about this issue of cuts in Medicare, he \nsaid this bill we have up for debate now that was filed by Senator Reid \ndoes not have cuts in Medicare. He could not be more incorrect. And \nthat is not a Republican statement. It is not a statement by anybody \nother than the Congressional Budget Office. I refer to a letter that \nhas already been introduced during the course of this debate--a letter \ndated November 18--to the Honorable Harry Reid, the majority leader. I \nwould refer the Senator to page 10 of that letter in which the Director \nof the Congressional Budget Office says this in reference to provisions \naffecting Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs:\n\n       Other components of the legislation would alter spending \n     under Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal programs. In \n     total, CBO estimates that enacting these provisions would \n     reduce direct spending by $491 billion over the 2010-2019 \n     period.\n\n  Then the letter goes on, on this page alone, to delineate three areas \nwhere Medicare provisions are going to be reduced or cut, and I would \nspecifically refer to them, but first is a fee-for-service sector, and \nthis is other than physician services. It is going to be reduced by \n$192 billion over 10 years. The Medicare Advantage Program--a program \nthat literally thousands of Georgians take advantage of today and \nmillions of Americans take advantage of--is going to be reduced by $118 \nbillion over 10 years, over the period 2010 to 2019. Medicaid and \nMedicare payments to hospitals--what we call disproportionate share \npayments, DSH payments--are going to be reduced or cut by $43 billion \nover 10 years.\n  What does a reduction in these benefits mean to each individual \ncommunity or each individual State? I can tell you what it means to the \nlocal hospital in the rural area of Georgia where I live. The reduction \nin DSH payments is going to amount to a reduction in income at Colquitt \nRegional Medical Center in Moultrie, GA, by $16.8 million over a 10-\nyear period. These cuts in Medicare are going to result in a reduction \nin payments to Emory Hospital in Atlanta in the amount of $367 million \nover a 10-year period.\n  So anybody who says these aren't cuts in Medicare spending simply has \nnot read the bill and certainly has not read the letter from the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office to Senator Reid dated \nNovember 18, 2009.\n  I want to turn this over to my colleague from South Carolina after \nthis final statement with reference to reductions in Medicare spending.\n  There is a specific reduction of $8 billion in this bill over a 10-\nyear period in hospice benefits.\n  Again, we have heard a number of personal stories around here, and I \nhave a particular personal story myself. My father-in-law died when he \nwas 99 years old. It was 3 years ago. The last 2 years of his life, he \nlived in an assisted-living home and he had hospice come in 2 or 3 or 4 \ndays a week, for whatever he needed. Had he not had the benefit of \nhospice, he would have had to go in a hospital, and no telling how much \nin the way of Medicare medical expenses he would have incurred. But \nthank goodness we had hospice available, and he spent 2 days in the \nhospital. Otherwise, he was able to live in his assisted-living home, \nhave my wife go by and spend quality time with him, which she will tell \nyou today were the best 2 to 3 years of her life as far as her \nrelationship with her father was concerned, because she had hospice \nthere to take care of him. Yet here we are talking about reducing a \nbenefit by $8 billion that saved no telling how many thousands of \ndollars in the case of my family, and you can multiply that across \nAmerica, and it is pretty easy to see we don't need to be reducing a \nbenefit that is going to save us money in the long run.\n  I would like to turn it over to my friend from South Carolina, who \nalso has some comments regarding Medicare, and then we will talk about \nour loser pays bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my friend from Georgia, and I will try to be \nbrief.\n  I guess to say that we need to do health care reform is pretty \nobvious to a lot of people. The inflationary increases in the private \nsector, to businesses, particularly in the health care area, are \nunsustainable. A lot of individuals are having to pay for their own \nhealth care costs and are getting double-digit increases in premiums. \nIn the public sector, the Medicare and Medicaid Programs are \nunsustainable. Medicare alone is $38 trillion underfunded.\n  Over the next 75 years, we have promised benefits to the baby-boom \ngeneration and current retirees, and we are $38 trillion short of being \nable to honor those benefits.\n  What has happened? We have created a government program that everyone \nlikes, respects, and is trying to save, and actuarially it is not going \nto make it unless we reform it. So what have we done? In the name of \nhealth care reform, we have taken a program many senior citizens rely \nupon--all senior citizens, practically--and we have reduced the amount \nof money we are going to spend on that program and then taken the money \nfrom Medicare to create another program the government will eventually \nrun. It makes no sense.\n  We need to look at saving Medicare from impending bankruptcy. Why \nwould we reduce Medicare by $464 billion and take the money out of \nMedicare, which is already financially in trouble, to create a new \nprogram? It makes no sense to me. That is not what we should be trying \nto do, from my point of view, to reform health care.\n  The Medicare cuts Senator Chambliss was talking about, they are real. \nThe way our Democratic colleagues and friends try to get to revenue \nneutrality on the additional spending, to get it down to where it \ndoesn't score in a deficit format, is they take $464 billion out of \nMedicare to offset the spending that is required by their bill.\n  Here is the question for the country: How many people in America \nreally believe this Congress or any other Congress is actually going to \nreduce Medicare spending by $464 billion over 10 years? I would argue \nthat if you believe that, you should not be driving. There is \nabsolutely no history to justify that conclusion.\n  In the 111th Congress, there were 200 bills proposed--and I was \nprobably on some of them--to increase the amount of payments to \nMedicare. In 1997, we passed a balanced budget agreement when President \nClinton was President slowing down the growth rate of Medicare. That \nworked fine for a while, until doctors started complaining, along with \nhospitals, about the revenue reductions. Every year since about 1999, \n2000, we have been forgiving the reductions that were due under the \nbalanced budget agreement because none of us want to go back to our \ndoctors and say we are going to honor those cuts that were created in \n1997 because it is creating a burden on our doctors. Will that happen \nin the future? You better believe it will happen in the future. In \n2007, Senators Cornyn and Gregg introduced an amendment to reduce \nMedicare spending by $33.8 billion under the reconciliation \ninstructions. It got 23 votes. I remember not long ago the Republican \nmajority proposed reducing Medicare by $10 billion. Not one Member of \nthe Democratic Senate voted for that reduction. They had to fly the \nVice President back from Pakistan to break a tie over $10 billion.\n  So my argument to the American people is quite simple: We are not \ngoing to reduce Medicare by $464 billion, and if we don't do that, the \nbill is not paid for, and that creates a problem of monumental \nproportions. If we\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\ndo reduce Medicare by $464 billion and take the money out of Medicare \nto create another government program, we will do a very dishonest thing \nto seniors. We are damned if we do and damned if we don't. And during \nthe whole campaign, I don't remember anybody suggesting that we needed \nto cut Medicare to create health care reform for non-Medicare services, \nbut that is exactly what we are doing.\n  To my Democratic colleagues: There will come a day when Republicans \nand Democrats are going to have to sit down and seriously deal with the \nunderfunding of Medicare and with the impending bankruptcy of Medicare. \nEverything we are doing in this bill may make sense to save Medicare \nfrom bankruptcy, but it doesn't make sense to pay for another \ngovernment-run health care program outside of Medicare. It makes no \nsense to take the savings we are trying to find in Medicare and not use \nthem to save Medicare from what I think is going to be a budget \ndisaster.\n  So let it be said that this attempt to pay for health care, to make \nit revenue neutral, will require the Congress to do something with \nMedicare that it has never done before and is not going to do in the \nfuture. So the whole concept is going to fall like a house of cards.\n  The way we have tried to pay for this bill has so many gimmicks in \nit, it would make an Enron accountant blush.\n  Now, as to tort reform, quite frankly, I used to practice law and did \nmostly plaintiffs' work. I am not a big fan of Washington taking over \nState legal systems. I prefer to let States do what they are best at \ndoing and let the Federal Government do a few things well--and we are \ndoing a lot of things poorly. But if we are going to take over the \nentire health care system, if that is going to be the option available \nto us, then we also need to nationalize the way we deal with lawsuits.\n  And to the AMA: There will come a day, if we keep going down the road \nhere, where the Federal Government will determine how you get to be a \ndoctor. There will be no State medical societies, and we will have a \nnational system to police doctors. That is what is coming if we \ncontinue to nationalize health care.\n  So, with Senator Chambliss, I have tried to come up with a more \nreasoned approach when it comes to legal reform. I have always believed \npeople deserve their day in court. There is no better way to resolve a \ndispute than to have a jury do it. I would rather have a jury of \nindependent-minded citizens decide a case than a bunch of politicians \nor any special interest group. So the jury trial, to me, is a \nsacrosanct concept that has served this country well.\n  But one thing I have always been perplexed about in America is that \nthe risk of suing somebody is very one-sided. Most developed nations \nhave a loser pays rule. I think you should have your day in court, but \nthere ought to be a downside to bringing another person into the legal \nsystem. So I think a loser pays rule will do more to modify behavior \nthan any attempt to cap damages. Let both wallets be on the table. You \ncan have your day in court, but if you lose, you are going to have to \npay some of the other side's legal cost, which will make you think \ntwice.\n  As to the indigent person, most people who sue each other are not \nindigent. The judge would have the ability to modify the consequences \nof a loser pays rule, but we need to know going in that both wallets \nare on the table. Under our proposal, we have mandatory arbitration \nwhere the doctor and the patient will submit the case to an arbitration \npanel. If either side turns down the recommendation of the panel, they \ncan go to court. But then the loser pay rule kicks in.\n  I think that will do more to weed out frivolous lawsuits than \narbitrarily capping what the case may be worth in the eyes of a jury. I \nthink it really does create a financial incentive not to bring \nfrivolous lawsuits that does not exist today.\n  If there is a $500,000 damage cap, most of the people I know would \nsay: I will take the $500,000. That is not much of a deterrent. But if \nwe told someone they can bring this suit if the arbitration didn't go \ntheir way, but if they go into court after arbitration they risk some \nof their financial assets, people will think twice. I think that is why \nthis is a good idea. The National Chamber of Commerce has endorsed it, \nand I am proud of the fact that they have endorsed it.\n  I would rather not go down this road, but if we are going to \nnationalize health care we also need to do something about the legal \nsystem that is going to be affected by the nationalization of health \ncare.\n  A final comment I would like to make about what we are doing is that \nit is probably worrisome to people at home that we are about to change \none-sixth of the economy and cannot find one Republican vote to help. I \nguess there are two ways to look at that: It is the problem of the \nRepublican Party or maybe the bill is structured in a way that is so \nextreme there is no middle to it. I would argue that what we have done \nis abandon the middle for the extreme. It is pretty extreme, in my \nview, to take a program that is $38 trillion underfunded, cut it, and \ntake the money to create a new program rather than saving the one that \nis in trouble. It is pretty extreme, in my view, to take a country that \nis so far in debt you cannot see the future and add $2.5 trillion of \nmore debt onto a nation that is already debt laden in the name of \nreforming health care.\n  When you look at the second 10-year window of this bill, it adds $2.5 \ntrillion to the national debt. Is that necessary to reform health care? \nDo we need any more money spent on health care or should we just take \nwhat we spend and spend it more wisely? The first 10 years is a \ncomplete gimmick. What we do in the first 10 years of this bill is \ncollect the $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes for the 10-year period, and we \ndon't pay any benefits until the first 4 years are gone. That is not \nfair. That is a gimmick. That catches up with you in the second 10-year \nperiod.\n  So the reason we do not have any bipartisan support is because we \nhave come up with a concept that has no middle to it. This is a power \ngrab by the Federal Government. This is a chance to set in motion a \nsingle-payer health care plan that the most liberal Members of the \nHouse and the Senate have been dreaming of. This is a liberal bill \nwritten by and for liberals, and it is not going to get any moderate \nsupport on the Republican side--and there is some over here to be had--\nand they are going to have a hard time convincing those red State \nDemocrats that this is good public policy. That is where we find \nourselves, trying to change one-sixth of the economy in a way that you \ndon't have any hope of bringing people together.\n  I would argue we should stop and start over.\n  I thank my good friend from Georgia for trying to find a way to \nchange lawsuit abuse in a more reasoned fashion.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham, for his thoughtful process that we went through in thinking \nthrough the loser pays bill and the amendment we have filed. Just like \nyou, having practiced law for 26 years before I was elected to the \nHouse, the same year you were, and then we were elected over here, I \ntried plaintiffs cases as well as defendants cases. I never represented \na defendant in a malpractice case. I was always on the other side.\n  I have great sympathy for individuals who are wronged by a physician \nwho is negligent. You and I agree that anybody who is the victim of \nnegligent action ought to have their day in court. That is what we \nprovide for under our bill. There is absolutely no question about the \nfact that anybody who is subject to negligent acts on the part of a \nphysician, they can have their day in court, and they should have their \nday in court if that is what they decide they want to do.\n  But under a loser pays provision like we have designed, we can \neliminate, hopefully, the frivolous lawsuits that add significantly to \nthe cost of health care delivery in this country. In 2003, direct tort \nlitigation costs in America accounted for 2.2 percent of our GDP. That \nis double the percentage of Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, and \nAustralia--all of which have loser pays systems.\n  The State of Alaska has had a loser pays system since 1884 and tort \nclaims in the State of Alaska constitute a smaller percentage of total \nlitigation than the national average.\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\n  Florida, which applied a loser pays rule to medical malpractice suits \nfrom 1981 to 1985, saw 54 percent of their plaintiffs drop their suits \nvoluntarily.\n  It does make a difference on frivolous suits. In the State of Florida \nduring that same period of time, the jury awards for plaintiffs rose \nsignificantly. Just as in our situation, anybody who had a legitimate \ncase in Florida during that period of time had the right to have their \ncase adjudicated by a jury. Those who made the decision to do so \nreceived more significant awards. That is the way the system ought to \nwork.\n  This is a win-win situation for the cost of health care delivery. It \nis a benefit to the physicians--sure, because they eliminate part of \ntheir significant cost of delivering health care services. But it also \nis a huge benefit to those individuals in America who are subject to \nnegligent acts on the part of physicians.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Graham and myself \nfrom Bruce Josten at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, dated November 3, \n2009, be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Chambliss: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, thanks you \n     for introducing S. 2662, the ``Fair Resolution of Medical \n     Liability Disputes Act of 2009.''\n       This legislation represents a positive and significant step \n     toward providing a more reliable justice system for the \n     victims of medical malpractice. Your bill encourages the \n     states to establish alternative methods for resolving medical \n     liability claims and provides them with the latitude to \n     develop unique approaches that fit the needs of their diverse \n     populations. The Chamber commends you for making this \n     important and thoughtful effort to bring needed reforms to \n     America's medical liability systems.\n       The issue of medical liability reform is central to any \n     serious effort to overhaul America's healthcare system. The \n     Congressional Budget Office recently determined that medical \n     liability reform would reduce total national healthcare \n     spending by $11 billion in 2009 and reduce the federal budget \n     deficit by $54 billion over 10 years. The Chamber believes \n     these estimates of healthcare savings may be too \n     conservative. Yet nonetheless, the $54 billion in deficit \n     reduction is significant, representing over 10 percent of the \n     net cost of the insurance coverage provisions agreed to in \n     the Finance Committee's ``America's Healthy Future Act of \n     2009.'' We are confident that you will be a forceful and \n     effective advocate for medical liability improvements that \n     will expand access to justice for injured patients and lower \n     the cost of healthcare.\n       There is bipartisan agreement that for healthcare reform to \n     be successful, it must ``bend the growth curve,'' making \n     healthcare delivery more efficient and slowing healthcare \n     inflation. Medical liability reform should play a critical \n     role in any such effort. The Chamber appreciates your work on \n     this legislation and looks forward to working with you and \n     the Senate in the coming weeks and months to refine your \n     legislation and advance commonsense changes to our system of \n     resolving medical liability claims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Chair inform me how much time was used on the \nRepublican side during the last group of speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was 42 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I am going to proceed to speak in the \nsame manner and yield to the Senator from Vermont. Our time will be \nless than that in total.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana is here. We are going to be speaking \nless than 42 minutes. We guarantee him that much. We will follow the \nsame process, if there is no objection, that was just followed with \nthree Republican speakers who spoke in that 42-minute period of time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sanders be recognized after me \nto speak and that our total time be no more than 42 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just offered that to the Republican \nside, and they asked me for permission and I gave permission, unanimous \nconsent.\n  We will speak as long as we like. We will enter into a colloquy. I \nhope the Senator from Louisiana will reconsider.\n  Let me try to address a few of the issues that have been raised on \nthe Senate floor. First, on the issue of medical malpractice, this is \nan issue often brought up on the other side of the aisle.\n  The first thing I would like to say is this is the bill we are \ndebating. It is 2,074 pages, and one extra page makes it 2075 pages. It \nhas taken us a year to put this together. There have been a series of \ncommittee hearings that have led to the creation of this legislation. \nIt has been posted on the Web site for anyone interested. If they go to \nGoogle, for example, and put in ``Senate Democrats,'' they will be led \nto a Web site which will let them read every word of this bill. It has \nnow been out there for 12 days at least, and it will continue to be \nthere for review by anyone interested.\n  If you then Google ``Senate Republicans'' and go to their Web site on \nhealth care and look for the Senate Republican health care reform bill, \nyou will find--this bill, the Democratic bill, because there is no \nSenate Republican health care bill. For a year, and with an enormous \nnumber of speeches, they have come to the floor and talked about health \ncare but have never sat down and prepared a bill to deal with the \nhealth care system, which leads us to several conclusions.\n  This is hard work and they have not engaged in that hard work. It is \neasier to be critical of this work product. They have chosen that \nroute. That is their right to do. This is the Senate. We are the \nmajority party. We are trying to move through a bill. But all of the \nideas they have talked about tonight and other evenings have not \nresulted in a bill.\n  Second, it may be that they do not want to see a change in the \ncurrent system; they are happy with the health care system as it exists \ntoday. That is possible. In fact, I think it drives some of them to the \npoint where they criticize our bill but do not want to change the \nsystem because they like it.\n  I guess there are some things to like about it. There are good \nhospitals and doctors in America. Some people are doing very well with \nthe current system. But we also know there are some big problems. We \nknow the current system is not affordable. We know the cost of health \ninsurance has gone up 131 percent in the last 10 years; that 10 years \nago a family of four paid about $6,000 a year for health insurance. Now \nthat is up to $12,000 a year. We anticipate in 8 years or so it will be \nup to $24,000 a year. Roughly 40 percent or more of a person's gross \nincome will be paid in health insurance.\n  That is absolutely unsustainable. So businesses are unable to offer \nhealth insurance as well as individuals are unable to buy health \ninsurance. The Republicans have not proposed anything, nothing that \nwill make health insurance more affordable. This bill addresses that \nissue. They have nothing.\n  Second, we know there are about 50 million Americans without health \ninsurance. These are people who work for businesses that cannot afford \nto offer a benefits package. They are people who are recently \nunemployed, and they are people in such low-income categories they \ncannot afford to buy their own health insurance, and their children--50 \nmillion. This bill we have before us will give coverage to 94 percent \nof the people in America, the largest percentage of people insured in \nthe history of our country.\n  The Republicans have failed to produce a bill that expands coverage \nfor anyone in America. Under the Republican approach, nothing would be \ndone to help the 50 million uninsured.\n  The third issue is one about health insurance companies. Everybody \nhas an experience there. It is, unfortunately, not good for most, \nbecause when you pay premiums all your life and then need the health \ninsurance, many times it is not there. What we do is give consumers \nbargaining power and a fighting chance with health insurance. That, to \nme, is a reasonable approach. It eliminates discrimination against \npeople because of a preexisting condition and putting caps on the\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\namount of money that is being paid. We extend the coverage for children \nunder family health plans from age 24 to age 26. We do things that give \npeople peace of mind that when they need health insurance for \nthemselves and their family it will be there.\n  The Republicans fail to offer anything that deals with health \ninsurance reform. That is a fact. They have said a lot about Medicare.\n  I would like to tell you that tomorrow, or soon, I will be \ncosponsoring and Senator Bennet of Colorado will be offering an \namendment which could not be clearer on the issue of this bill and the \nMedicare Program. The amendment is so short and brief and direct and \nunderstandable, I want to read a couple of highlights:\n\n       Nothing in the provisions of, or amendments made by, this \n     Act shall result in the reduction of guaranteed benefits \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n\n  That is Medicare. What Senator Bennet is saying is that people will \nhave their Medicare benefits guaranteed. Nothing in this bill will \ninfringe on their Medicare benefits, despite everything that has been \nsaid.\n  The Bennet amendment goes on to say:\n\n       Savings generated for the Medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act under the provisions of, and \n     amendments made by, this Act shall extend the solvency of the \n     Medicare trust funds, reduce Medicare premiums and other \n     cost-sharing for beneficiaries, and improve or expand \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits and protect access to Medicare \n     providers.\n\n  All of the speeches made in the last 3 days about how this bill \nthreatens Medicare--it does not--will be completely cleared up by the \nBennet amendment. I hope some Republicans who have a newfound love of \nthe Medicare Program, which was started many years ago, will join us in \nvoting for this amendment. It would be great to see if their speeches \nto save Medicare will result in their votes for the Bennet amendment. \nThis is a critically important amendment. I commend him for being so \nstraightforward and showing real leadership on an issue of this \nmagnitude.\n  I know the Senator from Vermont is interested in speaking. I am \nprepared to yield for comments and questions. Before I do, I wish to \nsay by way of introduction that we heard one of our Republican \ncolleagues say this is a single-payer bill, that at the end of the day \nwe will have created a single-payer system. I think the Senator from \nVermont is familiar with the concept of single payer, and I would \ninvite his comments or questions through the Chair to me about his \nfeelings on this issue.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend from Illinois for asking that question \nbecause, coincidentally, we have just introduced and brought to the \ndesk legislation for a single-payer national health care program. I \nsuggest to my friend from Illinois and my Republican friends that it is \na very different bill than the legislation we are now looking at. In no \nway, shape, or form is the legislation being debated now a single-payer \nnational health care program. As my friend from Illinois understands--\nand I ask his views on this--I have heard some of our Republican \nfriends talk about how strong this current health care system is that \nwe have right now. I ask my friend from Illinois, do you think we can \ndo better than being the only major country in the industrialized world \nthat does not guarantee health care to all of its people? Can we do \nbetter than that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Vermont, we must do \nbetter. This is the only civilized, developed, industrialized country \nin the world where a person can literally die because they don't have \nhealth insurance. Forty-five thousand people a year die because they \ndon't have health insurance. What does that mean? One illustration: If \nyou had a $5,000 copay on your health insurance policy--and people face \nthat--and you go to the doctor and the doctor says: Durbin, we think \nyou need a colonoscopy, and I realize I have to pay the first $5,000 \nand the colonoscopy is going to cost $3,000, and I say I am going to \nskip it--which people do, and bad things happen--I develop colon cancer \nand die, my insurance has failed me. Basic preventive care is not \nthere. We are the only civilized, developed country where that is a \nfact.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask my friend from Illinois, has he talked to \nphysicians who have, on that issue, told him that they have lost \npatients who walked into their office and they say: Why didn't you come \nin here 6 months ago or a year ago? And that patient says: I didn't \nhave any money, and I thought maybe the pain in my stomach or my chest \nwould get better.\n  I have had that conversation with physicians in Vermont. I wonder if \nthe Senator has talked to physicians who have said the same thing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. A lady I met 2 weeks ago in southern Illinois, 60 years \nold, a hostess at a hotel who serves breakfast in the morning--they are \nthere as we travel around our States--has never had health insurance in \nher life, is diabetic, and told me that her income is so low, $12,000 a \nyear, she could not afford to go to a physician to check out some lumps \nshe had discovered. That is the reality of the current health care \nsystem in the wealthiest, greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We have heard discussions of death panels. I think the \nSenator might agree with me that when we talk about death panels, we \nare talking in reality about 45,000 people who die every single year \nbecause they don't get to a doctor on time. That seems to me to be what \na death panel is.\n  In the midst of all this, with 46 million uninsured, with 45,000 \npeople dying every year because they don't get to a doctor when they \nshould, when premiums have doubled in the last 9 years, when we have \nalmost 1 million Americans going bankrupt because of medically related \nbills, I ask my friend from Illinois, isn't it time for a change? Isn't \nit time this country now moves forward and provides health care for all \nof our people in a comprehensive and cost-effective way?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the Senator from \nVermont. I would add one more statistic. Of the nearly 1 million people \nfiling for bankruptcy in America each year because of health care \ncosts, medical bills they can't pay, three-fourths of them have health \ninsurance. Three-fourths of them were paying premiums. These were the \npeople turned down when they needed coverage. These were the people who \nran into caps on coverage on their policies. These are folks who had to \nbattle it out and lost the battle with the insurance companies to try \nto get lifesaving drugs. That is the reality of the current system.\n  The fact is, the Republican side of the aisle has not produced an \nalternative. We have. We have worked long and hard to do it. They have \nnot.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask my friend from Illinois if we are not only dealing \nwith the personal health care issue of 46 million uninsured and people \ndying, but are we not dealing with a major economic issue? How are \nbusinesses going to compete with the rest of the world when every \nsingle year they are seeing huge increases in their health insurance \npremiums, and rather than investing in the business that they are \nsupposed to be in, they are having to spend enormous sums of money as \nhealth care costs soar? I know small businesses in Vermont tell me that \nin some cases not only can they not provide health insurance to their \nworkers, they cannot even provide it for themselves. I have to believe \nthere is a similar situation in Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is. We are sent many books and some of them I have a \nchance to glance at. This is the recent one I received, entitled ``Bend \nthe Health Care Trend.'' They have here information which says: \nAmerican health care spending reached $2.4 trillion in 2008 and will \nexceed $4 trillion by 2018. We expect a doubling of basic health \ninsurance premiums in 8 to 10 years, and we know what you just \ndescribed is reality. Even businesses owned by a couple, a husband and \nwife, are finding themselves not only unable to provide health \ninsurance for their employees, because of its cost, they can't cover \nthemselves.\n  I had a friend of mine, one of my boyhood friends, I grew up with him \nand his wife. His small business had one of their employees under the \nhealth insurance plan, and his wife had a baby with a serious illness. \nAs a result, their premiums went through the roof. He had to cancel his \ngroup health insurance. He had to cancel the insurance he gave to his \nemployees. He gave his employees the $300 a month, whatever it\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\nwas they were paying, and said: We are all on our own now. We have to \ngo in the private market. The couple with the sick baby couldn't find \nany health insurance. My friend, who was in his 60s, and his wife are \nin a pitched battle every year about how much they have to pay for \nhealth insurance and the company, the only one that will cover them, \neach year excludes whatever they turned a claim in for last year. So \nthat is the reality of health insurance for small businesses.\n  I also want to tell my friend from Vermont, about one-third of all \nrealtors in America are uninsured, have no health insurance. They are \nindependent contractors, and they have no health insurance, one out of \nthree.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. While we are talking about the economics of health care, \nI wonder if my friend from Illinois has had the same experience I have \nhad in Vermont where people tell me they are staying on the job, not \nbecause they want to stay on their job but because the job is providing \ndecent health insurance. They can't go where they want to go because \nthe new job may not provide insurance or they are afraid about the \ninterval when they may not have any health insurance at all. I wonder \nif my friend from Illinois happened to see the piece in the paper, \nunbelievable, where a middle-aged fellow joined the U.S. military \nbecause his wife was suffering from cancer, and he couldn't find a way \nto get health care for her so he joined the military. Does the Senator \nthink this is what should be going on in the greatest country in the \nworld?\n  Mr. DURBIN. We can do better. I would say to those who call our plan \na single-payer plan, what we are trying to do is to get fair treatment \nfrom private health insurance companies for consumers and families \nacross America and to give them choices. The Senator from Vermont, I \nassume, is part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. So am \nI. Most Members of Congress belong to the program. Eight million \nFederal employees and Members of Congress are part of this program. It \nmay be the best health insurance in America. And we can shop. I just \ngot a notice in the mail that says open enrollment is coming. If you \ndon't like the way you were treated by your health insurance plan last \nyear, you can change. You can pick a new one. If it is a generous plan, \nmore money will be taken out of your check. If it is not, less money \nwill be taken out. We can shop. What we do on the insurance exchanges \nin this bill is say to these Americans who wouldn't otherwise have \noptions, go shopping. Find the best health insurance plan for your \nfamily. Exercise your choice.\n  I would say to Senator Harry Reid, who drafted this bill, I thank him \nfor his hard work. He includes a public option, a not-for-profit health \ninsurance plan with lower costs that people can choose, if they care \nto. Giving people that choice, giving them an option to go shopping for \nthe most affordable, best health insurance plan is what we enjoy as \nMembers of Congress and what every American family should.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask my friend from Illinois, does he think some of our \nRepublican friends feel so threatened and so upset by giving the \nAmerican people the option to choose a public Medicare-type plan as \nopposed to a private insurance plan? Do you think that maybe, just \nmaybe, some of our friends are more interested in representing the \ninterests of the big private insurance companies rather than the needs \nof the American people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague from Vermont, I am waiting for the \nfirst Republican Senator to offer an amendment to this bill to abolish \nMedicare. If they really believe that government health insurance is \nsuch a bad idea, they ought to step right up and show it.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would say to my friend from Illinois that that is an \ninteresting proposal and, in fact, I was almost thinking of offering an \namendment at one point. We have a lot of people in this country who \nstand up and say: Get the government out of health care. Well, I think \nsome of my Republican friends have kind of echoed that message. I do \nthink that the Senator from Illinois is right. We may bring forth an \namendment to allow our Republican friends to say: Let's abolish the \nVeterans' Administration. Because, as you know, that is a government-\nrun program which most veterans in my State and I think around the \ncountry are very proud of. They think it is a good program. From what \nthe statistics tell us, it is a very cost-effective way to provide \nquality health care to all of our veterans. Maybe we should bring \nforward an amendment to those who say get the government out of health \ncare. If you want to abolish the Veterans' Administration, go for it. \nAnd what about TRICARE. Maybe you want to abolish TRICARE. Go for it. \nMaybe you want to abolish SCHIP which is providing high quality health \ninsurance for millions of kids. Maybe we might work together and bring \nforth an amendment.\n  Let our Republican friends who say get the government out of health \ncare, let them abolish the Veterans' Administration, Medicare, SCHIP, \nMedicaid, let them do that. We will see how many votes they might get.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is another way that Senators who loathe the idea of \ngovernment-run health insurance plans can show personally their \ncommitment to that idea, by coming to the floor and publicly announcing \nthey will not participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit \nProgram which provides health insurance for Members of Congress. I have \nyet to hear the first Member, critical of government health plans, come \nforward and say: So in a show of unity and personal commitment, I am \ngoing to opt out.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I suggest to my friend from Illinois that we could take \nit a step further. I go to the Capitol physician's office. That is \nwhere I go. We pay extra money for it. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield, \nbut I go there. Do you know who runs the Capitol physician's office, \nwhich I suspect the vast majority of the Members of Congress go to and \nget very fine primary health care?\n  Well, it is that terrible government agency, the U.S. Navy. So maybe \nsome of our friends who are busy denouncing government health care \nmight want to say they do not want to take advantage of that very fine, \nhigh quality health care, and that speaks for the whole military as \nwell. While we are at it, maybe you should abolish health care for the \nU.S. military, which is all government run and, by the way, generally \nregarded as pretty good quality health care.\n  I would ask my friend his views on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not think you will hear that. I think you will hear \na lot of speeches about socialized medicine, socialism, and the big \nreach of government.\n  When it comes right down to it, there is not a single Member from the \nother side who stepped up and said: Therefore, I will offer an \namendment to abolish it. They will have their chance in this bill, and \nif they want to, they can. I do not think the people who have this \ncoverage today would like to see it gone.\n  Mr. SANDERS. It might be an interesting amendment, I would say to my \nfriend. There is another area where it is a semigovernment nonprofit, \nwhich I know the Senator from Illinois feels very strongly about, and \nthat is the Federally Qualified Community Health Centers begun by \nSenator Kennedy over 40 years ago, where we now have over 1,200 \ncommunity health centers all over this country. In fact, I know this is \nwidely supported in a bipartisan or tripartisan way, because the \nFederally Qualified Community Health Centers provide quality health \ncare and dental care and low-cost prescription drugs and mental health \ncounseling.\n  I might say to my friend from Illinois, one of the provisions in that \n2,000-page bill he is holding up is legislation he and I and others \nhave worked hard on, which is to substantially expand the Community \nHealth Center Program into every underserved area in America. We talk \nabout 46 million people being uninsured in this country. We have 60 \nmillion people who do not have access to a doctor on a regular basis.\n  If we expand the Community Health Center Program, if we expand to a \nsignificant degree the National Health Service Corps so we can help \nyoung people become primary health care physicians by paying off their \nvery substantial medical debts, would my friend agree with me that this \nwould be a major step forward in improving primary health care in \nAmerica?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Vermont has been a leader on this\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\nissue. I can recall when President Obama came forward with his stimulus \nbill, the recovery and reinvestment bill, that the Senator from Vermont \nwas one of the leaders to put additional funds in the bill to build \nclinics all across America--in rural areas we represent, in the towns \nand cities we represent as well--for the very reason the Senator \nmentioned: Because for a lot of people who I represent in downstate, \nsouthern Illinois, in some of the rural regions, it is a long drive to \na doctors clinic for primary care. So these community health clinics, \nFHQA clinics, are going to offer people primary care.\n  I think as a result of this bill, when we enact it--and I feel very \ngood about the enactment of this because I think we sense this is a \nmoment in history we should not miss--we are going to see this network \ngrow across America. And it has proven itself to be so good.\n  In the city of Chicago, I have visited these community health \nclinics. I will bet the Senator does in Vermont. What I find there--\nmany times I will walk in the door. The administrator will be there. We \nwill start talking. I will meet the doctors. I will meet the nurses. \nWhen I finally get a chance to drink a cup of coffee and talk to them \nfor a few minutes, I say--and I mean it--if I were sick, I would feel \nconfident walking into the front door of this clinic, that I would be \nin the best of hands--better than the most expensive clinic in my \nState.\n  Mr. SANDERS. My friend from Illinois makes the point. And I have \nvisited virtually all of them in the State of Vermont. We have gone \nfrom 2 to 8, with 40 satellites. We have over 100,000 people in the \nState of Vermont who now use these Federally Qualified Health Centers.\n  I know my friend from Illinois is also aware that when you talk about \nhealth care, you have to talk about dental care.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Because what is true in Vermont is true in Illinois. You \nhave a whole lot of people who do not have access to a dentist, which \nthese Federally Qualified Health Centers now provide, and mental health \ncounseling, and low-cost prescription drugs.\n  So I thank my friend from Illinois. I am sure the Senator and I are \ngoing to work together to make sure we, in fact, are successful in \nkeeping people out of the emergency room, keeping them out of the \nhospital, by enabling them to get the medical care they need when they \nneed it. I look forward to working with my friend on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say, the Senator from Vermont has also raised an \nimportant issue. We know we are going to need more primary care \nphysicians, so there are provisions in this bill to encourage young \npeople to pursue primary care--internists, family practitioners--\nbecause those are the frontline people who are needed more frequently \nfor preventive care and basic checkups, so people have a chance to see \na good doctor before they get sick or become seriously ill and it is \nmuch more expensive.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So we are pushing forward for more and more health care \nprofessionals. Again, the Republican critics of this legislation have \noffered nothing--nothing--when it comes to encouraging the growth in \nthe number of our health care workers in America. This ought to be \nsomething that is nonpartisan. I would think that at some point they \nwould agree that many things in here are essential for the future of \nour country. I think that is one of them.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Would my friend from Illinois agree, it does not make a \nwhole lot of sense for people who do not have health insurance today to \ngo into an emergency room and run up a huge cost or to get terribly ill \nbecause they do not go to a doctor when they should and end up in the \nhospital? Wouldn't it make a lot more sense, both for the personal \nhealth of the individual and saving money for the system, to provide \nhealth care to people when they need it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Vermont. I would say we \nhave some of the best health care in America but also the most \nexpensive health care in America. We spend more per person than any \nother nation on Earth, and a lot of it has to do with money not being \nwell spent. People who do not have access to a medical home, which we \nestablish in this bill, people who do not have access to a community \nhealth care clinic, in desperation, will take a baby with a high fever \nin to an emergency room.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They will wait for hours to finally see a doctor. Once \nthere, they will have the most expensive care they could ever face, \nwhen they could have gone for a doctor's appointment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Exactly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And taken care of it for a fraction of the cost. That is \nnot good for the hospitals because many of them are giving charity care \nthey do not get compensated for, and they pass that cost along to other \npatients, and it certainly is not good for the families involved.\n  Mr. SANDERS. At this point, let me thank my friend from Illinois for \nallowing me to engage in this colloquy with him. I am going to yield \nback the floor to him and thank him for his very good work.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I say, at this point in time, we have three or four amendments before \nthe Senate on health care reform. We started the debate on Monday. We \nare now wrapping up Wednesday. We are about to go into the 4th day of \nthe debate on one of the most important bills in the history of the \nU.S. Senate, and we have yet to reach an agreement with the Republican \nside of the aisle to have the amendments voted on.\n  If we are only doing four amendments or three amendments in 4 days, \nthis is not going to be the kind of debate the American people \nexpected. They expected us to bring issues before the floor here, \ndebate them, with a reasonable period of time, and then vote and move \nto another issue. Certainly, there are a lot of things to talk about.\n  So I hope the Republican side of the aisle will have a change of \nheart and will start to join us in this dialog, will offer their \namendments in a timely fashion--we will give them their opportunity to \ndebate them--and then bring them to a vote. But the fact is, we have \nnot had a single vote this week on health care reform amendments \nbecause of objections from the other side. That is not in the interest \nof moving forward this important legislation and giving Members an \nopportunity to present their amendments and have them voted on in a \ntimely fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after any \nleader time on Thursday, December 3, and the Senate resumes \nconsideration of H.R. 3590, it be in order for any of the majority or \nRepublican bill managers to be recognized for a total period of time \nnot to extend beyond 10 minutes, equally divided and controlled; that \nthe time until 11:45 a.m. be for debate with respect to the Mikulski \namendment No. 2791 and the McCain motion to commit; and during this \ntime it be in order for Senator Murkowski to call up her amendment with \nrespect to mammography, a copy of which is at the desk; and that it \nalso be in order for Senator Bennet of Colorado to call up amendment \nNo. 2826, a side-by-side amendment with respect to the McCain motion to \ncommit; that no other amendments or motions to commit be in order \nduring the pendency of these amendments and motion; that at 11:45 a.m., \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment No. \n2791; that upon disposition of the Mikulski amendment, the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the Murkowski amendment; that upon \ndisposition of these two amendments, the Senate continue to debate \nuntil 2:45 p.m. the Bennet of Colorado amendment No. 2826 and the \nMcCain motion to commit, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Baucus and McCain or their designees; that at 2:45 \np.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Bennet of Colorado \namendment No. 2826; that upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate \nthen proceed to vote in relation to the McCain motion to commit; that \nprior to the second vote in each sequence, there be 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided and controlled in the\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\nusual form; that each of the above referenced amendments or motion be \nsubject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold, and that if the amendments \nor motion do not achieve that threshold, then they be withdrawn; \nfurther, that if any of the above listed achieve the 60-vote threshold, \nthen the amendment or motion be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; further, that it be in order if there is a \nrequest for the yeas and nays to be ordered with respect to that \namendment or motion, regardless of achieving the 60-vote threshold, \nthat if the yeas and nays are ordered, the vote would occur immediately \nwith no further debate in order with respect to this particular \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I would just like to point out we have had some \ndifficulty actually on both sides getting to the two votes that are \ndesignated in this consent agreement.\n  Our side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, was prepared \nto vote on both of those amendments tonight. Then a problem developed \non the other side, which I understand because we had had a problem on \nour side earlier. But I do just want to make it clear that Republicans \nwere prepared and fully ready and willing to vote on the two amendments \nin the consent agreement tonight.\n  Mr. President, I do not object.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I certainly concur with the distinguished majority \nwhip's goal of more amendments and more votes.\n  With regard to this very important screening and mammography issue, \nmy goal has been a very focused one. I have a filed second-degree \namendment that has a very simple, focused objective, which I believe is \nextremely noncontroversial. I believe it would be supported by everyone \nin this body, and that is simply to ensure that there is no legal force \nand effect to the recent recommendations issued in November of 2009 by \nthe U.S. Preventative Services Task Force with regard to breast cancer \nscreening, use of mammography, and self-examination.\n  As everyone knows, those new recommendations were shocking in that \nthey took a giant step back from the previous recommendations and took \na giant step back in terms of recommended screening, which virtually \nevery expert I know of strongly disagrees with.\n  So this filed, simple second-degree amendment simply says that those \nnew recommendations of November of this year have no force and effect. \nI will read the amendment. It is very short. To be clear, it does \nnothing more than that.\n\n       [F]or the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any \n     other provision of law, the current recommendations of the \n     United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast \n     cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be \n     considered the most current other than those issued in or \n     around November 2009.\n\n  So we are simply ensuring that those new recommendations--which I \nstrongly disagree with, experts strongly disagree with, I believe all \nof my colleagues do--have no legal force and effect. So I would simply \nask that the unanimous consent proposed be modified so that the \nMikulski amendment incorporates this language. I would propose that as \nan alternative unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request from the Senator from \nIllinois?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I continue to reserve my right to object. I am very \ndisappointed about objecting to this important and what should be \nnoncontroversial provision. I would suggest another solution, which is \nto take the unanimous consent request on the floor and modify it so \nthere is simply a vote on this second-degree amendment, amendment No. \n2808, immediately before the vote on the Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not sure I would support or oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, but this matter has been on the \nfloor now for 3 days. I say to the Senator, there is a pending \namendment here on your side of the aisle from Senator Murkowski on this \nissue, and I would hope that the Senator has approached her to \nincorporate his language. I do not know if the Senator approached \nSenator Mikulski. But at this point we think we have some effort being \nmade at fairness on both sides, that there will be Democratic \namendments and Republican amendments both offered--Mikulski and \nMurkowski and McCain and Bennet--and so I would object because I \nbelieve we have the basis for a fair agreement at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \noriginal request of the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, again, I am \nvery disappointed to hear that. I have approached both sides. Senator \nMurkowski has incorporated similar language, and I was hoping we could \ncome together, 100 to nothing, to actually pass this on to the bill, \nwhichever alternative tomorrow is voted up--and maybe they both will \nbe--but whichever is voted up or whichever is voted down, I think it is \nvery important to come together and state that we don't want these new \ntask force recommendations to have any force and effect.\n  So let me propose a third and final alternative unanimous consent \nrequest: that at any point after these votes, but before cloture is \nfiled on the pending matter, this amendment No. 2808 receive a vote on \nthe Senate floor as a first-degree amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I \nsuggest to my friend from Louisiana, would you consider approaching \nSenators Mikulski and/or Murkowski the first thing tomorrow and see if \nthey are prepared to work with you on this? This Mikulski amendment has \nbeen pending for 3 days.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I could----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, then, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, just so I \ncan respond directly, I didn't mean to cut the Senator off. If he has \nany further statement, I will be happy to listen to it. But just so I \ncan respond directly, the first thing today, I approached both those \nMembers and everyone involved in this debate about this language and \ncertainly the majority side has had this language for at least 7\\1/2\\ \nhours. The equivalent of this language has been incorporated into the \nMurkowski amendment, but my hope is that the same thing be accepted in \nthe Mikulski amendment because it is not clear which is going to be \nadopted. I don't see the great controversy here. So that was my hope. \nAnd that is why I approached those two Senators and the majority side \n7\\1/2\\ hours ago about it with specific language.\n  So I renew my last unanimous consent request I made in that spirit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, the staff advises me that \nthey are reaching out to Senator Mikulski at this moment. I don't know \nif we can be in contact with her this evening, but I would ask the \nSenator from Louisiana if he would consider allowing us to go forward \nwith this unanimous consent request and hope we can still modify it \ntomorrow, if there is an agreement with Senator Mikulski at that point. \nI don't think that jeopardizes the right of the Senator from Louisiana \nto offer this at a later time during the course of this debate.\n  Based on that, I would continue to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\n  Is there objection to the original unanimous consent of the Senator \nfrom Illinois?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, merely to \nrespond through the Chair, I would say I have been working in that \nspirit. I have given the language to the majority side. I have been \nworking both at the staff level and Member level with many folks. This \nshould be noncontroversial. I don't know of any Senator who disagrees \nwith this. So I will accept that offer. I will not object to this \npending unanimous consent, but I truly hope the offer is made in good \nfaith because I believe, when anyone reads this language, they will \nagree with it.\n  Again, it simply says these latest recommendations by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force, made 2 weeks ago, will not have any \nlegal force and effect. I believe all of us--certainly, it is my \nimpression and, I guess, we will find out tomorrow morning--I believe \nall of us want to stop them from having force and effect because it is \na great step backward in terms of breast cancer screening and \nmammography and even education about self-examination.\n  So I certainly take that offer and look forward to the majority side \nrereading this language and hopefully accepting it tomorrow morning \nbecause I can't imagine, on substantive grounds, objecting to the \nlanguage.\n  Thank you. With that, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request from the \nSenator from Illinois is agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2808 to Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder with respect to H.R. 3590 be modified to provide that the Vitter \namendment No. 2808 to the Mikulski amendment No. 2791 be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the order be \nfurther modified to provide that the vote with respect to the Mikulski \namendment should now reflect the Mikulski amendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2808) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prevent the United States Preventive Service Task Force \n         recommendations from restricting mammograms for women)\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment, after line 15 insert the \n     following:\n       ``(5) for the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of \n     any other provision of law, the current recommendations of \n     the United States Preventive Service Task Fore regarding \n     breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be \n     considered the most current other than those issued in or \n     around November 2009.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12152-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of a \nKentucky heroine, Ms. Mary Josephine Oberst of Owensboro. Ms. Oberst \npassed away on November 13, 2009, at the age of 95. A native \nKentuckian, she proudly served her country as a member of the Army \nNurse Corps beginning in 1937. In July 1941, Ms. Oberst was sent to the \nPhilippines, and in early May the following year, when Bataan and \nCorregidor fell to the Japanese during the Battle of the Philippines, \nmore than 60 nurses, including Ms. Oberst, were taken as prisoners of \nwar, POWs, by the Japanese. These nurses, later christened the ``Angels \nof Bataan,'' were held as POWs for 33 months. During this time, Ms. \nOberst continued her duties as a nurse, caring for fellow prisoners, \neven though she herself suffered from malaria and significant weight \nloss. In early February 1945, the 44th Tank Battalion rescued the POWs \nwho were later brought back to the United States.\n  After overcoming the medical conditions which resulted from her \nimprisonment, Ms. Oberst was appointed captain and continued to serve \nas a member of the Army Nurse Corps. She worked in hospitals in \nLouisville, KY; Fort Knox, KY; and Ashford, WV, until her retirement \nfrom the Corps in 1947. Ms. Oberst was honored for her duty with \nseveral military service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal. Mary \nJosephine Oberst was a woman of high character, who faithfully served \nour country. Today, I wish to honor her life and her service, as well \nas give my condolences to her family for their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12152-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12152-S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMINATOU HAIDAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of \nSenators who may not already be aware, a situation that has been \nunfolding in Morocco and the Canary Islands.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of meeting Ms. Aminatou Haidar, called \nby some the ``Saharawi Gandhi,'' who received the 2008 human rights \naward from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. \nMs. Haidar is a focus of attention again today because she is on a \nhunger strike in the Canary Islands after being summarily deported by \nthe Moroccan Government on her way home to Western Sahara from the \nUnited States, where, coincidently, she had been to receive the ``Civil \nCourage Prize'' from the Train Foundation.\n  Ms. Haidar is no newcomer to difficulties with the Moroccan \nauthorities. She was first imprisoned in 1987 when she was a 20-year-\nold college student, after calling for a vote on independence for \nWestern Sahara. When she was released after 4 years, during which she \nwas badly mistreated, she continued her advocacy for the right of the \nSaharawi people to choose their own future.\n  Arrested again in 2005 and separated from her two daughters, she led \na group of 37 other Saharawi prisoners on a 51-day hunger strike for \nbetter prison conditions, investigations into allegations of torture, \nand the release of political prisoners.\n  Since her 2006 release, she has continued her nonviolent struggle, \nwhich has brought widespread attention to the cause of the Saharawi \npeople. The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly endorsed a \nreferendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara.\n  On November 13, when Ms. Haidar arrived at the airport in El-Ayoun, \nshe was detained by Moroccan authorities. She was told that by \ninsisting on writing her place of residence as ``Western Sahara'' on \nher immigration form, she was in effect waiving her Moroccan \ncitizenship. Her passport was taken, and she was forcibly put on a \nplane without travel documents to the Canary Islands, a Spanish \narchipelago located 60 miles west of the disputed border between \nMorocco and Western Sahara.\n  She remains there at the airport, separated from her daughters, in \nthe 17th day of a hunger strike, and her health is reportedly rapidly \ndeteriorating. She has refused an offer of a Spanish passport, \ninsisting that she will not be a ``foreigner in her own country,'' and \nthe Moroccan Government refuses to reinstate her passport. She is, in \neffect, a stateless person.\n  This is unacceptable. Article 12 of the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, which Morocco has ratified, states in part, \n``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. . . . \nNo one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own \ncountry.''\n  The situation in Western Sahara is a difficult one for the Saharawi \npeople and the Moroccan Government. It is a protracted dispute in which \nthe international community has invested a great deal to try to help \nresolve, without success. I recall the time and energy former Secretary \nof State James Baker devoted to it. The solution he proposed was \nrejected by the Moroccan Government.\n  Morocco and the United States are friends and allies, and I have \ncommended the Moroccan Government for\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\npositive steps it has taken in the past to improve respect for human \nrights and civil liberties. On a recent trip to North Africa, Secretary \nClinton was complimentary of Morocco's efforts to reach a peaceful \nsolution in Western Sahara. But the Saharawi people, including Aminatou \nHaidar, have passionately advocated for the right to self-\ndetermination, and the international community, including the U.N., has \nlong supported a referendum on self-determination, which has thus far \nbeen blocked by the Moroccan Government.\n  I have no opinion on what the political status of Western Sahara \nshould be, but I am disappointed that the Moroccan authorities have \nacted in this way because it only adds to the mistrust and further \nexacerbates a conflict that has proven hard enough to resolve. Nothing \npositive will be achieved by denying the basic rights of someone of Ms. \nHaidar's character and reputation, or restricting the right to travel \nof other residents of Western Sahara, as the Moroccan authorities have \nincreasingly done in the last 2 months.\n  In the past, the United States has opposed proposals to extend the \nU.N.'s mandate in Western Sahara, currently limited to peacekeeping, to \nhuman rights monitoring. The recent crackdown on Ms. Haidar and other \nSaharawis who continue to insist on a referendum on self-determination \nsuggests that human rights monitoring is needed and should be seriously \nconsidered when the U.N. mission comes up for renewal in April. I \nencourage the Department of State to review this question and to \nconsult with the Congress about it.\n  I am confident that our relations with Morocco, already strong, will \ncontinue to deepen in the future. We share many important interests. \nBut the United States was also instrumental in the creation of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and while we sometimes fall \nshort ourselves, we will continue to strive to defend those whose \nfundamental rights are denied, wherever it occurs.\n  I appreciate the efforts the Department of State has made to try to \nhelp resolve this situation. I urge the Moroccan Government to \nreconsider its decision to deport Ms. Haidar, which will not advance \nits interests in the conflict over Western Sahara. It should return her \npassport, readmit her, and let her return to her home and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12153-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOICE OF AMERICA'S UKRAINIAN SERVICE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, for six decades the Voice of America's, \nVOA, Ukrainian-language service has been providing an invaluable \nservice through its consistent broadcasting of factual and \ncomprehensive news and information to the people of Ukraine.\n  During the first four decades of its existence, the Ukrainian service \nreached a Ukrainian population starving for information under an \nextremely strictly controlled, propagandistic Soviet media environment. \nUkrainians went to great lengths and some risks to overcome Soviet \ncensorship, which included the jamming of VOA and other shortwave \ninternational broadcasting.\n  During the Cold War VOA Ukrainian provided its listeners with \nuncensored news about such monumental events as the Hungarian \nRevolution, the Prague Spring, rise of Solidarity, and the fall of the \nBerlin Wall. A variety of shows worked to open the outside world to \nUkrainian listeners, including a Popular Music Show, a Youth Show, and \nthe long running series Democracy in Action, which was about how \ndemocracy works in the United States.\n  The Ukrainian service also focused on developments within Ukraine \nitself. VOA broadcasts about Soviet human rights violations in Ukraine, \nincluding its coverage of activities of the Helsinki process and the \nHelsinki Commission, gave sustenance to Helsinki Monitors and other \nUkrainian human rights activists, especially those languishing in the \ngulag for daring to call upon the Soviet government to live up to its \nHelsinki Final Act obligations. They knew that they were not forgotten. \nFurthermore, the Ukrainian service also provided objective information \nabout the Chornobyl nuclear disaster and the development of Ukraine's \nmovement for democracy and independence, culminating in the December 1, \n1991, referendum in Ukraine in which an overwhelming majority of \nUkrainians voted for the restoration of their nation's independence.\n  For nearly two decades since, VOA's Ukrainian service has continued \nto fill an important role in Ukraine's evolving democracy. VOA reported \non the challenges that Ukraine faced and on the U.S.'s considerable \nsupport and assistance for Ukraine, including in the dismantling of the \nnuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. During the Orange \nRevolution, VOA Ukrainian helped to reassure millions of Ukrainians \nthat the international community would not sanction electoral fraud.\n  As Ukraine has evolved, so has the Ukrainian Service. While no longer \nbroadcasting on radio as it did for most of its 60 years, it reaches \nmore Ukrainians than ever with daily broadcasts over Ukrainian \ntelevision--something unthinkable during Soviet rule--and reporting on \nits website. It continues to report on what is happening in Ukraine, \nbut also it continues to cover every aspect of American life and \nsociety. As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I commend the ongoing \nrole of VOA's Ukrainian service in helping Ukraine fulfill its \naspirations in becoming a more fully democratic, independent, and \nsecure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12153-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12153-S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of World AIDS \nDay, an international commemoration held each year on December 1 to \nraise awareness of HIV and AIDS around the world. The theme for this \nyear's World AIDS Day is ``universal access and human rights.''\n  Around the world, 33 million people were living with HIV in 2007, \nincluding 2.7 million new infections. In the U.S., more than 1.2 \nmillion people are infected with HIV. According to the Joint United \nNations Program on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS, global reports indicated that 2 \nmillion people died from AIDS-related causes in 2007.\n  Globally, sub-Saharan Africa is the hardest-hit region when it comes \nto HIV infection, accounting for two-thirds of all people living with \nHIV and for three-quarters of AIDS deaths in 2007. Sadly, 75 percent of \nyoung people worldwide who are diagnosed with HIV are girls living in \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  According to the results of a global youth survey conducted in 99 \ncountries, 50 percent of young people have a dangerously low knowledge \nof how the disease is contracted and can be prevented. Another report \nby UNAIDS collected data from 64 countries and found that fewer than 40 \npercent of young people have basic information about HIV. This \nknowledge gap is particularly disturbing when taking into account a \nUNICEF report that indicates that 4.9 million young people, ages 15-24, \nare living with HIV worldwide.\n  Despite these statistics, recent advances in prevention and treatment \nof HIV give hope for the future. Globally, approximately 38 percent of \nthe 730,000 children under 15 who needed antiretroviral drugs to treat \nHIV in 2008 were receiving the necessary therapy, according to UNAIDS. \nThis is a huge increase from just a little over 10 percent in 2005.\n  The percentage of pregnant women living with HIV who received \nantiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission has \nincreased from 9 percent in 2004 to 33 percent in 2007.\n  Despite recent improvements in treatment coverage and declining \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV, problems remain in preventing and \ntreating the disease. In addition, the number of new HIV infections \ncontinues to outpace the advances made in treatment numbers for every \ntwo people put on antiretroviral drugs, another five become newly \ninfected with the disease. Clearly, prevention measures are essential \nto continue the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  No State in the U.S. is immune from the effects of HIV/AIDS, and the \nepidemic is deeply felt among Marylanders as well. At the end of 2007, \nMaryland had 28,270 people living with HIV and AIDS. That same year, \nMaryland ranked fourth in the U.S. for the number of AIDS cases per \n100,000 people.\n  The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has estimated \nthat\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nthere are between 6,000 and 9,000 Marylanders who are unaware that they \nare infected with HIV. Of the 1.2 million people in the United States \nwho are estimated to be infected with HIV, as many as 21 percent are \nunaware that they have the virus.\n  To address this problem, it is crucial that HIV screening be readily \navailable and accessible to everyone at little or no cost. This will \nincrease the rate of diagnosis in individuals that have HIV and will \naccelerate their treatment.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will address this need \nand will help achieve the goals outlined by the theme of this year's \nWorld AIDS Day campaign of ``universal access and human rights.''\n  First and foremost, the bill eliminates discrimination based on pre-\nexisting conditions. Individuals with HIV will no longer be rejected \nfrom insurance coverage because of their disease.\n  The bill also encourages outreach to enroll vulnerable and \nunderserved populations in Medicare and CHIP, including adults and \nchildren with HIV/AIDS. It provides personal responsibility education \ngrants to States to create HIV/AIDS education programs for adolescents.\n  The bill will also cover preventive services recommended by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force, including HIV testing for all pregnant \nwomen. This testing will be provided at no individual cost, making it \nuniversally accessible to all women in the U.S. Testing pregnant women \nfor HIV is vital for prevention efforts, allowing women who test \npositive to begin antiretroviral drugs to prevent transmission to their \nbaby.\n  Furthermore, the Mikulski amendment, which I have cosponsored, would \nallow coverage for HIV testing for all women, regardless of risk, based \non expert recommendations from the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also provides grants \nto encourage training health care workers to treat individuals with \nHIV/AIDS and other vulnerable populations.\n  Because of the numerous provisions in the bill that will help the \nprevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, several groups have expressed \ntheir support for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Among \nthe groups that I have heard from is the HIV Medicine Association, an \norganization representing 3,600 physicians, scientists, and health care \nprofessionals who work on the frontlines of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in \ncommunities across the country.\n  We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the measures outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act that will further our efforts to combat this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12154-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12154-S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING REAL SALT LAKE SOCCER TEAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise and offer my congratulations to the \nReal Salt Lake soccer team, the newly crowned champions of Major League \nSoccer. While Utah has a number of sports teams with proud traditions--\nboth collegiate and professional--Real Salt Lake has brought to my home \nState its first major professional championship since 1971, when the \nUtah Stars won the ABA title. Fans throughout Utah are thrilled.\n  Real Salt Lake came to Utah in 2004 and faced difficulties during its \nfirst three seasons. In just its fourth season, however, Real Salt Lake \nmade an improbable run to the Western Conference Finals, despite only \nsneaking into the playoffs on the last day of the regular season. They \neventually lost that game by a score of 1-0, but with their first \nplayoff appearance, and opening their new world class soccer-specific \nstadium, their future was filled with promising signs.\n  In 2009 Real Salt Lake delivered on that promise. Once again, it was \nthe last team to qualify for the playoffs and was the lowest overall \nseed. Despite barely squeaking into the playoffs, this team of \noverachievers sure made some noise once they got there. They quickly \nreeled off a string of consecutive upsets against glitzier opponents \nwith established stars, dispatching top-seeded and defending MLS \nchampion Columbus and then powerhouse Chicago and its star Cuauhtemoc \nBlanco.\n  On November 22, the title game in Seattle pitted the little-known \nupstarts of Real Salt Lake against the Western Conference champions, \nthe Los Angeles Galaxy and its mega-stars Landon Donovan and David \nBeckham. After 90 minutes of regulation play and 30 minutes of \novertime, the game remained tied at 1-1. In the penalty kick shootout, \nReal Salt Lake emerged victorious 5-4 as Donovan's potential game-tying \nspot kick sailed harmlessly over the crossbar. Real Salt Lake had \ndelivered the first championship of its kind in Utah in nearly four \ndecades--and it couldn't have come in a more exciting fashion or to a \nmore deserving group of athletes.\n  In the end, it wasn't the Galaxy of stars that prevailed; it was Real \nSalt Lake with its philosophy that mirrors the words emblazoned on the \nsign in its home locker room: ``THE TEAM IS THE STAR.'' That teamwork \nwas certainly on display in the title tilt against Los Angeles. It was \nreflected in Real Salt Lake Robbie Findley's breakout 64th-minute \nstrike that knotted the score at 1-1 and made the team's overtime and \npenalty kick heroics possible. It was reflected in the play of Salt \nLake goalkeeper and Cup final MVP Nick Rimando, who turned away \npenalties from L.A.'s Jovan Kirovski and Edson Buddle before besting \nDonovan. Finally, RSL's determination to overcome the odds also mirrors \nthat of its owner, Dave Checketts, coach Jason Kreis and general \nmanager Garth Lagerwey--all of whom turned the team into a champion \ndespite the naysayers who said it couldn't be done.\n  No, Real Salt Lake's roster did not have the league's biggest stars. \nBut in the words of midfielder Clint Mathis, better known as Cletus, \nRSL was ``the better team in every game.'' As much as anything else, \nthat explains why champion Real Salt Lake is now the brightest light in \nMSL's firmament.\n  Once again, I congratulate Real Salt Lake on this accomplishment. \nSenator Bennett and I have introduced a resolution expressing the \nSenate's congratulations for Real Salt Lake and I urge my colleagues to \noffer their support.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to commend and congratulate Real \nSalt Lake for winning the 2009 Major League Soccer Cup. I am delighted \nto do so, and feel it is a privilege to honor the MLS Cup champions on \nthe Senate floor. The story of Real Salt Lake is more than just a story \nabout a soccer team capturing the MLS title; it is a story about \nbanding together to overcome obstacles and defying the odds after being \ncounted out and dismissed by ``the experts.'' In many ways, the story \nof Real Salt Lake is part and parcel of the American experience.\n  On November 22, 2009, in Seattle, WA, Real Salt Lake, or RSL, faced \noff against the better-known and widely acclaimed L.A. Galaxy. Just to \ngive a sense of what RSL was up against, listed on the roster for the \nGalaxy were U.S. National Team star Landon Donovan, and the \ninternationally acclaimed, indeed iconic, David Beckham. The RSL \nroster, on the other hand, didn't include what's known as a \n``designated player,'' or in other words, a recognized superstar. If \nthat wasn't enough, the Galaxy entered the postseason riding high, \nhaving finished at the top of the Western Conference in the regular \nseason with a 12-6-12 record, and were expected by most to perform well \nif not to win the championship. RSL had a far different experience \nduring their regular season, finishing with an 11-12-7 record. Indeed, \nthey barely managed to make it into the eight team playoff that would \ndetermine the MLS Cup Champion.\n  Considering these facts, it would have been easy for RSL to give up. \nBut that wasn't their attitude. When asked about not having a star \nplayer, instead of bemoaning that fact, the team's captain, Kyle \nBeckerman, said, ``We've really bought into the `star is the team' here \nin Salt Lake. When we work as a team and [are] doing well it's because \neverybody's playing well. It pays off.'' This team unity had initially \npaid off in the postseason for RSL as they defeated the defending \nchampion Columbus Crew, and beat the Chicago Fire in the Eastern \nConference finals. Despite this, many doubted whether they could win \nagainst the Galaxy in the championship game. When asked\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\nabout their chances, head coach Jason Kreis sarcastically replied, \n``Wow, it sounds like we better not even go. We don't even have a \nchance, do we?'' He knew RSL possessed something special.\n  Even in the final match, such outspoken optimism would be tested. By \nhalftime, RSL was trailing 1-0. Two of their key players were unable to \ncontinue playing, sidelined by injury and illness. If ever there was a \ntime to give up, it seemed that this was it. But that wasn't their \nattitude. Coach Kreis made a pair of substitutions, and encouraged his \nplayers to ``be confident,'' and play aggressive. And, well you can see \nwhere this is going. After 90 minutes of play, 30 minutes of overtime, \nand seven rounds of penalty kicks that included two blocked shots by \nRSL goalkeeper Nick Rimando, defender Robbie Russell converted the \nfinal penalty kick to seal the victory, establishing RSL as the \nchampions of Major League Soccer.\n  Now I wish to place this victory into some context. This was \nsignificant for Utah in that it was the first professional sports crown \nto go to the State of Utah since the Utah Stars basketball team won the \nAmerican Basketball Association title back in 1971. RSL's victory was \nnotable not only because Jason Kreis, at the age of 36, became the \nyoungest manager in MLS history to lead his team to the title, but also \nbecause RSL became the first franchise in professional sports history \nto win a championship after finishing the regular season without a \nwinning record. Think about that for a minute--if there is ever a \nreason to dismiss a team, a losing record in the regular season should \nbe it. But that wasn't RSL's attitude. Rather than dwelling in self-\npity and regret, RSL fought on, determined to prove their detractors \nwrong. They believed they could beat the entire league, and they went \nout and did just that. Their story exemplifies the American values of \nhard work, resilience, and overcoming the odds.\n  Once again, I congratulate RSL for their victory; I join with their \nfans in celebration of this championship; and I hope that this is one \nof many more championships to come for Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12155-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            COACHED FOR LIFE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the \nlife lessons we learn from participating in athletic activities and \nfrom the coaches who teach our young athletes. Michael T. Powers, \nauthor of many inspirational books once said, ``High school sports: \nwhere lessons of life are still being learned, and where athletes still \ncompete for the love of the game and their teammates.'' High school \nsports are a way of life across Montana and they create an important \nsense of community in small towns and cities all over Big Sky country. \nIn many areas across the state, small high schools will pool their \nresources to field football teams each fall; many play six or eight man \ngames.\n  This year Ed Flaherty, a native Montanan co-authored the book \n``Coached for Life'' about the experience he and his teammates had on \nthe State champion Great Falls Central High School football team in \n1962. I was inspired by the stories of these young men and how the \nlessons learned on the field from their coaches shaped who they became \nas people and their experiences later in life.\n  The young men that made up Great Falls Central's 1962 Championship \nsquad truly embody the best of Montana ideals and values, like hard \nwork and taking responsibility. They labored tirelessly both on and off \nthe field and achieved not only athletic glory, but also learned the \nvalue of a good education and how to be role models and ambassadors for \ntheir school. Great Falls has always been a working class town and many \nfamilies made significant financial sacrifices to allow their children \nto attend Great Falls Central, a private Catholic school. Coaches Bill \nMehrens and John ``Poncho'' McMahon, reminded the players each day that \nplaying football at Central was a privilege and that they had a \nresponsibility to their teammates, their school, and the community to \ngive it their all on each and every snap on the practice field, in the \ngame, and in the classroom. No doubt the coaches pushed these young men \neach and every day, they did it to instill discipline and to make them \nthe best they could be.\n  The 1962 season was a special one for Great Falls Central. The goal \nof the team was to win the State championship. A year earlier, the \ncoaches drove some of their players north 115 miles to Havre to watch \nthe State championship game, not only to scout two of the best teams in \nthe State but also to witness a championship win. The Central players \ntook it all in and knew they wanted to be the ones holding up the \ntrophy the following season. The Mustangs achieved that goal, making it \nthrough the 1962 season undefeated and beating their rival, the \ndefending State champions, Havre High 34-6 in the Montana Class A State \nchampionship game in front of more than 5,000 elated fans on their home \nfield.\n  Having gone through this experience, the men later in life were able \nto rise up against the many challenges that were thrown their way. At a \nteam reunion in 2002, 40 years after their championship run, the \nplayers and coaches got together to reflect and share their life \nstories. Some have gone on to be teachers and coaches, passing on the \nlife lessons they learned from Mehrens and McMahon. Some, like Ed \nFlaherty, have achieved successful careers in business and in turn gave \nback to their communities. Some served their country heroically in the \nmilitary. All have taken the lessons they learned from the fall of 1962 \nand have helped their communities and become leaders. Ed Flaherty has \ncompiled these stories in his book and brings to life that amazing \nseason and what it truly means to be coached for life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12155-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12155-S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRY R.

Bader for being the first Civilian Response \nCorps-Active Officer in the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, to be trained and ready for world-wide deployment.\n  Mr. Bader's specialized training, which will allow him to work in \nhigh threat environments, was recognized by the Administrator of USAID \nin a November 23, 2009, ceremony in Washington, DC. Currently, Mr. \nBader is the USAID Deputy Environmental Officer for the Democracy, \nConflict and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau.\n  USAID's Civilian Response Corps is a commendable program. The Corps \nplays an integral part in U.S. national security strategy. One of their \nmissions is to bring coordination to military and civilian efforts in \norder to stabilize fragile states and to improve the effectiveness of \ncounter-insurgency operations.\n  As an active officer, Mr. Bader's environmental security specialty \nwill be brought to bear in those areas of the developing world where \nscarcity or degradation of natural resource contribute to conflict. His \ntask will be to find ways to reduce the means and motivations for \nviolence.\n  Mr. Bader's diverse educational and professional backgrounds make him \nwell suited to excel as a Civilian Response Corps-Active Officer. He \nhas a law degree from Harvard and B.A. from Washington State \nUniversity. His career has been one of distinction and variety as a \nprofessor, author, researcher, lecturer, natural resource manager and \nconsultant.\n  He taught at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as an associate \nprofessor of resources policy at the School of Natural Resources \nManagement. During his tenure, he served on the Alaska Sea Grant Legal \nResearch Team, which was created in response to the Exxon Valdez Oil \nSpill to help strengthen oversight of hazardous materials.\n  At the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Mr. Bader was the \nnorthern region land manager in Fairbanks, where he was responsible for \nthe stewardship of 40 million acres of public land in the arctic and \nboreal regions of Alaska. He often collaborated with industry and \nacademia in developing land use policy.\n  Until recently, Mr. Bader was active with the Betula group, a \nconsulting firm he founded which specializes in resource management \nissues in challenging social and physical environments. He travelled to \nTajikistan, Iraq,\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\nand Ukraine lending his expertise in the development of democracy and \ngovernance. Mr. Bader is also perusing a midcareer doctorate at the \nYale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.\n  I applaud Harry on this appointment and am confident he will make \ncontributions to security and environmental improvement wherever he is \nassigned by the Corps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12156-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DONALD DOWD\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate Don Dowd for his \nlongtime public service to New England and to the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. For more than half a century Mr. Dowd has been a fixture \nin the culture, civic life, and politics of our region of the United \nStates. I also congratulate one of the many organizations with which \nMr. Dowd has been associated--Special Olympics Massachusetts, part of \nthe international Special Olympics organized by Eunice Shriver in 1968.\n  Special Olympics Massachusetts has just moved into a new state-of-\nthe-art office and training center in Marlborough. The Yawkey Sports \nTraining Center has training rooms, a gymnasium and outdoor soccer \nfields, all right in the heart of Massachusetts, less than a 90-minute \ndrive from 90 percent of the population of the Commonwealth.\n  Mr. Dowd has been one of the biggest and most active supporters of \nSpecial Olympics, a global force for understanding and change, \ninvolving 2.5 million athletes representing more than 140 countries. \nSpecial Olympics Massachusetts currently serves more than 10,000 \nathletes and involves 11,000 volunteers and 1,600 coaches. With its new \ntraining center, which opened this fall, Special Olympics Massachusetts \nhopes to expand the program to 20,000 athletes by 2010. Mr. Dowd began \nhis public service career as the Assistant Regional Director of the \nU.S. Postal Service for the six New England States during the \nPresidency of John F. Kennedy. He was political adviser to Robert F. \nKennedy's Presidential campaign in 1968. And he was an aide and close \nfriend to Senator Edward M. Kennedy throughout Ted's entire 47-year \ncareer in the Senate. Mr. Dowd coordinated the 1979 opening of the John \nF. Kennedy Presidential Library and has served as a member of the John \nF. Kennedy Library Foundation Board since its inception. Mr. Dowd \ncontinues to do consulting work since his retirement from his regional \nexecutive position with the Coca-Cola Company.\n  He is a lifelong resident of Springfield, MA, and as such once played \na little known role in getting Ted Kennedy to make a cameo appearance \nin a video production. Twentieth Century Fox had invited every town \nnamed Springfield to enter videos to make the case that their town \nshould be the Springfield in ``The Simpsons'' animated movie and \ntelevision program, and it was no secret that the mayor in the Simpsons \ncartoon was a spoof on Ted.\n  Mr. President, I thank Mr. Dowd for his service and dedication to our \nregion and our country.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a Maine small \nbusiness with a long standing reputation for producing elegant and \npractical instruments used by the maritime industry. Founded in 1858, \nShaw and Tenney of Orono, ME, has been producing renown, specialty \nhandcrafted wooden oars and paddles for over a century and a half. \nIndeed, Shaw and Tenney is the oldest continuing producer of solid \nwooden paddles and oars in America, as well as the third oldest \nmanufacturer of marine products in the country.\n  This historic company got its start on the banks of the Stillwater \nRiver near Orono where its founder, Frank Tenney, first launched his \nsignature oars and paddles as part of the Orono Manufacturing Company. \nDuring the 19th century, Maine rivers and coastal waters served as a \ncritical highway network for transporting people and goods throughout \nthe State. Small boats such as skiffs, peapods, and canoes were several \nof the major vessels employed in promoting greater commerce, and Mr. \nTenney's quality oars and paddles served as an indispensible tool in \nhelping to propel major industries to new heights across the State. In \nthe 1890s, Mr. Tenney merged his small manufacturing company with the \nBoston-based George Shaw Company, which produced similar goods. \nTogether they formed what is now formally known as Shaw and Tenney.\n  The newly merged business soon moved to downtown Orono's Main Street \nand remained there until nearly 1950, when it relocated again to the \ncompany's current location at 20 Water Street. The Tenney family \nretained ownership until about 1970 when the company underwent three \nshort-lived transitions to new owners. The current proprietors, Steve \nand Nancy Holt, share the privilege of carrying forward the legacy of \nthis unique novelty company. Since the Holts came aboard, they have \nexpanded the company's product line to include other specialty products \nsuch as masts, spars, boat hooks, and flagpoles. At the same time, the \nHolts take pride in producing the same quality product that's earned \nShaw and Tenney its stellar reputation for dependable marine \ninstruments.\n  More than just ordinary oars and paddles, the Shaw and Tenney product \nline is composed of individual pieces of art specially handcrafted to \nbe both practical and refined. Much of the company's well-earned \nsuccess lies in the quality of the raw material used to construct its \ndistinguished oars and paddles. To make its flat- and spoon-bladed \noars, Shaw and Tenney mostly utilizes clear, solid, eastern red spruce \nsupplied by two mills located within a 50-mile radius of the company's \nfacility. In fact, clear red spruce has the highest strength-to-weight \nratio of any North American softwood, providing the finished products \nwith a noticeable lightweight durability. Each piece of lumber is \ncarefully critiqued before generating the exceptional, distinct oar or \npaddle.\n  Shaw and Tenney's artifacts are showcased across the country and, \nindeed, the world. Its traditional rowing oars can be found at places \nas diverse as California's Disneyland and the Royal Saudi Naval Force's \nwhale boats. Domestic travelers will also notice Shaw and Tenney oars \nin Las Vegas as gondoliers ferry visitors around the city's \nreproduction of Venice's Grand Canal. Furthermore, many U.S. Marines \ngive the company's paddles as a gift when an officer leaves the ranks \nand it is not uncommon for customers to request fancy oars to use as \nbalusters or stair rails in their homes.\n  Shaw and Tenney has truly crafted a legendary product that highlights \nthe ingenuity and craftsmanship of Mainers. Since its start on the \nbanks of a small Maine river, this impressive small business has \nblossomed into a trusted and worldwide leader in its specialized \nindustry. Congratulations to everyone at Shaw and Tenney for over 150 \nyears of their extraordinary handiwork, and I offer my best wishes for \ntheir continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12156-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12156-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12156-5", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12156-S12157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3029.

A bill to establish a small dollar loan-loss guarantee fund, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safe Affordable Loan \nAct. This legislation will increase the access for low and moderate \nincome Americans to mainstream financial institutions while reducing \nthe relevance of pay day lenders. Additionally, the bill will encourage \ncommunity banks and credit unions to provide small dollar loan amounts \nto families across their communities.\n  There are approximately 30 million Americans operating on the fringe \nof the financial system. They are known as the ``unbanked.'' The \naverage income for these individuals is approximately $26,390, with \nlittle to no savings. Additionally, these consumers rely on check \ncashing services or payday lenders as a way to access credit. Most of \nthese operations charge excessive fees and interest rates that leave \nconsumers financially devastated. Without access to mainstream \nfinancial services, consumers can be trapped in a cycle of debt with \nlittle hope of escape.\n  In 2008, the FDIC launched a Small Dollar Loan program which offers \nvolunteer participants CRA credit to provide consumers with affordable \nsmall dollar loans. I am proud that two banks from Wisconsin, Mitchell \nBank in Milwaukee and Benton State Bank in Benton are participating in \nthis valuable program. While this program has been beneficial to \ncommunities across the country, only 31 banks have chosen to \nparticipate. That is a drop in the bucket compared to the 23,000 payday \nlender operations. Without other incentives, banks will shy away from \nlending consumers small amounts, leaving them to rely on payday lenders \nand other loan alternatives.\n  The legislation I am proposing would create a loan-loss reserve fund \nthat financial institutions could access in order to mitigate some of \nthe risk associated with offering small dollar loans. Financial \ninstitutions will be able to access the reserve fund and could \npotentially recover 60 percent of a lost loan, provided that their \nloans meet certain affordability requirements. The institutions must \noffer loans that have no prepayment penalties, have a repayment period \nlonger than 60 days and has an interest rate of 36 percent APR or \nlower. Additionally, the loan size cannot exceed $2,500. In order to \nprotect the government from excessive risk taking by the financial \ninstitutions, the fund administrator will take into consideration the \noverall default rate of the loan program that the institution offers to \ndetermine the reimbursement rate. Furthermore, the financial \ninstitutions would be required to report payment history to the credit \nreporting bureaus which will help consumers build credit or repair bad \ncredit.\n  As we consider changes to our financial system, we should include \nreforms that will help increase access to many of those who are left \nout. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nissue in the Banking Committee to move it towards passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/02/senate-section/article/S12162-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 366--EXTENDING CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF \n SERGEANT MARK RENNINGER, OFFICER TINA GRISWOLD, OFFICER RONALD OWENS, \n                       AND OFFICER GREG RICHARDS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY BUDGET.\n\n       (a) National Health Security Budget.--\n       (1) In general.--By not later than September 1 before the \n     beginning of each year (beginning with 2010), the Board shall \n     establish a national health security budget, which--\n       (A) specifies the total expenditures (including \n     expenditures for administrative costs) to be made by the \n     Federal Government and the States for covered health care \n     services under this title; and\n       (B) allocates those expenditures among the States \n     consistent with section 1504.\n\n     Pursuant to subsection (b), such budget for a year shall not \n     exceed the budget for the preceding year increased by the \n     percentage increase in gross domestic product.\n       (2) Division of budget into components.--The national \n     health security budget shall consist of at least 4 \n     components:\n       (A) A component for quality assessment activities \n     (described in subtitle E).\n       (B) A component for health professional education \n     expenditures.\n       (C) A component for administrative costs.\n       (D) A component (in this subtitle referred to as the \n     ``operating component'') for operating and other expenditures \n     not described in subparagraphs (A) through (C), consisting of \n     amounts not included in the other components. A State may \n     provide for the allocation of this component between capital \n     expenditures and other expenditures.\n       (3) Allocation among components.--Taking into account the \n     State health security budgets established and submitted under \n     section 1503, the Board shall allocate the national health \n     security budget among the components in a manner that--\n       (A) assures a fair allocation for quality assessment \n     activities (consistent with the national health security \n     spending growth limit); and\n       (B) assures that the health professional education \n     expenditure component is sufficient to provide for the amount \n     of health professional education expenditures sufficient to \n     meet the need for covered health care services (consistent \n     with the national health security spending growth limit under \n     subsection (b)(2)).\n       (b) Basis for Total Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--The total expenditures specified in such \n     budget shall be the sum of the capitation amounts computed \n     under section 1502(a) and the amount of Federal \n     administrative expenditures needed to carry out this title.\n       (2) National health security spending growth limit.--For \n     purposes of this part, the national health security spending \n     growth limit described in this paragraph for a year is (A) \n     zero, or, if greater, (B) the average annual percentage \n     increase in the gross domestic product (in current dollars) \n     during the 3-year period beginning with the first quarter of \n     the fourth previous year to the first quarter of the previous \n     year minus the percentage increase (if any) in the number of \n     eligible individuals residing in any State the United States \n     from the first quarter of the second previous year to the \n     first quarter of the previous year.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this title:\n       (1) Capital expenditures.--The term ``capital \n     expenditures'' means expenses for the purchase, lease, \n     construction, or renovation of capital facilities and for \n     equipment and includes return on equity capital.\n       (2) Health professional education expenditures.--The term \n     ``health professional\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\n     education expenditures'' means expenditures in hospitals and \n     other health care facilities to cover costs associated with \n     teaching and related research activities.\n\n     SEC. 1502. COMPUTATION OF INDIVIDUAL AND STATE CAPITATION \n                   AMOUNTS.\n\n       (a) Capitation Amounts.--\n       (1) Individual capitation amounts.--In establishing the \n     national health security budget under section 1501(a) and in \n     computing the national average per capita cost under \n     subsection (b) for each year, the Board shall establish a \n     method for computing the capitation amount for each eligible \n     individual residing in each State. The capitation amount for \n     an eligible individual in a State classified within a risk \n     group (established under subsection (d)(2)) is the product \n     of--\n       (A) a national average per capita cost for all covered \n     health care services (computed under subsection (b));\n       (B) the State adjustment factor (established under \n     subsection (c)) for the State; and\n       (C) the risk adjustment factor (established under \n     subsection (d)) for the risk group.\n       (2) State capitation amount.--\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of this title, the term \n     ``State capitation amount'' means, for a State for a year, \n     the sum of the capitation amounts computed under paragraph \n     (1) for all the residents of the State in the year, as \n     estimated by the Board before the beginning of the year \n     involved.\n       (B) Use of statistical model.--The Board may provide for \n     the computation of State capitation amounts based on \n     statistical models that fairly reflect the elements that \n     comprise the State capitation amount described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (C) Population information.--The Bureau of the Census shall \n     assist the Board in determining the number, place of \n     residence, and risk group classification of eligible \n     individuals.\n       (b) Computation of National Average Per Capita Cost.--\n       (1) For 2010.--For 2010, the national average per capita \n     cost under this paragraph is equal to--\n       (A) the average per capita health care expenditures in the \n     United States in 2008 (as estimated by the Board);\n       (B) increased to 2009 by the Board's estimate of the actual \n     amount of such per capita expenditures during 2009; and\n       (C) updated to 2010 by the national health security \n     spending growth limit specified in section 1501(b)(2) for \n     2010.\n       (2) For succeeding years.--For each succeeding year, the \n     national average per capita cost under this subsection is \n     equal to the national average per capita cost computed under \n     this subsection for the previous year increased by the \n     national health security spending growth limit (specified in \n     section 1501(b)(2)) for the year involved.\n       (c) State Adjustment Factors.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the succeeding paragraphs of \n     this subsection, the Board shall develop for each State a \n     factor to adjust the national average per capita costs to \n     reflect differences between the State and the United States \n     in--\n       (A) average labor and nonlabor costs that are necessary to \n     provide covered health services;\n       (B) any social, environmental, or geographic condition \n     affecting health status or the need for health care services, \n     to the extent such a condition is not taken into account in \n     the establishment of risk groups under subsection (d);\n       (C) the geographic distribution of the State's population, \n     particularly the proportion of the population residing in \n     medically underserved areas, to the extent such a condition \n     is not taken into account in the establishment of risk groups \n     under subsection (d); and\n       (D) any other factor relating to operating costs required \n     to assure equitable distribution of funds among the States.\n       (2) Modification of health professional education \n     component.--With respect to the portion of the national \n     health security budget allocated to expenditures for health \n     professional education, the Board shall modify the State \n     adjustment factors so as to take into account--\n       (A) differences among States in health professional \n     education programs in operation as of the date of the \n     enactment of this title; and\n       (B) differences among States in their relative need for \n     expenditures for health professional education, taking into \n     account the health professional education expenditures \n     proposed in State health security budgets under section \n     1503(a).\n       (3) Budget neutrality.--The State adjustment factors, as \n     modified under paragraph (2), shall be applied under this \n     subsection in a manner that results in neither an increase \n     nor a decrease in the total amount of the Federal \n     contributions to all State health security programs under \n     subsection (b) as a result of the application of such \n     factors.\n       (4) Phase-in.--In applying State adjustment factors under \n     this subsection during the 5-year period beginning with 2010, \n     the Board shall phase-in, over such period, the use of \n     factors described in paragraph (1) in a manner so that the \n     adjustment factor for a State is based on a blend of such \n     factors and a factor that reflects the relative actual \n     average per capita costs of health services of the different \n     States as of the time of enactment of this title.\n       (5) Periodic adjustment.--In establishing the national \n     health security budget before the beginning of each year, the \n     Board shall provide for appropriate adjustments in the State \n     adjustment factors under this subsection.\n       (d) Adjustments for Risk Group Classification.--\n       (1) In general.--The Board shall develop an adjustment \n     factor to the national average per capita costs computed \n     under subsection (b) for individuals classified in each risk \n     group (as designated under paragraph (2)) to reflect the \n     difference between the average national average per capita \n     costs and the national average per capita cost for \n     individuals classified in the risk group.\n       (2) Risk groups.--The Board shall designate a series of \n     risk groups, determined by age, health indicators, and other \n     factors that represent distinct patterns of health care \n     services utilization and costs.\n       (3) Periodic adjustment.--In establishing the national \n     health security budget before the beginning of each year, the \n     Board shall provide for appropriate adjustments in the risk \n     adjustment factors under this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 1503.

Such fee schedules shall be \n     designed to provide incentives for practitioners to choose \n     primary care medicine, including general internal medicine \n     and pediatrics, over medical specialization. Nothing in this \n     section shall be construed as preventing a State from \n     adjusting the payment schedule amounts on a quarterly or \n     other periodic basis depending on whether expenditures under \n     the schedule will exceed the budgeted amount with respect to \n     such expenditures.\n       (c) Billable Covered Service Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``billable covered service'' means a service covered \n     under section 1101 for which a practitioner is entitled to \n     compensation by payment of a fee determined under this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 1512.

In accordance with \n     standards established by the Board, each State health \n     security program, after consultation with representatives of \n     the pharmaceutical profession, shall establish schedules of \n     dispensing fees, designed to afford reasonable compensation \n     to independent pharmacies after taking into account \n     variations in their cost of operation resulting from regional \n     differences, differences in the volume of prescription drugs \n     dispensed, differences in services provided, the need to \n     maintain expenditures within the budgets established under \n     this title, and other relevant factors.\n\n     SEC. 1515.
