Mr. President, I take to the floor right now to talk \nabout my good friend, the former Governor of Iowa and our soon to be \nSecretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack.\n  Before I do, I would be remiss if I did not at this time talk about \nwhat it was like to be at the inauguration of the 44th President of the \nUnited States. This is my ninth inauguration. My first was Jimmy Carter \nwhen I was a freshman Congressman in 1977 and then two Reagans, Bush, \ntwo Clintons, two more Bushes. And so this is my ninth.\n  I can tell you, I have never seen anything such as this. To be out \nthere today, I mean this is once in history that something such as this \nhappens. I was watching a television program yesterday, a news program, \nand Jim Clyburn, our colleague on the House side, was talking about the \nimportance of today and what it meant to him.\n  He went on to talk about not only himself but so many people from \nwhere he is from in South Carolina and other places, elsewhere. He \nsaid, I remember my grandparents telling me about their parents being \nslaves and how close the connection was. And to think that today \nAmerica saw inaugurated as our 44th President an African-American.\n  Not only does this say a great deal about Barack Obama, but it says a \ngreat deal about America and how far we have come. Someone asked me \nwhat I thought earlier about his speech. I thought three things: \nuplifting, sobering, and challenging. I think that is what we want from \na President. We want a President who will lift us up, a President who \nwill be honest and square with us but a President who also challenges \nus.\n  That is what I thought President Obama did in his speech today. So it \nwas a great day, not only for President Obama and Michelle and their \nfamily, for our great friend, Joe Biden, now our Vice President, and \nJill and his family, a great day for America, a real turning point, I \nthink, in our history.\n  So we look forward with confidence and with optimism to the future. I \nwished to take the floor today to say a few words about my friend, Tom\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\nVilsack, who I hope the Senate today will concur in his being passed \nthrough for being Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I have known Tom well since the 1980s. He was a lawyer in Mount \nPleasant, IA, at that time. We had a terrible catastrophe in \nagriculture; farmers were going broke, a lot of suicides were being \ncommitted in my State and around rural America.\n  Tom Vilsack was a small-town lawyer. I did not know him from anybody. \nBut he took upon himself the job of defending a lot of these small \nfarmers, helping them to work through their problems, and getting them \nthrough these hard times.\n  That is the first time I ever came in contact with him. I thought he \nwas one of those rare individuals who saw something that was wrong \nwhich needed to be done and he would involve himself in it. He did not \nmake any money doing this. There was no money to be made. But he got \ninvolved in it, and I can tell you, he helped many small farmers hang \nonto their farms.\n  Well, later on, by then a tragedy happened in Mount Pleasant, IA. Tom \nVilsack was then on the city council. There was a terrible tragedy in \nwhich the mayor had been murdered, and they asked Tom to take over as \nmayor--again, another catastrophe in that small community. So Tom \nVilsack then took over as mayor of Mount Pleasant, pulled the city \ntogether, kept it going, and lifted it up.\n  Shortly after that then, he ran to be a State Senator and was elected \nas a State Senator. He served very admirably there. He then later ran \nto be Governor and served for two terms as the Governor of our State of \nIowa. He had a great two terms--8 years, 4 years each--as our Governor. \nAgain, he showed he could bring people together. That is why I think he \nis going to be good with our former colleague, now President Obama.\n  For the entire 8 years Tom Vilsack was Governor, he had a Republican \nlegislature, but he worked with them. They worked together. We got some \ngood things done in the State of Iowa, both with a Republican \nlegislature and a Democratic Governor. I think that showed his method. \nThat, plus what he had done earlier, I think showed the true mark of \nthis individual.\n  So I could not have been happier when I found that President Obama \nhad picked him to be Secretary of Agriculture. Tom Vilsack knows \nproduction agriculture. He knows what is happening out on the farms. He \nalso is one of the strongest proponents of the conservation of natural \nresources and clean water and clean air. Suffice to say, I think all my \nfriends at Pheasants Forever and Ducks Unlimited and all the people I \ngo hunting with every year love Tom Vilsack because of all he has done \nto encourage wildlife habitats and the conservation of our natural \nresources--something, again, I feel very strongly about.\n  Then, again, in his hearing before our Agriculture Committee, he \ntalked about nutrition and the role nutrition plays in health care \nreform and how we have to think about prevention and wellness. That \nstarts with our kids. And what starts with our kids? School lunches and \nschool breakfasts and the foods they eat in school, the women, infants, \nand children's supplemental feeding program, what kind of food are they \ngetting?\n  Now, before the Agriculture Committee this year, Senator Chambliss \nand I will be working together on our committee to reauthorize the \nChild Nutrition Act. That is the school lunch, school breakfast, and \nthe WIC program, the women, infants, and children's supplemental \nfeeding program. We have to do better for our kids. We have to get \nbetter food, locally grown foods, healthier foods, fruits and \nvegetables, and things such as that for our kids to eat. He talked \nabout this in his hearing before our committee.\n  So I do not wish to take any more time of the Senate. I see our \ndistinguished leader is in the Chamber. But I wished to thank President \nObama for asking Governor Vilsack to be Secretary of Agriculture. I \nhave asked Senator Chambliss. We know of no objections--not one \nobjection on our committee--to his nomination.\n  So I hope the Senate will, this afternoon, by unanimous consent, \nclear him so tomorrow he can be at the door. He said: As soon as I am \nconfirmed, the first thing I want to do is go to the Department of \nAgriculture and stand outside at 7 o'clock in the morning to greet all \nthe people coming in because I want them to know I care about them, \nthat I honor their work and look forward to being Secretary of the \nDepartment. The one Department I always say, of all the Secretaries we \nhave--the Secretaries of State and Treasury get all this publicity, and \nthey travel around the world and all that and get a lot of publicity--\nthe Secretary of Agriculture hardly gets any publicity. But no \nDepartment--no Department--touches every American every day as closely \nand as intimately as the Department of Agriculture: the food you eat, \nthe clothes you wear, the food safety programs. Things happen to our \nkids in school, what they eat--all this is in the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  So I hope the Senate will, by unanimous consent, follow the lead of \nthe Agriculture Committee in unanimously approving Tom Vilsack to be \nour next Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter, dated January \n20, 2009, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of Thomas J. Vilsack to be Secretary of \n         Agriculture\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader.\n       Dear Leaders: On December 17, 2008, President-elect Obama \n     announced his intention to nominate Thomas J. Vilsack, of \n     Iowa, to be Secretary of Agriculture.\n       The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \n     forwarded the Committee's nomination questionnaire to \n     Secretary-designate Vilsack. The Committee requires each \n     nominee to complete a questionnaire relating to the nominee's \n     qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Governor \n     Vilsack's responses to the questionnaire provided basic \n     biographical and financial information.\n       As part of the confirmation process, the Committee received \n     the nominee's Public Financial Disclosure Report and a copy \n     of Governor Vilsack's letter to Mr. Raymond J. Sheehan, \n     Designated Agency Ethics Official, U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture. This letter details the steps that Governor \n     Vilsack will take to avoid potential conflicts or the \n     appearance of a conflict of interest.\n       In anticipation of the nomination, the Committee conducted \n     a hearing on January 14, 2009, in public session, to \n     carefully review the credentials and qualifications of \n     Secretary-designate Vilsack. Governor Vilsack was the only \n     witness at this hearing.\n       After the hearing and after Committee Members had the \n     opportunity to review responses to written questions \n     submitted for the record, the Committee polled all Members of \n     the Committee to ascertain their positions regarding this \n     nominee. We are pleased to report that the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry unanimously supports the \n     nomination of Thomas J. Vilsack for the position of Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n     Tom Harkin,\n       Chairman.\n     Saxby Chambliss,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S662-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is very cold in Washington today, but our \nNation's heart is warm. From every corner of our country and the \nfurthest crevices of the Earth, people came together at the apex of our \ndemocracy to be a part of an American renewal.\n  President Barack Obama's inaugural address appealed to our better \nangels, as Abraham Lincoln called them, and our best intentions. \nPresident Obama reminded us no matter how daunting our challenges may \nseem, America always answers the call of history.\n  The millions who came together, lining our National Mall for miles \nand miles, were not merely observers to this memorable day; they were \nparticipants, ready to work with our new President in service to a \ncommon cause.\n  Our great country is ready to join our new President to answer that \ncall to service. That is why we are in session now, a few short hours \nafter the swearing in. Faced with some of the great challenges of our \nlifetimes and challenges in the history of our country, there is no \ntime to waste.\n  In the coming days, weeks, and months, we will work with President \nObama and our Republican colleagues to revive our economy, protect \nhomeowners and consumers, bring our country closer to energy \nindependence, strengthen our national security, and improve access to \nhealth care and education for all Americans.\n  These challenges require a President with a full arsenal of tools and \nexperts. President Obama has nominated a Cabinet of exceptionally \nbright and capable people, as indicated by support from all over \nAmerica--Democrats and Republicans and Independents talking about these \ngreat Cabinet nominees. These Cabinet nominees represent a cross-\nsection of our country, geographically and politically.\n  So it is up to us, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, to \nconfirm these worthy nominees quickly so they, along with our new \nPresident, can hit the ground running.\n  I express my appreciation to my distinguished counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell, for working with us today to move on to some of these \nnominations. For those who are not going to be approved today, we are \ngoing to work to approve them shortly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled \n``Employment Guidelines for Potential Presidential Appointees in \nSubcabinet Positions'' be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Employment Guidelines for Potential Presidential Appointees in \n                          Subcabinet Positions\n\n       An individual may be employed as an advisory or counselor \n     to the Secretary prior to announcement, nomination and \n     confirmation but after being selected as a potential nominee.\n       The advisor/counselor must:\n       Act in a manner consistent with that of an advisor \n     preparing for additional duties and responsibilities and not \n     presume any authority that could come only as a result of \n     Senate confirmation. For example, do not use the office \n     space, dining facilities, etc. that are available only to a \n     confirmed appointee in that position.\n       Comply with all applicable ethics rules.\n       The advisor/counselor may:\n       Consult within the Department on current policy topics, \n     receive briefings, and become familiar with relevant issues.\n       Offer informed advisory views on policy issues, but on a \n     strictly informal basis.\n       The advisor/counselor must not:\n       Serve as an official Department representative in meetings \n     or on travel.\n       Have access to classified materials until a security \n     clearance is issued.\n       Sign any documents that give the appearance of having \n     assumed official duties or take any actions that give the \n     appearance of issuing authoritative guidance. Must not \n     originate an action, receive routing of official actions of \n     the Department or approve/disapprove any actions of the \n     Department. However, the advisor may receive informational \n     copies of action proposals and other official memoranda.\n       Undertake to hire, transfer, or terminate members of a \n     potential future organization or otherwise reorganize its \n     management. It is permissible, however, to meet and interview \n     applicants and to informally advise confirmed appointees on \n     personnel and organizational issues.\n       Use the term ``designate'' prior to nomination by The \n     President of the United States.\n       Meet with anyone outside the Department unless accompanied \n     by a ``reasonable official'' of the Department who can speak \n     for the Department. The limited role as a consultant to the \n     Department, and not an official of the Department, should be \n     made clear.\n       Attend a meeting with a contractor.\n       Meet with foreign officials or interest groups to any great \n     extent.\n       Represent or speak for a component of the Department, or a \n     prospective component, in a meeting within the Department.\n       Meet or speak with the press, other than in connection with \n     the confirmation process and then only after consultation \n     with Public Affairs.\n       Give speeches or many any appearances outside the \n     Department on any issue relating to the business of the \n     Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S663-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S663-S667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased to voice enthusiastic \nsupport for the nomination of Arne Duncan to serve as Secretary of \nEducation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his \nnomination. Mr. Duncan brings inspiration, dedication, and ability to \nthe field of education, and I am confident that his leadership will \nhelp move America forward to tackle the challenges present in our \neducational system.\n  Last week, Mr. Duncan appeared before our Education Committee for his \nconfirmation hearing. He was met with broad bipartisan support from \nmembers across our committee for his vision and his commitment to move \nAmerican education forward at all levels--from early education through \ncollege.\n  Mr. Duncan shared with us his very personal connection to the field \nof education, which first developed with his work alongside his mother \nin an afterschool tutoring program for needy students. Since then, he \nhas worked to confront challenges and advance reforms as head of \nChicago's schools. We\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\nare all aware of the demands on superintendents of large city school \nsystems, which is why the average tenure of an urban school chief is \nless than 3 years. In Chicago, Arne Duncan has given 7. In each of \nthose years, he focused with relentless determination on closing \nachievement gaps, improving teacher quality, reducing dropout rates, \nand better engaging communities in schools.\n  Throughout his career, Arne Duncan has brought an impressive, can-do \npragmatism to the complex challenges present in our education system. \nHe is a leader who will bring people together, put children first, \nsupport teachers and focus on results. Each of those traits will serve \nall of us well as he takes the helm of the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  Today's nomination should also remind us all of the importance of \neducation to America's future.\n  Education is the key to opportunity and a strong economy, and \nAmerica's schools and teachers are the catalysts for change. The \nability of each of our young people to compete and succeed in this new, \nglobal economy depends on our ability to ensure that they receive a \nhigh-quality education.\n  Education is also key to our national security. Skills and knowledge \nare the pathway to protecting America and maintaining our progress in \nthe world.\n  Most of all, education is key to maintaining America's greatest \nideals and values, and to ensuring the vitality of our democracy.\n  My friend and colleague, the late Claiborne Pell, used to say that \nthe real strength and security of our nation lies in the education and \ncharacter of our people. Our Founding Fathers agreed, and so did many \nschool reformers after them, from John Dewey to Horace Mann. As \nAmericans, we have an obligation to provide everyone--regardless of \ntheir background, economic means, disability, or language skills--with \nthe best possible education that enables them to develop their talents \nand participate fully and actively in their communities and in their \ncountry.\n  In order to achieve this goal, we need a new, major effort to \nconfront and address the persistent challenges that are present in our \neducational system. This effort must span from the early years through \nhigh school, into college and beyond, and it must focus on building \noutstanding schools and institutions that deliver opportunity for every \nAmerican to learn and succeed. Today's inauguration of our President-\nElect marks our chance to write a new and better chapter in American \neducation--one that will harness innovation, cultivate solutions, and \ninvest wisely toward reaching our goals.\n  Our work must begin in the early years, by recognizing that what we \ndo for our children in their first years has a profound impact on their \nlater learning and success. The healthy development of children depends \non the relationships they build with those around them--in any early \nlearning setting.\n  Today, 38 States support prekindergarten programs for children, and \ninvest more than $3.7 billion in such programs. More than a million \nchildren attend State-funded preschool, comprising 22 percent of all 4-\nyear-olds in the Nation. Nearly 1 million more low-income children are \nserved by the Federal Head Start and Early Head Start programs. And 12 \nmillion children under the age of 5 are in some form of child care \nevery week--1.7 million of which receive Federal assistance to attend \nsuch programs.\n  We must focus each of our early learning investments--at the Federal, \nState, and local level--on a shared goal of school readiness and \nquality, regardless of the child care center, preschool classroom, or \nearly learning program in which a child participates. In the early \nyears, quality is the key. We need a new effort to build an early \neducation system that provides opportunities for every child to arrive \nat school ready with the skills necessary to succeed in kindergarten, \nand with a strong foundation from which to build and grow in their \nlater academic experiences.\n  In elementary and secondary education, we must strengthen and \nmodernize our public schools, and move quickly to address the \ninequities in our system that enable persistent achievement and \nopportunity gaps. No Child Left Behind started us down the road of \naccountability and high expectations for all students. But we need a \nnew, national strategy to implement the changes needed to better \nachieve the law's goals.\n  Any effort at improving public education must begin by supporting and \nstrengthening America's teachers, who reside on the front line of \nschool reform. We need new avenues to attract talented individuals into \nthe teaching profession, and better supports to ensure that they remain \nin the classroom. We need new ways to encourage our best teachers to \nserve in the neediest schools, new mechanisms for recognizing and \nrewarding teacher successes, greater chances for teachers to develop \nand share their practice, and better opportunities for teachers to \nbecome leaders and decisionmakers in their own schools.\n  We cannot afford for America's students to be outcompeted and \noutpaced in this 21st century economy. We must support new efforts to \nincrease the rigor and relevance of the school curriculum, more \nefficient and effective methods of testing and using school data, \ngreater supports for disabled students and English learners, and a \nbetter-organized school schedule that maximizes learning time and \nprovides new connections for students to develop knowledge and skills \nin their communities.\n  Unlocking the doors of higher education is more important today than \never before, and the dream of a college education should be available \nto any student with the talent, desire, and commitment to pursue it. \nYet many of America's students still lack the help and assistance they \nneed to prepare for college. A dollar sign still bars the doors of \ncollege opportunity for too many. For others, the path to college is \nblocked by heavy student loan debt and unmet financial need.\n  In the 110th Congress, we responded to these challenges by enacting \nthe College Cost Reduction and Access Act and the Higher Education \nOpportunity Act. We committed to provide an unprecedented lifeline of \nneed-based grant aid to students, to upgrade essential programs that \nprepare students for college, to reforming our student loan programs, \nand to simplifying the application process for college aid.\n  Yet far more remains to be done to address college access and \naffordability, and to bring the promise of a college degree to many \nmore students. We must make greater strides in expanding the Pell grant \nfor America's neediest students. We need new efforts to ensure that our \nFederal student aid programs protect students and taxpayers from risk, \nnew mechanisms to contain and reduce soaring college costs, and new \nefforts to bolster the educational pipeline by strengthening community \ncolleges and investing in college persistence and completion.\n  In each of these areas--early childhood education, elementary and \nsecondary education, and higher education--there are great challenges \nto be met. We must forge ahead with an urgency to confront each of them \nhead on, and improve educational opportunities for all Americans.\n  Today is a great day that reminds us of all that's possible in the \ndays ahead. Our work to help others achieve the American dream begins \nby improving education across our country. We should each dedicate \nourselves to that goal, with a renewed spirit of innovation and a \nresolve for change. And I believe that Arne Duncan is just the person \nto lead us forward as our next Secretary of Education.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I support the pending nomination of Mr. Arne \nDuncan to be Secretary of Education. I had the opportunity to meet with \nMr. Duncan earlier this month, although I have been aware of his work \nin Chicago for a number of years. What struck me the most is his focus \non doing what is best for the children and his belief that every child \ncan succeed regardless of their background.\n  During his confirmation hearing in the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions--HELP--Committee, Mr. Duncan was asked about what he had \naccomplished in Chicago as the CEO of the Chicago Public Schools. His \nsupport for charter schools, public school choice, performance pay for \nteachers and school leaders was highlighted at the hearing. He \ndescribed how he had closed low-performing schools in Chicago because \nthey were not providing children the education they needed. He\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nalso spoke of the important role teachers have and how we need not only \nto attract but retain quality teachers. He believes that children have \none chance to get a good education, and as adults we need to make sure \nthey have that opportunity to learn and achieve.\n  Historically, education has been a bipartisan issue. The HELP \nCommittee has an excellent track record for getting bills passed and \nsigned into law as a result of a strong bipartisan process. Mr. Duncan \ndid not hesitate to commit to establishing and maintaining a \ncooperative working relationship with all Senators on the HELP \nCommittee, Democrat or Republican, by promptly responding to any \nwritten or phone inquiries, sharing information as soon as it becomes \navailable, and directing his staff to do the same. He also agreed that \nregulations promulgated under his direction should be based on \nlegislative authority. Despite the recognition that it is easier to \nstart something than to end it, he also pledged to target resources on \nprograms that work and to eliminate those programs that don't. The \nmembers of the committee were impressed with his answers to our \nquestions, and it was evident from our comments that he enjoys strong \nbipartisan support. I am hopeful that support will show itself by our \nvote today.\n  Mr. Duncan is no stranger to the challenges that he will face as \nSecretary of Education. He understands the important issues that will \naffect every child and every schoolroom throughout the United States. \nHis track record with a major urban school district is well known. \nHowever, I did caution Mr. Duncan that I will remind him regularly and \noften of the unique challenges that rural and frontier schools and \nstudents face. Congress and the Department of Education need to work \ntogether to make sure that every school has the tools and the \nflexibility needed to help students develop the knowledge and skills \nrequired to be successful in the 21st century.\n  We cannot afford to have students leaving high school--and college--\nwithout completing their programs of study. Mr. Duncan and I agree that \nwe have to build upon the successes of No Child Left Behind, coordinate \nefforts across programs including Head Start, career and technical \neducation and workforce programs under the Workforce Investment Act, \nand reduce the barriers nontraditional students face to obtaining \neducation that will provide the knowledge and skills they need to be \nsuccessful in the 21st century. Our country's future depends on our \nability to reach this goal.\n  It is no secret--good skills lead to good jobs. Maintaining those \nskills through a lifetime of learning will lead to a good career. Mr. \nDuncan understands this and the fact that the workplace isn't what it \nused to be. In this global, technology-driven economy, school is never \nout. Today's workplace demands an ever-changing workforce that can \nadapt to the requirements and skills of the new high-tech jobs that are \nin such high demand. Keeping workers' abilities current will be vital \nif they are to continue to find the kind of good jobs they will need to \nsupport their families and maintain a consistently high standard of \nliving. I was pleased to see that Mr. Duncan supports the role \ncommunity colleges can play in providing this education and training \nand understands the need to support and accommodate the growing \npopulation of nontraditional students in our postsecondary education \ninstitutions.\n  I am pleased to be able to join the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Kennedy, in supporting the confirmation of Mr. \nDuncan to be the next Secretary of Education. Today, this body has the \nopportunity to confirm an excellent nominee with the skills, \nexperience, and commitment to help students of all backgrounds \nthroughout their lives achieve their own version of the American dream. \nBy confirming Arne Duncan as the next Secretary of Education I am \nconfident that we will have an effective advocate for education and who \nwill work to meet the lifelong education needs of our children and \nstudents of all ages.\n  I intend to vote in favor of Mr. Duncan's nomination to head the \nDepartment of Education, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Peter R. Orszag\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to support the nomination of Dr. \nPeter R. Orszag to be the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  As our Nation wrestles with the economic crisis, the next Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, OMB, must be prepared to tackle \nserious fiscal and budgetary crises. The Federal budget is under stress \nfrom the impact of a deep recession and the costs of rescue and \nstimulus packages. Spiraling, out-of-control health-care costs are \ndriving long-term budgetary imbalances. And the next few years will \nalso see cresting waves of baby boom retirements, with enormous impacts \non Social Security and Medicare expenditures, as well as the Federal \nworkforce.\n  Pointing to these trends and to the estimated $1.2 trillion deficit \nfor the current fiscal year, President Obama has prudently warned that \nunless strong measures are taken, the outlook is for ``red ink as far \nas the eye can see.'' That is, of course, an unacceptable and \nunsustainable scenario for the Government, for the economy, and for the \nhouseholds and business owners who pay the Government's bills.\n  OMB is the leading player for the incoming administration as it \nformulates policy to deal with a grim present and uncertain future. OMB \nalso serves as a critical link between Congress and the executive \nbranch as we work toward a consensus on a sustainable path forward.\n  Dr. Orszag brings an impressive set of skills and experiences--and \napparently boundless energy--to OMB. As a former Director of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, he is familiar with the \nlegislative branch and the intricacies of budgets and policy analysis. \nEarlier service as an economics adviser in the Clinton administration, \nas a scholar at the Brookings Institution, and as a consultant will \nalso provide important perspectives.\n  Dr. Orszag will need to draw on every ounce of his knowledge and \nexperience as he takes the reins of OMB.\n  Dr. Orszag has already indicated that the economy and stimulus \nmeasures portend a near-term rise in the deficit. But as he knows, \nrecent years' outlays and the growth of unfunded entitlements are \nunsustainable.\n  We desperately need a realistic plan to avoid having the Federal \nbudget become a mammoth drag on opportunities for job growth and higher \npersonal income--and for people's ability to decide what to do with \ntheir own money. The public also expects aggressive oversight and \ncareful stewardship of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and of any \nfuture economic-recovery package.\n  Dr. Orszag will also need to focus intensely on the management \nchallenges confronting the Federal Government. OMB must provide \nsustained leadership to build upon contracting reforms Senator \nLieberman and I championed in the last Congress. Improving transparency \nand accountability in Government operations and enhancing agency \nperformance will also be Dr. Orszag's responsibility.\n  These and other pressing challenges will confront Dr. Orszag as \nDirector of Office of Management and Budget. I look forward to working \nwith him as we confront the financial problems our Nation faces.\n\n\n                     nomination of janet napolitano\n\n   Mr. President, I also support the nomination of Arizona Governor \nJanet Napolitano to be the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  As the Department nears its sixth anniversary, those of us who \nparticipated in its creation can take some measure of satisfaction in \nits progress. The men and women of the Department have helped detect \nand prevent terrorist attacks.\n  Our Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to disasters--whether \nnatural or manmade--has also improved dramatically with the changes \nthis committee made in the structure and operations of FEMA. \nNonetheless, constantly evolving terrorist threats and the forces of \nnature demand further improvements at the Department and strong and \nskilled leadership.\n  I believe Governor Napolitano will provide that leadership.\n  I have had the opportunity to closely examine the record of Governor \nNapolitano and talk with her about a wide range of issues, including \nsecurity at our borders and seaports, cooperation with State and local \nlaw enforcement, and the myriad tests that DHS must confront in the \ncoming years.\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n  The Governor's law enforcement background and knowledge of homeland \nsecurity issues are impressive.\n  Her experience as a border-State Governor enables her to bring an \nimportant perspective to the Department. Arizona, like my home State of \nMaine, is a border State with extensive cross-border and tourism. \nResidents of border communities work, shop, worship, and visit friends \nand family on both sides of the boundary, complicating the challenge of \nborder security.\n  Governor Napolitano understands that we have to let our friends in, \nwhile keeping our enemies out--enforcing border regulations in a \npractical manner that accommodates legitimate trade and travel.\n   One emerging challenge the new Secretary will face is the need to \nenhance security at the Nation's biological laboratories. The recent \nreport of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction predicted a \nterrorist attack with a biological weapon within the next 5 years. The \nCommission pointed to lax security at biological labs as one of the \nbases for that chilling assessment.\n  Another threat that the Department must address is the security of \nour Nation's cyber-infrastructure. The Department must fully understand \nthe cyber threat and establish and enforce best practices across the \nexecutive branch, as well as redouble its efforts to work with the \nprivate sector on cyber-security.\n  We must also continue to focus on the security and resiliency of our \nNation's critical infrastructure. With more than 85 percent of those \nassets in private hands, this is a daunting task. Seaports and chemical \nfacilities have been made more secure through legislation that I \ncoauthored. In addition to extending these two important programs, the \nDepartment must develop a strategy to promote the best practices \ndeveloped through the National Infrastructure Protection Plan.\n\n  In the last 6 years, DHS has helped improve our all-hazards \npreparedness and response capabilities. Homeland security grant funding \nfor our State and local first responders has certainly played a key \nrole in that effort. Funding levels in the last few years, however, \nhave been under attack from the executive branch, and DHS has not yet \nfully complied with the requirement to establish an all-hazards risk \nformula. The Department must also improve information sharing and \ncooperation with our State and local partners.\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency forms the core of the \nDepartment's ability to perform its preparedness, response, and \nrecovery missions. After Hurricane Katrina, Senator Lieberman and I \nauthored vital reforms of FEMA. Subsequent disasters like wildfires, \ntornadoes, and severe storms and floods have demonstrated FEMA's new \nand improved capabilities, bolstered by increased coordination with \nState and local governments and military resources.\n  FEMA's documented improvements and the logical combination of all-\nhazards prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery in a single \ndepartment underscore the need to keep FEMA within DHS. Detaching FEMA \nin the vain hope of recapturing mythical halcyon days would weaken its \neffectiveness, reduce the ability of DHS to carry out its all-hazards \nplanning mandate, cause needless duplication of effort, and foment \nconfusion among State and local first responders during a disaster. \nThat is why our Nation's leading first responder organizations, like \nthe International Association of Fire Fighters, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the Congressional Fires Services Institute, \nthe International Association of the Chiefs of Police, and the National \nTroopers Coalition, all strongly support keeping FEMA as part of DHS.\n  As a relatively new Department, DHS still suffers from significant \nintegration and management challenges. The effective operation of the \nDepartment's 22 legacy agencies requires a strong Departmental culture, \nclose collaboration between the Department's components, and effective \ncooperation with other Federal, State, local, tribal and private-sector \npartners. From the Department's program management and resource \nallocations, to the basic need for a consolidated headquarters, the \nnext Secretary must focus intently on removing obstacles to effective \nintegration and improved performance.\n  To continue its growth, the Department must have a skilled executive \nto lead its dedicated workforce. I believe Governor Janet Napolitano \nhas the ability to meet these and other challenges facing the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the years to come. I look forward to \nworking with her and urge support for her nomination.\n\n\n                      nomination of eric shinseki\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of GEN \nEric Shinseki for Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  I have three criteria that I use to evaluate all executive branch \nnominees: competence, integrity, and commitment to the core mission of \nthe Department. Based on these criteria, I wholeheartedly support \nGeneral Shinseki to be our next Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  In his 38-year Army career, which culminated at Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Shinseki was always first and foremost an advocate for \nthe soldiers--he was a soldier's general. As a veteran of combat in \nVietnam, during which he suffered life threatening and life altering \ninjuries, General Shinseki understands firsthand the obstacles our \nreturning troops face. He knows what it is like to be made whole again \nin the military health care system. know General Shinseki will focus on \ntransforming the Department of Veterans Affairs into an agency for the \n21st century with the same fortitude and tenacity he has shown \nthroughout his military career.\n  This is a critical time for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nHistorically high percentages of wounded soldiers are surviving their \nwounds. For this we should be thankful. However, many of them are \ngrievously disabled with debilitating, visible wounds of war, or with \nequally debilitating wounds that do not bleed--like post-traumatic \nstress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Our veterans' health \nsystems must be updated and adapted to care for this new generation. \nOur country has made a 50-year commitment to our wounded warriors to \ncare for them. We must streamline the red-tape that prevents wounded \nwarriors from receiving the care they need. We must shorten the months \nof waiting for the benefits claims process to unfold. We must better \nintegrate the DOD and VA health care systems to create a single system \nwith uniform rating processes and standards. We owe our veterans \nnothing less. General Shinseki is the right choice to lead the VA to a \nhigher state of readiness to care for this new generation of veterans.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs challenges don't end with our \nimmediate obligations to our wounded veterans, but must persist in \naddressing our long-term promises to our veterans. This means \nmaintaining affordable health care for our retired servicemembers. \nMaking it responsive. Providing the best care. Ensuring our promises \nmade are promises kept.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs challenges also include aiding \nmembers with the transition into civilian life. I am proud of the \nrecent steps we have taken in Congress to help veterans. Last year we \npassed the post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act to make badly \nneeded updates to the G.I. bill. This legislation will provide \neducational benefits to help a new generation of veterans and \nservicemembers so they can better themselves through education, better \ntheir ability to serve our Nation as soldiers and citizens, and better \nprovide for themselves an their families. I am also proud of the \nwounded warrior legislative provisions Congress passed in 2007. These \nprovisions mandated a modernization the military health care system's \napproach to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury \ncare. I will look to General Shinseki not just to ensure the \nimplementation of these groundbreaking legislative accomplishments is a \npriority, but also to identify meaningful and comprehensive steps to \nbuild on this foundation to ensure that our veterans health care system \ndelivers the world class care our veterans have earned.\n  I look forward to working with GEN Eric Shinseki as the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs and have full confidence in his honesty, his \nintegrity, and his ability to stand up for our veterans. The next \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs will face many challenges. I look forward \nto meeting those challenges with him as he leads the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment in this time of change.\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\n  Mr. REED.

The world is watching today as our great \n     democracy engages in this peaceful transition of power. Here \n     on the National Mall, where we remember the founders of our \n     Nation and those who fought to make it free, we gather to \n     etch another line in the solid stone of history. The freedom \n     of a people to choose its leaders is the root of liberty. In \n     a world where political strife is too often settled with \n     violence, we come here every 4 years to bestow the power of \n     the Presidency upon our democratically elected leader.\n       Those who doubt the supremacy of the ballot over the bullet \n     can never diminish the power engendered by nonviolent \n     struggles for justice and equality like the one that made \n     this day possible. No triumph tainted by brutality could ever \n     match the sweet victory of this hour and of what it means to \n     those who marched and died to make it a reality. Our work is \n     not yet finished, but future generations will mark this \n     morning as the turning point for real and necessary change in \n     our Nation. They will look back and remember that this was \n     the moment when the dream that once echoed across history \n     from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial finally reached the \n     walls of the White House.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In that spirit, we today not only \n     inaugurate a new administration, we pledge ourselves to the \n     hope, the vision, the unity, and the renewed call to \n     greatness inspired by the 44th President of the United \n     States, Barack Obama.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, and God bless America.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. At this time I call upon Dr. Rick Warren, \n     pastor of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, CA, to \n     provide the invocation.\n       Pastor WARREN. Let us pray.\n       Almighty God, our Father, everything we see and everything \n     we can't see exists because of You alone. It all comes from \n     You. It all belongs to You. It all exists for Your glory. \n     History is Your story. The scripture tells us: Hear, O \n     Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one. And You are the \n     compassionate and merciful one, and You are loving to every \n     one You have made. Now, today, we rejoice, not only in \n     America's peaceful transfer of power for the 44th time, we \n     celebrate a hinge point of history, with the inauguration of \n     our first African-American President of the United States. We \n     are so grateful to live in this land, a land of unequaled \n     possibility, where the son of an African American can rise to \n     the highest level of our leadership. And we know today that \n     Dr. King and a great cloud of witnesses are shouting in \n     heaven.\n       Give to our new President Barack Obama the wisdom to lead \n     us with humility, the courage to lead us with integrity, the \n     compassion to lead us with generosity. Bless and protect him, \n     his family, Vice President Biden, the Cabinet, and every one \n     of our freely elected leaders. Help us, O God, to remember \n     that we are Americans, united not by race or religion or \n     blood but to our commitment to freedom and justice for all.\n       When we focus on ourselves, when we fight each other, when \n     we forget You, forgive us. When we presume that our greatness \n     and our prosperity is ours alone, forgive us. When we fail to \n     treat our fellow human beings and all the Earth with the \n     respect that they deserve, forgive us.\n       As we face these difficult days ahead, may we have a new \n     birth of clarity in aims, responsibility in our actions, \n     humility in our approaches, and civility in our attitudes, \n     even when we differ. Help us to share, to serve, and to seek \n     the common good of all. May all people of goodwill today join \n     together to work for a more just, a more healthy, and a more \n     prosperous nation and a peaceful planet. And may we never \n     forget that one day all nations and all people will stand \n     accountable before You.\n       We now commit our new President and his wife Michelle and \n     his daughters, Malia and Sasha, into Your loving care. I \n     humbly ask this in the name of the one who changed my life, \n     Yeshua, Esau, Jesus, Jesus, who taught us to pray: Our \n     Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom \n     come. Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us \n     this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we \n     forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into \n     temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom \n     and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am so pleased to introduce world renowned \n     musical artist Aretha Franklin to sing ``My Country Tis of \n     Thee.''\n       (Performance by Ms. Aretha Franklin.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Please join me in welcoming my colleague \n     from Utah, the Honorable Robert Bennett.\n       Mr. BENNETT. It is my great honor to introduce Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\n     Court of the United States John Paul Stevens, who will \n     administer the oath of office to the Vice President-elect. \n     Will you all please stand.\n       Associate Justice JOHN PAUL STEVENS administered to the \n     Vice President-elect the oath of office prescribed by the \n     Constitution, which he repeated, as follows:\n       ``I, JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN, JR. do solemnly swear that I \n     will support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear \n     true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this \n     obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose \n     of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the \n     duties of my office on which I am about to enter. So help me \n     God.''\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is my pleasure to introduce a unique \n     musical performance: Mr. Itzhak Perlman, violinist; Anthony \n     McGill, clarinet; Yo-Yo Ma, cellist; and Gabriela Montero, \n     pianist, performing ``Air and Simple Gifts,'' a composition \n     arranged for this occasion by John Williams.\n       (Performance by Mr. Yo-Yo Ma, Mr. Anthony McGill, Ms. \n     Gabriela Montero, and Mr. Itzhak Perlman.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is my distinct honor to present the \n     Chief Justice of the United States, the Honorable John G. \n     Roberts, Jr., who will administer the Presidential oath of \n     office. Everyone, please stand.\n       The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, JOHN G. ROBERTS, \n     JR., administered to the President-elect the oath of office \n     prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, as \n     follows:\n       ``I, BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA, do solemnly swear that I will \n     faithfully execute the office of President of the United \n     States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So \n     Help me God.''\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE. Congratulations, Mr. President.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great \n     personal honor to present the 44th President of these United \n     States, Barack Obama.\n       (Applause.)\n       The PRESIDENT. Thank you. Thank you.\n       My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task \n     before us, grateful for the trust you bestowed, mindful of \n     the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush \n     for his service to our Nation, as well as the generosity and \n     cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.\n       Forty-four Americans have now taken the Presidential oath. \n     The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity \n     and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath \n     is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these \n     moments, America has carried on not simply because of the \n     skill or vision of those in high office but because we, the \n     people, have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears \n     and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it \n     must be with this generation of Americans.\n       That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. \n     Our Nation is at war against a far-reaching network of \n     violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a \n     consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some \n     but also our collective failure to make hard choices and \n     prepare the Nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs \n     shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; \n     our schools fail too many; and each day brings further \n     evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our \n     adversaries and threaten our planet. These are the indicators \n     of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable \n     but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our \n     land, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, \n     that the next generation must lower its sights.\n       Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. \n     They are serious, and they are many. They will not be met \n     easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America--\n     they will be met.\n       (Applause.)\n       On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over \n     fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this \n     day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and \n     false promises, the recriminations and wornout dogmas that \n     for far too long have strained our politics. We remain a \n     young Nation, but in the words of scripture: The time has \n     come to set aside childish things. The time has come to \n     reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better history, \n     to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea passed \n     on from generation to generation, the God-given promise that \n     all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to \n     pursue their full measure of happiness.\n       (Applause.)\n       In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation, we understand \n     that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our \n     journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. \n     It has not been the path for the fainthearted, for those who \n     prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches \n     and fame. Rather, it has been the risk takers, the doers, the \n     makers of things, some celebrated but more often men and \n     women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long \n     rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they \n     packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across \n     oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in \n     sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the \n     whip, and plowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died \n     in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sahn.\n       Time and again, these men and women struggled and \n     sacrificed and worked until their hands were raw so that we \n     might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the \n     sum of our individual ambitions, greater than all the \n     differences of birth or wealth or faction.\n       This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most \n     prosperous, powerful Nation on Earth. Our workers are no less \n     productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less \n     inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they \n     were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity \n     remains undiminished, and our time of standing pat and \n     protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant \n     decisions--that time has surely passed. Starting today, we \n     must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again \n     the work of remaking America.\n       (Applause.)\n       For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state \n     of our economy calls for action, bold and swift. And we will \n     act, not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation \n     for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric \n     grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us \n     together. We will restore science to its rightful place \n     and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's \n     quality and lower its cost. We will harness the Sun and \n     the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our \n     factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges \n     and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All \n     this we can do. All this we will do.\n       Now, there are some who question the scale of our \n     ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too \n     many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have \n     forgotten what this country has already done, what free men \n     and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common \n     purpose and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to \n     understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that \n     the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so \n     long no longer apply.\n       The question we ask today is not whether our Government is \n     too big or too small but whether it works--whether it helps \n     families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a \n     retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is, yes, we \n     intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will \n     end. Those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held \n     to account--to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our \n     business in the light of day--because only then can we \n     restore the vital trust between a people and their \n     Government.\n       Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force \n     for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand \n     freedom is unmatched. But this crisis has reminded us that \n     without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control \n     and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the \n     prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended \n     not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the \n     reach of our prosperity, on the ability to extend opportunity \n     to every willing heart--not out of charity but because it is \n     the surest route to our common good.\n       (Applause.)\n       As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice \n     between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, \n     faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a \n     charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a \n     charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals \n     still light the world, and we will not give them up for \n     expedience sake. And so to all the other peoples and \n     governments who are watching today, from the grandest \n     capitals to the small village where my father was born, know \n     that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, \n     and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we \n     are ready to lead once more.\n       (Applause.)\n       Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and \n     communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy \n     alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our \n     power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do \n     as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through \n     its prudent use. Our security emanates from the justness of \n     our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities \n     of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. \n     Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new \n     threats that demand even greater effort, even greater \n     cooperation and understanding between nations.\n       We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and \n     forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends \n     and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the \n     nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet. \n     We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waiver \n     in its defense. And for those who seek to advance their aims \n     by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you \n     now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You \n     cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.\n       (Applause.)\n       For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not \n     a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews \n     and Hindus, and nonbelievers. We are shaped by every language \n     and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth. And because \n     we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation \n     and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, \n     we cannot help\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\n     but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the \n     lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows \n     smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that \n     American must play its role in ushering in a new era of \n     peace.\n       To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on \n     mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around \n     the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's \n     ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on \n     what you can build, not what you destroy.\n       (Applause.)\n       To those who claim power through corruption and deceit and \n     the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side \n     of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing \n     to unclench your fist.\n       (Applause.)\n       To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside \n     you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to \n     nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those \n     nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can \n     no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our \n     borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without \n     regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must \n     change with it.\n       As we consider the role that unfolds before us, we will \n     remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who at \n     this very hour patrol far off deserts and distant mountains. \n     They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who \n     lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not \n     only because they are the guardians of our liberty but \n     because they embody the spirit of service, a willingness to \n     find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet at \n     this moment--a moment that will define a generation--it is \n     precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much \n     as Government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith \n     and determination of the American people upon which this \n     Nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when \n     the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would \n     rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which \n     sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's \n     courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a \n     parent's willingness to nurture a child that finally decides \n     our fate.\n       Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we \n     meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success \n     defends--honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, \n     tolerance and curiosities, loyalty and patriotism--these \n     things are old. These things are true. They have been the \n     quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is \n     demanded, then, is a return to these truths; what is required \n     of us now is a new era of responsibility--a recognition, on \n     the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, \n     our Nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly \n     accept but, rather, seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that \n     there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of \n     our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.\n       This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is \n     the source of our confidences--the knowledge that God calls \n     on us to shape an uncertain destiny.\n       This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed--why men \n     and women and children of every race and every faith can join \n     in celebration across this magnificent Mall, and why a man \n     whose father, less than 60 years ago, might not have been \n     served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take \n     a most sacred oath.\n       (Applause.)\n       So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and \n     how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in \n     the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by \n     dying camp fires on the shores of an icy river; the capital \n     was abandoned, the enemy was advancing, the snow was stained \n     with blood; at a moment when the outcome of our Revolution \n     was most in doubt, the Father of our Nation ordered these \n     words be read to the people:\n\n       Let it be told to the future world . . . that in the depth \n     of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive . . \n     . that the city and the country, alarmed at one common \n     danger, came forth to meet [it].\n       America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter \n     of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With \n     hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and \n     endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's \n     children that when we were tested, we refused to let this \n     journey end, that we did not turn back, nor did we falter; \n     and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, \n     we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it \n     safely to future generations.\n       Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States \n     of America.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have the distinct pleasure of introducing \n     an American poet, Elizabeth Alexander.\n       Ms. ALEXANDER. ``Praise Song for the Day.''\n\n     Each day we go about our business, walking past each other, \n           catching each other's eyes or not, about to speak or \n           speaking.\n\n     All about us is noise. All about us is noise and bramble, \n           thorn and din, each one of our ancestors on our \n           tongues.\n\n     Someone is stitching up a hem, darning a hole in a uniform, \n           patching a tire, repairing the things in need or \n           repair.\n\n     Someone is trying to make music somewhere, with a pair of \n           wooden spoons on an oil drum, with cello, boom box, \n           harmonica, voice.\n\n     A woman and her son wait for the bus. A father considers the \n           changing sky. A teacher says, ``Take out your pencils. \n           Begin.''\n\n     We encounter each other in words, words spiny or smooth, \n           whispered or declaimed, words to consider, reconsider.\n\n     We cross dirt roads and highways that mark the will of some \n           one and then others, who said I need to see what's on \n           the other side.\n\n     I know there's something better down the road. We need to \n           find a place where we are safe. We walk into that which \n           we cannot yet see.\n\n     Say it plain: that many have died for this day. Sing the \n           names of the dead who brought us here, who laid the \n           train tracks, raised the bridges, picked the cotton and \n           the lettuce, built brick by brick the glittering \n           edifices they would then keep clean and work inside of.\n\n     Praise song for struggle, praise song for the day. Praise \n           song for every hand-lettered sign, the figuring-it-out \n           at kitchen tables.\n\n     Some live by love thy neighbor as thy self, others by first \n           do no harm or take no more than you need. What if the \n           mightiest word is love?\n\n     Love beyond marital, filial, national, love that casts a \n           widening pool of light, love with no need to pre-empt \n           grievance.\n\n     In today's sharp sparkle, the winter air, any thing can be \n           made, any sentence begun. On the brink, on the brim, on \n           the cusp,\n\n     praise song for walking forward in that light.\n\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And now it is my privilege to introduce the \n     Reverend Dr. Joseph E. Lowery to deliver the benediction.\n       Reverend LOWERY. God of our weary years, God of our silent \n     tears, Thou who hast brought us thus far along the way, Thou \n     who has by the might, led us into the light, keep us forever \n     in the path we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our \n     God, where we met Thee; lest our hearts drunk with the wine \n     of the world we forget Thee, shadowed beneath Thy hand, may \n     we forever stand true to our God and true to our native land.\n       We truly give thanks for the glorious experience we have \n     shared this day. We pray now, O Lord, for your blessing upon \n     thy servant, Barack Obama, the 44th President of these United \n     States, his family and his administration. He has come to \n     this high office at a low moment in the national and, indeed, \n     global fiscal climate. But because we know you have got the \n     whole world in Your hands, we pray for not only our Nation \n     but for the community of nations. Our faith does not shrink, \n     though pressed by the flood of mortal ills, for we know that, \n     Lord, You are able and You are willing to work through \n     faithful leadership to restore stability, mend our \n     brokenness, heal our wounds, and deliver us from the \n     exploitation of the poor, the least of these, as well as \n     favoritism toward the rich, the elite of these.\n       We thank You for the empowering of Thy servant, our 44th \n     President, to inspire our Nation to believe that, yes, we can \n     work together to achieve a more perfect Union. While we have \n     sown the wind of greed and corruption and even as we reap the \n     whirlwind of social and economic disruption, we seek \n     forgiveness and we come in the spirit of unity and solidarity \n     to commit our support to our President by willingness to make \n     sacrifices necessary to respect Your creation, to turn to \n     each other and not on each other.\n       And now Lord, in the complex arena of human relationships, \n     help us to make choices on the side of love not hate, on the \n     side of inclusion not exclusion, tolerance not intolerance. \n     And as we leave this mountaintop, help us to hold on to the \n     spirit of fellowship, of koinonia, and the oneness of our \n     family. And take that spiritual power back to our homes, our \n     workplaces, our churches, our temples, our mosques, wherever \n     we seek Your will.\n       Bless President Barack, First Lady Michelle, look over our \n     little ``angelics,'' Sasha and Malia. We go now to walk \n     together, children, pledging that we won't get weary in the \n     difficult days ahead. We know You will not leave us alone \n     with Your hands of power and Your heart of love. Help us, \n     then, now Lord, to work for that day when nation shall not \n     lift up sword against nation, when tanks will be beaten into \n     tractors, when every man and every woman shall sit under his \n     or her own vine and fig tree, and none shall be afraid; when \n     justice will roll down like water and righteousness as a \n     mighty stream.\n       Lord, in the memory of all the saints who from their labors \n     rest, and in the joy of a new beginning, we ask You to help \n     us work for that day when Black will not be asked to get \n     back, when Brown can stick around, when Yellow will be \n     mellow, when the Red man can get ahead man, and when White \n     will embrace what is right. Let all those who do justice and \n     love mercy say amen. Say amen. And amen. Amen.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the \n     singing of our national anthem by the U.S. Navy Sea Chanters \n     Chorus. Following the anthem, please remain in place while \n     the presidential party exits the platform. Thank you very \n     much.\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n       (Performance by the U.S. Navy Sea Chanters.)\n       (The Inagural ceremony was concluded at 12:36 p.m.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S670-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S670-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S670-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 249\n\n  At the request of Ms. Stabenow, the name of the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Menendez) was added as a cosponsor of S. 249, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to qualify formerly homeless \nyouth who are students for purposes of low income tax credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S670-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in August 1963, I was a law student and \na summer intern in the U.S. Department of Justice here in Washington. I \nwas standing at the back of a huge crowd on a hot day when Dr. King \nspoke of his dream that one day his children would be judged not ``by \nthe color of their skin, but by the content of their character.''\n  The inauguration of our former colleague, Barack Obama, the day after \nDr. King's birthday, symbolizes both remarkable progress on America's \nmost intractable problem--race--and a reaffirmation of our country's \nmost unique characteristic--a fervent belief that anything is possible.\n  I thought about this in the same way 4 years ago at almost this time. \nI formed a speech in my head that I wanted to make, but I did not make \nit. Senators are rarely guilty of unexpressed thoughts. I have said \nmany things I wish I had not said, but this is one time I wish I had \nsaid, 4 years ago, what I was thinking. So I wish to say it today, \nright after President Obama's inauguration. And I am especially \ndelighted Senator Martinez happens to be here too.\n  What I was thinking 4 years ago as the new Senators were sworn in was \nthat here were three Members of the new class who had especially unique \ncharacteristics, and they had special people in the gallery that day.\n  I, with Senator Carper and some others, had been asked by the leaders \nto work on the orientation for the new Senators. So we had gotten to \nknow the new Senators, including Salazar and Obama and Martinez, during \nthat period of time.\n  So here is what I was thinking that day--and let's take them one by \none. Here was Senator Salazar from Colorado with a Spanish surname, but \nhe will be quick to tell you that his family has been here for 14 \ngenerations and helped to found Santa Fe. He has had a distinguished \ncareer here now. On that day 4 years ago, his mother was in the \ngallery.\n  Senator Martinez was sworn in 4 years ago as a new Member of the \nSenate, in this case from Florida. His story, which he has just \npublished in a remarkably good book which I have given to many of my \nfriends, is the story of a young boy growing up very happily in Cuba \nwhose parents took him to the airport one day, after having bought him \na new suit, when he was 14 years of age, and put him on an airplane to \nMiami, not knowing if they would ever see him again. He was in a foster \nhome there, then moved to Orlando. The story is all in the book. He \nwent to Florida State, met his wife Kitty, became the mayor of Orlando, \nthen became a member of President Bush's Cabinet, then a Member of the \nU.S. Senate. A very remarkable story. His mother, who put him on the \nairplane in Cuba, was here that day.\n  These same 4 years ago when we swore in these new Members of the \nSenate, we also had the Senator from Illinois. We all now know his \nstory very well: a father from Kenya, a mother from Kansas. I don't \nneed to repeat that extraordinary story, about which he has written so \nwell in his autobiography. But what struck me was that his grandmother \nwas in the gallery that day. It was either his grandmother or his \ngrandfather, but I believe it was his grandmother. His father's parent \nwas in the gallery that day on the first trip, I believe, from Africa \nto this country to see the son of an immigrant sworn into the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So I thought 4 years ago, and I think again today on this day on \nwhich we swear in Barack Obama as President, what a remarkable country \nthis is. Here in this Senate 4 years ago, the 14th-generation American \nKen Salazar is now going into President Obama's Cabinet as Secretary of \nthe Interior. Mel Martinez, having had a long career in public life as \nmayor in Orlando, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as \nU.S. Senator, is going on to other things in his life. Former Senator \nObama, of course, is now the President of the United States. But what \nwas remarkable to me was 4 years ago they came to this Senate, and in \nthat gallery were their parents--and in one case a grandparent--\nreaffirming what I think Barack Obama's inauguration represents for us \ntoday. It was historic in the sense that it helped us symbolize the \novercoming of one of our most intractable problems, the problem of \nrace. But just as\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nimportant, it symbolized once again the characteristic that makes this \ncountry more remarkable than any other country, the idea that anything \nis possible.\n  People in other parts of the world look at the United States, and \nthey don't always approve of us, but they know one thing is different \nabout us: that we are not a country based on blood or race or the color \nof our skin or where our grandparents came from; that we are based upon \nour common belief in a few ideas, most of which are incorporated in two \nfounding documents, the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution. But one of those ideas is just in our character, and that \nis this irrational, fervent belief that in this country, anything is \npossible. Senator Martinez, Senator Salazar, and former Senator Barack \nObama all represent that beautifully, and that makes this a very \nspecial day.\n  I thank the President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/20/senate-section/article/S671-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2009\n\n  Mr. REED.
