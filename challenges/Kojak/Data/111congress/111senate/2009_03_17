With the six amendments, we should be able to finish the \nlegislation without a lot of heavy lifting tomorrow--maybe early \ntomorrow--which would allow us to do some nominations and get some of \nthose done before we leave here. So I hope that will work out. We are \nnot there yet, but I think we are very close.\n  I had a meeting this morning with Senator Bingaman. He understands \nthe subject matter of the amendments--he being the chair of the Energy \nCommittee, which has the jurisdiction of everything in this bill--so \nthat should take care of that matter.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the weekend we learned the \nextent of the bonuses being paid to some of the same people at AIG who \ngot this company in the position it is in. Many of us on both sides of \nthe aisle expressed absolute outrage that these bonuses could be paid. \nYesterday, the White House joined that chorus and promised to do \neverything possible to get the taxpayers' money back. Well, we \ncertainly appreciate those efforts. However, it could have been handled \na little differently. It would have been better if this pledge had \nincluded action 2 weeks ago. Just 2 weeks ago, the\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nTreasury agreed to give AIG another $30 billion in taxpayer money--just \nwithin the last 2 weeks. For example, wouldn't the Treasury and the \ntaxpayer have had more leverage over AIG's executive contracts before \nproviding another $30 billion in tax money for them? Once that money \nwas handed over to AIG, the leverage was lost. That would have been the \nperfect time to make sure this didn't happen.\n  It is my hope the Treasury will be vigilant in safeguarding taxpayer \nfunds from here on. I certainly expect them to look for every possible \nlegal way to live up to the pledge made yesterday on behalf of the \ntaxpayers of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3124-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3124-S3126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, a lot has been written over the past \nseveral days about the inmates at Guantanamo, and none of it makes the \nadministration's decision to shut this facility down by the end of the \nyear any less challenging than it already was. This is an issue which \nhas grave implications for our Nation's security, and we really need to \nget it right. So this morning, I wish to spend a few minutes explaining \nwhy the administration would do well to reconsider its approach to \nGuantanamo, an approach that looks even hastier now than when it was \nfirst announced back in January.\n  One of the most obvious problems the administration faces on this \nissue is what to do with these inmates once Guantanamo is closed. This \nis not a new concern. Ever since the United States started using \nGuantanamo as a detention facility after the invasion of Afghanistan, \nGovernment officials and legal thinkers have tried to come up with ways \nof dealing with enemy combatants who don't fall into the traditional \ncategories of war. No one denies that the United States is legally \nentitled to capture and to hold enemy fighters to prevent them from \nreturning to battle, but their release and repatriation have proved to \nbe extremely complicated. As the years have passed, these questions \nhave become even more complicated--not less--than they were back in \n2001.\n  Just this week, a number of European countries that had previously \noffered to help the administration find a new home for about 60 of the \nremaining 241 inmates at Guantanamo began to backpedal. Some of these \ncountries now indicate they won't take any of these inmates unless the \nUnited States agrees to take some of them as well and agrees to put \nthem in American prisons. This is clearly a dodge since the American \npeople appear to be even less interested in housing these inmates than \nthe Europeans are. Well, if there is no place for these terrorists to \ngo in Europe and no place for them to go in the United States, an \nobvious question arises: Where else can they go? At the moment, there \nis no answer to that most important question.\n\n  When the question of sending detainees to U.S. soil was put to the \nSenate in the summer of 2007, the vote against it was 94 to 3. We had \nthat vote right here in the Senate in the summer of 2007, and by a vote \nof 94 to 3 Members of the Senate said they did not want these \nGuantanamo prisoners on U.S. soil. This is not only a good reflection \nof where public opinion is on the issue, it is also notable that four \nof the votes cast were Senators from Kansas and Colorado, States that \nare most often mentioned as possibilities to house the inmates. One of \nthese Senators, Ken Salazar, is now in the Obama administration, and \nformer Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, who also opposes sending \ninmates to Kansas, is the administration's pick to head the Department \nof Health and Human Services. So the bottom line here is that it is \nhard to find anyone anywhere, even inside the Obama administration, who \nwants their State to become the next home to captured violent \nterrorists.\n  Now, there is a reason no one wants to have these guys nearby. Over \nthe years, the pool of prisoners at Guantanamo has become only more \ndangerous, not less, and those who remain include dozens of proud and \nself-proclaimed--proud and self-proclaimed--members of al-Qaida. Many \nhave been directly linked to some of the worst terrorist attacks in \nhistory, including some who had direct knowledge--direct knowledge--of \nSeptember 11. Others have trained or funded terrorists, made bombs or \npresented themselves as potential suicide bombers.\n  We recently got a vivid glimpse into the minds of these men when a \nnumber of them responded in writing to the Government's charges against \nthem. Here are some of the excerpts from the document which was signed \nby five men whose names appear on the chart right behind me:\n\n       With regard to these nine accusations that you are putting \n     us on trial for--\n\n  So said one of the terrorists--\n\n     to us, they are not accusations. To us, they are badges of \n     honor which we carry with pride . . . therefore, killing you \n     and fighting you, destroying you and terrorizing you, \n     responding back to your attacks, are all considered to be \n     great legitimate duty in our religion.\n\n  Later on, these men refer to the September 11 attacks as ``the \nblessed 11 September operation.''\n  Toward the end of the document, they make a statement and a \nprediction. Here is what they said:\n\n       We ask to be near to God, we fight you and destroy you and \n     terrorize you. . . . your end is very near and your fall will \n     be just as the fall of the towers on the blessed 9/11 day. . \n     . . so we ask from God to accept our contributions to the \n     great attack, the great attack on America, and to place our \n     nineteen martyred brethren among the highest peaks in \n     paradise. . . .\n\n  One of the most chilling statements in the document is the simple \nassertion by these men, quoted on the chart behind me:\n\n       We are terrorists to the bone.\n\n  ``We are terrorists to the bone.''\n  This is how they see themselves. These are the men the administration \nwants to release from Guantanamo?\n  Not only are most of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo extremely \ndangerous, they are also increasingly likely to return to battle if \nthey are transferred back to their home countries. According to \nPentagon reports, detainees who have been released from Guantanamo \nappear to be reengaging in terrorism at higher rates, with the current \nrate of those either suspected or confirmed of reengaging in terrorism \nat about 12 percent. About 12 percent of those who have been released \nare back in the fight.\n  More than a third of the detainees who have already been released \nwere from Saudi Arabia, which has its own detention and rehabilitation \nsystem. But our confidence in that system has been shaken by recent \nreports that Saudi detainees who returned home have gone back to \nfighting.\n  Last month, two Saudis who were released from Guantanamo and who \npassed through the Saudi rehabilitation program appeared in a video as \nmembers of al-Qaida in Yemen. One of them, Ali al-Shihri, is thought to \nhave been involved in a deadly bombing on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen \nlast September.\n  Al-Shirhi was released to Saudi Arabia from Guantanamo in 2007.\n  Even more worrisome than the Saudi detainees, however, is the \nprospect of releasing Yemeni detainees to Yemen since Yemen has shown \nlittle ability to control even the most dangerous terrorists we \nrelease. Of the 100 Yemenis who remain at Guantanamo, about 15 have \nbeen cleared for transfer to Yemen. Another 15 may face trial in the \nUnited States. Some of the remaining Yemenis could go to Saudi Arabia, \nbut the Yemeni Government is protesting the move.\n  Other inmates who have been released have shown up on the battlefield \nin places like Pakistan and Iraq. One former inmate from Kuwait \ntraveled to Syria after his release, snuck into Iraq, and plotted \nattacks against U.S. forces there. He eventually drove a truck packed \nwith explosives into a joint American and Iraqi military training camp, \nblowing himself up, and killing 13 Iraqi soldiers.\n  Each one of these concerns is serious enough to warrant a \nreconsideration of the administration's decision to close the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay. Taken together it is hard to imagine the \nadministration is not already having second thoughts. Of the \nalternatives that have been considered, some, like a transfer of \ndetainees to Europe, may no longer be viable.\n  But even if these inmates were sent to Europe, one all-important \nquestion would remain: What then? Will they be released? With a \nrecidivism rate now hovering around 12 percent, this is a risk that is \nsimply too dangerous to take--especially when it only takes\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\none terrorist to inflict unimaginable horror.\n  According to the European Union's own rules, a detainee who is \nreleased within a 25-nation area within the EU is free to move about \nthese countries without even a passport check. A member of al-Qaida who \nis sent to Europe and subsequently released could easily reenter a \ntransnational terrorist network--and the recidivism rate suggests that \nthis is not at all unlikely.\n  Guantanamo itself, on the other hand, has proven to be a completely \nsecure facility: in more than 7 years of use, not a single prisoner has \nescaped Guantanamo to maim or kill a single innocent person. Let me \nrepeat that: in the more than 7 years that we have used Guantanamo as a \ndetention facility, not a single prisoner out of the roughly 800 who \nhave been housed there has escaped to maim or kill a single innocent \nperson.\n  No one has credibly argued that the inmates are poorly treated: three \nmeals a day, a full library or books, magazines, and DVDs, and medical \ncare that is said to be excellent. Indeed, one European official who \nvisited in 2006 called Guantanamo ``a model'' prison and better than \nthe ones in Belgium. This is not Abu Ghraib.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder is in charge of the review of the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay. He captured the dilemma over \nGuantanamo after a recent trip there when he offered a glowing report \non the facility, said the prisoners were being treated well--and then \nreiterated the administration's intent to close it within the year. On \nsome level, the Attorney General must realize how illogical this seems. \nIf he doesn't, then for the sake of the safety of the United States and \nits citizens, it is my hope that he realizes it before the end of the \nyear.\n  President Obama was right and courageous to rethink an artificial \ndeadline on withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. As we approach another \nartificial deadline, it is my hope that he rethinks this decision \nirrespective of what they may think in certain European capitals. Any \nshift in our policy on these detainees must meet a simple test: Will it \nkeep us as safe as Guantanamo has from men like the ones whose names \nappear behind me? If the answer is no, then the policy we have is best. \nAt the moment, the only safe option is to keep the inmates at \nGuantanamo in one place--and that's right where they are.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe court order to publish the Islamic Response to the Government's \nnine accusations and the Response itself.\n     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v.

Also, may \n     God praise the prophet's household, his entire companionship, \n     and his followers until judgment day.\n       With regards to these nine accusations that you are putting \n     us on trial for; to us, they are not accusations. To us they \n     are badges of honor, which we carry with pride. Many thanks \n     to God, for his kind gesture, and choosing us to perform the \n     act of Jihad for his cause and to defend Islam and Muslims. \n     Therefore, killing you and fighting you, destroying you and \n     terrorizing you, responding back to your attacks, are all \n     considered to be great legitimate duty in our religion. These \n     actions are our offerings to God. In addition, it is the \n     imposed reality on Muslims in Palestine, Lebanon, \n     Afghanistan, Iraq, in the land of the two holy sites [Mecca \n     and Medina, Saudi Arabia], and in the rest of the world, \n     where Muslims are suffering from your brutality, terrorism, \n     killing of the innocent, and occupying their lands and their \n     holy sites. Nevertheless, it would have been the greatest \n     religious duty to fight you over your infidelity. However, \n     today, we fight you over defending Muslims, their land, their \n     holy sites, and their religion as a whole.\n       The following is our Islamic response back to your nine \n     untenable, just like a spider web, accusations:\n       First, ``the conspiracy accusation'':\n       This is a very laughable accusation. Were you expecting us \n     to inform you about our secret attack plans? Your \n     intelligence apparatus, with all its abilities, human and \n     logistical, had failed to discover our military attack plans \n     before the blessed 11 September operation. They were unable \n     to foil our attack. We ask, why then should you blame us, \n     holding us accountable and putting us on trial? Blame \n     yourselves and your failed intelligence apparatus and hold \n     them accountable, not us.\n       With regards to us, we were exercising caution and secrecy \n     in our war against you. This is a natural matter, where God \n     has taught us in his book, verse 71 from An-Nisa: ((O you \n     believers! Take your precautions, and either go forth (on an \n     expedition) In parties, or go forth together.))\n       Also, as the prophet has stated: ``War is to deceive.''\n       With regards to the second. third, and forth accusations: \n           ``Attacking civilians.'' ``Attacking civilian \n           objects.'' and ``deliberately causing grave bodily \n           harm'':\n       We ask you; who initiated the attacks on civilians? Who is \n     attacking civilian objects? And who is causing grave bodily \n     harm against civilians? Is it us, or is it you?\n       You are attacking us in Palestine and Lebanon by providing \n     political, military, and economic support to the terrorist \n     state of Israel, which in turn, is attacking unarmed innocent \n     civilians. In addition, Israel attacks Palestinian and \n     Lebanese civilian objects by bombing them and destroying \n     them. Furthermore, Israel is causing grave bodily harm by \n     using weapons that are forbidden internationally, such as: \n     cluster bombs in Lebanon and the rubber and live ammunitions \n     in Palestine and breaking bones of Palestinian children. \n     Moreover, the Israeli criminal list is long and endless, \n     against civilians in Lebanon and Palestine.\n       In addition, was it not you that attacked an entire \n     population in Iraq, destroying civilian targets and its \n     infrastructure? Was it not you that has killed one million \n     Iraqi children caused by your oppressed economic sanctions, \n     which you imposed after the first Gulf War?\n       In fact, it was you who had wiped out two entire cities off \n     the face of the earth and killed roughly half a million \n     people in a few minutes and caused grave bodily harm by \n     nuclear radiation? Did you forget about your nuclear bombs in \n     Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\n       You are the last nation that has the right to speak about \n     civilians and killing civilians. You are professional \n     criminals, with all the meaning the words carry. Therefore, \n     we will treat you the same. We will attack you, just like you \n     have attacked us, and whomever initiated the attacks is the \n     guilty party.\n       In God's book, verse 193, Al-Baqara, he states: ((The \n     sacred month is for the sacred month, and for the prohibited \n     things, there Is the law of equality. Then, whoever \n     transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress \n     likewise against him.))\n       God stated, in verse 179, Al-Baqarah: ((And there is (a \n     saving of) life for you in Al-Qisas (The law of equality in \n     punishment), O men of understanding, that you may become A-\n     Muttaquin (the pious).))\n       God also stated, in verse 40, Al-Shura: ((The recompense \n     for an evil is an evil like thereof.))\n       In verse 45, Al-Maida: ((Life for life, eye for an eye, \n     nose for a nose, ear for an ear, tooth for a tooth, and \n     wounds equal for equal.))\n       In verse 193, Al-Baqara: ((. . . Let there be no hostility \n     except to those who practice oppression.))\n       With regards to accusations five and six. ``Crimes in \n           violation of the law of war.'' and ``Destroying \n           property in violation of the law of war'':\n       Who is breaking the law of war in this world? Is it us, or \n     is it you? You have disobeyed all heaven and earth's laws of \n     war, to include your own laws.\n       You have violated the law of war by supporting the Israeli \n     occupation of Arab land in Palestine and Lebanon, and for \n     displacing five million Palestinians outside their land.\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\n     You have supported the oppressor over the oppressed and the \n     butcher over the victim.\n       Also, you have violated the law of war by attacking an \n     independent sovereign Arab nation with your first crusade \n     campaign in 1991. By force, you have occupied the Arabian \n     Peninsula and the Gulf. In addition, today, you are occupying \n     Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Also, you have violated all laws of war, and in particular, \n     your treatment of Prisoners of War, in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n     We are the best example of such violations and your ``Black \n     Sites'' for torturing prisoners. This, and with your ``Abu-\n     Ghurayb'' prison in Iraq. Guantanamo camps are witness to all \n     of that.\n       So, you are the first class war criminals, and the whole \n     world witnesses this. You have no values and ethics and no \n     principles. You are a nation without a religion. On the other \n     hand, we are a great nation, with a great religion, values, \n     ethics, and principles, which we comply with and follow, and \n     we invite people to following our ways. History will testify \n     on our actions. You should look back at Salah Al-Din and how \n     ethically he treated your crusader ancestors that were \n     prisoners to him.\n       We fight you to defense our nation, our religion, and our \n     land. All heavenly and earthly laws guarantee our rights to \n     do so. We, Muslims, are content with God's book, the Quran, \n     to fight you with. God has granted us to fight, in verse 39, \n     Al-Hajj: ((To those against whom war is waged, permission is \n     given (to fight,) because they are wronged and verily, Allah \n     is most powerful for their aid.))\n       God stated in his book, verse 190, Al-Baqara: ((And fight \n     in the way of Allah those who fight you, but be not the \n     transgressor, Allah likes not the transgressors.))\n       With regards to the seventh accusation, ``Hijacking and/or \n           endangering a vessel or an aircraft'':\n       In return, we ask you: Which is more dangerous; Hijacking \n     and/or endangering a vessel or an aircraft, or endangering an \n     entire population with a military occupation, killing and \n     endangering innocent civilians by starving them with an \n     economic sanction?\n       If you do not respect the innocent in our countries, then \n     we will do the same, by exposing you to danger and hijacking \n     in the air, at sea, and land.\n       In God's book, he ordered us to fight you everywhere we \n     find you, even if you were inside the holiest of all holy \n     cities, The Mosque in Mecca, and the holy city of Mecca, and \n     even during sacred months.\n       In God's book, verse 9, Al-Tawbah: ((Then fight and slay \n     the pagans wherever you find them, and seize them, and \n     besiege them and lie in wait for them in each and every \n     ambush.))\n       Remember, that you are the ones who attacked the Iranian \n     civilian aircraft, flight 655, in 1988 with your Cruise \n     missiles over the Hermuz straights, killing all of its 290 \n     passengers, among them 66 children. They are still shedding \n     tears today over your victims. Does your blood have a value \n     and the blood of Muslims not?\n       With regards to the ``Terrorism'' accusations:\n       Who are the real terrorists? Is it us, or is it you? \n     America is the terrorist country number one in the world. Is \n     has nuclear weapons of mass destruction, and the hydrogen \n     bombs, and the biological weapons, and its ocean fleets are \n     around the world, threatening countries' security and safety \n     and any country that is not subjected to its oppressed will.\n       In addition, America is the main shepherd of the main \n     support to the Israeli terrorism against Muslims in the \n     occupied state of Palestine, and also support and bond with \n     the terrorist governments of the Arab and Islamic world, \n     which, in turn, oppress and suppress their own people that \n     are calling for freedom, and the application of Islamic law.\n       We do not possess your military might, not your nuclear \n     weapons. Nevertheless, we fight you with the almighty God. \n     So, if our act of Jihad and our fighting with you caused fear \n     and terror, then many thanks to God, because it is him that \n     has thrown fear into your hearts, which resulted in your \n     infidelity, paganism, and your statement that God had a son \n     and your trinity beliefs.\n       God stated in his book, verse 151, Al-Umran: ((Soon shall \n     we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, for that \n     they joined companies with Allah, for which he has sent no \n     authority; There place will be the fire; and evil is the home \n     of the wrongdoers.))\n       God also stated in his book, verse 60, Al-Anfal: ((Against \n     them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, \n     including steeds of war, to strike terror into the heart of \n     the enemies of Allah and your enemies.))\n       Also, God has informed us, in his book, of what is in your \n     heart from fear and terror towards us, and that you fear and \n     have been terrorized from us more than God himself. Verse 13, \n     Al-Hashir: ((Of a truth you (Muslims) are more feared in \n     their (the infidels from Christians, Jews, and others) \n     hearts, than Allah. This is because they are men devoid of \n     understanding.))\n       Therefore, you do not fight us face-to-face, man-to-man. \n     But rather, you fight us from behind roadblocks, trenches, \n     and warplanes, which are thousands of feet in the air.\n       Your status in Iraq and Afghanistan does not need any \n     further explanation. God has demonstrated to us your mental \n     and your defeated fighting moral status.\n       God has stated in his book, verse 14, Al-Hashir: ((They \n     fight not against you even together, except in fortified \n     townships, or from behind walls, their enmity among \n     themselves is very great, you would think that they were \n     united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they \n     are a people who understand not.))\n       Our prophet was victorious because of fear. At a month \n     distant, the enemy did not hear from him.\n       So, our religion is a religion of fear and terror to the \n     enemies of God: the Jews, Christians, and pagans. With God's \n     wiling, we are terrorists to the bone. So, many thanks to \n     God.\n       The Arab poet, Abu-Ubaydah Al-Hadrami, has stated: ((We \n     will terrorize you, as long as we live with swords, fire, and \n     airplanes.))\n       With regards to the ninth accusation. ``Material support to \n           terrorism'':\n       America is the number one, and the largest country in the \n     world, in spreading military might and terrorism. Also, \n     America is the principle and greatest supplier to the \n     occupying terrorist state of Israel in Palestine. Also, \n     America supports and finances the terrorist regimes that \n     govern the countries of the Arab world, such as Egypt, Saudi \n     Arabia, and Pakistan.\n       Nevertheless, we are defending our rights, land, religion, \n     and our oppressed Muslim brethrens around the world. \n     Therefore, we would spend all of our money and properties for \n     this cause. This is not strange, since Muslims are all part \n     of the same Umma.\n       We will make all of our materials available, to defend and \n     deter, and egress you and the filthy Jews from our countries.\n       God has ordered us to spend for Jihad in his cause. This is \n     evident in many Quranic verses.\n       Verse 195, Al-Baqara: ((And spend of your substance in the \n     cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to \n     your destruction, but do good; for Allah loves those who do \n     good.))\n       We ask to be near to God, we fight you and destroy you and \n     terrorize you. The Jihad in god's cause is a great duty in \n     our religion. We have news for you, the news is: You will be \n     greatly defeated in Afghanistan and Iraq and that America \n     will fall, politically, militarily, and economically. Your \n     end is very near and your fall will be just as the fall of \n     the towers on the blessed 9/11 day. We will raise from the \n     ruins, God willing. We will leave this imprisonment with our \n     noses raised high in dignity, as the lion emerges from his \n     den. We shall pass over the blades of the sword into the \n     gates of heaven.\n       So we ask from God to accept our contributions to the great \n     attack, the great attack on America, and to place our \n     nineteen martyred brethren among the highest peaks in \n     paradise.\n       God is great and pride for God, the prophet, and the \n     believers. . . .\n\n       Signed: The 9/11 Shura Council\n       Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\n       Ramzi bin As-Shibh\n       Walid bin 'Attash\n       Mustafa Ahmed Al-Hawsawi\n       'Ali 'abd Al-'Aziz 'Ali\n       Sunday, 3/1/1429h\n       Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If I were in the AIG administration, I would \nrecommend they give back those bonuses. Remember, we as a Congress are \nnot defenseless. We can also do things. Senator Baucus, chairman of the \nFinance Committee, is going to make a proposal that will certainly send \na message to the people at AIG and others who try to benefit from the \nhardships the American people face. So in the next 24 hours, you will \nhear from the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, that \nAIG's recipients of these bonuses will not be able to keep all their \nmoney. That is an understatement.\n  Also, regarding Guantanamo, I think we should not make this a \npolitical issue. John McCain has come out in favor of this. ``I think \nthat it's a wise move,'' McCain said about closing Guantanamo Bay. So \nthis is something President Obama is not out there alone on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3126-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3126-S3127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMERICA'S ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, 8 years of greed and negligence have left \nour country with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. \nPresident Obama took office in an economic climate that no President \nwould relish: staggering job loss, the largest national debt in \nhistory, a frozen credit market, major banks teetering on the edge of \ninsolvency, a record foreclosure rate forcing millions of families to \nlose their jobs and their homes, a stock market in freefall, leaving \nsenior citizens to put retirement on hold and putting the economic \nsecurity of millions more at risk.\n  The first job of any doctor is to stabilize a patient. In the first 2 \nmonths of\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nhis administration, President Obama has started to stop the bleeding \nand begun to heal our economy. The cornerstone of the President's near-\nterm plan to end the freefall he inherited is the Economic Recovery \nAct, which will save and create 3.5 million jobs, while making \ncritically needed investments in roads, bridges, tunnels, education, \nhealth care, and energy.\n  President Obama, along with Democrats in Congress, understands that \nas deep as our immediate problems may be, the worst mistake we could \nmake is to stop investing for the future.\n  That is why the President's budget proposal lays the groundwork for \nan economy that just doesn't recover in the short term but also \nprospers in the long term. That starts with ending the previous \nadministration's era of passing the buck, refusing to make tough \nchoices, to plan for the future, or to hold anyone accountable for \ngreed and corruption.\n  There will be no accounting tricks in the Obama budget. There will be \nhonesty, accountability, lower taxes for working families, smart \ninvestments for a long-term prosperity that reaches beyond the \nprivileged to lift up the middle class.\n  One of the most critical investments we can make today is in a new \nnational energy policy that finally begins to end our addiction to oil. \nSince the first Model-T Ford left the assembly line more than 80 years \nago, the risks associated with oil consumption have been known. Today, \nwe face a three-pronged oil crisis threatening our economy, our \nnational security, and our environment.\n  After years of writing bigger and bigger checks to foreign nations \nfor more and more barrels of oil, this budget finally takes the logical \napproach that all Americans understand: We need to reduce our \nconsumption, and we need to find new renewable sources of clean energy \nthat we can grow, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs right \nhere at home.\n  We must make these investments now and, if we do, we will not only \naccomplish those goals but also lower future energy bills for every \nsingle American consumer, and we will save money for all middle-class \nfamilies.\n  Remember, last year, we spent, buying oil from foreign nations, about \na half trillion dollars, which is money that should have stayed at \nhome. That is why President Obama is proposing a market-based cap on \ncarbon pollution to drive production of renewable fuels and energy-\nefficient technology and reward companies that lead the way.\n  This budget will also invest $15 billion a year to develop the \nrenewable sources of energy that lie literally all around us--in the \nSun, the wind, and just beneath the Earth in geothermal. All across \nAmerica, the work of tapping these plentiful energy sources is \nunderway.\n  In Pennsylvania, renewable energy has sparked more than $1 billion in \nprivate investment. In Iowa, shuttered factories have reopened to build \nparts for wind turbines. In Nevada, a State called the ``Saudi Arabia \nof renewable energy,'' we already have enough renewable energy projects \nin operation to heat and cool hundreds of thousands of homes--without a \ndrop of oil.\n  If we make renewable energy a priority in this budget, these projects \nwill just be the beginning. The solar power in Nevada and the desert \nSouthwest alone could meet our entire energy needs 7 times over--the \nneeds of this country.\n  The wind energy in the Great Plains, the Midwest, and off both of our \ncoasts is similarly abundant. The potential for geothermal energy--\nstill largely untapped--is staggering.\n  Until recently, all of these outstanding projects have been moving \nforward with little, if any, Federal support. Our landscape is dotted \nwith renewable energy projects, but right now we are not connecting the \ndots. The renewable energy is where people don't live; we need to bring \nthat energy to where people live.\n  The fact that we are not connecting the dots has to end, and it will \nend when we begin to invest in a smarter and greener transmission grid \nthat brings renewable energy from the places that produce it to the \nplaces that will use it.\n  We should be catalyzing the work of private sector innovators who are \ncarrying the green revolution on their shoulders. Every job created by \na new renewable energy project in California, Utah, Illinois, Nevada, \nor Iowa is a job that could never be shipped overseas.\n  Some on the other side may try to protect our country's biggest \ncorporate polluters from cleaning up their act. Some may say that in \nthis time of economic crisis, we should not be investing in our future. \nSome may criticize the President's budget, yet refuse to offer ideas of \ntheir own.\n  Over the next several weeks, we have the opportunity to engage in a \nserious and vigorous debate over this budget and the priorities it \nreflects.\n  I urge all my colleagues to choose sound policy over sound bites. We \nmay not agree on everything, but I know we can agree that after 8 long \nyears of irresponsibility, we must pass a budget that puts the American \npeople first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3127-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, for years, we have talked about the fact that the \nannual budget process is the truest test of priorities that the \nPresident and Congress engage in. For years, I was concerned about the \nlast administration's budgets, and I was very vocal about that--too \nlittle investment in America, too many gimmicks, and too much focus on \nthe few and not the many. It was those budgets and the policies they \nimposed that led us to the challenges we are now facing.\n  President Obama inherited huge problems not of his own making. That \nis why his first budget blueprint is such a breath of fresh air. \nPresident Obama's budget is both a statement of priorities and a test \nof our commitment to making our country stronger for all Americans.\n  Our Nation faces serious challenges now, but it is not a time to shy \naway from the investments that will ensure our prosperity and our \ncompetitiveness in the future. His budget builds the foundation that \nwill make America stronger by investing in health care, energy \nindependence, and education. The President inherited an economic \nrecession and staggering deficits. The shortsighted budgets and \npolicies of the past have left our infrastructure crumbling, our \neducation system falling behind, and the debt of war in the pockets of \nour grandchildren.\n  There is no doubt we have to take some serious steps to dig out of \nthis hole. President Obama's budget takes steps to cut our deficit in \nhalf and to restore fairness to our tax system. Importantly, after 8 \nyears of gimmicks, this budget is transparent and tells the American \npeople exactly where we are spending our money. The President accounts \nfor war spending and leaves room for natural disasters or other \nemergencies we might face.\n  The President has been honest about the challenges that face this \ncountry, and now he is being honest about where we need to invest. He \nhas warned Congress and the American people about the sacrifice we all \nhave to make to\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nmove our country forward, and they are many. But he has also been clear \nthat now is the time to continue to invest in health care and energy \nand education reform to ensure our long-term strength and prosperity.\n  I come to the floor today to talk specifically about the need to \ninvest in education. Investing in education is one of the most certain \nways we can create jobs and strengthen our economy well into the \nfuture. Education means economic recovery, and in this global economy a \ngood education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity, it is a \nprerequisite for success. Ensuring quality education for every American \nis essential to our future as a nation.\n  The President and this Congress made a downpayment on that commitment \nin the Economic Recovery Act we passed last month. That bill meant help \nfor students in Washington State--my State--who are struggling to \nafford and attend college and students across the country. It means \nserving more K-12 students' needs. It means the ability to restore the \neducation cuts our States are facing. It means keeping teachers in \ntheir jobs and our class sizes down.\n  Those investments we made in the economic recovery package are going \nto not only help create jobs, they are going to help our teachers and \nour parents in our communities keep their jobs while they modernize \neducation for today's students. Those students are going to be \ntomorrow's highly skilled workforce, so we need to make this investment \nto stay strong as a nation. That economic recovery bill made a \ndownpayment on our students' future. The next step we have to take is \nour budget, to help improve education for our kids and for all.\n  The budget we are going to be seeing puts a long-needed emphasis on \npreparing students for the jobs of today and tomorrow, with the focus \non science, math and technology skills and equipment. It focuses on \n21st century skills and early childhood education. It talks about \ncareer and technical education and accessing and affording higher \neducation, which includes 2-year colleges and technical training.\n  So let me talk a minute about the budget and its details. The budget \ncreates a 0-to-5 plan, which will continue to increase funding for Head \nStart, Early Head Start, and the child care development block grants. \nIt encourages State and local investment in early education to help get \ninformation to parents about quality child care programs, including \nimportant home visiting programs for parents with young children.\n  The budget will make important investments in preparing and \nsupporting great teachers and school leaders for our schools. It will \nallow students to achieve their college dream by making critical \nfunding to raise the Pell grant in this time of need, and it continues \nthe new American Opportunity Tax Credit, which will help families \nacross the Nation afford tuition.\n  The budget also makes a 5-year, $2.5 billion investment in a new \nAccess and Completion Incentive Fund to ensure that low-income students \ncomplete college. We know that only about 50 percent of our students \nwho start a college education in this country complete it. We have to \ndo a lot better than that because almost all of our good-paying jobs \ntoday require a credential beyond high school.\n  I come to the floor today to say that now is not a time to sit back \nand just worry. Now is a time to be bold and make the critical \ninvestments in our country that are so long overdue. Nowhere is this \nclearer than in education. I applaud the President for making his \ncommitment clear, and I pledge to work with him and every one of my \ncolleagues who are willing to ensure that ours becomes the greatest \neducation system in the world.\n  Now let me say a word about some of the criticism we have been \nhearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle. I have heard a \nlot of talk about this budget ``taxing'' too much. Well, they must be \nreading a different budget than I am. President Obama's budget would \nnot raise taxes on 95 percent of Americans. I think that is important, \nso let me say it again. Ninety-five percent of Americans will not see \ntheir taxes raised under this plan. In fact, too much of the tax burden \nin this country is being borne today by our working families, and \nPresident Obama is working hard to fix that. Nine of ten working \nfamilies will see their taxes go down with his budget plan.\n  The President's Making Work Pay credit--$400 for individuals and $800 \nfor families--is extended under his budget plan. That credit cuts taxes \nfor 95 percent of our working families. It cuts taxes for 95 percent of \nour working families.\n  The American Opportunity Education Tax Credit is going to help our \nfamilies pay for college by providing a $2,500 credit to offset the \ncost of tuition and related expenses, and it makes the credit partially \nrefundable.\n  Finally, the budget increases eligibility for the refundable portion \nof the child credit.\n  Those are just three ways this administration is focusing on tax \nrelief for those who need it most--our working families. So while we \nare hearing a lot--and we will continue to hear a lot, no doubt--from \nour friends on the other side about ``taxing'' too much, it is \nimportant that we all look at the facts and not buy into the rhetoric.\n  After 8 long years of budgets that left our American families behind, \nI look forward to working with President Obama and a bipartisan group \nin Congress to move forward and invest in the future strength of this \nNation. We have a lot of great challenges ahead, but I believe we can \nand we will overcome them by working together, making some tough \nchoices, and investing in the best resource we have--the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise again to discuss the issue of \nautomatic pay raises for Members of Congress. As I said in our debate \non the omnibus spending bill last week, I think this system of \nautomatic pay raises--pay raises for Members of Congress on autopilot, \nwithout the need for any legislation, any debate, any vote--is truly \nwrong and truly offensive. I believe it is in the best of times, but I \nbelieve it is triply wrong and offensive right now as Americans all \nover our country, who have to work hard in the real world, face dire \neconomic challenges and conditions.\n  I rise again to urge us to act, to do the right thing, to rebuild \nconfidence among the American people by changing this system and no \nlonger having automatic pay raises for Members of Congress. I proposed \ndoing this as an amendment on the Omnibus appropriations bill. After \nsome difficulty in getting my amendment even recognized and debated and \nvoted on, I finally was able to do that and we had a meaningful debate. \nWe had a vote. It was a close vote. Unfortunately, from my perspective, \nI fell a little bit short in terms of agreeing to the amendment. It was \ndefeated 52 to 45. But in that process we did have an important debate \nand several other Members came forward and expressed support for the \nconcept--most notably the majority leader, Senator Reid. In fact, the \nvery day after I finally secured a debate and a vote on my amendment, \nthe day after that Senator Reid introduced his own freestanding bill to \nget rid of automatic pay raises, at least after the next one scheduled, \nand to do away with that process.\n  Obviously, I completely agree with that concept. That is the whole \nimpetus for my work, along with Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and my \nother coauthors, Senator Ensign and Senator Grassley.\n  During the debate on this issue, Senator Reid went further. He spoke \non the floor in support of this effort. He said several things:\n\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n\n       I agree with Senator Vitter that cost-of-living adjustments \n     for Members of Congress should not be automatic. That is why \n     I introduced a freestanding bill last week that would do just \n     that.\n\n  In addition, in the same time on the floor, Senator Reid said:\n\n       If there are people who don't want to agree to this \n     tonight, assuming the Senator from Louisiana is that person, \n     I will bring it up some other time. I am committed to doing \n     this.\n\n  Again:\n\n       I will bring it up some other time. I am committed to doing \n     this.\n\n  I objected to bringing that freestanding bill up then because it \nclearly would have drained votes in support of my amendment away from \nmy amendment and helped defeat it. In fact, we saw how close that vote \nwas. But now that that vote is over, I applaud Senator Reid for his \noffer:\n\n       I will bring it up some other time. I am committed to doing \n     this.\n\n  I am here to say that this time, right now, these next 2 weeks, is a \nperfect ``some other time.'' We are clearly in a bit of a lull in terms \nof floor activity, this week and next week, before we begin an \nimportant debate on the budget. The majority leader is looking for \nthings to take up our floor time. We are clearly in a light period. So \nwhat better ``some other time'' than right here, right now? In that \nspirit, and in the spirit of cooperation to move forward, I sent the \nmajority leader a letter last Thursday and I expressed these thoughts \nand I asked him to bring up his freestanding bill, or mine, or any \nfreestanding bill to end pay raises for Members of Congress being on \nautopilot on the Senate floor as soon as possible. As I pointed out, \nthis clearly has support to move this through the process, through the \nSenate in the near future.\n  It does not have unanimous support. Any issue such as this never \nwould have unanimous support. But it has the support of over 60 Members \nof this body.\n  Why do I say that? It is simple math. On the vote on my amendment I \nobtained 45 ``yes'' votes. In addition to those 45 votes, there were 20 \nMembers, including the distinguished majority leader, who voted against \nmy amendment, saying that the only reason they were doing that was to \nnot burden the omnibus spending bill with the amendment. They said on \nthe record, they are for the concept and Senator Reid introduced a \nfreestanding bill in this body and he has coauthors to that \nfreestanding bill in that number--20. It is simple math. If you add 45 \nand 20 you come up with 65, well over a filibuster-proof number, well \nover the 60 votes required to not only move this bill through the \nSenate but move it through in a fairly expedited, efficient, quick \nprocess.\n  The perfect time is now. We are clearly in 2 weeks of relative lull \nbefore the debate on the budget. The majority leader clearly is looking \nfor important business to bring to the floor, particularly since cram-\ndown and other issues are not being brought to the floor this week as \nplanned. What better time to come together in a bipartisan way, to \nrebuild the confidence of the American people and to get this done, \npassing it through the Senate. Again:\n\n       I will bring it up some other time. I am committed to doing \n     this.\n\n  The distinguished majority leader.\n  Again I ask the majority leader in a spirit of bipartisanship, of \ncooperation, of reestablishing the confidence of the American people in \nCongress by doing away with this offensive practice--pay raises on \nautopilot without debate, without legislation, without a vote, without \neven a line item in an appropriations bill which we can try to change \nthrough amendment--let's change that wrong and offensive practice.\n  I urge the distinguished majority leader to look at my letter of last \nThursday, to consider it carefully, to understand that we have \nestablished through his bill, through my vote, 65 votes in support of \ndoing away with this on the Senate floor. So let's act. With 65 votes \nwe can act, we can be successful, and we can do it in a very efficient \nmanner. What better time to do it than right now?\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What is the order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a couple issues. The \nfirst is to add my voice to the outrage over the bonuses to people who \nto say don't deserve it is an understatement. I used to work on Wall \nStreet a very long time ago. You got a bonus when you did something \ngood, when you brought business in, when you did well for the company, \nnot when you brought the company down. It is disgusting, disgraceful. \nWe are hearing outrage from all quarters of society, which means we are \ngoing to do something about it. I wanted to make sure I am on the \nrecord as saying the bonuses ought to be returned voluntarily and, if \nnot, they ought to be taxed as close to 100 percent as we can get. I \nwill be supporting that.\n  It is time to change the culture in corporate America. If you are \ngoing to turn to taxpayers for help, then don't squander their money. \nWork to pay it back as fast as you can and get back on your own. It is \nsuch an obvious point. I wish to praise the President for being clear \non this point.\n  I also came to talk about the upcoming debate we will be having on \nthe budget. I was a long-time member of the Budget Committee and then \nmoved off to take other assignments. But I have always respected the \nwork of that committee because the budget is truly a roadmap to the \npriorities of a nation. When we look at a budget, surely there will be \ncertain items in it we may not want to agree with. We may want to trim \nit here and there. I don't agree with everything in the Obama budget. \nThere are a few I will work to change. In general, at this time when we \nare suffering so economically, the priorities laid out are good for \nAmerica and good for the State of California. I wish to talk about a \ncouple of these priorities.\n  We know the Obama administration inherited an economic nightmare from \nGeorge Bush's administration: 4.4 million jobs lost in the last 14 \nmonths; an unemployment rate that is soaring--in my State it is in \ndouble digits--12.5 million Americans unemployed, and a Federal debt \nthat is going upward very quickly.\n  What is so interesting to me is that when Bill Clinton handed over \nthe keys to the White House to George W. Bush, our budget was actually \nin a surplus. We actually had discussions in my household about the \nfact that the debt is going down so fast, we may not have the \nopportunity to buy any more Treasury bonds. Let's not forget what \nhappened in 8 years. A budget surplus turned into outrageous deficits. \nThe economy took a terrible turn for the worse. The debt began to soar.\n  Now we have a new President who ran on a platform of change. As I \nwatch my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, save a few, they \nare fighting for the status quo. My belief is, if you fight for the \nstatus quo, that is not a passive act. It is a hostile act. Because the \nstatus quo has to change so we can relieve some of the pain in America. \nWhat President Obama does with this budget, very wisely, is to continue \nthe economic stimulus he started with his economic stimulus bill.\n  He focuses on three priorities: education, health care, and clean \nenergy. Everyone knows--and I know my friend in the chair has a young \nson--what President Obama said is true. Countries that outteach us \ntoday will outcompete us tomorrow. His young son and my grandchildren, \nif they don't get the education they deserve, will not have a chance to \nget that dream we had the opportunity to get in our generation. For \nevery dollar invested in education, there is a $4 to $9 return in \nhigher earnings, higher employment rates, less crime, less welfare, and \nin better health. The Obama plan will double the number of children \nserved by Early Head Start and will expand Head Start. He will provide \nresources\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\nto reward effective teachers and effective principals. He will increase \nthe capacity of our young people to go to college on Pell grants. When \nwe have a President who invests in education, we know we should support \nhim because every dollar we invest comes back ninefold.\n  Then the President invests in health care. We know the biggest cause \nof bankruptcy in America is when a family is hit with a catastrophic \nhealth problem and they are uninsured or their insurance is capped. We \nknow premiums have grown four times faster than wages in the last 8 \nyears. Our President is going to finally take on the issue of health \ncare. We should stand with him. Does that mean we will support every \nlittle thing he recommends? It may not. We may agree on 90 percent. But \nwe will move on health care because not to do so, again, is a hostile \nact because the current situation is unsustainable. The cost to \nfamilies today is unsustainable. The fear families have--what if \nsomebody gets a catastrophic illness, what will happen--is \nunforgivable.\n  Lastly, we see our President investing in clean energy. What he is \ndoing is looking at the future and recognizing that the old energy is \nnot going to sustain us. If we want to lead the world, we have to do \nwhat Thomas Friedman suggests in his book ``Hot, Flat, and Crowded''--\nstep out and invent the new clean energy technologies. In doing that, \nwe will lead the world in green jobs. We will lead the world in \nexports. If we adopt the cap-and-trade plan that is recommended by our \nPresident, we will see a robust economy because, once you put a price \non carbon, all the other alternatives come up behind it, and it will \nlead us out of this economic morass.\n  I believed it important to come to the Chamber today to speak to \nthese two issues. We cannot abide by the outrageous bonuses in a \ncompany led by people who took the company down. We can't abide by \nthat. In addition, we need to work with our new President and bring \nabout the change he promised in his campaign. That change is reflected \nin his budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3130-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                     The Budget And Reconciliation\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I listened this morning to President Obama \nas he spoke on the budget. In attendance with him were the chairmen of \nthe Budget Committees in the Senate and the House, Chairman Conrad and \nChairman Spratt. Essentially, the President was defending his budget, \nas proposed and sent up here to the Hill.\n  His theme was we should not pass on problems to the next generation. \nThus, he said, his budget took on the issue of energy and took on the \nissue of health care as being core questions that need to be resolved \nnow and not be passed on to the next generation. I could not agree with \nhim more--first, that we should not pass on problems to the next \ngeneration, and, secondly, we should take on the problems we have \ntoday. And they are fairly big.\n  Where I disagree with him is the conclusion that the budget he sent \nup here does not pass problems on to the next generation. In fact, it \npasses the most significant problem on to the next generation, which is \nthat it so greatly expands the size of Government in such a short \nperiod of time with so much borrowing that it basically will bankrupt \nour children and our children's children as a result of the cost of \nGovernment going forward.\n  People do not have to believe me to recognize this. All they have to \ndo is look at the President's budget. In 5 years, the President's \nbudget will double the national debt. In 10 years, the President's \nbudget will triple the national debt. To try to put this in \nperspective, if you take all the debt the U.S. Government has run up \nsince the beginning of our country--from George Washington all the way \nthrough to George W. Bush, that total amount of debt--in 5 years it \nwill be doubled under this budget, as sent up by President Obama.\n  Now, a lot of that debt that is being run up in the short run I am \nnot going to claim is inappropriate in the sense that it is something \nthat is under his control or that he is responsible for as President. \nIn fact, I agree that we as a nation need to expand our spending as a \ngovernment in the short run in order to try to address this \nrecessionary period, and specifically to try to stabilize our financial \nsituation, our financial system. I do not happen to agree with the \nstimulus package which was passed. I do not agree with the omnibus \npackage which was passed. They were both profligate and unfocused, \nmoney being spent inappropriately and inefficiently. But I am willing \nto accept the fact in the short run there has to be a spike in our \nnational debt in order to address this recession.\n  What is not tolerable, however, is that under this budget, after the \nshort run--after this period from 2008, 2009, say, through 2011, when \nthe recession, by all estimates, will hopefully be over--we will still \nbe running the debt up radically, as sent up by this President. In \nfact, it doubles in 5 years, but it triples in 10 years, which means \nthere is--I am not aware that a recession in the last 5 years of this \nbudget is being proposed; I certainly hope it is not being proposed, \nbut certainly there is nothing that requires that type of a radical \nexpansion in our debt over that period.\n  The practical implications of this doubling of the debt are that by \nthe time the budget gets into the year 2013, the public debt of this \ncountry will be, as a ratio of GDP, 67 percent of GDP. I suspect when \nCBO scores the President's numbers at the end of this week it will \nprobably be close to 70 percent of GDP. What does that mean? Well, try \nto put this in perspective.\n  Prior to the recession, our public debt--that is the debt held by \npeople such as the Chinese, for example, and the Europeans--our public \ndebt--the debt which we sell to the world in order to finance our \nGovernment--was about 40 percent of our gross national product. That is \nan acceptable level. Most economists will say we can tolerate a debt to \ngross national product ratio of 40 percent. But when it gets up to \naround 70 percent, when it gets over 60 percent--when it gets into \nthose numbers--it is not tolerable. You might be able to tolerate it \nfor a little while, for a few years, but you cannot tolerate it for an \nextended period of time. What the President is proposing is that 67 \npercent of public debt to GDP ratio--which will be over 70 percent, I \nsuspect, when it is rescored that goes on forever.\n  In addition, the deficit, beginning in the year 2012, under the \nPresident's budget, will be at 3 percent to 4 percent of gross national \nproduct. Now, historically, over the last 20 years--prior to the \nrecession--the deficit has been around 2 percent of gross national \nproduct. Why is it important to keep that down? Because every time you \nrun a deficit, you add to the public debt. When you get into the 3- to \n4-percent range of annual deficits as a percentage of GDP, you are \nessentially adding so much debt so quickly every year that basically \nyour Government becomes unaffordable. That is the bottom line here.\n  What happens, as you go into the outyears when you triple the debt \nand keep the deficit at around 3 percent or 4 percent of GDP the \ncurrency starts to be under pressure. The dollar becomes questioned as \nto its value. People start asking, especially in the international \ncommunity: Do we dare buy American debt? In fact, you heard, \nregrettably, the Chinese Premier raise that issue already. If you \ncannot sell the debt and you cannot finance the Government, you do not \nhave too many choices. You must move to inflation. That is not a good \nchoice for Americans.\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n  So basically what you are putting in place is a structural debt and a \nstructural deficit under the President's proposal which simply is not \naffordable, which means our children are either going to be overwhelmed \nby a tax burden or they are going to find a country where inflation is \nrampant or basically the standard of living has dropped significantly.\n  Why does this all happen? Well, it happens primarily because under \nthe President's budget he is taking spending up radically. Sure, in the \nshort run that may be acceptable because we are trying to address this \nrecession. But he does not bring spending back down to its historic \nlevels.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows you that the historic level of \nspending of the Federal Government has been at about 20 percent of \ngross national product. We have been up and down around 20 percent for \nyears. But under President Obama's proposal, he radically moves the \nGovernment to the left, greatly expanding the Government role in all \nsorts of areas: in energy, in health care, in education. As a result, \nhe takes Federal spending up to 23 percent of gross national product \nand keeps it there for as far as the eye can see and revenues stay down \nat about 19 percent, so you have this big structural deficit in here.\n  Even if you were to take revenues up to 23 percent of gross national \nproduct, the practical effect would be that you would be wiping out \nmost people's incomes with taxes. The President says he is only going \nto raise taxes on the wealthiest in America. That, first, is inaccurate \nbecause he has put in this proposal a massive carbon tax, which is \nbasically a national sales tax on electricity, and every time you turn \non your electric lights, you are going to end up with a new tax, a new \nnational Federal tax. But independent of that, he cannot get this debt \nunder control with this type of spending level unless he radically \nincreases the tax burden on working Americans--all Americans--to a \npoint where basically productivity would drop significantly in this \ncountry, and that would be a self-fulfilling event, of course. Once \nproductivity drops, your revenues drop, and you never get back to an \nefficient marketplace and, therefore, you probably aggravate the \ndeficit.\n  But the problem is, this huge debt he is running up and passing on to \nthe next generation--this tripling of the Federal debt, about which he \nsays: We do not pass problems on to the next generation--this is a \npretty darn big problem that is being passed on to the next \ngeneration--is driven almost entirely by spending, spending at the \nFederal level, which he greatly expands.\n  Under the proposal which he has put forward as a blueprint--this \nbudget proposal--his way of solving the health care problem is to \nessentially nationalize health care. His way of solving the educational \nproblem is to essentially nationalize the student loan program. His way \nof solving the energy problem is not to produce more energy in America, \nit is basically to significantly increase the cost of energy in America \nto all Americans by putting in place a carbon tax, which is a national \nsales tax.\n  His way of addressing the issues which we confront, which are \nreasonable, philosophical approaches, is to significantly increase the \nsize of Government and, thus, the cost of Government and, thus, to \ncreate this huge debt, this massive debt, which we are not going to be \nable to finance and which is, therefore, going to threaten the economic \nstrength of our Nation and clearly give our children something less \nthan we received. Therefore, when he says he is not going to pass the \nproblems on to the next generation, the exact opposite is true. He is \ncreating a huge problem for the next generation in the way he wants to \nspend this money.\n  Now, there is a second issue I want to address today. That goes to \nthe issue of the substance of the points made today at the press \nconference. This could be addressed, of course--this issue of spending \nand those questions regarding these major public policies--if he wanted \nto reach across the aisle and approach things in a bipartisan way.\n  Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, and I have \nproposed an idea calling for a commission with fast-track authority \nwhich essentially would talk on the big issues which drive this \nspending problem--health care, specifically; Social Security, also; and \ntax policy--and would allow us, in a bipartisan way, to come forward \nand grapple with these issues and put forward ideas as to how to solve \nthem and bring under control these numbers so they are affordable and \nso we do not run up this massive debt on our children. That is a \nbipartisan initiative which I am totally committed to.\n  In the area of energy, there are a number of bipartisan initiatives \nwhich make sense. But we are now hearing that rather than proceeding on \na bipartisan path to try to address these issues, they are going to \nthink about using something called reconciliation. That is a term of \nart around here. Most people do not know what it means. But what it \nessentially means is that you say here in the Senate that the Senate \nwill function as an autocracy, it will function like the House of \nRepresentatives, that you will have the ability to bring to the floor a \nbill which will not essentially be amendable and which will only take \n51 votes to pass.\n  Reconciliation was a concept enacted as part of the congressional \nbudget process, and its use has evolved. Its purpose was to reconcile \nthe budget. In other words, if the numbers on spending around here did \nnot meet the budget, then there would be a bill to correct that, so \nthat if the appropriations numbers were not correct or the entitlement \nnumbers were not correct or the tax numbers were not correct, there \ncould be a bill that comes through called reconciliation, which would \nfollow the budget resolution.\n  Sometimes over the years, it has been used in an aggressive way. It \nwas used to adjust already existing programs--authorized programs, \nentitlement programs, and tax proposals. President Bush used it \naggressively on taxes. In 1997, President Clinton used it aggressively, \nalong with a Republican Congress, on everything--entitlements and \ntaxes--but it was always directed at existing policy and adjusting that \npolicy. In other words, we were raising the tax rate or dropping the \ntax rate, changing an entitlement program in some way that already \nexisted or not changing an entitlement program.\n\n  Reconciliation has never been used for the purposes of putting in \nplace a dramatic new Federal program which will fundamentally shift the \nway the Government functions in this country. It has never been used in \nthe sense of an ab initio event or program.\n  The carbon tax--or, as I call it, the national sales tax on electric \nbills--is a massive exercise in industrial policy, totally redirecting \nhow energy is produced in this Nation and affecting everybody in this \nNation because everybody's energy bill will be increased as a result of \nthis tax, especially in the Midwest and in the Northeast. It is a brand \nnew program--something we have never seen before. It is a huge program. \nObviously, rewriting the health care system of this country is a \ndramatic exercise affecting absolutely everyone in this Nation at all \nsorts of different levels. It is a brand new, major program. These are \ninitiatives of significant size and import. Reconciliation was never \nconceived to undertake those types of events, those types of \ninitiatives.\n  You can't bring to the floor of the Senate a bill which totally \nrewrites the way people produce and pay for energy in this Nation with \na brand new national sales tax, under a rule that says you will get 20 \nhours of debate and no amendments, and have the Senate function as is \nits purpose, which is to be a place of discussion and amendment. It \nwould function like the House of Representatives, that is true, but it \nwould basically eliminate the Senate as a concept and it would go right \ndirectly at destroying the purposes of the Senate. The same, of course, \nis true, to bring a major initiative--to basically rewrite health care \ncompletely--basically quasi-nationalize it, as far as I can see, is the \nproposal--but to have a massive health care initiative which would \naffect everything that has to do with health care brought to the floor \nof the Senate under reconciliation would be to fundamentally undermine \nthe purposes of the Senate, which is to discuss, debate, and have the \nright to amend major public policy. I can't think of two things which \nwould be more significant public policy than those initiatives.\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n  Yes, if they used this system of reconciliation, they would take \nserious risks because they would be subject to something known as the \nByrd Rule on public policy, but just the concept that they would be \nthinking about this is the reflection of their willingness to ignore \nthe concept of bipartisanship which we hear so much about. If you are \ngoing to talk about reconciliation, you are talking about something \nthat has nothing to do with bipartisanship; you are talking about the \nexact opposite of bipartisanship. You are talking about running over \nthe minority, putting them in cement, and throwing them in the Chicago \nRiver. Basically, it takes the minority completely out of the process \nof having a right to have any discussion, say, or even the right to \namend something so fundamental as a piece of legislation of this \nsignificance. It also, I would note, takes anybody who disagrees, even \non the majority side, out of the discussion, anybody who disagrees with \nthe actual document brought to the floor under the reconciliation \ninstructions.\n  So using reconciliation in this manner, on this type of an issue, \nwould do fundamental harm--fundamental harm--to the institution of the \nSenate. Why even have a Senate if you are going to use reconciliation \non something this significant? You might as well just go to a \nunicameral body and be like Nebraska: just have one body. It would be \nthe House of Representatives because that would be the practical effect \nof using reconciliation. It is such a dangerous precedent to set or to \neven discuss because by discussing it, you basically devalue the \npurposes of the Senate, which is to amend and debate and have an open \nforum; one where, as Washington said, the hot coffee can be poured from \nthe teacup into the saucer. The Senate is supposed to be the saucer. It \nis supposed to be where we get an airing, and certainly on issues of \nthis size we should have it.\n  So I certainly hope we have no further discussion of the idea of \nusing reconciliation for the purposes of pursuing either a national \nsales tax on energy called the carbon tax and the policies it would \nimply for industrial policy relative to energy production in this \nNation or for the massive rewrite of health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the warnings \nissued by my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, whose service on \nthe Budget Committee has been very valuable, and I hope everyone has \ntaken careful heed of his words for what we need to do in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about something that is \nhappening at this moment and a problem we have to solve before we even \nlook at what we do in the future. Like so many others--and I assume the \noccupant of the chair and all of my colleagues have heard the same \nthing--the phones in my office in the District of Columbia and across \nthe State are ringing off the hook. Americans are outraged that their \nhard-earned taxpayer dollars are being used to pay bonuses at AIG. \nYesterday afternoon and today, there have been countless press reports \nabout these bonuses paid to some of the same people who may have been \nresponsible for putting AIG into this mess. I agree. I, too, am \noutraged. It is unacceptable to pay bonuses after the American taxpayer \nwas forced to bail out an institution without reforming it--without \nreforming it--without demanding any changes.\n  While I share Americans' fury over this latest idiocy, I am, quite \nfrankly, a little surprised to see the President and his Treasury \nSecretary so outraged by these bonuses when they had the opportunity to \nprevent them before they gave AIG the latest installment of taxpayer \ndollars. That is right, the Obama administration could have refused to \npay the remainder of the $170 million in bonuses to failed AIG \nexecutives as a condition to providing that company the additional \nmoney it sought from the Treasury. Earlier this month, the Obama \nadministration gave AIG another injection of $30 billion of taxpayer \nfunds to keep this failed institution from failing even further. There \nis a rat hole, and we have thrown $170 billion down it.\n  At the same time, Treasury Secretary Geithner should have and could \nhave ensured that taxpayer dollars wouldn't be used to pay any of these \nbonuses, but he didn't. This is another example, I regret to say, of \nthe Secretary's failed leadership. When he was President of the Federal \nReserve of New York, he had oversight responsibility over AIG, Citi, \nand other of the major failed institutions. What was done? Obviously, \nthe answer is ``not much.''\n  The outrage over the bonuses really, in some ways, kind of misses the \npoint. I believe that capping corporate pay and taking away business \nand private jets is not enough for the failed executives who got us \ninto this problem. We need to go further. The failed senior executives \nand the board of directors should have been fired, should have been \nreplaced when the Government first had to step in and rescue the \ncompany. Don't throw good money after people who are not running their \ninstitutions well.\n  I can assure my colleagues that if any worker in Missouri or any \nother State across the Nation drove their company into the ground, they \nwould have been and should have been fired. They wouldn't be receiving \na bonus. I believe this double standard for Wall Street versus Main \nStreet is another reason Americans are so mad about how their taxpayer \ndollars are being used.\n  What is particularly troubling is that AIG's intention to pay these \nbonuses had been no secret, and the administration was completely aware \nof these payments. Now that Americans are outraged about how their \ntaxpayer dollars are being spent, Secretary Geithner and President \nObama are suddenly shocked and outraged as well. The real outrage is \ntheir ad hoc and knee-jerk reaction to the crisis. The administration's \nadhocracy amounts to spending billions--that is right, billions with a \n``b''--of good taxpayer dollars on the failing banks.\n\n  What we really need, as I said last week, is to follow the words of \nthat old country music song: ``We need a little less talk and a lot \nmore action.'' We need to focus on the failing banks and others, and I \nhave laid it out. It is called the American Credit Cleanup Plan. It is \nreally very simple. It uses existing authorities for the banks, \nexisting authorities within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n  There are three main steps that need to be taken: We need to identify \nfailing institutions; we need to remove the toxic assets, protect \ndepositors, and remove the failed leadership; and then return healthy, \nclean banks or portions of those banks into the private sector and get \nthe Government out of running the businesses. Government doesn't do a \nvery good job of running private business. I hate to say it, but our \nrecord in Congress on running our own business is not something one \nwould hold up as an example of good executive management.\n  Unfortunately, we don't seem to have any executive management in the \nadministration, but we can send the FDIC in to clean up the banks and \nput the banks back into the private sector--at least in various pieces, \nwhatever is sold off, whatever the market will buy--and let the market \njudge whether these new institutions, or institutions with these new \nportions in them, are working. There ought to be discipline in the \nmarketplace. There has been no discipline.\n  I agree with Americans who don't want to see their tax dollars going \nto failed executives at AIG or any other failing institution. Our plea \nis stop throwing good tax dollars at bad banks. The zombies should not \nbe propped up without being cleaned up. We have well-established \nprinciples. We need bold action that fixes the root problems and a \nclear exit strategy in mind such as the American Credit Cleanup Plan. \nGet in, take out the bad assets, protect the depositor if it is a \nfinancial institution, clean out the boards of directors if need be, \nand put the bank or parts of it back in the marketplace.\n  It is time the President and the Treasury realize that throwing good\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nmoney after bad is not the way to solve this crisis. We saw in the late \n1980s and 1990s where prompt action cleaned up the savings and loan \ncrisis. It was actually savings and loans and banks. They went in, \ncleaned them up, sent them out, and the economy recovered.\n  Japan tried what we apparently are trying to do now. They spent a \ndecade throwing more Government money at failing institutions, and what \ndid they get? They got a decade of stagnation. There is no reason for \nthat to happen to us when we know how it is done.\n  I have talked to Bill Seidman, who ran that operation. I have talked \nwith former Chairman Greenspan and the presidents of the Federal \nReserve of Kansas City and St. Louis, and they all say the same thing: \nGet in, clean them up, get the toxic assets out, get the Government out \nof running the banks and telling them where they spend their money and \nwhere they don't. Get them out and the economy will recover because the \ncredit crisis will clear up. Until we do that, we will see more and \nmore wasted dollars.\n  I have talked with the leadership, and I hope they will bring up a \nmeasure I have cosponsored along with the chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, as well as Senator Crapo, to give a \nline of credit to the FDIC to do its vital cleanup work. They should \nexpand their powers to go after bank holding companies if they are in \nbad shape. If we can pass that, they will have an additional tool. The \nFDIC has the basic tools. There is expertise there. Let's use the \nexpertise and clean up rather than flooding these zombies with more \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              AIG Bonuses\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will speak on a letter that myself and \na number of colleagues are sending to the head of AIG, and I believe a \nfew other colleagues will be here in the next half hour to speak on the \nletter as well.\n  I rise today to express my outrage and the outrage of the American \ntaxpayers at the bonus payments the American International Group \nintends to make to the employees of its Financial Products division.\n  Yesterday, we learned that AIG is in the process of paying $165 \nmillion in bonuses to the employees of its Financial Products division \nas part of the plan that will pay them $450 million in bonuses by the \nend of 2009.\n  This is disgraceful, this is unacceptable, and it is an offense to \nmillions of hard-working Americans whose tax dollars are the only \nreason AIG continues to exist as a going concern.\n  Today, I rise to assure you, the leadership of AIG, my fellow \nAmericans, and my colleagues, that we intend to do everything in our \npower to prevent those payments from being made and to recoup the money \nthat has already been paid. As of now, eight of my colleagues and I \nhave joined in a letter to Edward Liddy, the chairman of AIG, demanding \nthat he renegotiate these contracts, and letting him know that we will \nnot stand by. If Mr. Liddy does nothing, we will act, and we will take \nthis money back and return it to its rightful owners--the American \ntaxpayers. We will take this money back by taxing virtually all of it. \nSo let the recipients of these large and unseemly bonuses be warned: If \nyou don't return it on your own, we will do it for you.\n  In the letter, joining me are the majority leader, Senator Reid; \nsecretary of the caucus, Senator Murray; Senator Klobuchar; Senator \nCarper; Senator Lincoln; Senator Menendez; Senator Johnson; and the \noccupant of the chair, Senator Begich. The number is growing, and I \nbelieve many other people will put their names on the list.\n  In the past year, we have learned much about the reckless behavior \nwithin our financial system. No firm was more reckless than AIG. What \nthey did was not only irresponsible but, from a business perspective, \nit was immoral. They took what was a very solid, well-made business \nthat sold insurance to individuals and firms around the globe and \nturned it into a gambling den that they used to enrich themselves. They \nsold credit default swaps and other derivatives to all comers as though \nthey were playing with monopoly money, but it was real money. When \ntheir deals went sour, when they actually had to pay, they had nothing \nwith which to pay anyone.\n  As Warren Buffet said, ``When the tide goes out, you see who is \nswimming without a bathing suit on.'' The leadership of this unit of \nAIG was doing just that.\n  Just this month--in fact, less than 3 weeks ago--AIG reported that in \nthe final quarter of 2008, as a firm, it lost $61.7 billion. Let me \nrepeat that. In a single quarter--in just the last 3 months of 2008 \nalone--this firm lost over $60 billion. That is by far the largest \nsingle quarterly loss in corporate history. For all of 2008, AIG lost \n$99.3 billion, nearly $100 billion. Nearly all of those losses were \ncaused by the actions of the employees of the Financial Products \ndivision. But, yesterday, we learned the firm intended to pay nearly \n$165 million in ``bonuses'' this year and a total of $450 million in \nbonuses over the next year for the employees in the very same unit--not \nonly bonuses but performance bonuses--a performance bonus for a firm \nthat lost $100 billion.\n  I will repeat that. This is a performance bonus for a firm that lost \n$100 billion. If anything defines ``Alice in Wonderland'' business \npractices, this is it. It boggles the mind.\n  In the past 6 months alone, the American taxpayers have been forced \nto commit over $170 billion to AIG. If the Government had not stepped \nin, if it had not repeatedly acted to fill the hole in the financial \nsystem created by this firm and these employees' behavior, AIG would \nhave been bankrupt. All these employees would have received nothing--\nzero.\n  We keep hearing that AIG is contractually bound to pay these bonuses; \nthat if they don't, these supposedly talented people--those whose \ntalent created this disaster--will leave. Here is what I would like to \nknow from Mr. Liddy: Did he even attempt to renegotiate these \ncontracts? Did he approach these individuals and point out to them the \nhealth of AIG and the condition of the United States and global \neconomies and their own culpability in creating this mess? Did they \nrespond by saying: I don't care, I want my bonus? Is that what Mr. \nLiddy is suggesting?\n  Well, Mr. Liddy, I urge you to fix this mess because, let me tell you \nsomething: We are all fed up. If you don't fix it, we will.\n  Here is what we are doing: My colleagues and I are sending a letter \nto Mr. Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell these \nemployees who are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily \nreturn them because, if they don't, we plan to tax virtually all of it. \nHe should tell these employees if they don't give the money back, we \nwill put into place a new law that will allow us to tax these bonuses \nat a high rate so it is returned to its rightful owners--the taxpayers.\n  For those of you getting these bonuses, be forewarned: You will not \nbe getting to keep them.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, in the past few days, we have learned \nthat the American International Group--known as AIG--has awarded $165 \nmillion in bonuses to its high-end employees--the employees of its \nFinancial Products group. These are people responsible for the fancy \nwheeling and dealing that nearly destroyed the company and wreaked \nhavoc on our entire financial system.\n  The American public is outraged by the arrogance and the abuse of \ntaxpayer funds, and so am I. I was just in my State, where there are \npeople barely holding onto their homes, people who have had their hours \ncut, and who are just one step away from their home going into \nforeclosure or from losing their car, and now we learn this today.\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n  Last year, under desperate but necessary circumstances, the U.S. \nGovernment had to rescue AIG from total collapse. This was done not to \nrescue the company itself but to rescue our financial system. AIG would \nnot even continue to exist today except for the infusion of $170 \nbillion in taxpayer funds. The American people now own essentially 80 \npercent of the company, and AIG is supposed to be doing everything \npossible to right itself. Well, they haven't.\n  There is no rational way to justify these bonuses to people who have \ncaused untold damage to our economy. This is not pay for performance, \nit is pay for failure, which makes no sense at all. Why should they get \nthe golden parachutes when their company and our financial system have \nbeen crashing to the ground? The bonuses these individuals are \nreceiving for their failure is more than most Americans make in a \nlifetime. The American people simply should not be in the position of \nrewarding the failure of high-flying Wall Street bankers who brought \ntheir company and our economy crashing down.\n  That is why I have joined today with Senator Schumer and other \ncolleagues in writing to Edward Liddy, the chairman and CEO of AIG. We \nare telling him if these bonus contracts are not renegotiated \nimmediately, we will offer legislation that will have the effect of \nmaking American taxpayers whole. AIG needs to step up and do the right \nthing. But if AIG doesn't take action on its own to correct this \noutrage, we stand ready to take the difficult but necessary step of \nenacting legislation that would allow the Government to recoup these \nbonus payments through the Tax Code.\n  If we are forced to do this, we will impose a steep tax, possibly as \nhigh as 91 percent, that would, in effect, recover nearly all the bonus \nmoney. Now, I am like most Americans; I don't like to see taxes raised. \nBut in this instance, I think all of us can make an exception. If they \nrefuse to do the right thing, then it is only fair to impose this kind \nof tax against the people who have done such great harm to our \nfinancial system. They can't walk away with millions of dollars.\n  They may be laughing all the way to the bank right now, but if AIG \ncan't or won't fix this problem, these people will soon be crying all \nthe way to the tax office. These people seem to think they can operate \nwith a height of arrogance and irresponsibility. This is not just a \nbusiness outrage, it is a moral outrage.\n  I am also concerned that in addition to the bonuses already handed \nout, AIG has plans to spend an additional $450 million in bonuses over \nthe next 2 years. Based on what we know now, can we trust that these \nbonus payments go to the people who deserve it--the people who fix the \nproblems rather than people who just make the problems?\n  AIG is set to go into the history books as a company that symbolizes \nthe type of greed and recklessness that has weakened our economy. Where \nI come from, we reward those who work hard and play by the rules and we \ntake responsibility when we screw up. I believe the administration and \nCongress should do everything in their power to block these payments \nand demand accountability.\n  Now, we know this is also an insult to the many good, strong, healthy \nfinancial institutions across this country--the small banks such as \nthose we have in Minnesota; healthy financial institutions that didn't \nengage in these high-flying dealings that shouldn't be punished. Their \nstockholders shouldn't be punished because of what companies such as \nAIG did.\n  As a prosecutor for 8 years, I dealt with criminals all the time. I \nhave to say the white-collar crooks were often the worst to deal with \nbecause they claimed their crimes were an honest mistake and that there \nweren't any victims. As far as I am concerned, it didn't matter if \nsomeone stole with a crowbar or a computer or that they committed their \ncrimes in a nice office or out on the streets, they need to be held \naccountable under the law.\n  Time will tell, and the Justice Department and other prosecutors and \npolice will sort this financial wreck out to see when and where crimes \nwere committed, but it is clear that what we need is accountability. If \nAIG's leadership won't demand it, we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to join some of my colleagues to \nexpress our deep frustration with the financial institutions that have \nmade the very poor decision of handing out multimillion dollar bonuses \nat taxpayers' expense--AIG being the latest in the line of continuing \nirresponsible behavior coming from Wall Street.\n  I have hard-working families--and there are hard-working families all \nacross this great Nation--who are saying: Enough is enough.\n  This is not the kind of behavior Americans should be accepting at \nthis time. It is completely irresponsible. Times are tough and people \nare sacrificing. People all across this country are sacrificing. Many \nemployees in my State are seeing their hours cut or they are finding \nthemselves out of work altogether. How are they caring for their \nfamilies? They are working hard to look for that next job to put dinner \non the table or to get their kids to school or making sure they can \nkeep their families together.\n  I have talked to recent retirees who have been devastated because the \nnest egg they have been saving all these years has been slashed by 40 \nor 50 percent in just a matter of months. Now they are having to \ndramatically downsize their quality of life or go back to work, if they \ncan even find work. I met a gentleman this weekend who is beginning to \nhave college-age kids. He spent his entire life working to save for \nthose college funds only to find that in these last several months they \ntoo have been slashed in half.\n  These people are realizing the impact of what is happening not only \nin our country but globally. They are standing up as Americans. They \nare willing to make sacrifices. They are working hard to keep body and \nsoul together. But it is absolutely, unequivocally totally unacceptable \nfor failed financial institutions that have received taxpayer \nassistance to be rewarding their employees with bonus payments at this \ntime. It is outrageous and it will not be allowed.\n  We are the stewards of the taxpayers in our States and of the dollars \nwe have provided in good faith as an investment in these companies to \ntry to make sure they, too, can make ends meet. But this isn't making \nends meet--handing out tremendous bonuses to just a select few. It is \nabsolutely irresponsible.\n  During the debate of the recovery package, Senator Wyden and Senator \nSnowe and myself offered an amendment that put an excise tax on bonuses \nand financial institutions that had received TARP dollars. We did so \nbecause we feared this very thing would continue to happen. \nUnfortunately, our proposal was taken out of the package in the \nconference. So I am pleased to hear many of my colleagues who are now \nin agreement that something must be done to correct this travesty.\n  Make no mistake, if these companies handing out multimillion dollar \nbonuses do not rectify the situation, do not change their ways, we \nstand ready to work to enact legislation that recoups these tax dollars \nand these taxpayers' funds. Our taxpayers have worked hard and they are \nsuffering as much as anybody else. But we do not need to see these \nmajor corporations and financial institutions that are handing out \nthese unbelievable enhanced bonuses at a time when we should all be \npulling together, pulling together to make our economy strong, to set \nit back on track and to make sure we can embrace and continue the kind \nof quality of life that all Americans need to be able to realize.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3134-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Newspaper Industry\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have a lot of interesting landmarks in \nmy home State of Washington, especially in Seattle. But one of my \nfavorites has always been the globe that sits on top of the Seattle \nPost Intelligencer's building on Elliott Bay. The words, ``It's in the \nP.I.'' wrap around that globe, and it is more than just another quirky \npart of our skyline. It has symbolized the importance of the paper to \ngenerations of readers.\n  For 146 years, the Seattle P.I., as everyone in Seattle calls it, has \ninformed, investigated, enlightened, entertained, and, yes, sometimes \nirritated the people of our community. The P.I. staff has put \npoliticians, businesspeople and bureaucrats to the test, and their work \nhas distinguished the paper and won them well-deserved awards--from our \ncartoonist David Horsey's Pulitzers to a long list of prizes for public \nservice journalism.\n  But, today the P.I. published its last print edition. Its owner, the \nHearst media chain, put it up for sale and hasn't been able to find a \nbuyer.\n  Hearst has said it will replace the paper with a smaller online \nedition, but it won't be the same.\n  We have been lucky to live in a two-newspaper town. Two-newspaper \ncommunities used to be common, but they are rare these days.\n  In Seattle, the Times and the P.I. had a Joint Operating Agreement \nfor 26 years, but they were always rivals when it came to breaking \nnews.\n  Competition made both papers dig a little deeper and push a little \nharder. That competition meant everyone from corporate leaders to \nschool officials to sports team owners were held to a higher standard.\n  Our community is a better place as a result.\n  Unfortunately, the P.I. is not the first major paper in our country \nto stop publishing this year. Last month, Denver's Rocky Mountain News \nclosed its doors. And the P.I. may not be the last to close either.\n  The reality is that newspapers have been struggling and cutting back \nfor several years now. Many of the major papers across the country are \nworried about whether they will make it through the economic downturn.\n  Like so many other companies, they are victims of the recession and a \nchanging business environment.\n  The depth of the problem hit home for me earlier this year when I \nvisited the press in Olympia, our State's capital city.\n  In 2001, there were 31 reporters, editors, and columnists covering \nthe state house there. Now there are nine--nine.\n  We have all noticed the shrinking press corps here in Washington, DC, \ntoo.\n  Not too many years ago, we had more than a dozen reporters here \ncovering the Washington State delegation. We have seen that number \nshrink to just a couple in the last year.\n  This is really troubling to me because at the end of the day, \nnewspapers aren't just another business. And if more close--and there \nis nothing to replace them--our democracy will be weaker as a result.\n  For generations, newspaper reporters have been the ones who have done \nthe digging, sat through the meetings, and broken the hard stories.\n  A newspaper broke the Watergate scandal--and the story about horrible \nconditions at Walter Reed Medical Center.\n  Newspapers have exposed graft and corruption at every level of \ngovernment. They have uncovered environmental threats posed by strip \nmining, hog farming, and contaminated waterways.\n  They have used the power of the press to expose injustice, prejudice, \nand mistreatment of people who don't have the power to speak up for \nthemselves.\n  And most importantly, newspaper stories have led to real change.\n  In my community, the P.I.'s reports on asbestos led me to introduce \nmy legislation to ban it and the P.I.'s investigation on the shortage \nof FBI agents in the Pacific Northwest has led to my work to increase \nthe number of agents in Washington State.\n  We need reporters to root out corruption, shine a light on the \noperations of government, and tell the people what is really going on \nin our communities.\n  We need them to go to school board meetings, cover local elections, \nand attend congressional hearings.\n  And, yes, we need them to push for information, to investigate, to \nrequest public records--and to fight when the government stands in the \nway.\n  We are still working out what role the Internet will play in the \nFourth Estate--and what role TV and radio have in the new media \nenvironment.\n  There has been a lot of talk recently about whether online \npublications can--or will--adequately replace the paper editions.\n  While there is something comfortable about the fact that we can pick \nup a paper, spread it out on the kitchen table, and cut out articles to \nstick on the fridge, what's most important to me is that if the media \nenvironment is really changing, someone will be there to step in and do \nthe work newspapers do for our communities now.\n  I really hope what we are seeing is just an evolution in the news \nbusiness.\n  I hope that when it all shakes out, the media will end up as strong \nas ever. I am going to miss the Seattle P.I., and I know all of Seattle \nand the Pacific Northwest will as well.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n614 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                       2010 Budget Tax Increases\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is St. Patrick's Day. St. Patrick, \nthe patron saint of Ireland, is revered by Irish and non-Irish alike, \nfor many things. Among the many legends is one regarding snakes. St. \nPatrick drove snakes off the Emerald Isle. In looking at the \nPresident's budget, you could see that we might need St. Patrick to \ncome back and drive all the extra taxes out of the budget. Certainly, \nlike the snakes in Ireland, all of these new taxes, if left unchecked, \ncould bite a lot of hard-working American taxpayers.\n\n  Nineteen days ago, President Obama sent his first budget up to \nCapitol Hill. The deficits and debt proposed in that budget are eye-\npopping. President Obama is correct when he says that he inherited a \nrecord budget deficit of $1.2 trillion. I have a chart here that shows \nthe pattern of the Federal debt.\n  But, from the statements from the congressional Democratic \nleadership, you would think they just got the levers of power this \nJanuary. You would think they had no role in creating that deficit \nPresident Obama inherited. In fact, congressional Democrats and the \nlast Republican administration agreed on the fiscal policy in the last \nCongress. The congressional Democratic leadership, together with the \nGeorge W. Bush administration, wrote the stimulus bills, housing bills, \nand the financial bailout. The congressional Democratic leadership \nwrote the budgets and spending bills in 2007 and 2008. So let's be \nclear. President Obama inherited the deficit and debt, but the \ninheritance had bipartisan origins--the Democratic Congress and the \nlast Republican administration. What's more, the budget the President \nsent up would make this extraordinary level of debt an ordinary level \nof debt. What is now an extraordinary burden on our children and \ngrandchildren would become an ordinary burden.\n  In the last year of the budget, debt held by the public would be two-\nthirds, 67 percent of our gross domestic product.\n  The President's budget does contain some common ground. Whenever \nPresident Obama wants to pursue tax relief, he will find no better ally \nthan we Republicans. Likewise, if President Obama wants to embrace \nfiscal responsibility and reduce the deficit by cutting wasteful \nspending, Republicans on Capitol Hill will back him vigorously. From \nour perspective, good fiscal policy keeps the tax burden low on \nAmerican families, workers, and small businesses and keeps wasteful \nspending in check. For the hard-working American taxpayer, there is \nsome good news in the budget. President Obama's budget proposes to make \npermanent the lion's share of the bipartisan tax relief plans\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nthat are set to expire in less than 2 years. Republicans have been \ntrying to make this bipartisan tax relief permanent since it was first \npassed.\n  It will mean families can count on marriage penalty relief and a \ndoubled child tax credit. It means workers will be able to count on \nlower marginal tax rates. It means low-income seniors, who rely on \ncapital gains and dividend income, will be able to rely on low rates of \ntaxation as they draw on their savings. It means middle-income families \nwill be able to count on relief from the alternative minimum tax, AMT. \nPresident Obama will find many Republican allies in his efforts to make \nthese tax relief policies permanent.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama's budget also contains bad news for \nthe American taxpayer. For every American who puts gas in a car, heats \nor cools a home, uses electricity to cook a meal, turn on the lights, \nor power a computer, there is a new energy tax for you in this budget. \nThis tax could exceed a trillion dollars. The budget also raises taxes \non those making over $250,000. That sounds like a lot of money to most \nAmericans. But, we are not just talking about the idle rich.\n  We are not talking about coupon clippers on Park Avenue. We are not \ntalking about the high-paid, high-corporate-jet-flying, well-paid hedge \nfund managers in Chicago, San Francisco, or other high-income liberal \nmeccas. Many of the Americans targeted for a hefty tax hike are \nsuccessful small business owners. And unlike the financial engineers of \nthe flush liberal meccas of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, a lot \nof these small businesses add value beyond shuffling paper.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that small businesses are the main \ndrivers of our dynamic economy. Small businesses create 74 percent of \nall new private sector jobs, according to the latest statistics. My \nPresident, President Obama, used a similar figure of 70 percent \nyesterday. Both sides agree that we ought not hurt the key job \nproducers, small business. President Obama also mentioned his zero \ncapital gains proposal for small business start-ups. Republicans agree \nwith him on that.\n  We are still scratching our heads on why the Democratic leadership \ndoesn't agree with the President on that small business-friendly \nproposal. So if we all agree that small business is the key to creating \nnew jobs, why does the Democratic leadership and the President's budget \npropose a new tax increase directed at the American small businesses \nmost likely to create new jobs?\n  How do I come to that conclusion? Here's how. According to a recent \nGallup survey, about half of the small business owners employing over \n20 workers would pay higher taxes under the President's budget. I have \na chart that shows that nearly 1 million small businesses will be hit \nby this tax increase. Here is another chart that shows that roughly \nhalf the firms that employ two-thirds of small business workers, those \nwith 20 or more workers, are hit by the tax rate hikes in the \nPresident's budget.\n  According to Treasury Department data, these small businesses, \naccount for nearly 70 percent of small business income. In addition, \nthe budget would reduce itemized deductions for donations to charity, \nhome mortgage interest, and State and local taxes. Combating tax \nshelters and closing corporate loopholes can be good tax policy, but \nhigher general business taxes during a recession doesn't make much \nsense.\n  If these higher taxes were dedicated to reducing the deficit, the \nDemocratic leadership could argue this was their version of fiscal \nresponsibility. We Republicans would disagree with this approach, but \nat least we would agree with the goal. But, a close examination of the \nbudget reveals higher taxes and higher spending. So, from an overall \nstandpoint, deficits will remain as far as the eye can see. Drawing on \nour principles, Republicans will work with President Obama on making \npermanent tax relief for families.\n  We, however, will oppose tax increases that harm America's small \nbusinesses. We Republicans also will scrutinize and question a broad-\nbased energy tax that cuts jobs and could, according to MIT, cost \nconsumers and businesses trillions. In these troubled economic times, \nwe ought to err on the side of keeping both taxes and spending low and \nreduce the deficits. That will be a necessary condition to returning \nour economy back to growth and providing more opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the pending bill. I \nunderstand we will have a unanimous consent agreement that the majority \nleader and I have worked out on the omnibus lands package. Having spent \n10 years in a legislative body, I understand how things work, and I \nknow we have a bill that is a compilation of 150-plus other bills that \nis so peppered with individual parochial interests that the hopes of \ndefeating the bill are somewhat diminished. However, I would be remiss \nin the oath I took to the Constitution to not try to inform my \ncolleagues in the Senate as well as--and more importantly--the people \nof this country what is coming about with this bill.\n\n  Yesterday, one of my constituents sent me a news article described as \nthe following: ``Natural Gas Rig Shutting Means Prices May Double.'' \nNatural gas right now is under $4 a million British thermal units. It \nwas as high as $13 in the height of what I would say was the \nmanipulation of the commodity market but also in the height of the \nexpansion we saw in economies around the world.\n  Why is that important to the American public? When people look for \nnatural resources, they look for natural resources--to find them--so \nthey can sell them at a profit. Natural gas exploration in the \ncontinental United States--not offshore--is fraught with great \ndifficulties in terms of finding great supplies. However, what we do \nknow in terms of the law of economics is: If you cut exploration in \nnatural gas by 45 percent--and that is just through February of this \nyear versus July of last year--what is going to happen? What is going \nto happen to natural gas prices? Well, they are going to rise and they \nare going to rise significantly and, most probably, they are going to \napproach $10 a year from now.\n  Is it a great policy we are going to pass a bill that is going to \nmake it harder to find additional natural gas resources in this \ncountry, that shuts off 13 trillion cubic feet of known reserves right \nnow? That is enough to supply our country for 2 years. Is it smart for \nus to pass a lands package that is going to take 2.8 million acres and \nsay: You cannot ever touch it for energy, regardless if natural gas is \n$45 a million Btu's, you cannot touch it?\n  But at the same time, if our demand rises, what are we going to do? \nWe are going to import it. So we are doing two things highly negative \nin the long run that will have major effects on the average American \nfamily. One is, we are going to limit the ability to go find it; and, \nNo. 2, we are going to continue to fund imports with our dollars to \nburn the same natural gas we could have developed here.\n  The same thing could be said for oil. We all remember oil at $140 a \nbarrel. We pretty well like that gasoline--in my hometown, I filled up \nwith regular unleaded gasoline for $1.64 a gallon this weekend versus \nthe highest it got in Oklahoma, I think, was $3.90 a gallon. We like \nthat. But we are getting ready to pass a bill that says the likelihood \nof us going back to that era of demand--supply inequality--will be \nincreased and that to pay for that will be a tax on every American \nfamily's budget. It is a pretty tough tax if you are commuting or if \nyou are heating your home with natural gas our if you are buying \nheating oil. Many of our families in the Northeast and upper Midwest \nbought their heating oil at the peak of prices.\n  So the opposition to this bill, from my standpoint, comes from a lot \nof areas, and I am going to spend some time outlining that today. But I \nwant to be a predictor of what is going to happen. What is going to \nhappen is energy prices are going to rise. If you are the greenest of \ngreen and think we can provide all our energy from renewables,\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\ngreat. But what you cannot deny is the fact that it is going to take us \n20 years to get there. What this bill is going to do is markedly hamper \nour ability to supply needed energy products for American families. It \nis not just oil and gas.\n  Ninety percent of the known geothermal and absolutely clean, safe, \nenvironmentally friendly way to produce steam and power a turbine to \nproduce electricity is taken off in this bill--90 percent of the known \ngeothermal reserves. So when we say we want to use renewables and we \nwant to get away from a carbon-based source, there are some things we \nhave to do. One is to recognize how long it is going to take us and \nmake sure we do not have a disruption in our supplies; No. 2, markedly \nincrease the supplies we need in the meantime; and, No. 3, not \nhamstring our ability to use completely renewable sources from sources \nwe know are available to us right now.\n  There have been a lot of claims this bill is not controversial. Well, \ncoming from an energy-producing State, it is controversial as all get \nout for Oklahoma. When we say we are going to shut off large portions \nof this country forever to future energy exploration, it does not just \nimpact--Oklahomans have cheap energy. We are the least impacted by it. \nWhat the American citizens ought to be asking is: What did we get \nindividually that can put 150 bills together that will make your \nRepresentative in Congress vote for something that in the long term is \ndamaging to our energy independence and will keep us more dependent on \npeople who are supplying energy who do not necessarily believe in \nfreedom, do not necessarily like our way of life, and do not \nnecessarily believe we ought to have the standard of living we have?\n  This bill has 1,248 pages--1,248 pages. There is a total of 170 \nunique, different bills. This bill, also, is going to cost the American \ntaxpayer--our kids--$10 billion, and it has $900 million of mandatory \nspending that is going to be spent no matter what anybody in Congress \nsays. So we are going to add another $11 billion to our spending. It is \nopposed by over 200 different groups. Whether it is property rights \ngroups, the Chamber of Commerce, energy-producing groups, recreation \ninterests across the country, they are uniform in their opposition to \nthis bill.\n  It is not necessarily just in their own self-interests they are in \nopposition to it. They know what is coming. They are not thinking short \nterm. They are not thinking about how I look good at home. They are \nthinking about what is in the best long-term interests of our Nation.\n  One hundred of these bills have no effect on us as individual \nAmericans. They will not have an effect on energy. They will not have \nan effect on property rights. There probably is no problem with them. \nBut 70 of these bills will markedly impact every American.\n  When this bill went through the House on suspension--and it is \nimportant you know what ``suspension'' means: You get a vote on it, but \nyou do not get any opportunity to amend it--it did not pass the \nrequirement to pass the House without amendment.\n  This bill has been smoldering here for 2 years. I wish it would \nsmolder a whole lot longer. I will have to admit that. This is the \nfirst time in 2 years we are going to be able to offer an amendment to \nchange this bill. It is going to be a limited set of amendments: six \namendments on 1,248 pages of legislation, on $11 billion worth of \nspending, but, more importantly, on a significant decline in the \nAmerican people's standard of living because energy costs are going to \nrise. They are going to rise anyway, but they are going to rise \ndramatically because of what we are going to do in this bill.\n  It is a massive collection of unique provisions, some quite \ncontroversial. There is actually a section of wilderness area in one \nCongressman's district that nobody from his district wants and neither \ndid he, but it got put in the bill, and he has no ability to amend the \nbill. So we are going to take a section out of one of our States and \nput it in a wilderness area, where the citizens do not want that to \nhappen and the Congressman does not have the ability to try to stop it. \nThat is what happens when you start playing games in trading things in \nCongress to pass a bill that cannot pass any other way except for \nbuying off votes with something that looks good at home.\n  It creates 10 new National Heritage Areas. It creates three new units \nof the National Park Service. We have a $9 billion backlog in just \nkeeping the buildings maintained in our national parks right now, and \nwe are going to add three new parks--at a time when we are going to \nhave an over $2 trillion deficit. We are going to have a deficit that \nwill add $7,000 per man, woman, and child, $28,000 per family this year \nalone--this year alone.\n  It creates 14 new studies to expand or create more national parks. It \ncreates 80 new wilderness designations or expansions. It takes 2.2 \nmillion acres of direct Federal land and says: You can never touch \nthis, regardless of how much oil is there, how much natural gas is \nthere, how much geothermal is there. You can never touch it. No matter \nwhat our need is, we will never be able to access it.\n\n  How stupid are we when we are going to tell the rest of the world's \nsuppliers of oil we are going to limit our ability to influence their \npricing to us?\n  It creates 92 wild and scenic river designations--that is more than \nwe have total wild and scenic rivers now--1,100 miles of shoreline. It \nis going to kill an LNG, liquefied natural gas, port in Massachusetts \nthat is not a scenic river at all because we are so green we do not \nwant to use natural gas, one of the cleanest carbon-based fuels we \nhave, and we are going to eliminate the ability for people in the \nNortheast to have cheap natural gas. But we are going to do it.\n  It creates six new National Trails. I will tell you, the trails it \ncreates have eminent domain. Even though this bill says they are not \ngoing to use it, the bureaucrats are still going to have the ability to \ntake private property from individuals without their consent.\n  The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act will prohibit any gas transmission \nlines, any electrical lines, any utility lines, that may be in our \nNation's best interest, to either pump oil from Canada or natural gas. \nYou cannot go near the river, so you cannot cross the river. So what we \nare going to do is, not only are we going to raise the cost, we are \ngoing to increase the cost of getting it here because we are going to \nhave to go circuitous routes to bring energy to people in this country.\n  It includes 19 specific instances where Federal lands are \npermanently--permanently--withdrawn from future mineral and geothermal \nleasing. Three million acres are impacted by this permanent withdrawal. \nIn the Wyoming Range that is in this bill, according to the National \nPetroleum Council, 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is proven and \nsitting there right now--and that is enough to run our country for \nalmost 3 years--300 million barrels of oil. That is the most up-to-date \nstudy by the BLM. Each of the 19 withdrawal provisions of the 3 million \nacres also excludes future geothermal leasing. Studies performed by the \nBureau of Land Management confirm geopotential on many of the \ndesignations in this bill. In other words, it has been studied. I will \nhave a chart later to show that. We know where the geothermal sources \nare in this country--clean energy, cheap, abundant--yet we are going to \ntake it away. We are going to say we are not going to use it.\n\n  The threats posed by this bill to American energy independence have \ngrown since the last time we considered this bill. Secretary Salazar \nhas withdrawn 77 major leases in Utah. He has withdrawn eight--and \nthese are leases that are already completed, signed, and paid for--\nenergy leases in Wyoming, outside of this bill. He has delayed any \nincrease in offshore drilling because it ``needs more study.'' We do it \nwith perfection in the Gulf of Mexico. The vast quantity of our oil \nthat we produce domestically comes from there. He has delayed the \ndevelopment of oil shale because it needs more testing, except all the \nprototype plants have been highly effective in how they have utilized \nit.\n  The bill is another direct challenge from Congress to President \nObama's pledge to clean up the earmark process. There are multiple \nearmarks in this bill for things that none of us would be proud of and \nnone of us would say would meet with any common sense, especially in \nlight of the fiscal and monetary difficulties in which we find \nourselves.\n  There is $1 billion for a water project in California to repopulate \n500 salmon. There is $5 million for a wolf compensation and prevention \nprogram for\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\nwolves that we reintroduced in the wild that are now killing cattle. So \nwe are reintroducing wolves, and then we are going to pay the ranchers \nfor the cows the wolves killed.\n  There is $3.5 million to celebrate the 450th anniversary of St. \nAugustine in 2015. Do we really think right now we ought to spend $3.5 \nmillion to plan a birthday party in 2015 when we are stealing every \npenny we are going to spend this year--in the remaining portion of this \nyear--from our kids and our grandkids? Is that really something we want \nto do?\n  We are going to spend a quarter of a million dollars to study whether \nAlexander Hamilton's boyhood estate in St. Croix, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, is suitable as a new national park. Well, let's do it after we \nget out of the mess we are in; let's don't do it now. Let's not spend a \nquarter of a million dollars. What would a quarter of a million dollars \ndo? It would buy at least 20 families health insurance for a year, 20 \nfamilies who don't have it. It would supply lots of small businesses \nwith the working capital they require to keep going and keep their \nemployees on board instead of laying them off.\n  This bill gives $5 million for the National Tropical Botanical Garden \nto operate and maintain new gardens in Hawaii and Florida. Is that \nreally a priority for us right now? Is that something--if we were a \nfamily, would we be making those kinds of decisions? It gives us a new \nocean exploration program which has as its No. 1 job to locate, find, \nand document historic shipwrecks. It may be a good idea in a time of \nplenty, but in a time of hurt it is a terrible idea.\n  There is $12 million for the Smithsonian to build a new greenhouse \nfor a national orchid collection. Is that something we should do now? A \nfull waiver for the Cave Institute in New Mexico to be fully funded by \nthe American taxpayers rather than by the State of New Mexico. It just \nhappens to be one of those little things snuck into the bill.\n  What about property rights? There is little transparency. It is \nestimated the Federal Government now owns 653 million acres, 1 out of 3 \nacres in the United States, and 1 out of 2 acres in the Western United \nStates. The 10 national heritage areas--what does that mean? The Park \nService funds advisory committees in these heritage areas which means \nthey have an advantage over the local residents because they have \nmoney. So they come in and pass requirements and code changes that \nimpact private property rights in all of these areas.\n  So if you are in the heritage area or if you are abutting it, you now \nhave the Federal Government funding a group that may be counter to your \nown private property rights. Eighty wilderness areas and another 2.2 \nmillion acres. Recent court decisions have now said being in the \nwilderness area isn't enough. If you are close to it, you can't have \nyour rights; we will decide what you do with your land.\n  Ninety-two national scenic rivers--again, eminent domain--anything \ntouching it or anything they want to have touch it, they have eminent \ndomain to take private property, and we are creating 92 of those. So if \nyou live along one of those rivers, you should worry about whether you \nare going to have the freedom to do with your property as you want, \nwhether you are on the river or not. You just have to be in proximity.\n  Six national trail designations. The underlying National Trails Act \ngrants land acquisition and eminent domain authority. So if they want \nto put a national trail through your backyard, they can come and take \nyour home. Do we really want to give that kind of capability, and is \nnow the time to do it?\n  Here is a quote from the National Property Rights Advocates:\n\n       This bill is a serious threat to all property owners in \n     this country. Over the past several decades there has been a \n     proliferation of programs dedicated to the preservation of \n     land that has extended the grasp of the Federal Government \n     and its influence over private property rights.\n\n  Amen.\n\n       As a result of this legislation, landowners will see their \n     property value diminish due to increased land use regulations \n     and outdoor recreation enthusiasts will find new restrictions \n     on both public and private land.\n\n  So you can have private land where you allow people to horseback \nride, but if you are next to one of these areas and they are not \nallowed in that area, you are not going to be allowed. So you may \nactually even lose income because you no longer have that as a \ncapability of your property.\n  The experts go on and say:\n\n       This legislation should never arbitrarily attempt to seize \n     land from the public and restrict its use as this package \n     will.\n\n  The problem is, there is no priority in this bill--there is no \npriority for energy independence or less dependence. There is no \npriority to protect rights that are guaranteed under the Constitution.\n  Let's think for a minute about what we have tasked the American \nagencies with. The National Park Service, here is what they are \nresponsible for: 84 million acres of land in the National Park Service, \n391 different units; 54 national wilderness areas which include 44 \nmillion acres; 15 wild and scenic rivers, and we are getting ready to \nadd 92 to that; 40 national heritage areas, and we are getting ready to \nadd 12; 28 national memorials, 4 national parkways, 120 national \nhistoric parks, 20 national preserves and reserves, 24 national \nbattlefields, 18 national recreation areas, 74 national monument areas, \n10 national seashores, 4 national lake shores, 3,565 miles of national \nscenic trails, 12,250 miles of unpaved trails, 46 miles of Canadian \nborder, 285 miles of Mexican border to patrol and manage, 27,000 \nhistoric structures--27,000 historic structures that are falling down--\n26,830 camp sites, 7,580 administrative and public use buildings, 8,505 \nmonuments and statues, 1,804 bridges and tunnels, 505 dams, 8,500 miles \nof road that they have to maintain yearly, 680 waste water treatment \nsystems, and 272 million visits annually.\n  The National Park Service has a $9.6 billion maintenance backlog, so \nsevere that the backlog grew $400 million since the time we first \npassed this bill and its coming back to us. The backlog has grown by \n$400 million, which includes some of our treasures--the USS Arizona \nMemorial, where 1,117 American sailors were killed--and faces a backlog \nof $33.4 million. It is not getting fixed; Gettysburg National \nBattlefield, 51,000 casualties in 3 days, $29 million backlog; the \nGrand Canyon National Park, $299 million backlog; the Statue of Liberty \nPark, $197 million backlog; The National Mall in Washington, DC--The \nMall that is just west of here--$700 million backlog. There is even \nmiscellaneous and supposedly noncontroversial provisions in the bill \nthat could pose a threat to American families. It is not intended; it \nis just that it is a consequence.\n\n  In this bill is a little provision that if you are on Federal lands \nand you happen to pick up a rock--not intentionally to steal a fossil, \nbut if it is a fossil, 5 years in jail, and they can confiscate your \nautomobile, plus a fine. One of the amendments we have tries to fix \nthat. We don't have a big problem with fossils being stolen, but we are \ngoing to fix a problem that isn't great by this amendment, by this \nbill, and we need to clean it up.\n  There is a provision to codify an existing agency program at the \nBureau of Land Management which will, in fact, consolidate power over \n38 million acres of land onto a few anti-energy, anti-recreational \nbureaucrats. This jurisdiction will extend the wilderness study areas \nlands, many of which have been deemed already nonsuitable for \nwilderness.\n  I am going to make a point later in the presentation just to show my \ncolleagues--as a matter of fact, I will make it right now. One of the \nthings the law requires is that we, in fact, do studies on the \napplicability of lands for wilderness area. My staff just had time to \ngo through California, Oregon, and Washington. By law, it is mandated \nthere has to be a study to see if it is suitable. I am going to read \nthrough some of these.\n  Granite Mountain, CA. It is not suitable for wilderness \nrecommendation because resource conflicts in the WSA include modern to \nhigh geothermal resource potential. It should never get a wilderness \ndesignation. We are going to designate it a wilderness area.\n  Spring Basin, oil and gas, moderate potential for occurrence based on \nseveral factors. Soda Mountain wilderness study area, California; \nagain, the entire wilderness is considered to have a moderate potential \nfor the occurrence of oil and gas. So we know in many of\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nthese areas there is tremendous energy potential for us, and we are \ngoing to shut it off forever.\n  Sabinoso wilderness study area, oil and gas; Pinto Mountain, CA, zero \nacres--this is by the Bureau of Land Management--zero acres were deemed \nsuitable for wilderness. Yet we are going to put that area in a \nwilderness classification. Beauty Mountain, CA, no wilderness is \nrecommended for this wilderness study area. The wilderness values for \nmost of the area are not outstanding at all and commonplace.\n  Little Jackson, Big Jackson, wilderness study area, Idaho, natural \ngas pipeline between it and a supposed source of minerals; Bruno River \nwilderness study area, geothermal resources are found at the northern \nand southern ends of it. The solitude of this area is frequently \ndisrupted by flying military aircraft utilizing the U.S. Air Force \nbombing range just east of the wilderness study area.\n  I can go through Oregon, Idaho, Washington--and we will go through \nthe rest of them before this debate is over--but the fact is, we are \nnot even paying attention to what the law says. When we have a study \nthat says we shouldn't be, we are putting them in wilderness areas \nanyway.\n  One of the things I would like to do is commend to my colleagues \nhighlights of GAO-09-425T, a study released March 3, 2009, on the \nDepartment of the Interior by the GAO. I would bet my colleagues a \nnickel against a penny, or any multiple of that, that less than one \nperson in the Senate besides myself has read this report because you \ncan't read this report and come out and vote on this bill. This is the \nGovernment Accountability Office. What they say is, the Department of \nthe Interior is essentially poorly run, poorly managed, and the safety \nand welfare of our people who are on BLM lands and in the national \nparks is at risk because of the poor management and the lack of \noversight that has been carried out by Congress. It is the very same \ncommittee that brings us this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I also commend to my colleagues the testimony of Mary \nKendall, the acting inspector general for the Department of the \nInterior, her statement before the U.S. House of Representatives \nCommittee on Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies. When you read it, it will scare you to death. \nHere is what the internal inspector general is saying, and it mirrors \nwhat the GAO is saying. Yet this has received zero consideration from \nthe authors of this bill; otherwise, we would see an opportunity to fix \nthe problems that are outlined in these two documents in this bill. \nThere has been no consideration to fix the problems and no significant \noversight.\n  What does it find? At no point during their testimony did they agree \nthat it was a good idea to add any additional responsibilities to the \nDepartment of the Interior, based on what has been found: We find \nourselves in the biggest mess in terms of maintenance. There is \nactually a public safety and health issue for people who are visiting \nour parks highlighted throughout both of these reports. There is no \nattempt to fix that, no attempt to authorize the money to get the \nbacklog caught up with what we presently have and should be taking care \nof. There is no attempt whatsoever.\n  In the GAO report--I quoted almost $9 billion--they are saying it is \nbetween $13.2 billion and $19.4 billion to get our national parks up to \ndate and manage the things we should be managing. In contrast, the \nentire budget for the Department of the Interior in 2007 was under $11 \nbillion. We are going to take significant moneys that should be spent \non the backlog of repair and maintenance and we are going to use that \nto implement this 1,243-page bill. I don't get it. I don't understand \nthe lack of common sense. I understand the political drive. I \nunderstand we want to do things for people back at home. But I don't \nunderstand why there hasn't been a change in behavior given the \neconomic situation we are in. I flat don't get it. I guess I have a lot \nto learn about politics.\n  The GAO wasn't necessarily critical of the management of the \nDepartment of the Interior, they were really critical of Congress. They \nsaid that although Interior has made a concentrated effort to address \nits deferred backlog, the dollar estimate of the backlog has continued \nto escalate. It sounds as if they need help. The last thing they need \nis another 3 million acres for which they have to be responsible. They \nclassify the backlog into four categories: roads, bridges, and trails, \nbetween $6 billion and $9 billion; buildings, including historic \nbuildings, between $2 billion and $3.5 billion; irrigation, dams, and \nother water structures, between $2.4 billion and $3.6 billion; \nrecreation sites and fisheries, between $2 billion and $2.93 billion.\n  The Department of Interior by itself manages more than 500 million \nacres of Federal land, more than 1.8 billion acres of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, and its 70,000 employees working in 2,400 locations. \nYet congressional leadership intends to add another 3 million acres and \nhundreds of new commitments to DOI in this bill.\n  In one instance of mismanagement, in this GAO report, GAO points out \nthat the Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for 132,000 acres of \nfarmland, most of which it doesn't manage. However, even though these \nfarmlands are unwanted, the Fish and Wildlife Service cannot sell these \nlands because they are now part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. \nSo Fish and Wildlife owns thousands of acres of good farmland that it \ndoesn't manage and doesn't even inspect. It is less than 13 percent of \nthe land they inspect yearly. It is land we could use for agricultural \nproduction, but we don't use it because we in the Congress have \nhandicapped them.\n  What the GAO report also said was, in describing the maintenance \nbacklogs, that the deterioration of these facilities can impair public \nhealth and safety, reduce employee morale and productivity, and \nincrease the cost for major repairs and early replacement of structures \nand equipment.\n  Other groups have made similar observations. According to the \nNational Parks Conservation Association, ``From neglected trails to \ndirty or deteriorating facilities, national parks across the country \nare showing the strain of budget shortfalls in excess of $600 million \nannually. . . .'' It will be greater than that this year. ``The visitor \ncenter at the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii is overcrowded, its \nfoundation is cracking, and it is sinking. . . .a shortage of staff and \nfunding limits the ability of the Park Service to maintain campgrounds \nat Nevada's Great Basin National Park. Broken benches, dilapidated \nbuildings, and a crumbling boardwalk greet visitors to Riis Park in \nGateway National Recreation Area in New York and New Jersey. Chaco \nCulture National Historical Park in New Mexico lacks funding to \nmaintain and repair the park's 28 miles of backcountry trails. As a \nresult, trails are damaged by heavy use and weather, compromising the \nexperiences of visitors and the integrity of cultural resources and \nnearby natural resources that become trampled when visitors cannot \nfollow the trails.'' They are not maintained, and that becomes an \necological problem.\n  According to Acting IG Mary Kendall, ``Our work has documented \ndecades of maintenance, health and safety issues that place the \nDepartment of Interior employees and the public at risk.'' She listed \nthe following examples of where poor management has led to safety \nconcerns:\n  The U.S. Park Police, responsible for maintaining security at \nnational icons, ``failed to establish a comprehensive security program \nand lacks adequate staffing and formal training for those responsible \nfor protection [of those assets].''\n  Opportunities for improvement remain in the security of our Nation's \ndams.\n  The Department's Office of Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency \nManagement still struggles with issuing centralized policy and \nproviding effective oversight of DOI law enforcement.\n  In 2006, they found a National Park Service visitor center literally \nfalling apart, severe deterioration at the Bureau of Indian Education \nelementary and secondary schools, and Fish and Wildlife employees \nworking for almost 7 years in two buildings that were condemned and \nclosed to the public.\n  That is how good the oversight is that we have done.\n  They identified abandoned mines where members of the public had been \n``killed, injured, or exposed to dangerous environmental contaminants''\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nby abandoned mines, and Congress is prioritizing a massive increase in \nthe public lands without funding or prioritizing the true national \nconcerns in DOI.\n  What was also found in the GAO report is that despite increasing \nfirefighting funds fourfold, there is incompetent forest fire \nmanagement. The fact is that they are made worse because of poor \nmanagement. We have done nothing for that.\n  Her statement was:\n\n       In other words, DOI has not managed to even develop goals \n     for maximizing fire management and prevention funds.\n\n  Another statement is:\n\n       High prevalence of waste and fraud in the procurement and \n     Federal assistance process.\n\n  They also found problems throughout the solicitation process: a lack \nof presolicitation planning, a lack of competition, selection of \ninappropriate award vehicles, and poor administration of contracts and \ngrants.\n  Mary Kendall said:\n\n       Financial management has remained a top challenge for the \n     department.\n\n  Why don't we fix it? You cannot fix what you cannot measure. Yet we \nare going to add this bloated bill.\n  There is something everybody should know. For the Native American \nschools in this country, we are spending a billion dollars a year for \n50,000 kids. And when you look at performance, what you see is \nsomething akin, in many areas, to Washington, DC--not all but in many. \nThe cost per student running through that is $20,000. We could put them \nin the best private schools, with the best private teachers, and bunk \nthem, for $20,000 a year. Yet we continue to allow this.\n\n  BLM grazing fees collected were $12 million in fiscal year 2004--that \nis the latest year for which we have numbers, which tells you something \nabout the accounting--even though the cost to implement the grazing \nprogram was $58 million. We would be better off eliminating the grazing \nprogram and saving $46 million.\n  So what is it about this bill that has had me so persistent? I will \ntell you. It is a great example of what we do wrong. It is a great \nexample of the worst tendency of Congress. We were in an energy-short \nenvironment, and even though it doesn't feel that way today, it will \nfeel that way 10, 12, 18 months from now. We are going to eliminate the \npotential for us getting out of it. We are going to add significant \nresponsibilities to an agency that both the GAO and their own IG says \nis in trouble. Yet we don't approach anything to fix it.\n  We are going to make everybody feel good in this body because they \nall have something in the bill and they can go home and say: Look what \nI did, look what I accomplished. I got something that is important for \nour State. The problem with that thinking is that, when we only think \nin a parochial manner--if I only think about Oklahoma or if the Senator \nfrom Texas only thinks about Texas or any other Senator thinks only \nabout their State and themselves--the whole country loses. Not once in \nour oath does it say that our allegiance is to our State. What it says \nis that our allegiance is to our country. And if our country is not \nhealthy, no State can be healthy. Yet we have allowed parochialism and \nthe politics of the Senate to design a bill that, for sure, will pass \nbut which in the long run is going to be harmful to the country. It is \ngoing to pass. It will have 65 or 70 votes, maybe even 80 votes, \nbecause the press release at home is more important than the principle \nin Washington. Consequently, not only will we spend this $11 billion \nand overburden an agency that is struggling to keep itself above water, \nwe will commit the Department of Interior to further backlogs, further \nproblems, and we will strangle our ability to respond both with clean \nenergy and the energy we know we are going to need for the next 20 \nyears the next time the supply-demand balance gets upset.\n  The question the American people ought to ask is, Is it worth it? Is \nit worth it for somebody from Oklahoma to get something and to do this \nto the Nation as a whole? Is it responsible? Is that how our country is \ngoing to work in the future? Are we going to always place parochial \ninterests first or are we going to go back and grab ahold of the \nheritage which made this country great, which says the politician \ndoesn't matter; the principles and forbearance of our forefathers in \naccomplishing what is best for the nation, is that going to win the \nday? My thoughts are that it won't. When it doesn't win the day, I \ndon't lose--I fought for it--but my kids lose, my grandkids lose, and \nso does everybody else in this country. In the name of playing the good \ngame, what we are doing is undermining our country.\n  We have a lot of financial problems in front of us today. We as a \nnation can get out of those problems. As a matter of fact, we will get \nout of those in spite of the U.S. Congress because what makes America \ngreat is its people, not its politicians. What makes America great is \nthe fact that the people get up every day, and no matter what is ahead \nof them, they will struggle to try to defeat the problems in front of \nthem to make a better life for themselves, their kids, and their \nneighbors. We could learn a great deal from the average American \ncitizen as we approach the legislation.\n\n  This little bill, which I assure you nobody in this body has read, is \na compilation of 170 bills--some good; some don't have any of the \nnegative effects I have described. But 50 of them are going to have \ndevastating effects. And how we respond, how the American people \nrespond to our doing this, is going to reflect on the character of the \nAmerican people. They need to become informed about what we are doing.\n  Later today, we will have a unanimous consent that I thank the \nmajority leader for. He has the toughest job in the Senate, and I \nrecognize that. I have given him fits on this bill. I don't apologize \nfor that. I think this bill is the wrong thing at the wrong time for \nthe wrong reason. But we will have a unanimous consent agreement that \nallows six amendments, which I will offer either later this evening or \ntomorrow, which eliminate some of the stupidity in this bill. It won't \nfix the bill. It won't fix the problem I have described.\n  We are then going to walk out of here happy, because it will go back \nto the House, not have a chance to be amended in the House, and the \nPresident is going to sign a bill that is going to hurt our energy \nindependence. We are going to hear all sorts of statements to the \ncontrary, but that is not true. The fact is it is going to hurt our \ncapability of becoming more self-sufficient for our own energy needs.\n  So a year or 18 months from now, when you are no longer paying under \n$2 for gasoline, and it is $4, I hope the American people will remember \nthis bill, because this is the start of the battle against undermining \nutilizing our own resources in our own country for what is in the best \nlong-term interest--not the short-term--for our country. And it doesn't \nhave anything to do with climate change or global warming. Because if \nit did, we wouldn't worry about 20 years of carbon usage when we know \nwe are going to go away from it.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience and the time today. I \nyield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent agreement \nthat I am going to propound, and I believe it is acceptable on all \nsides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be yielded back, \nand the motion to proceed to H.R. 146 be agreed to; that once the bill \nis reported, the Bingaman substitute amendment, which is at the desk, \nbe called up for consideration; that once the substitute amendment has \nbeen reported, it be considered read; that the following list of \namendments be the only first-degree amendments in order; that upon \ndisposition of the listed amendments, the substitute amendment, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time, and the Senate then vote on passage of the bill, that \npassage of the bill be subject to a 60-vote threshold; that if the \nthreshold is achieved and upon passage, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\ntitle amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; provided further \ndebate time prior to a vote in relation to each amendment be limited to \n60 minutes, equally divided and controlled in the usual form; and that \nno amendment be in order to any amendment prior to a vote in relation \nthereto; that if there is a sequence of votes in relation to the \namendments, then prior to each vote in a sequence, there be 4 minutes \nof debate, divided as specified above, and that after the first vote in \nany sequence, subsequent votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  Here is the list of amendments: Coburn amendment No. 680, regarding \nbarring new construction.

Mr. President, at this point I believe I intend to put \na quorum call in. My colleague from Idaho is going to speak in a few \nminutes, as I understand it, to discuss some of the issues involved \nwith the legislation. I plan to speak myself and then we will await \nSenator Coburn's return to the floor so he can call up the first of his \namendments.\n  I am informed that the Senator from Oklahoma wishes to speak. \nAccordingly, I will not put in a quorum call at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a lot of my colleagues have come down and \ntalked about the outrage at the excessive bonuses for AIG executives \nafter, then, the $180 billion bailout. I think we should be mad at a \nlot of people, I guess, right now--certainly the executives who were \nthe ones who ran what was once a great company into the ground. But \nthat is not where the blame ends. It is not where the buck stops. I \nknow I will upset some of my colleagues when I remind them and the \nAmerican people that much of the blame should be directed right here in \nthis Chamber to Members of this body, the Senate, and to the other side \nof the Capitol, because that is where it all started in October.\n  It was October 10 when 75 percent of the Senators voted to give an \nunprecedented amount of money to an unelected bureaucrat to do with as \nhe wished. This happened to be $700 billion, the largest amount ever \nauthorized, if you could use that word, in the history of the world. So \n75 percent of the Senators in this Chamber said to both Treasury \nSecretary Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner--let's keep in mind he was in \non this deal, too--when voting in favor of the massive bailout, to go \nahead and take the $700 billion and do anything with it you want.\n  How can they support giving money to a bureaucrat to ``do anything \nyou want''? There was nothing there. He gave a promise. He said it was \nto go buy damaged assets, but he didn't do that. Instead, that money \nwent to banks and I don't know that there are any positive results in \nthe way of credit as a result of that effort.\n  When it comes to AIG, outrage doesn't even come close. I have said \nfrom a long time, from the outset, in fact, that the Federal Government \nneeds an exit strategy for its entanglement in the financial system. \nThe revelation that AIG is trying to give hundreds of millions of \ndollars in bonuses at the same time it is the recipient of the largest \ngovernment bailout in history shows why. How can you give out bonuses \nwhen the taxpayer has to rescue you from sudden failure? What are these \nbonuses for exactly?\n  I understand bonuses should be a reward for a job well done. It is \npretty clear when they are getting bailed out by the taxpayers it was \nnot a job well done. What could possibly justify the bonuses? I \nnormally would not support having the government try to micromanage pay \npackages in any industry, but these are not normal times. AIG has \nreceived almost $180 billion in U.S. taxpayers' bailouts. The U.S. \nGovernment owns 80 percent of the company. How the executives at AIG do \nnot get the fact that these are not normal times is absolutely mind \nboggling.\n  I have been saying for a long time we need a change of course in our \napproach to the financial bailouts. President Obama's Treasury \nSecretary came out over a month ago, February 11, and he said he had a \nplan for changing course. We have been waiting since February 11 for \nthat plan. Nobody has it. We do not have any idea if anybody has a plan \nout there, but certainly we have not heard anything from Tim Geithner.\n  I don't know how people at AIG, giving out or receiving a bonus right \nnow, can look themselves in the mirror, but my colleagues and I in \nCongress can look you in the eye right now and say if we do not see \naction on this and action on it soon from the administration, you can \nbe sure we will do all we can to right this wrong to get these bonuses \nback.\n  There are several people working on how, mechanically, that would \nwork. But above all, we need the people to demand a change in course \nwhen it comes to a financial rescue approach.\n  I hesitate saying this but--and I hope this will never happen again--\nat the time, October 10, when a decision was made to influence 75 \npercent of the Senators in this Chamber to give $700 billion to an \nunelected bureaucrat to do with as he wished and then we turned around \nand complained about what he did with it was not reasonable. I hope \nthis never happens again.\n  With that, I believe there are some things in the works now that are \ngoing to change this situation. I hope we can be successful. It is \nunconscionable what has happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to stand in behalf \nof and support of H.R. 146. This is what we passed earlier in the \nSenate as S. 22 and now, because of the procedural necessities between \nthe House and the Senate as we seek to provide an opportunity for this \nlegislation to reach the desk of the President, it has been amended to \nH.R. 146.\n  To call this legislation bipartisan is an understatement. This bill \ncontains over 150 individual provisions sponsored by almost 50 \ndifferent Members, almost half of our colleagues in this Senate. It \nrepresents every region of the country and has almost an equal number \nof bills from each side of the aisle. It is going to provide \nsignificant protections to existing public lands, improve recreation, \ncultural and historic opportunities, and provide important economic \nbenefits for rural economy States such as my home State of Idaho.\n  Every bill in the package has gone through regular order. Most have \nhad multiple hearings and markups in the Energy Committee. All are \nfully supported by the committee chairman and the ranking member. In \nfact, many of the provisions, such as my top legislative priority, the \nOwyhee initiative, are the result of years of extensive collaboration \nat the State and local levels\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nin conjunction with elected officials, businesses, community leaders, \noutdoor enthusiasts, and other stakeholders. This legislation has been \nin preparation, also, for years. In fact, many of the provisions \nincluded in this legislation were initially worked on by the Energy \nCommittee when the Republicans were in control of the Senate and \nSenator Pete Domenici was the chairman of the Energy Committee.\n\n  Additionally, there is no direct spending in this authorizing bill. \nThe package does not have any bills that have a CBO score without an \noffset, meaning that the spending authorized in this bill is offset. \nThis is not to say that the legislation is without controversy or that \nit is unanimously supported. Few pieces of legislation that pass \nthrough this Chamber are. However, while any omnibus package by nature \nwill contain elements that are troubling to some, the Energy Committee \nnegotiated the inclusion of each bill in this package to successfully \nreach a compromise on which both sides of the aisle could agree.\n  As with my Owyhee wilderness legislation, not everyone got exactly \nwhat they wanted, but both sides made concessions and believe the \nresult is something they can put their support behind. As a result, \nthis omnibus lands bill is widely supported and represents a diverse \ngroup of interests from every region of the country. Because of this, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support its passage swiftly this week.\n  Some are attacking the bill by saying it is a huge omnibus bill that \ncontains over 150 separate individual pieces of legislation and that \nbecause it is so large, that is a reason to oppose it. Frankly, I am \none of those in this Senate who does not like the notion of taking \nsmaller pieces of legislation, in general, and packaging them into \nlarge omnibus bills without allowing those bills to go through orderly \nprocess and without allowing the committee process and the amendment \nprocess on the floor to fully work. This is not the first time this \nlegislation has seen the floor of the Senate, however. As I said \nearlier, it has already passed the floor essentially in the same format \nas the proposed amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, as S. 22. It \nwas on the floor previously and essentially in the same shape and we \ndebated it multiple times.\n  As I said, the individual pieces of this legislation have moved \nthrough the Energy Committee and have been approved by the Energy \nCommittee as this process was followed.\n  Historically it has been the way the Energy Committee approaches \npublic lands legislation, to put them into large groups. Why? As I \nsaid, there are 150 pieces in this particular bill. Previous to this \nbill was another one which I believe had somewhere over 70 different \npieces, and I will bet the Energy Committee today has another 50 or 70 \nor 100 pieces of legislation waiting for consideration. If every single \none of them moved individually on the floor of the Senate, we would \nhave little time on the floor for any other type of business.\n  It has become a working procedure that these bills are grouped \ntogether and moved in one unit as we work among ourselves with regard \nto land management issues in our respective States so we can move \nforward.\n  Let me give an example of what I am talking about, relating to my own \nspecific state, Idaho. As I have indicated, my top legislative \npriority, the Owyhee initiative, is included in this bill. I am going \nto talk further about it in a few moments. But that is not the only \nbill relating to Idaho that is in this legislation. As a matter of \nfact, there are five or six bills in this legislation that relate to my \nhome State of Idaho. Let me give an example of what they are so you can \nsee why it is these bills are collected together and moved as one unit.\n  One of them is S. 2354, the Twin Falls Land Exchange.\n  This bill transfers four specified parcels of land in Twin Falls, ID, \nfrom the BLM to the city of Twin Falls, ID, for use to support the \nAuger Falls Project, which is a community park and recreation area.\n  Again, many people who are not from the West, who do not realize how \nlarge the areas of public land are that we have out here, do not \nrealize that when we make adjustments to land ownership between the \nFederal Government and the city or the county or other private \nentities, it requires an act of Congress. That is what one of these \nprovisions in the bill is, an uncontroversial bill for this land \nexchange between the BLM and the city of Twin Falls.\n  Another one is S. 262, to rename the Snake River Birds of Prey \nNational Conservation Area as the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of \nPrey National Conservation Area in honor of the late Morley Nelson, who \nis an international authority on birds of prey, who was instrumental in \nthe establishment of this National Conservation Area--the change of the \nname of a conservation area.\n  Another of those pieces of legislation relevant to my home State of \nIdaho is the boundary adjustment to the Frank Church River of No Return \nWilderness, another huge area in Idaho which has been previously, years \nand years ago, designated as wilderness, where we need to make a few \nboundary adjustments to include and exclude some specific lands.\n  Another one is S. 542. The name is Snake, Boise, and Payette River \nSystems studies. This legislation authorizes the Secretary of Interior, \nacting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to conduct feasibility \nstudies on projects that address water shortages within the Snake, \nBoise, and Payette River Systems in Idaho that are considered \nappropriate for further study by the Bureau of Reclamation water \nstorage assessment report; in other words, to help us manage our water \nissues in Federal lands that are managed in the State of Idaho. This \nlegislation authorizes this important water study for the people of our \nState.\n  Another of the bills in this package relating to the State of Idaho \nis the reauthorization of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992. \nThis amends the National Geologic Mapping Act to extend the deadlines \nfor development of a 5-year strategic plan for the geologic mapping \nprogram and for appointment of an advisory committee.\n  That applies a little bit more broadly than just to Idaho, but it is \nvery important in Idaho that we have the proper and final conclusions \nof this mapping process for our State's land management.\n  There are other pieces of legislation within this package that are \nnot specific to Idaho but are very relevant to the citizens of other \nStates. For example, one of the bills, S. 2593, is called Forest \nLandscape Restoration Act of 2008, which establishes a collaborative \nforest landscape restoration project to select and fund ecological \nrestoration treatments for priority forest landscapes, an important \npart of our forest management policy that we have been working on for \nsome time to get a more collaborative and effective way to manage our \nforests in our country.\n  Another piece, the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail Designation \nAct--this one designates the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail, a \ntrail from Missoula, MT, to the Pacific Ocean, to proceed for the \npublic appreciation, understanding, and enjoyment of the nationally \nsignificant natural and cultural features of the Ice Age floods.\n  Again, I point these out simply to show the broad variety of the \ntypes of land management decisions and acts, pieces of legislation that \nare included in this bill, which is being attacked as something that \nwas just thrown together in a haphazard fashion by those who wanted to \nexpand the role of the Federal Government in controlling the public \nlands.\n  I can tell you, in my home State of Idaho, there is very strong \nresistance to increasing the reach of the Federal Government. The \ndecisions that we have made in supporting these types of legislation \nhave been made in terms of trying to protect and preserve those very \nkinds of issues.\n  I will mention one more, S. 2875. This is one that is very important \nto us in the West, probably not that big of an issue in the East. It is \ncalled the Wolf Livestock Loss Prevention and Mitigation Act, \nintroduced by Senator Tester of Montana. I am a cosponsor of it. It \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture to establish a 5-year demonstration program to provide \ngrants to States and Indian tribes to assist livestock producers with \nrespect to losses they may acquire on Federal, State, private, or \nIndian land, to undertake proactive,\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\nnonlethal activities to reduce the risk of livestock loss as a result \nof predation by wolves.\n  The reason the predation of wolves has become an issue is because \nunder the Endangered Species Act, the wolves have been reintroduced \ninto this area. Now a conflict has arisen as to wolves that, frankly, \nare predators with regard to livestock. This legislation in some States \nis not an issue, might be irrelevant. To people in my State, it is a \nhuge issue. The bill continues with issue after issue in other States \nwhere Senators, with the renaming of recreation areas, the adjustment \nof boundaries, the establishment of water studies and the like, have \nbeen working with land management issues in their States to proceed \nwith rational, well thought out policy changes that they and their \nStates support. I do not believe there is a single piece of legislation \nin this bill that is not supported by the Senators from the States in \nwhich the land sits, where the legislation impacts.\n  Now, let me take a few minutes while I wait for my colleagues who \nwant to come and bring amendments. I would say right now to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma or any others who would like to come and either \ndebate this matter on the floor or bring forward an amendment and be \ngiven the amendment consideration process, that I am prepared to work \nwith them as soon as they arrive on the floor for that purpose. But \nuntil they arrive, let me talk a little bit about the Owyhee \nInitiative.\n  I said earlier it was my No. 1 priority for this legislation. Many \npeople, when I say ``Owyhee,'' wonder if I am saying ``Hawaii.'' It is \nOwyhee, O-w-y-h-e-e, and it is named after the Owyhee Canyonlands in \nsouthwestern Idaho, one of the most beautiful places that you can find \nin many parts of this country, but one of the most beautiful parts of \nthe country with a tremendous and rich environmental and cultural \nheritage.\n  It is also an area where we have been having conflicts over land \nmanagement policies for decades. Conflict among whom? Well, in this \narea, this beautiful gorgeous area of Idaho, not only do we have a rich \nenvironmental heritage and flora and fauna that abound, but we have \nlivestock owners and ranchers. We have two Indian tribes. We have an \nAir Force training range both on land, as well as the air rights that \nimpact on the area.\n  We have, as you might guess, hunters and fishers, and those who would \nlike to recreate in the area in off-road vehicles or backpacking or \nrafting on the rivers or any number of other ways. And the types of \nuses that people want to put this gorgeous land to occasionally--not \noccasionally, regularly--come into conflict. Because of that, 8 years \nago I was asked by a number of those from different interests in this \nland to see if I would host a collaborative effort to bring together \nthose interested in all different perspectives, and instead of fighting \nin court or fighting in public hearings to sit down around the table \nand see if we could not collaboratively work out a solution.\n  I agreed to do so, and we started the Owyhee Initiative. That was \nliterally about 8 years ago. Since that time, I am pleased to tell you \nthat this collaborative effort between all levels of government, \nmultiple users of public land and conservationists to resolve these \ndecades-old heated land use battles in the Owyhee Canyonlands have come \nto a conclusion by all who support this legislation.\n  Now, I cannot tell you that literally every interest group possible \nsupports it, but I can tell you that with the exception, in my opinion, \nof those in extreme positions, the vast majority of the people of Idaho \nand people across this country with interests in this great land are \nsupportive of this land management act which has been proposed in \nCongress.\n  Owyhee County contains some of the most unique and beautiful \ncanyonlands in the world, and offers large areas in which all of us can \nenjoy its grandeur. Now, 73 percent of the land base in this county is \nowned by the United States of America, and it is located within 1 \nhour's drive of one of the fastest growing areas in the Nation, Boise, \nID. This combination of all of this incredible bounty, the closeness to \na very large, growing population and the large amount of land ownership \nby the Federal Government, together with all of these other multiple \nuses to which the people who love the land want to put it to, has \nresulted in an explosive effect on property values, community expansion \ndevelopment, and ever-increasing demands on public land.\n  Given this confluence of circumstances, Owyhee County can certainly \nbe understood to be a focus of conflict over the years, with heated \npolitical and regulatory battles that many thought would never end. The \nconflict over the land management is both inevitable but also \nunderstandable. And the question we face is, how do we manage it?\n  The wonderful people I will mention who worked on this effort came \ntogether and were able to find win-win solutions where everybody was \nbetter off with this legislation than with the status quo. The county \ncommissioners said enough is enough, and I have to give credit to them \nfor their tremendous work.\n  As we went forward, we ran into some sharp turns and steep inclines \nand burdens and hurdles in the roads, sharp rocks, deep ruts, sand \nburrs, what have you. But we worked hard for the last 7 or 8 years to \ncome up with this legislation which I now support.\n  The commissioners appointed a chairman, an extraordinary gentleman, \nFred Grant. They formed a work group that included the Wilderness \nSociety, the Idaho Conservation League, the Nature Conservancy, Idaho \nOutfitters and Guides, the U.S. Air Force, the Sierra Club, the county \nSoil Conservation Districts, Owyhee Cattleman's Association, the Owyhee \nBorderlands Trust, People for the Owyhees, the Shoshone and Paiute \nTribes, and others to join their efforts. They all worked together, and \nwe came up with this legislation.\n  Now, I see that others have come in, and I believe they may want to \nbegin making remarks, so I will wrap up rather quickly. I have a list \nof the names of the individuals who worked so hard over the years to \nbring together a win-win situation for the people of Idaho.\n  These people came from groups and institutions and interests that \nhistorically have been battling head to head. Instead, they were \nwilling to work through this in a way that I believe sets a tremendous \nexample for how we should approach land management decisions and \nconflicts in this Nation.\n  That is another reason this important legislation should pass. This \nlegislation, some call it a wilderness bill, and it does have \nwilderness in it--I call it a comprehensive management bill, not just \nwilderness, but wild and scenic rivers. It deals with cattle and \nranching. It deals with private property ownership. It deals with off-\nroad vehicle use. It deals with travel plans. It deals with hunting and \nfishing and outfitters and the guides and all of the other different \naspects of the way that people would want to use beautiful land like \nthis.\n  I commend the commitment and leadership of everybody who has worked \nto make this legislation possible. Today is a very important day for \nthem. Although we will probably still spend some time on the floor of \nthis Senate working on this and the other important issues in this \nlegislation, it is my hope we can expeditiously handle the amendments \nthat have been proposed to this legislation and then move forward with \njust as expeditious activity and send this legislation back to the \nHouse for, hopefully, its final consideration.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their forbearance and for listening \nto this one more time. I am looking forward to the debate that we will \nhave on the authorized amendments that have been made in order. I will \nwork with my colleagues to assure that we pass this legislation as \nquickly as possible.\n  I would like to recognize and thank the people who have been the real \ndriving force behind this process: Fred Grant, chairman of the Owyhee \nInitiative Work Group, his assistant Staci Grant, and Dr. Ted Hoffman, \nSheriff Gary Aman; the Owyhee County Commissioners: Hal Tolmie, Chris \nSalova, and Dick Reynolds and Chairman Terry Gibson of the Shoshone \nPaiute Tribes. I am grateful to Governor Jim Risch of the Great State \nof Idaho for all of his support. Thanks to Colonel Rock of the U.S. Air \nForce at Mountain Home Air Force Base; Craig\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nGherke and John McCarthy of the Wilderness Society; Rick Johnson and \nJohn Robison of the Idaho Conservation League, Inez Jaca representing \nOwyhee County; Dr. Chad Gibson representing the Owyhee Cattleman's \nAssociation; Brenda Richards representing private property owners in \nOwyhee County; Cindy and Frank Bachman representing the Soil \nConservation Districts in Owyhee County; Marcia Argust with the \nCampaign for America's Wilderness; Grant Simmons of the Idaho \nOutfitters and Guides Association; Bill Sedivy with Idaho Rivers \nUnited; Tim Lowry of the Owyhee County Farm Bureau; Bill Walsh \nrepresenting Southern Idaho Desert Racing Association; Lou Lunte and \nWill Whelan of the Nature Conservancy for all of their hard work and \ndedication.\n  I would also like to thank the Idaho Back Country Horseman, the \nFoundation for North American Wild Sheep, Roger Singer of the Sierra \nClub, the South Board of Control and the Owyhee Project managers, and \nall the other water rights holders who support me today. This process \ntruly benefited from the diversity of these groups and their \nwillingness to cooperate to reach a common goal of protecting the land \non which they live, work, and play.\n  The Owyhee Canyonlands and its inhabitants are truly a treasure of \nIdaho and the United States; I hope you will join me in ensuring their \nfuture.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 5 minutes and, at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       AIG Executive Compensation\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nquestion of executive compensation triggered in particular by the \nrecent round of bonuses paid to executives at AIG who had such a \nsignificant role in putting America into the economic distress we are \nin now. I have vented probably 50 times over this already, so I have \ncalmed down a bit, but it is truly infuriating. I believe all my \ncolleagues share how frustrating and infuriating it is. What is it \nabout these people? They don't seem to get it. At long last have they \nno sense of humility? Have they no sense that their wretched \ncorporation would not even exist today if it were not for the good will \nof millions of American taxpayers whose own economic future is being \nput at risk to prop up this corporation? Then they turn and do this?\n  It is not only I. I was in Rhode Island over the weekend. I stopped \nat Coffey's service station to have the oil changed. It was the one \nthing the mechanics were furious about. People don't come up to me and \ntalk about issues all the time. I am a pretty normal person. We bump \ninto each other, and we talk about various things. They were all over \nthis. I stopped at Amenities Deli in Providence to pick up coffee and a \nmuffin. Rosie, who runs it, all over this. I went to a meeting with the \npolice chief and some community organizers in Olneyville. There was the \nlocal media, the radio stations, all over it. People are so angry.\n  What has happened is, the view has appeared that there isn't anything \nwe can do about this. What I would like to say is, I believe that view \nis wrong. I am pleased President Obama has directed Treasury Secretary \nGeithner to use the Treasury's leverage and pursue every single legal \navenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole.\n  It is not just these bonuses. There is more out there. The Wall \nStreet Journal reported weeks ago that there is $40 billion in deferred \nexecutive compensation waiting to be paid to recipients of the TARP \nplan of Federal taxpayer generosity. We are not doing anything about \nthat either. The problem is fairly simple. In the ordinary course, \nthese companies which have wrecked themselves would ordinarily be \ninsolvent and would ordinarily go into bankruptcy. In bankruptcy, you \nwould have a judicial forum. The court would make determinations about \nwho gets paid under a regular schedule. These executive compensation \nschemes--deferred compensation is a tax dodge, so how wonderful that \nthat should be favored now--these compensation schemes come at the very \nend. You line up at the back of the line with the unsecured creditors \nand you may get paid only pennies on the dollar. But because of their \nimportance, because they were too big to fail, because we had to keep \nour financial system going, we could not allow them to go into \nbankruptcy. That was the decision. That took away that judicial forum.\n  Because we haven't replaced it under American law, where you can't \nundo a contractual obligation, you can't willy-nilly take it away, not \nwithout providing due process of law, all the way back to that case \nthat all of us learned in the first year of law school, Fuentes v. \nShevin. When the sheriff came to take away Mrs. Fuentes' stove because \nshe hadn't paid for it, the Supreme Court said: You can't take Mrs. \nFuentes' stove away, even if she hasn't paid for it, not without giving \nher a chance to be heard. So we have to create a place where the \nGovernment can go to contest these executive compensation schemes and \nhave a proper due process hearing and air it out before the people.\n  The legislation I have proposed is called the Economic Recovery \nAdjustment Act of 2009. It would permit the Government, after notice \nand a hearing, consistent with due process principles, to reduce \nexcessive executive compensation obligations at financial institutions \nthat have received Federal bailout funds. It would also create an \noffice of the taxpayer advocate in the Department of Justice to take \nthe other side in the contest between the executives and the public, \nthe Department of Justice would represent the public. Finally, you \nwould set up a temporary court, a temporary recovery oversight panel of \nsitting bankruptcy judges. You don't have to create new positions. You \ntake sitting bankruptcy judges and create a temporary panel and you can \nget this heard.\n  I don't wish to speak long. I know the distinguished Senator from \nVermont is waiting. I do wish to assure my colleagues that if we want \nto ventilate about this, if we want to wring our hands about it, if we \nwant to give speeches about how it is outrageous, we can do that. But \nif we actually want to do something about it, within the constitutional \nrestrictions of the United States, I believe the bill I have proposed \nwill allow us to do it. Frankly, I don't see another way. I invite \ncolleagues to discuss it further with me. I don't think I have an \nexclusive piece of wisdom here. I do think there may be ways the bill \ncould be improved. I am willing to listen to anybody.\n  I can't tolerate a situation in which we do nothing, in which we \nunilaterally disarm the U.S. Government from doing anything about this \ncompensation by failing to set up the basic judicial method through \nwhich we could take a look at this and try to make things right.\n  Again, I invite my colleagues to be in touch on this, if they are \ninterested in pursuing it. I think it is necessary. I appreciate the \nindulgence of the Chair. I appreciate the indulgence of the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is hard to know how to begin because \nthere is such a huge sense of outrage today in our country at what Wall \nStreet has done through their greed, through their recklessness, and \nthrough their illegal behavior. The so-called masters of the universe, \nthe best and the brightest, have plunged our Nation and, in fact, the \nworld into a deep recession and taken us to the edge of a major \ndepression.\n  In my State of Vermont and all over the country, what we are seeing \nis good, decent people losing jobs, losing homes, losing savings, \nlosing their hopes for a future because of the greed and recklessness \nof a small number of people on Wall Street.\n  Everybody understands that one of the major institutions that has \ntaken us into the financial mess we are in today is AIG. Over the past \nseveral years, AIG has moved away from being the largest insurance \ncompany in the world to becoming the largest unregulated gambling hall \nin the world. That is what they have done. As a result of the risky \nbets that AIG had made and lost on, the taxpayers have spent $170 \nbillion bailing them out. That amounts to some $600 for every man, \nwoman, and child.\n  During much of this period, Hank Greenberg, former CEO of AIG, was\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nable to amass a personal fortune of close to $2 billion. In 2007, he \nwas one of the wealthiest people in the world. Even after the collapse \nof AIG, Mr. Greenberg is still worth close to $100 million, according \nto Forbes magazine.\n  Having helped cause this financial disaster as a result of their \nreckless and irresponsible behavior, it is beyond comprehension that \nthese same people, the best and the brightest, would actually believe \nthey are entitled to millions of dollars in bonuses. Think for a \nmoment. These are the people who have caused one of the great financial \ndisasters in the last 70 years, and they are sitting back and saying: \nFor all of my fine and excellent work, I am going to be rewarded with a \n$3 million bonus or whatever it may be.\n\n  It goes without saying that we have to hear the outrage of the \nAmerican people and say: Enough is enough. I have signed on to two \nletters which essentially tell these people who have received their \nbonuses to give them back. If they don't give them back, we are going \nto pass a surtax on those bonuses so the taxpayers will, in fact, \nreceive back what we gave them. In my view, what we have to move to is \nlegislation, to what I proposed, along with Senators Lincoln and Boxer, \nwhich was called ``stop the greed'' legislation on Wall Street.\n  The President is paid $400,000 a year. I think the President will \nsurvive on that sum of money. It seems to me that when taxpayers are \nspending hundreds of billions of dollars bailing out large Wall Street \nfirms, we should make it very clear that none of their executives \nshould be entitled to earn more than the President of the United \nStates. They can, in fact, get by. I know it will be hard, but I expect \nthey can survive on $400,000 a year when the taxpayers of this country \nare bailing them out.\n  More importantly and, in fact, for another lengthier discussion, we \nneed to move to a new concept of what Wall Street should be doing. \nBankers historically in our country and in the world play a very \nimportant role in providing credit to businesses that then create jobs, \nproviding credit to individuals who can purchase homes and other \nnecessities. That is what bankers historically have done. But over the \nlast number of years, what Wall Street has become is not a place where \nresponsible loans are made but a gambling hall where these guys have \nmade huge sums of money in very risky investments that have failed. The \ntaxpayers are now bailing them out.\n  We need to rethink the function of Wall Street. I, personally, \nbelieve that all these CEOs who are responsible for the crisis we are \nin right now should be leaving their positions. I would hope business \nschools will be educating financiers and business people to take the \nposition that their job is to help this country, help create decent-\npaying jobs, help people get the homes they need, help people get the \nloans responsibly that they should have. That is a radical idea, I \nknow. But I would hope we can move toward a Wall Street which has those \nvalues. The American people are sick and tired. They have had it up to \nhere with a Wall Street that has seen their only responsibility being \nto make as much money as they possibly can in any way they possibly \ncan.\n  Having said that, immediate action in stopping these bonuses is the \norder of the day. Longer term, we need fundamental reforms in the way \nWall Street does business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleagues from Vermont and Rhode Island for \ntheir comments. I certainly support what they have had to say.\n  When my kids were growing up, my daughter's favorite movie was the \n``Wizard of Oz.'' It had that great ending, of course, when this \nmassive wizard who held everyone in thrall, they finally pulled the \ncurtain back, the little doggie did, and there was this gnomish \ncharacter sitting in front of a microphone. Everybody stepped back and \nsaid: All these years that we have been afraid of the great Wizard of \nOz, it turns out it is just a little fellow back there.\n  I wish to thank the bonus babies at AIG. They managed to trip up the \ncurtain and we took a look and saw what was behind it. What was behind \nit was unvarnished greed. These are people who would not have a job \ntoday were it not for the hard-working taxpayers of America putting \n$160 billion of our tax money into their failed corporate experiment, \nan experiment that failed and they knew it would, when they went \noverseas to London and had 300 of their best and brightest dream up a \nplan to issue insurance policies that couldn't pass muster by the laws \nand regulations of the United States. Somehow they dreamed it up in \nLondon, executed it, and the next thing you knew American taxpayers \nwere holding the bag. It was a big bag; some say $1 trillion or more of \nliability.\n  So the time came when Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke called \nthe leaders from the House and Senate into a private meeting last \nOctober and said, in a very quiet manner: If we don't do something and \nmove quickly to do it, the American economy could collapse and the rest \nof the world may follow.\n  Now, that is the kind of conversation you do not forget around \nCapitol Hill. I will never forget it. We said: What do you need? They \nsaid: We need hundreds of billions of dollars to ride to the rescue of \nAIG and all these other entities that are teetering on collapse.\n  So what did we do? Most of us said: We have no choice. If the \nalternative is to do nothing and watch businesses and families fail, we \ncannot let it happen. So we gave this authority to the previous \nadministration to try to move in and prop up the economy and get it \nmoving forward again.\n  Well, about $350 billion later, people said: What happened? Did it \nsolve our problems? No. We are still in a recession. Did it save banks? \nPerhaps some for another day. But the economy is still struggling. We \nended up saying to American taxpayers: Now you will become investors in \nthese teetering and failing financial institutions.\n  That is what brings us to today. It turns out we own about 79 percent \nof the value of AIG--once the world's largest insurance company. Now it \nis subsidized by American taxpayers. Were it not for that subsidy, it \nwould have fallen flat on its face in bankruptcy, as Senator Whitehouse \nmentioned earlier. In bankruptcy, the sanctity of the contract is set \naside. The bankruptcy trustee and judge sit back and decide: What are \nwe going to do with limited assets and dramatically larger liabilities \nat the end of the day? They rewrite contracts. They basically come to \ndifferent conclusions.\n  We saved AIG from that fate as taxpayers, and what reward do we have \nto show for it? Millions of dollars in bonuses paid to employees who \nfailed, bonus babies at AIG who could not get enough. After $160 \nbillion of taxpayers' money, they wanted their own personal bonuses to \ntake home. As families across America struggle, losing their jobs, \nlosing their homes, watching their savings accounts diminish to \nvirtually nothing, these folks wanted to walk off with a bonus. For \ngood work? No. A bonus for bad work.\n  So this morning a couple people ventured out to defend them. I could \nnot wait to read those articles. One of them said: These people know \nwhere all the bodies are buried. They know the intricacies of these \ninsurance policies. We need them. They know the secret rocket fuel \nformula. If they leave, someone else may never discover it, and we \ncould lose even more money.\n  I am not buying it. America should not be held hostage by the bonus \nbabies at AIG. The fact is, what we have seen here is greed at its \nworst, incompetence rewarded, and people bold enough on the Federal \nsubsidy to want to take a million dollars or more home for a job not \nwell done.\n  Well, there are several ways we are going to try to send a wake-up \ncall to these bonus babies at AIG. One of them is a provision that \nSenator Baucus of the Finance Committee has proposed, which is \nvirtually going to impose taxes on them so, at the end of the day, \nafter they pay their tax bill, there is nothing left. After they have \npaid their Federal and State and local taxes, there will not be \nanything left of these bonuses.\n  I do not know if they will have the good sense to realize this was a \nterrible corporate decision, but we have to send this message loudly \nand clearly. If America's taxpayers are on the line, then, frankly, \nthese people, who now\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nwork for us and work for this Government, are not entitled to a bonus \nfor their misconduct and incompetence.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 621 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to discuss the legislation \nbefore us, the so-called public lands bill and, in particular, four of \nthe amendments that have been offered by Senator Coburn.\n  I think four of these amendments are--I have not concluded my study \nof the other two, but four of these amendments I would commend to our \ncolleagues and suggest that at least a couple of these amendments \nshould not deter passage of the bill. If they are adopted by my \ncolleagues--and I think they should be--they are in no way a poison \npill. They should not cause the House of Representatives to reject the \nbill in any way. The bill should go on to the President. So for those \nwho are supportive of the legislation, I think these amendments simply \nimprove the bill, and they are offered, I know, by Senator Coburn for \nthat purpose.\n  If I could discuss each of these amendments--I am sorry I do not have \nthe numbers for them, but I will describe them briefly.\n  One is an amendment that would specifically strike out spending in \nfour or five specific areas that are earmarked in the bill. It would \nsave about $25 million. This is symbolic, but $25 million is still a \nlot of money to some of us anyway.\n  They are five specific areas: to celebrate St. Augustine's birthday, \na party for that purpose; botanical gardens in Hawaii and Florida; \nsalmon restoration in California; Alexander Hamilton's boyhood estate \nin the Virgin Islands; and something called the Shipwreck Exploration \nProgram.\n  I am sure the authors of those provisions will come to the floor and \ndescribe in detail why these are such important programs and should be \nincluded in the legislation, and I will look forward to those \nexplanations. Perhaps they will be persuasive. At this point, without \nfurther explanation, they look like the kind of thing that should not \nbe a part of an omnibus bill such as this and could be stricken, as a \nresult of which I am inclined to support my colleague's amendment to \nsave $25 million by striking those particular items.\n  The next deals with the subject of eminent domain. The Federal \nGovernment acquires a great deal of land under this legislation for \ndifferent purposes, including wilderness areas. There are other \nprovisions to protect other kinds of property short of wilderness \nareas. The point of Senator Coburn's amendment on the use of eminent \ndomain is to just ensure that in no case is private property being \ntaken against the wishes of the private landowner.\n  I think we would all agree that if the Government is acquiring a \npiece of property for a public purpose--let's say for a military base--\nthe use of eminent domain is appropriate in that case. The Government \nhas to establish that there is no reasonable alternative to the taking \nof the particular private property, and then if it can establish that, \nit can take possession of the property and then a trial ensues as to \nwhat amount of money is the proper compensation to the owner for the \nland. That is the usual and appropriate use of eminent domain.\n\n  However, we are told that with respect to this legislation, it is not \nnecessary to use eminent domain to acquire land in that way. The reason \nis because in every case--at least my staff advises me--the land that \nis owned by private landowners that would become publicly owned under \nthis legislation has the approval of the private landowner. \nSpecifically, a staff report says that:\n\n       None of the component parts of the omnibus land bill \n     anticipate the use of eminent domain, and all land exchanges \n     and conveyance provisions include willing seller-buyer \n     provisions, or were advocated by the private landowners in \n     each specific provision of the bill in which they are \n     involved.\n\n  It is further noted by the staff of the committee that:\n\n       Great attention was given to private property rights \n     issues. They were addressed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n  This omnibus bill is comprised of tens or scores of individual bills \nthat were then added together into this one giant omnibus bill. So we \nare told that:\n\n       On a case-by-case basis as to each particular bill, private \n     property rights were protected and respected. In many \n     instances, the land designations only affect land that is \n     already publicly owned so it is not even an issue, and for \n     those bills that may affect privately owned land, some of the \n     purchases were actually authorized at the request of the \n     landowner and some contain language that allows land to be \n     purchased only from a willing seller.\n\n  My point is that apparently, at least according to the minority \nstaff, great attention was taken to ensure that the Government in no \ncase in this bill is taking land against the wishes of the landowner. \nThe point of Senator Coburn's amendment is to ensure that that is the \ncase, that he would prohibit the use of eminent domain for the \nacquisition of land under the bill. So if it is true, as the staff \nsuggests, that none of this land needs to be acquired by eminent \ndomain, there is absolutely no harm in including the language that \nprohibits the use of eminent domain. The language in the bill is very \nbrief. I think it is one or two sentences long. In fact, let me read \nit. It simply says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or \n     amendment made by this Act, no land or interest in land other \n     than access easements shall be acquired under this Act by \n     eminent domain.\n\n  That is it, short and sweet.\n  The reason I think it is important is that it establishes an \nimportant principle: that the Congress will not allow land to be taken \nagainst a landowner's wishes for purposes other than the usual purposes \nfor which eminent domain is used, where the Government has to have the \nproperty. There is no other alternative, as in a military base, as I \nsaid, where you are simply acquiring property because it is a good \nidea. You want to protect a particular riparian area of a river, for \nexample. What we do there is we acquire that land either by purchasing \nit from a willing seller or engaging in a land exchange. Those are the \ntwo typical ways of accomplishing this--both very appropriate. But it \nis not a case where the Federal Government has to have the land in the \npublic's interest, as with the military base. So we don't use eminent \ndomain ordinarily in a case such as this.\n  All Senator Coburn is trying to establish here is that we are not \ngoing to change that principle and that the Senate adheres to the \nprinciple we have had in the past. We want to establish this precedent \nand continue to live by it--that eminent domain isn't used in \ncircumstances such as this.\n  I think that is a worthy amendment, and I think, frankly, if we \nreject it, it raises a question of why. Why would we want to preserve \nthe right to use eminent domain if apparently there is no reason for us \nto do so? It, as I said, leaves hanging the question of whether we \nmight use eminent domain in a situation where otherwise it wouldn't be \ncalled for.\n  There is another amendment that I think clearly ought to be approved \nby my colleagues. I don't know why this hasn't been done--I know it was \ndone a long time ago and it needs to be done again--and that is to \nsimply require a report that details the amount of Federal land we \nhave. This would be a public report that would be done--it would be \nupdated each year, and it would detail Federal land ownership and the \ncost to maintain that land and the relative percentage of that land to \nthe total, which would be very helpful information.\n  I understand Senator Coburn has added one other amendment to this \nbecause there was a question raised about the fact that some Federal \nland serves a military purpose or an intelligence purpose which cannot \nalways be disclosed publicly. So, correctly, he provides for a \nclassified annex that would provide the ownership of the lands used for \nclassified purposes. Members who are entitled to see that would be able \nto see it, but it wouldn't be available to the public generally, and \nthat is frequently the way that classified material is handled. So I \nthink that is a good amendment. There is no reason to oppose this. It \nis important for us to know how much land the Government owns.\n  Let me put it this way: You are a landowner. Somebody says, How much\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nland do you own? You know exactly how much land you own. You know where \nit is, what it does, how much it costs to own it, what the taxes on it \nare, and so on. It is important, if the Federal Government is going to \nbe a good steward of both the land and taxpayer money, that it know \nwhat it owns--what we own. Do we need it all, would be one of the \nquestions. Are there pieces of land that could be sold? The Government \ncould use the money. Maybe we could dispose of some of this. In fact, \nthere has always been a list of disposable lands owned by the U.S. \nGovernment, and frequently we acquire land in trades and so on, and \nthere is a lot of buying and selling going on, and that is perfectly \nappropriate. So let's have an inventory of what we own and we can make \ndecisions better as to whether some of that land could be sold or \nwhether we need to retain it all, but at least we will know how much it \ncosts to retain it and how much we have.\n  I think that is a very good amendment. I can't imagine anyone voting \nagainst it. And, if it is adopted, it in no way should affect the \nlegislation being passed by the House of Representatives. I know there \nis an intention that when the bill passes here in the Senate--assuming \nit does--it would immediately be taken up in the House and would be \npassed in the House in the form passed by the Senate and then would go \nto the President for his signature. There is nothing in here requiring \na report of Federal lands that would upset that issue.\n  The final amendment is technical and it may be considered to be a \nminor matter, but it is an improvement in the law we have. Again, I \nthink it does no damage to the overall piece of legislation--the \nomnibus lands bill. It corrects a little piece that needs correcting, \nand here is what it does. We all know that if you take fossils or other \nvaluable artifacts or rocks from a national park, for example, and you \ncollect that or you try to sell it, you are guilty of a very serious \ncrime, and we intend to prosecute people who do that. We have had far \ntoo many thefts of valuable things, including fossils, petrified wood, \nIndian artifacts, and that sort of thing from our Federal lands, and it \nis important to have legislation that continues to criminalize that. \nHowever, if I take my grandkids on a vacation and one of them picks up \na rock and brings it home to show his buddies and it may or may not \ncontain--maybe it is a little teeny piece of petrified wood, for \nexample, should he be prosecuted in the same way that a person who is \ndeliberately doing this to sell would be prosecuted?\n  The law is sufficiently unclear on this. The underlying bill attempts \nto correct that problem and it comes within one word of correcting it \nproperly. What it says is that the Secretary ``may'' write rules that \nallow for the casual collection of these items; and that is a good \nthing, for the Secretary to write rules that provide some exception if \na little child happens to pick up a rock and it has theoretically some \nvalue to it. In order to ensure that this is done, Senator Coburn \nsimply changes the word ``may'' to ``shall,'' that the Secretary \n``shall'' write rules that allow for the casual collection of these \nkinds of rocks. That makes sure it gets done. It doesn't tell the \nSecretary what he has to do, how he has to do it, or anything else. The \nSecretary could theoretically write a rule that says the only time this \never happens is if it is exactly midnight on a Tuesday or something \nsuch as that. So we are not telling him he has to make this a \nwidespread thing; we are not saying he should not protect our precious \nassets--and indeed we want him to--but we do want him to write these \nrules so that a casual collector would not be penalized under the \nrelatively harsh penalties that exist in the law today, and as I said \nearlier, appropriately so. It is a technical change. It is a minor \nchink. It should not cause anyone to not vote for the larger bill if, \nin fact, the amendment is adopted.\n\n  So those are the four amendments. As I say, my colleague has two \nother amendments and I need to study them more carefully to know \nwhether I will support them, but I urge my colleagues to support these \nfour amendments of Senator Coburn. I think they all make an important \ncontribution to the bill. I am delighted he has been able to offer the \namendments. I appreciate the cooperation of the majority leader in \nagreeing for him to be able to do that.\n  My understanding is we will continue to debate these amendments this \nafternoon and this evening and then tomorrow there will be votes on all \nof these amendments prior to the vote on final passage of the bill, \nwhich I think is supposed to occur tomorrow evening, but in any event, \nin the not too distant future. So I urge my colleagues to consider \nthese amendments.\n  If you have questions about them, I urge you to talk to Senator \nCoburn so he can explain in detail what they are and are not intended \nto do. If you think in any way that they are deficient or need to be \nmodified in some way, approach him with regard to that. I did that last \nnight and he responded to some of my suggestions about, for example, \nadding the provision in the report that would allow a classified annex \nfor those portions of the land that need to be protected. I am sure he \nwill be willing to listen to folks if they have any concerns about his \namendments, but don't vote against them on the theory that you don't \ncare to know what is in them or if there is any change to this bill, it \nwon't pass the House. That is not true. These are important amendments \nand, in some cases, benign amendments and I think they deserve our \nattention. I hope my colleagues would be willing to give these their \nserious consideration when the amendments are voted.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               AIG Bonuses\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise first to talk about an issue so \nmany of us have been deeply concerned about--frankly, beyond concerned \nbut outraged by--and that is what is happening with AIG and the effect \nof the decision the executives made there about bonuses, in relation to \nour economy. I think it is important to step back from the obvious \nfrustration we have. So many Americans are expressing their outrage and \nanger, and a deep sense of betrayal has been generated almost because \nof this action. I want to step back for a second and review where we \nare.\n  Basically, what we have is an American company of international reach \nthat has said to the American people: We know you gave us $170 billion, \nat last count; you gave us your tax money because we were in trouble. \nAnd we have to ask them: Why were you in trouble?\n  One of the big reasons is because a group of employees in one \ndivision of AIG developed schemes. That is the best word to describe \nwhat they developed. These were sophisticated schemes to make money, \nwhich caused the near collapse of this company. That is what we are \ntalking about. This isn't complicated. It is that simple. The employees \nof that division concocted these schemes to make money, and now the \ncompany is in near collapse, while the American people--the American \ntaxpayers--were asked through their elected representatives, through \ntheir Government, to provide tens of billions in help--by one count, \n$170 billion in help. And what do we get for that? We got little in the \nway of accountability with all these transactions AIG has entered into, \nvery little in the way of accountability, and now we find out this past \nweekend that the very division--not just a broad section of employees \nbut the very division that concocted the schemes that led to the \nproblems is getting tens of millions in bonuses--$160 million, $165 \nmillion in bonuses. So this is beyond the insult of getting billions \nand tens of billions and hundreds of billions in taxpayer help and then \nasking for bonuses for anyone. This is much worse than that. This is \ngiving bonuses to the people in the very division that caused most, if \nnot all, of the problems at AIG that taxpayers were then called upon to \nprovide some remedy or rescue. That is the outrage here. That is the \ninsult to the American people, that this company now is thumbing its \nnose at the American people.\n\n  This comes at a time when, for example, in Pennsylvania, our \nemployment rate hit 7 percent. I never thought we\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nwould get to an unemployment rate that high. Thank God we have been a \nlittle lower than the national rate, but 7 percent is a very high \nnumber in any State, and many States have been there for a year or \nmore. So we have been spared somewhat in Pennsylvania. But at the very \ntime we have an unemployment rate of 7 percent, when people have lost \ntheir homes, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their hopes and \ntheir dreams, we have a major international company that got what comes \nfrom the sweat and blood and work of the American people, they got the \nbenefit of all that, the $170 billion in taxpayer help, and what do we \nget for it? We get the insult and the betrayal of bonuses to the very \npeople who caused the problem. You couldn't write fiction as disturbing \nas this or as outrageous as this.\n  So I and others have said to the company very plainly--as I said in a \nletter today when I gave them two choices, neither of which they may go \nalong with--I said have these employees forgo the bonuses or fire them. \nSimple as that. And if you are not going to take the step and ask them \nor somehow compel them for the good of the country, if not for the good \nof their own well-being, their own ethics, to forgo these bonuses, then \nthey should be fired.\n  Now, I realize they may say: That is an interesting suggestion from \nCongress, but we are not going to do either. Well, if they want to go \ndown that path, then Congress will act. The Finance Committee of the \nSenate, as the Presiding Officer knows, is working on a piece of \nlegislation right now. If there is legislation that says we are going \nto tax these bonuses at 70 or 80 or 90 percent, I, along with other \npeople, am going to vote for it. Whatever it takes to impose the \nmaximum amount of penalty or punishment--pick your phrase--as long as \nit is legal and constitutional, we are going to support it. The \nAmerican people have every right to demand that Congress take action \nbecause they are the ones who have been insulted at the worst time. \nThey have been kicked in the face at a time when they have been \nstruggling month after month, despite all of the promises from \ncompanies that they would get back on track with taxpayer help.\n  So that is what is happening. The American people will monitor this. \nAnd stay tuned, because it is not over today. We can do more than \nexpress outrage. We can take action, and I think that is appropriate in \nthis instance.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              AIG Bonuses\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, most Americans have read in their \nnewspaper and heard on news accounts the story about the company called \nAIG that has been the recipient of some $170 billion of guarantees by \nthe American taxpayers, because of an unbelievably failed business \nstrategy and being involved in very risky financial products.\n  They had an outfit in London with several hundred people in it who \nwere involved in trading credit default swaps and steered that company \nright into a ditch. We have recently learned that that company, which \nhas lost a substantial amount of money, just paid $165 million in \nbonuses to executives in its financial products unit, and the American \npeople are furious about it and should be.\n  I think it is a disgrace that a company that has been engaged in the \nkind of essential wagering that has been involved in here is now paying \nbonuses. What do they teach in business school, that a company that \nloses money and helps create a significant problem for this country's \neconomy ought to be paying bonuses, especially after they received \nAmerican taxpayers' funds, to employees who helped the company lose \nmoney?\n  I want to mention one additional point. I think it is disgraceful to \nhave those kinds of bonuses being announced for AIG employees. But we \nhave another circumstance that is even worse. Merrill Lynch lost $27 \nbillion last year and still paid $3.6 billion in bonuses to its \nemployees last December.\n  There were 694 employees of that company got more than $1 million \neach in bonuses. Think of it. And then, by the way, a week or two \nlater, the company that took them over, Bank of America, got tens of \nbillions more of TARP funds from the American taxpayer.\n  All of this is disgraceful. My colleagues and I have decided we are \ngoing to do everything we can to try to claw back those bonuses. They \ndo not deserve bonuses. Where is the responsibility here on the part of \npeople who helped steer this economy into the ditch? Where is the \nresponsibility on the part of people who made bad business decisions, \nthat in Merrill Lynch's case lost $27 billion in a year, and then \ndecide, you know what, let's decide how much we should pay in bonuses \nthis year?\n  Well, you know what, the answer ought to be, zero. Where do you get \nthe notion you pay bonuses for losing money? Where do you get off \ndeciding you are going to pay bonuses after you have taken tens and \ntens of billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money, through TARP funds \nand other emergency assistance, and then sit around and say, all right, \nnow we have had to take all of this taxpayer money because we have lost \na bunch of money because we gambled, we had several hundred people in \nthat office in London who had massive gambling enterprises going on and \ncredit default swaps, and so now we decide we are going to pay them \nbonuses. I do not understand that.\n  By the way, there is another issue, a very short issue. All of the \ncounterparties who are getting money that the taxpayers are sending \ninto AIG are being recompensed to the tune of 100 percent. Where is \nthis notion about everybody sacrificing a bit? Why is it that the big \ninterests that are counterparties to this are getting a 100-percent \nreturn on their investment? How about taking a haircut here? But nobody \nis doing that. Everybody is sitting around trying to figure out, how do \nI get mine, even in circumstances where employees now are getting big \nbonuses for losing money.\n  There has to be some accountability at some point. What is happening \nis disgraceful. And we have every right and responsibility as a \nCongress to decide that we are going to try to claw back these ill-\ngotten bonuses.\n  The AIG bonuses for the employees in its financial products unit \ncould total as much as $450 million. Fifty-five million was paid in \nDecember. The outrage right now is about $165 million paid last week. \nBut there is another $230 million in AIG bonuses that could come later \nthis year or next. It is time for this Congress to take a stand on \nbehalf of the American people. We need to claw back those bonuses. We \nneed to say to all of those companies: No more. We are not going to put \nup with it anymore. This is disgraceful. How about some economic \npatriotism? How about standing up for the interests of this country and \nthe interests of these taxpayers?\n  I will have more to say about it tomorrow, but I wanted to point out \nthat the anger around this country, reading this kind of nonsense, is \npalpable and real. This Congress understands it and we are going to do \neverything we can to try to claw back these bonuses that, in my \njudgment, are disgraceful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my presentation, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Brown be recognized for up to 5 minutes. Following \nSenator Brown, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Coburn be \nrecognized. I see\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nSenator Thune on the floor. Does he wish to be recognized after Senator \nCoburn?\n  Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to object, as of right now, Brown for \n5? Coburn?\n  Mr. REID. I understand he wants to speak for about 40 minutes. I am \nsure, knowing Dr. Coburn, if you have a short statement, he would not \ncare. How long do you wish to speak?\n  Mr. THUNE. For 7 minutes.\n  We will work it out on our side.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that Senator Thune be recognized. Senator Coburn \nwants to lay down his amendments. I will renew this consent request in \na minute. I withdraw the consent at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3149-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REPEALING AUTOMATIC PAY ADJUSTMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. REID. The recently passed Omnibus appropriations bill completed \nunfinished business from the Bush administration, which funded the \nGovernment to provide critically needed services for the American \npeople. The omnibus that was signed into law last week also eliminated \nthe congressional cost-of-living adjustment for 2010.\n  During debate on that bill, I sought unanimous consent of this body \nto take up and pass freestanding legislation to permanently end the \nautomatic cost-of-living adjustment and instead require Members of \nCongress to vote for or against all future adjustments.\n  Especially in this hour of economic crisis, the overwhelming majority \nof Democrats and Republicans would agree that we should end this \npractice of automatic adjustments. Senator Feingold has championed this \ncause for a long time, 17 years to be exact. I applaud him for his \nleadership. Others have tried to take this issue from Senator Feingold, \nbut it is his issue and has been, I repeat, for 17 years. This should \nhave passed last Tuesday when I asked unanimous consent for the bill to \npass. One week later, let's see who objects to passing this bill. It \nshould have been done last week.\n  An overwhelming bipartisan majority of Senators is undeterred by the \nobstruction that took place last week. Passing this legislation to \npermanently end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for Members is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Absent any further objections, we should do so right now and pass it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 620, introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 620) to repeal the provision of law that \n     provides automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 620) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF AUTOMATIC PAY ADJUSTMENTS FOR \n                   MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 601(a) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) is \n     repealed.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--Section 601(a)(1) \n     of such Act is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(a)(1)'' and inserting ``(a)'';\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) as \n     paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), respectively; and\n       (3) by striking ``as adjusted by paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection'' and inserting ``adjusted as provided by law''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     December 31, 2010.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend our majority leader for moving \nthis legislation through the Senate. I have introduced legislation like \nthis for the past six Congresses, and am delighted that, because of \nSenator Reid's leadership, this proposal has finally passed the Senate.\n  Congress has the power to raise its own pay, something that most of \nour constituents cannot do. Because this is such a singular power, \nCongress ought to exercise it openly, and subject to regular procedures \nincluding debate, amendment, and a vote.\n  But current law allows Congress to avoid that public debate and vote. \nAll that is necessary for Congress to get a pay raise is that nothing \nbe done to stop it. The annual pay raise takes effect unless Congress \nacts.\n  That stealth pay raise mechanism began with a change Congress enacted \nin the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that act, Members \nof Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal \nto half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one \nmeasure of inflation.\n  On occasion Congress has voted to deny itself the raise, and the \ntraditional vehicle for the pay raise vote is the Treasury \nappropriations bill. But that vehicle is not always made available to \nthose who want a public debate and vote on the matter. As I have noted \nin the past, getting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise is a \nhaphazard affair at best, and it should not be that way. The burden \nshould not be on those who seek a public debate and recorded vote on \nthe Member pay raise. On the contrary, Congress should have to act if \nit decides to award itself a hike in pay. This process of pay raises \nwithout accountability must end.\n  I was pleased to join with the junior Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nVitter, in offering an amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill \nrecently. That amendment received strong support, support which was all \nthe more remarkable because many of the amendment's potential \nsupporters felt constrained to oppose it in order to keep the \nunderlying legislation free of amendments. I commend Senator Vitter for \nhis efforts to end this system. Now, thanks to our majority leader, we \nhave a real chance to do so.\n  This issue is not a new question. It was something that our Founders \nconsidered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part \nof the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that \nincluded what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of \nRepresentatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that \nCongress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. On \nSeptember 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September \nof 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan Legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the States.\n  The 27th amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I honor that limitation. Throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the \nrate of pay that Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in \nas a Senator. And I return to the Treasury any cost-of-living \nadjustments or pay raises during my term. I don't take a raise until my \nbosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is \nthe spirit of the 27th amendment, and at the very least the stealth pay \nraises permitted under the current system certainly violate that \nspirit.\n  This practice must end, and I am delighted to say that thanks to \nMajority Leader Reid, we have a real chance at ending it. I urge the \nHouse of Representatives to take this bill up and pass it right away, \nso we can assure the American people that we are serious about ending a \nsystem that was devised to provide us with regular pay increases \nwithout any accountability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3149-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3149-S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR AND WAR OF 1812 BATTLEFIELD PROTECTION ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBrown be recognized for 5 minutes--\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if the leader would yield, I think the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nfrom Oklahoma will lay down his amendments, which would take up to a \nhalf an hour, 40 minutes. Whenever he concludes, I ask that I proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, be recognized for up to 5 minutes; that Senator \nCoburn be recognized to lay down whatever amendments he chooses, and \nspeak up to one-half hour; that following that time Senator Thune then \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  AIG\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the unemployment rate in my State of Ohio \nis 8.8 percent. The poverty rate is 13.1 percent. Lines at food \npantries snake around buildings and down the street. In AIG, executives \nare receiving $1 million bonuses. Failed executives, executives who \nhave made a mess of their company, are receiving $1 million bonuses. \nWhen the house of cards AIG built eventually collapsed, the Bush \nadministration, then the Obama administration, provided financial \nsupport. They had no choice; doing nothing in the face of AIG's \ncollapse could turn a national economic downturn into a full-blown, \ndecades-long economic collapse. But what do you tell a Cincinnatian who \nhas lost her job or a Clevelander who has lost their home or someone in \nMansfield, OH, who is standing in line at a food pantry when they hear \nthat AIG executives are earning millions in bonuses as they suck up \ntaxpayer dollars, tens and tens and tens of billions of taxpayer \ndollars like a vacuum?\n  I am going to tell them we are not only going after those bonuses, we \nare going after the corporate-centric, consequences-free culture that \nfueled those million-dollar bonuses. Many of my conservative colleagues \ndon't believe in regulation. I would like one of them to stand with a \nstraight face and tell the American public that overregulation is the \nreason AIG accepted taxpayer-funded Government aid and then gave \nmillion-dollar bonuses to its employees.\n  How did AIG dig itself into this hole? How did the Bush \nadministration, which simply didn't do the regulation they should have \ndone, let it happen? In the short-term, either AIG CEO Edward Liddy, \ninstalled by the Bush administration months ago, needs to renegotiate \nthese bonus contracts to get taxpayer money back or the employees need \nto give up their bonuses voluntarily or Congress and the administration \nneed to act to get these dollars back. That means we impose a one-time \ntax on these employees on so-called retention bonuses. If we impose a \none-time tax on these employees that approximates their net bonuses, so \nbe it.\n  Usually after a statement that begins ``in the short-term,'' there \nfollows a statement that begins ``in the long-term.'' Not this time. In \nthe short-term, we need to return these bonuses to taxpayers, and in \nthe short-term we need to change the rules of the road so no company, \nno matter how big, such as AIG, which accepts TARP funds, can fritter \naway those dollars on huge pay packages and lavish bonuses, as the \nSenator from North Dakota pointed out, while passing through those tax \ndollars and making whole companies such as Goldman Sachs of New York, \nBarclays in London, Societe Generale in Paris, Deutsche Bank in \nGermany, American taxpayer dollars passing through AIG executives' \nhands going directly to those foreign and domestic banks making them \nwhole, when they made bad decisions just like AIG made bad decisions. \nIn the short term, not the long term, maybe most importantly of all, we \nneed to rewrite Federal regulations to prevent the arrogance and \nrecklessness and the greed and self-aggrandizement from turning \nfinancial institutions into a weight around America's neck and \npickpockets robbing the American people. It is what we have to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that instead of going in the \norder that the unanimous consent had requested, Senator Vitter from \nLouisiana be recognized for 5 minutes, then followed by myself, and \nthen followed by Senator Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                          Automatic Pay Raises\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the action the Senate \ntook by unanimous consent, passing my language to get rid of the \nautomatic pay raises for Members of Congress through the Senate. I \nthank Senator Reid for joining in this effort after my amendment was \nmade in order on the Omnibus appropriations bill. I thank everyone who \ncooperated in passing this by unanimous consent. I was happy to give \nthat consent for my part since my vote on an amendment on another bill \nwas no longer at stake, so it wouldn't drain votes away from my \namendment. We did come together to do that, and we did pass this \nthrough the Senate. Obviously, this is a bicameral legislature so the \nstory is not over. I encourage everyone to come together and \nencourage--no, do more than encourage--pressure the House of \nRepresentatives to do the right thing and pass this reform. The last \nweek has proven what can be changed when we come together and listen to \nthe voice of the people.\n  A week ago this wasn't on radar. This was not a possibility. Today it \nhas passed the Senate. How did that happen? It happened because we \nbrought up the issue. We came together. I joined with Senator Feingold, \nwho has been an advocate of this issue for some time. We had an open \ndebate. The people's voices from around the country were heard, and we \nreacted to that in a positive way. I say that because it proves what \ncan happen in the House. The House leadership has made clear they don't \nwant to bring up this matter. They certainly don't want to pass this \nbill into law. But we can change that, even more than that, the \nAmerican people can change that and call their House Members and demand \nthat the leadership have a fair vote and pass this into law.\n  I thank Senator Reid for changing his language from last week and \nadopting mine so there would be no further automatic pay raises in the \nnear future, if this bill is adopted. Under his standalone bill filed \nlast week, there would have been at least one more autopilot automatic \npay raise to go into effect. Under my original language, which he \nadopted in this latest version which just passed through the Senate by \nunanimous consent, that is not the case. It would change the autopilot \nautomatic pay raise system immediately. That was an important and \nnecessary correction on his part. I thank him for making that \ncorrection.\n  We are on a bipartisan roll. Let's keep it up. Let's bring that \nspirit, that public debate, let's bring that public pressure to the \nHouse of Representatives. When the people are involved and when their \nvoice is heard, it is amazing what can change around here and what can \nget done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 680 To Amendment No. 684\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will spend some time tonight offering \ntwo amendments to the bill under consideration.\n  I begin by asking: Why is it in the midst of all the problems that \nface the country, the Senate is going to spend time on an omnibus lands \npackage? It is no emergency. There is no crisis. There is nothing \ncritical about it. Instead of working on the problems that are in front \nof this country, we will spend the next 2\\1/2\\ days or next 1\\1/2\\ days \non a 1,243-page bill that has 170 separate bills in it that, in fact, \nfor the average American doesn't come anywhere close to being a \npriority. One has to ask that question. Why are we doing this? We don't \nhave anything better to do. We don't have anything more important to \ndo. If that is the case, we probably should go on until we do have \nsomething that can make a significant change in the country.\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\n  I call up amendment No. 680.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 680.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that the general public has full access to our \nnational parks and to promote the health and safety of all visitors and \n                employees of the National Park Service)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATIONS ON NEW CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of the Interior (acting through the Director of the \n     National Park Service) (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall not begin any new construction in units \n     of the National Park System until the Secretary determines \n     that all existing sites, structures, trails, and \n     transportation infrastructure of the National Park Service \n     are--\n       (1) fully operational;\n       (2) fully accessible to the public; and\n       (3) pose no health or safety risk to the general public or \n     employees of the National Park Service.\n       (b) Exclusions.--Subsection (a) shall not affect--\n       (1) the replacement of existing structures in cases in \n     which rehabilitation costs exceed new construction costs; or\n       (2) any new construction that the Secretary determines to \n     be necessary for public safety.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I spent about an hour this afternoon talking about the \nproblems of the National Park Service. They are severe. I introduced \ninto the record the GAO report on the problems at the Department of \nInterior, as well as the testimony of the acting inspector general, \nMary Kendall, about the significant problems that parks are \nexperiencing. Our parks are falling down. The maintenance backlog, \naccording to the Park Service, is $8.9 billion. But according to the \ntestimony of the GAO, it is somewhere between $13 and $19 billion.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. What it says is, before we \nstart anything new and new parks, we are going to bring up-to-date what \nshould be brought up-to-date in the parks we have today. That is \nimportant because they need to be fully operational. They need to be \nfully accessible to the public which many are not now because of \nmaintenance backlogs. They need to pose no safety or health risk for \nboth the employees of the parks and the Department of Interior as well \nas the American citizen, some 270 million who visit them every year.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It says we are going to do \nsomething we don't often do. We are going to prioritize how we spend \nmoney in the parks. What we are saying is, we are not going to do any \nnew construction in terms of units of the national park system until \nthe Secretary--and this is left to the Secretary, not us--determines \nthat the existing sites, the structures, trails and transportation \ninfrastructure of the National Park Service are fully operational, \nfully accessible to the public, and pose no health or safety risk to \neither the public or park employees.\n  We have thought about other things. We want to make sure there is an \nexclusion in there. If something is going to cost more to repair than \nto build something new, we say build something new. The other thing, \nanything that the Secretary deems is important for public safety that \nis new, we let them do that as well. All this is saying is with this \n$10 billion of new authorizations and $900 million of mandatory \nspending accompanying this bill, the first thing we ought to do is take \ncare of what we have before we start off on another project.\n  The crown jewels of our national parks are fading. They are fading \nbecause we won't take care of them. The backlog since the last time we \nconsidered this bill has grown by $400 million. That is just what we \nknow since the last time we considered this bill. The other thing we \nknow from the GAO report is there is a marked risk to both employees \nand the public in many areas of our national parks. The other thing we \nknow is many of our best parks, the Grand Canyon, for example, a large \nnumber of the trails are in such disrepair that they are closed. The \npeople can't access them because we haven't said put the money where it \nneeds to go to make sure we keep the things we have today operational \nand pristine. So it is straightforward.\n  What we also know is that the agency needs some help in terms of \npriorities. In spite of what we have had, oftentimes we are sending \nthem messages to do something else that is not within these priorities. \nAll we are saying is, we have these wonderful assets. Before we go \ncreate new assets and new things to enjoy, let's take care of the ones \nwe have. We would not build a new addition onto our own homes when the \nwhole rest of the home is collapsing from lack of maintenance. The \nfirst thing we would do is take care of the home, the maintenance of \nthe home.\n  The bill in front of us actually has the potential to make the \nsituation in our parks worse. It is because we are going to mandate \ncertain things in the bill that will take away from true priorities of \nmaintaining our existing structures.\n  A recent memo prepared by the Facility Management Division of the \nNational Park Service reveals at least 10 States where the National \nPark Service backlog exceeds $100 million. At least 20 States have \nfacilities with deferred maintenance exceeding $50 million. That \nexcludes $4 billion that is sitting there for roads and bridges in our \nnational parks. This is in spite of the historically high \nappropriations levels we have sent to the parks.\n  I listed earlier--and I will not list again--all the things the \nNational Park Service is responsible for. But it is a litany that, when \nyou look at it, is almost incomprehensible that one agency can take \ncare of everything we have asked them to take care of.\n  The USS Arizona now faces a maintenance backlog of $33.4 million; the \nGettysburg National Battlefield site, $29.4 million; the Statue of \nLiberty Park has a backlog of $196 million. Are we going to let it fall \napart while we create something new or should we take care of what we \nhave first?\n  What we do know from both the inspector general's report and the GAO \nis the Park Service is denying access in an increasing number of areas \nbecause of the growing maintenance backlog.\n  Representative Rob Bishop is from Utah. The Dinosaur National \nMonument is largely inaccessible due to its overwhelming backlog. The \ncenter is designed so a kid can go in there and see, within the \nmountainside, the fossils that are there and see what scientists say \nabout those fossils and then be able to put all that together in their \nmind. Unfortunately, no one has been able to access this building for \n10 years--for 10 years--because we do not have enough money to fix the \nbuilding and it has been condemned.\n  So here is an area where there is great educational value, great \nhistorical value and for 10 years the building has been condemned and \nwe have not put the money there. This amendment is meant to fix what is \nwrong now before we spend money on new things.\n  According to the inspector general of the Department of Interior, \nfinancial management has remained a top challenge for the Department, \nand their work--this is the inspector general--has documented decades \nof maintenance, health, and safety issues that place Interior \nDepartment employees at a health and safety risk, as well as the \npublic.\n  A report by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees found \nwidespread evidence of major problems that will be evident, including \ndecreased safety for visitors, longer emergency response times, \nendangerment of protected resources, and dirtier and less well-\nmaintained parks. The problem will only grow worse in the coming years \nif we pass this bill and do not prioritize the maintenance backlog.\n  It is noted that at the Grand Canyon, the cross-canyon water line is \ndeteriorating so badly that it had 30 leaks this year and is in danger \nof failing entirely. Yet we did not spend any money on that in this \nbill. We did not authorize them to fix it. We are not about taking \ncare; we are about solving our own political situation.\n  At Yellowstone, 10,000 gallons of raw sewage this past year leaked \nfrom a broken pipe and flowed into a trout-spawning stream in \nYellowstone National Park. It is the absence of maintenance. We know \nthe life expectancy of many of these infrastructures, and\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nyet we have not done anything about it.\n  Carlsbad Caverns--a great experience. Sewer lines were actually \nleaking into the caves because of deferred maintenance. Superintendent \nBenjamin said: Believe me, if there's sewage dripping down into the \ncavern, people are not going to believe we are doing a good job.\n  No kidding. Well, that starts with us.\n  The National Park System has grown to almost 400 units, 84 million \nacres, and a $9.6 billion maintenance backlog. That is according to the \nPark Service. It is much higher if you look at the GAO's numbers.\n  We appropriated $540 million for new land acquisition from 2001 to \n2008. We have increased the number of National Heritage Areas since \n2000 from 18 to 40. We added 10 more in January of this year. In the \n110th Congress, 35 bills were introduced to expand the National Wild \nand Scenic Rivers.\n  The National Park Service already manages over 3,000 miles of scenic \nrivers. This bill includes 1,200 miles. But yet the maintenance \ndollars, the dollars put there to take care of what we have, are not \nthere.\n  In April of 2008, the Congress passed and the President signed the \nConsolidated Natural Resources Act. That was another big lands bill \nthat impacted land and property rights in over 30 States. It authorized \n$380 million in new spending and not one way of paying for it and none \nof it for maintenance backlogs.\n  What we also know is this agency, the Department of Interior, is \nunable to prioritize the maintenance of existing obligations over new \ncommitments. They get mixed signals. We say: Go do this new one. And \nthen we send appropriations dollars and say: You have to spend it on \nthis rather than taking care of a rotting sewage line.\n  Until we in Congress and the administration prioritize the \nmaintenance of our existing national parks, these problems are going to \ngrow. There is no excuse for it.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 679 to Amendment No. 684\n\n  So I would put forward this is a simple amendment. It does not cost \nus anything. It actually saves us money because to repair something \nthat is falling down--before it gets to that stage--is much cheaper \nthan waiting until it is a catastrophe. Consequently, if we were to \nplan appropriately, and if we were to direct the funds appropriately, \nwe would be repairing that which we need to repair so we do not spend \nextra dollars once they have failed.\n  My hope is we will get positive consideration of this amendment. This \nis a commonsense amendment. People at home would do the same thing. \nThey take care of what they have before they go and add something else \nthat is going to take away money that is required to maintain what they \nhave.\n  I would say, again, individuals do not build additions to their homes \nwhen the roof and the foundation is caving in and neither should the \nPark Service and neither should Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that amendment No. 679 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 679 to amendment No. 684.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to provide for the future energy needs of the United States \n   and eliminate restrictions on the development of renewable energy)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ON PUBLIC LAND.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall restrict the development of renewable energy \n     on public land, including geothermal, solar, and wind energy \n     and related transmission infrastructure.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to read this amendment because it \nis very short and very straightforward:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall restrict the development of renewable energy--\n\n  ``Renewable energy''--\n\n     on public land, including geothermal, solar, and wind energy \n     and related transmission infrastructure.\n\n  Very straightforward. We had a great experience with the harsh \nreality that we are energy dependent this past summer. It is going to \ncome back again. Unfortunately or fortunately--depending on how you \nlook at it--in the West, where the Government owns 1 out of every 2 \nacres, the vast majority of geothermal land resides.\n  What you will see--as indicated on this map--through this area, \nthrough southern California, along the coast of California, and Oregon, \nIdaho, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, some areas of Montana, Wyoming, \nand Arizona, is where the vast resources of a clean renewable energy \nexists: geothermal.\n  The only problem is, in this bill we gut a large portion of that and \nsay we can never touch it. Well, why would we, if we believe in climate \nchange--and I am a skeptic, but I will take that point for a moment. \nLet's say we believe in climate change and we want to have energy \nproduced that does not increase the CO2 content of the \natmosphere. Why would we pass a bill that takes and restricts a large \nportion of this area from geothermal?\n  We know in Nevada and Arizona, for example, solar is a massive source \nfor clean energy. Yet in this bill, in both the wilderness areas and \nthe heritage areas and all these other areas, we are going to restrict \nnot only the utilization of geothermal and wind and solar but also the \nability to capture it and move it somewhere else.\n  Well, if we take all this area for geothermal, and if you concentrate \nNevada and Arizona in terms of the solar and then you look at the wind \ncorridor that comes up through here, as shown on this map, and say you \ncannot send a transmission line anywhere across any of these \nproperties, what we are doing is shooting ourselves in the foot. We do \nnot want carbon-based energy. And now, where the Government owns 650 \nmillion acres, we do not want wind, solar or geothermal. Why would we \ndo that?\n  I guess we are going to go all nuclear. We do not see any nuclear \ncoming from the President. We do not see any nuclear coming from \nanywhere else. So what are we going to have? We are going to have no \nenergy.\n  So we are going to limit hydrocarbon energy, and then we are going to \ntake our greatest sources for wind, solar and geothermal and we are \ngoing to say: Sorry, that is off limits. You cannot use it here. You \ncannot extract it.\n  Geothermal is so powerful because it is a direct conversion. We \ncapture steam and we capture a temperature gradient that turns a \nturbine that puts off nothing but water vapor--no CO2, no \nnitrous oxide, no sulfur dioxide. It is free energy. Yet in this bill \nwe are going to take 2.2 million acres out of these areas and say: You \ncannot touch it for renewable energy. Why would we do that? So all this \namendment says is you can do whatever you want on all these areas, as \nwhat we have done in the bill, but you cannot exclude it from renewable \nenergy.\n  I am reminded, everybody wants renewable energy, but they just do not \nwant it in their own backyard. Everybody wants us to have wind. We love \nwind. We have turbines like crazy in Oklahoma, like they do in North \nDakota and South Dakota and several other States. We are happy to have \nit. But if you applied the same thing to Oklahoma, in terms of \nwilderness areas, we would not have any of the windmills that are \ngenerating a significant portion of our alternative renewable energy \ntoday in Oklahoma. More importantly, you would not be able to transport \nthe energy you are creating that is renewable, that does not create \nCO2, that does not supposedly contribute to ``climate \nchange.''\n  We are going to pass a bill that is going to significantly restrict \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\nWhat are we thinking? Why would we limit alternative renewable energy \naccess in all these Federal lands, this extra 2.2 million to 3 million \nacres? Why would we do that? It is almost like we have a death wish. \nEither that or we are not thinking, we are not considering what we are \ngoing to need in the future. We are considering the short term, but we \nare not considering the long term.\n  So this map shows us specifically where geothermal is available. If \nyou look down in southern California, we have heritage areas. Knock it \nout. If you look in Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Arizona, New \nMexico, we have heritage areas. We knock it out, saying: You can never \nutilize this land to capture clean alternative renewable energy. That \nis ludicrous.\n  So all this amendment does is say: Yes, you can. We are going to do \neverything else under the heritage areas, under the wilderness areas, \nunder all the other restrictions we put in this bill, but we are going \nto capture renewable, clean energy for the American people. We should \ndo nothing, given the fact that we are in trouble on energy and we \ndon't even know it right now.\n\n  What we know is the supply-demand glide is going like this and we are \nin a recession now, and we don't feel it, but as we lock in and cut \nexploration for natural gas in this country, we will see a twofold \nincrease in natural gas within the next 18 months. We know that because \nwe have built reserves every year until this year in natural gas. We \nknow we consume 4.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas every year in \nthis country. As they shut down the exploration for known areas of \nnatural gas because the price is under $4, what we know is the demand \nis not going to decrease significantly over what it is because we have \ngone to alternative sources for power generation--a lot of it natural \ngas--that the demand is going to increase and the supply is going to \nbecome static.\n  What is going to happen? The price of natural gas is going to go up. \nWhat is that going to do to utility bills? Before we do a monstrous \ncap-and-trade that is going to severely raise everybody's electrical \nrates in this country, we are going to limit an alternative supply for \nelectricity with this bill, because we are going to limit the access to \ngeothermal, we are going to limit the access to wind, and we are going \nto limit the access to solar, and solar thermal electricity generation.\n  I have trouble figuring it out. It must be my commonness being from \nOklahoma, but I can't figure out why we would--I know we are going to \ncut one leg off in terms of going green over the next 20 years. I can't \nfigure out why we are cutting off the other leg. I am wondering what we \nare going to use for power in this country. If we are going to severely \nlimit alternative renewable, nonpolluting energy that is clean and we \nare going to massively limit--as the Department of Interior is \nalready--exploration for hydrocarbon-based fuels, and we are going to \nlimit the significance of coal, of which we have over 300 years \navailable to us, what are we going to use for energy? We are also going \nto slow down the permitting process and the loans for nuclear, so what \nare we going to use? What is going to keep the lights on?\n  This amendment is about keeping the lights on in a way that nobody \nshould be able to object to. It is not carbon based. It is a renewable, \nit is essentially almost free, it is something we can capture without \nany significant greenhouse effect. Yet we are going to limit it with \nthis bill. I think it is significantly foolish on our part.\n  What we know is that this 140 million acres we see here, if we add in \nwhat is already in wilderness areas, what is already off limits in \nterms of national forests and Federal lands, you add in--and this does \nnot include except a small portion of Alaska--we are going to markedly \nlimit our resources. Ninety percent of all the geothermal capability in \nthis country--a clean source for renewable energy--is found on Federal \nlands. As we grow the limitations on Federal lands, what we are going \nto do is take that 90 percent and we are going to take anywhere from 50 \nto 70 percent of that and say you can't have it. There are 29 million \nacres with solar potential in six southwestern States--these six \nStates. If you can't transmit the power through power lines, if you \ncan't disturb the soil to build, whether you put it above ground or \nunderground, if you can't cross a river with a power line either \noverhead or under the river, how are we going to transmit the power? \nWhat we are saying is we believe in renewable, clean energy, but we \ndon't.\n  The other point I wish to make is we now have in this country in \nwilderness areas alone 108 million acres. Do you know how many acres we \nhave in developed land in this country? It is 106 million. Not counting \nthe Federal lands outside of wilderness, which is 650 million acres, we \nhave 108 million acres of wilderness and only 106 million acres of \ndeveloped land. Where do we stop to the point where we don't steal away \nfrom the future potential energy production in this country? I am not \ntalking carbon based; I am talking noncarbon based. How do we get the \npower from geothermal from these concentrated areas to the west coast \nand back to the upper Midwest if we can't cross any of these areas? And \nthen, what is the cost and what is the line loss load when we have to \ndo something such as this and then go underground and then come back \nup? It becomes prohibitive, and then we lose all advantage from \nrenewable energy.\n  The other area we know where we have tremendous potential in all of \nthese areas and others is biomass. We have a tremendous source. \nApproximately one-third of the 747 million acres across the United \nStates is covered in forest land. Fifty-seven percent of those forests \nare owned by the Federal Government. Also, 590 million wet tons of \nbiomass are available in the U.S. annually--590 million tons. Sixteen \npercent of renewable energy generated right now from electricity comes \nfrom biomass and 3 percent of our total energy in the year 2000. I \ndon't have the dates for where we are today.\n  Here is what the U.S. Forest Service says: ``The technology to \ngenerate energy from wood has entered a new millennium with virtually \nlimitless possibilities.''\n  Yet, even if we generate it, we can't transmit it under this bill, or \nthe difficulty of costs for transmitting it will be prohibitive.\n  Each of the designations in this bill--somebody challenge me on \nthis--each of the designations in this bill specifically withdraw the \nland from future mineral and geothermal leasing. That includes the \nwilderness areas, the wilderness study areas, and the wild and scenic \nrivers. They are withdrawn. They can't be used. Right now, there are \n708 federally imposed wilderness areas totaling 107 million acres of \nland in 44 States. That will go to 1.92 million acres with the passage \nof this bill. It is a small portion of the 2 billion acres in this \ncountry, but it still denies the fact that we have more land now in \nwilderness than we have developed. The prohibition from capturing clean \nenergy, renewable energy, and nonpolluting energy is unfortunate.\n  One of the things that is wrong with this bill also is that we are \nviewing tomorrow's energy potential on all of these lands with today's \ntechnology. Just like when you go back and look at the old BLM studies \nand the Department of the Interior studies on the land, if you use old \ntechnology, you can say there is no energy there. When you use new 3D \nseismic and electromagnetic seismology, what we see is a whole great \npotential for all other sources, including geothermal.\n  The other concern I have with this bill, and the reason I have this \namendment, is we recently had a Federal judge in Washington, DC issue a \nrestraining order to halt the development of major oil and natural gas \nreserves on 100,000 acres of Federal land in portions of Utah, not \nbecause it was in a wilderness area, not because it was in a heritage \narea, not because it was along a scenic river, but because it was near \nthere. So we are going to abrogate to the courts and the aggressive \nenvironmentalists the ability to stop even clean renewable energy \nsources by the wilderness area designations.\n\n  Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, a former colleague of ours, \nrecently ordered a secretarial order calling for the production, the \ndevelopment, and delivery of renewable energy; that it would be a top \npriority of the Department of the Interior, but this bill restricts \nthat order. So here we have the Department of Interior Secretary saying \nthis is our priority\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nand we are going to pass a bill that undermines that authority and that \npriority.\n  Secretary Salazar claims that this effort will include the \nidentification of areas of high potential renewable energy, including \ngeothermal, wind, solar, and biomass. It also includes mapping out \ntransmission infrastructure to connect power to consumers.\n  Well, as we create all of these wilderness areas and heritage areas, \nguess what we are doing. We are limiting the ability to map out power \ntransmission lines. In total, the lands bill will withdraw over 3 \nmillion acres from energy leasing, placing them outside the scope of \nSecretary Salazar's endeavors.\n  Majority Leader Harry Reid summed up the difficulties imposed by \nthese designations when he discussed energy resources in Nevada. He \nsaid:\n\n       We know that our State has immense clean energy resources. \n     However, the Federal Government's management of 86 percent of \n     Nevada lands makes it challenging to explore and develop our \n     enormous renewable resources.\n\n  The only area in this bill that does not affect geothermal is in the \nState of Nevada. It is the only area.\n  If we are serious about alternative energy, this amendment should be \naccepted, should be voted for, allowing us to have a wilderness area, \nbut at the same time utilizing clean energy as a way to bring us to \nenergy independence in the 21st century. So this is a very simple \namendment. It says, OK, let's have what we have, but let's don't \nrestrict it as far as renewable, clean energy. Let's use the renewable, \nclean energy that is available. This happens to be geothermal, but we \nknow where the solar is, we know where the biomass is, and we know \nwhere the wind corridor is in this country. Why would we restrict it?\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 675 to Amendment No. 684\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of eminent domain and to ensure that no \n  American has their property forcibly taken from them by authorities \n                        granted under this Act)\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 675.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 675:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of eminent domain and to ensure that no \n  American has their property forcibly taken from them by authorities \n                        granted under this Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EMINENT DOMAIN.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act (or an \n     amendment made by this Act), no land or interest in land \n     (other than access easements) shall be acquired under this \n     Act by eminent domain.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, that is a straightforward amendment. The \nauthors of this bill said we are never going to use eminent domain for \nany of this, even though they reference two or three statutes that give \neminent domain. Well, if that is the case, if we are never going to use \neminent domain to accomplish the purposes of this, there should be no \ntrouble accepting this amendment. This amendment just says we can't. On \nthis bill, you can't use eminent domain to take the property away from \nsomebody who doesn't wish to give their property.\n  Amendment 5 of the U.S. Constitution says:\n\n       No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property \n     without due process of law, nor shall private property be \n     taken without just compensation.\n\n  That is the Constitution. But the father of the Constitution said it \na different way. He said, in a word:\n\n       As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be \n     equally said to have a property in his right.\n\n  Eminent domain is necessary and appropriate at times in this country \nfor national defense, for the health and well-being of the country, for \npriorities that protect the public at large, and that makes sense. \nThere are times when we have to use it. There is not a time associated \nwith any of the parts of this bill that we should have to use eminent \ndomain.\n  I have been assured by the authors of this bill that they have no \nintention of using eminent domain. If that is the case, then support \nthis amendment, and we will never have a problem with it. The property \nrights folks in this country, of which about 100 support this \namendment, would say that is great, so let's vote it up or down.\n  But if we vote against it, what is it going to tell them? What it is \ngoing to do is erode the confidence of landowners in this country. We \nsay we are not going to take your land away from you without your \npermission, without there being a willing seller, but we have kind of a \nking's edge. We have our fingers crossed behind our backs because there \nmay be some time when a bureaucrat has made a decision other than what \nwe are saying tonight.\n  So the way to enforce that would be a straightforward message that \nsays, according to this amendment, ``notwithstanding any other \nprovisions of this act, or any amendment that is made to this act, no \nland or interest in land, other than an access easement, shall be \nrequired under this act by eminent domain.''\n  That is straightforward. Let's give them confidence that we are not \ngoing to take their land away against their will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Fiscal Year 2010 Budget\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senate will in a couple of weeks take \nup the fiscal year 2010 budget. It is a defining document. In many \ncases, the budget establishes a blueprint for the agenda, what is going \nto happen in the Congress.\n  We normally get a budget proposal from the President, and the \nCongress takes it up and acts on it. We have gotten that blueprint from \nthe new administration. The Congress will, as I said, in a couple of \nweeks take up our version of that budget, put it into legislative form, \nand take action on it.\n  I think what most Republicans in the Senate are going to take issue \nwith in this budget is the fact that it does spend too much, tax too \nmuch, and borrow too much. We believe the budget as proposed is going \nto be very harmful to the economy at a time when we ought to be looking \nat creating jobs. In fact, this budget could do the exact opposite. It \ncould cost the economy a significant number of jobs because it is going \nto impose all kinds of new burdens on that economy.\n  The first point I would like to make with respect to the issue of \nspending too much--as I said, it spends too much, taxes too much, \nborrows too much, but if we look at the amount of spending in the bill \non the surface, discretionary spending would increase by $725 billion \nover 10 years. Mandatory spending would increase $1.2 trillion during \nthe same period.\n  Total spending in this year's budget for fiscal year 2010 is $3.9 \ntrillion or 28 percent of our gross domestic product. That means we \nwould be spending more as a percentage of our gross domestic product \nthan at any time since World War II.\n  That is a stunning and staggering fact when you think about it. At a \ntime when a lot of Americans are being asked to tighten their belts in \na difficult economy, this budget grows the size of Government by 9 \npercent for nondefense programs in fiscal year 2010, for a total of 20 \npercent growth in these programs since the year 2008.\n  There has been a lot of talk about revising the history of the past 8 \nyears. But this budget spends more than the Bush budget every single \nyear, and that is even after adjusting for inflation.\n  For those on the other side who have been critical of the \noverspending on the Republican side--and I don't deny the Republicans \nspent more than we should have when we were in control of this place, \nbut this budget is staggering in terms of the amount of spending it \nincludes--$3.9 trillion for fiscal year 2010, and, as I said, 28 \npercent of GDP, which would represent the highest level of share of GDP \nat any time in this Nation since World War II.\n  With respect to the issue of taxes--and as I said, it spends too much \nwhich, obviously, any person who looks\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nat this would agree with, but it also taxes too much. If you look at \nthe taxes in the proposal, there is on the surface a whole lot of new \nrevenue that is raised just by allowing previous tax policy to expire. \nWe are going to see tax rates increase on people at the higher income \nlevels.\n  The argument by the Democrats in the Senate has always been--and by \nthe President, for that matter--that 95 percent of the people in the \ncountry are going to get tax cuts, and these new taxes on the economy \nare not going to impact that many people.\n  We are going to take issue with that because if you look at the total \namount of new taxation--and when I say ``new,'' I am talking about net \nnew taxes because that is independent of the tax relief. What they call \nthe make work pay tax credit that is included in this bill does reduce \nthe tax burden on some Americans by a certain amount. But the overall \ntax burden on the American economy is going to grow by $1.4 trillion.\n  Again, to put things in perspective, $1.4 trillion is equivalent to \nthe annual GDP of Spain. We are going to raise taxes by $1.4 trillion \nin an economy that is in the middle of a recession.\n  Much has been made about the fact small businesses are going to be \nsaddled with new taxes under this budget. There have been statistics \nthrown around. Make no mistake about it; if you are a small business \nwith more than 20 employees and you are organized as a subchapter S \ncorporation or an LLC and, therefore, the income you derive from that \nbusiness flows through to your individual income statement, you are \ngoing to pay a higher level of taxes if you have a certain amount of \nincome coming in.\n  So any company that makes $200,000 or $250,000 a year adjusted gross \nincome because it flows through to the individual tax form, that \nindividual could be facing much higher taxes. In fact, what has been \ndetermined through the analysis that has been done is that 60 to 80 \npercent of small businesses in this country will see their tax burdens \ngo up because of the taxes included in this budget--$1.4 trillion in \nnew taxes, which, as I said, is the equivalent of the annual GDP of \nSpain in the middle of a recession.\n  The other point I would make to those who say this is not going to \nimpact average middle-income Americans is, if you look at the energy \ntax in this bill, I don't know how you can get around the fact that is \ngoing to hit everybody across the board.\n  The administration has said the revenue raised on the cap and trade--\nwe call it the energy tax component. It is going to be a tax on \nutilities because the utilities are going to pass this on. It is not \ngoing to be borne by the utilities. It will be passed on to consumers. \nThe administration has indicated $646 billion or $650 billion in \nrevenue will come in from this new cap-and-trade proposal or this new \nenergy tax proposal. I would argue that based upon additional analysis \nthat has been done, it will be significantly more revenue coming in \nfrom that, which means it is going to cost the economy significantly \nmore as well.\n  I refer my colleagues to an MIT study that was done in 2007 where \nthey looked at a proposal, the Boxer-Sanders proposal--S. 309, I \nbelieve it was--and made an assessment as to what that would cost the \neconomy. Bear in mind the President, while he was a Senator, \ncosponsored that proposal, and his proposal for a cap-and-trade regime \nis modeled very much after that legislation.\n  What MIT found when they modeled this was that it would cost the \naverage household in this country $3,128 in the year 2015 if this sort \nof cap-and-trade proposal were implemented and put into law.\n  As I said before, that assumes a much higher level of taxation, a \nmuch higher level of revenue coming in from this cap-and-trade proposal \nthan does the President's budget.\n  I would argue that the President's budget dramatically underestimates \nthe impact of the cap-and-trade proposal in terms of cost to the \neconomy and the additional taxes that will be passed on, and that this \nrepresents a much more accurate review.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also has in their analysis concluded \nthat by the year 2020, this could cost somewhere between $50 billion \nand $300 billion a year. The MIT study suggests it would cost more than \n$300 billion a year. I think as more and more analysis is done and more \nand more data is captured about this cap-and-trade proposal, we are \ngoing to find it is extremely more expensive than what has been \nanticipated and what has been assumed in the President's budget.\n  The energy tax piece of this is going to be passed on to everybody. \nIf you are a middle-income taxpayer, a lower income taxpayer, or a \nsmall business, energy costs are going to go up. The argument has also \nbeen made the make work pay tax credit would offset that. That is true \nup to a point, but that is up to $400 for a single filer and $800 for a \ncouple filing jointly and phased out so that people in the middle-\nincome categories are still going to be faced with this significant \nenergy tax that is paraded by the new cap-and-trade policy that is \nassumed in the President's budget. Not only does it directly raise \ntaxes--the $1.4 trillion that I mentioned earlier which equals the \nannual GDP of Spain--the tax increase is going to be passed on to a lot \nof small businesses in this country. But there is this cap-and-trade \ntax, which is the secret job killer in this budget in terms of the \nenormous burden and cost it will impose on our economy, on small \nbusinesses, and on working families in this country.\n\n  As I said before, this budget spends too much, it taxes too much, and \nthe other point I will make is that it borrows too much. If we look at \nthe amount of borrowing that is entailed as a result of this budget and \nwhat it does to our national debt over time, again, the numbers are \nquite staggering.\n  This budget doubles--doubles, Mr. President--the public debt in 5 \nyears and triples it in 10 years. The amount of borrowing that we are \npassing on to future generations is going to double in 5 years and \ntriple in 10. Just to put this in perspective, this creates more debt. \nThe President's budget creates more debt than was accumulated under \nevery President in this country from George Washington through George \nBush. In other words, from the inception of our country, from our very \nfirst President, George Washington, to George Bush, his Presidency \nincluded--a lot of people have criticized the previous administration \nfor adding to the Federal debt. In fact, during the Bush \nadministration, it was about $2.9 trillion that was added to the \nFederal debt. This is going to dwarf that by multitudes. It doubles the \npublicly held debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years and \naccumulates more debt than was accumulated from the time of George \nWashington through the Presidency of George Bush.\n  That is a stunning amount of borrowing. We are getting to where even \nif the President's budget proposals and economic assumptions are \naccurate--and I would take issue with those--where the total amount of \nborrowing, the total amount of public debt is going to be about two-\nthirds of our GDP, those are numbers we have not seen at any time in \nthis country since World War II.\n  There are incredible amounts of spending, incredible amounts of \ntaxation, incredible amounts of borrowing, and lots of policy changes \nthat we think are very bad for the country and very bad for our economy \nat a time when we need to be putting policies in place that will create \njobs, stimulate the economy, and help expand it in a way that will make \nthis country more prosperous and stronger for the future.\n  In the debate that will ensue in the next several weeks--and it will \nget underway in a couple of weeks--we are going to be making lots of \narguments, as both sides will--those who are in favor of the \nPresident's budget proposal and those of us who are opposed to it--\nabout the substance of it. I hope when we focus on the substance of it, \nthe American people will tune in because they ultimately are the ones \nwho pay the costs.\n  For the taxpayers of this country who bear the burden and \nresponsibility of financing the many new initiatives that are paraded \nin this, it does create a lot of new initiatives. It does away with \nguaranteed student loan lending, a program that has been very \nsuccessful across this country and moves everything back into direct \nlending of the Federal Government. It, as I said, creates an entirely \nnew energy program, a cap-and-trade program, which\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nis a tax. Let's call it what it is. It is going to impose an incredible \ncost on our economy, not to be borne by corporate America; it will be \npassed on to the American consumers. If the MIT study that was done a \nyear ago is right, there will be $3,128 per household in this country \nto comply with the additional costs that will be imposed as a result of \nthis new cap-and-trade proposal included in the President's budget.\n  It assumes some $600 billion for health care reform. We have not seen \nspecifics and details about that, but we are concerned as well about \nthe direction in which that may be headed. There are lots of reasons to \nbe opposed to this budget. There are lots of things we could and should \nbe doing to get this economy growing again, but clearly, raising taxes, \nspending more money here in Washington, DC, borrowing more from our \nchildren and grandchildren is not the way to go about this.\n\n  I wish I could say I was presenting the worst-case scenario. The \nnumbers we are seeing here are probably optimistic. I think the \nPresident's economic assumptions with respect to inflation, \nunemployment, GDP growth, and all those sorts of things are overly \noptimistic. I think they have dramatically understated, as I said, the \ncost of the cap-and-trade proposal. They have understated savings that \nwill be achieved by reductions in our military spending as a result of \ndrawdowns in Iraq. I don't think that is going to be nearly what they \nassume it is going to be. I think the actual deficits and debt that are \ngoing to come as a result of this budget proposal that the President is \nputting in front of us is going to be way beyond anything we are even \ncontemplating now.\n  I have to say, what we are contemplating now is way beyond anything \nwe have seen throughout our Nation's history. It is not fair to future \ngenerations for us to be saddling them with this enormous amount of \ndebt. As I have pointed out before on the floor, we have had a \ntradition in this country of one generation sacrificing for another; \none generation going without things so that future generations can have \na better life. We have turned that ethic completely on its head with \nthis budget by the amount of borrowing and spending that we are doing \nand in the amount of taxing. We are taking from future generations and \nasking them to sacrifice so we can have a better life today because we \nhave not been willing or able to live within our means.\n  It is high time that Congress started taking the steps necessary to \nget this budget under control, to not buy into the spending spree. \nSince we have been here--and it has been a little over 50 days in this \nnew Congress and the new administration--the level of spending is now \nat $1.2 trillion--$24 billion a day or $1 billion an hour that we have \nspent already--and that is before we even get to this fiscal year 2010 \nbudget, which includes historic levels of spending, historic levels of \ntaxation, the largest tax increase in American history, and historic \nlevels of borrowing that asks future generations to make sacrifices \nwhich are not fair to ask of them.\n  It is our responsibility to live within our means. We can do that. We \ncan put policies in place that will be additive in terms of creating \njobs and growing our economy and making our country stronger. Going \ndown this path is not going to do that. I hope as we debate this in the \nnext couple of weeks that it will become clear to the American people \nwho is standing up for the American taxpayer and what the costs are--\nthe actual costs--that we are asking not only them to bear but asking \ntheir children and grandchildren to bear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PATRICK'S DAY 2009\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, Mr. President, it is St Patrick's Day, and you \nmight notice a lot of green ties on the floor of the Senate. I notice \nthe Presiding Officer has a nice one on.\n  I wish to just say for a moment how proud I am to have a grandmother, \nwho passed away, named Mary Margaret Gaul, who was always proud of her \nIrish heritage and convinced us as kids that is where God would hang \nout, that great Republic of Ireland. It meant a lot to us growing up as \nkids to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with my grandmother and to try to \ncontinue that tradition in our own time.\n  But it goes beyond just family connections. It is almost impossible \nto overstate the importance of Ireland's contributions to America. From \nour earliest days as a nation, Ireland and America have been united by \nunbreakable bonds of friendship, family, and a shared commitment to \nliberty and freedom.\n  There is a great quote from George Washington, who once said:\n\n       When our friendless standard was first unfurled for \n     resistance, who were the strangers who first mustered around \n     our staff? And when it reeled in the fight, who more bravely \n     sustained it than Erin's generous sons?\n\n  In the more than two centuries since then, America has been enriched \nimmeasurably by the contributions of the Irish, and Irish Americans, in \nevery field and every walk of life.\n  And the contributions go both ways.\n  It just was not the ``sons of Erin'' who stood and fought on our side \nwith George Washington in the Revolution, it was a son of America, \nBrooklyn-born Eamonn deValera, who, in 1921, became the first President \nof a free Ireland.\n  And it was another son of Irish America, former Senate majority \nleader George Mitchell, who helped broker the Good Friday Peace Accord \nnearly 11 years ago.\n  That hard-won historic agreement laid out a path to end more than 30 \nyears of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland and create a new \nprovince, a new government, and a new dream.\n  For more than a decade, the Good Friday agreement has inspired people \naround the world to believe it is possible to resolve old hatreds, it \nis possible to heal old wounds.\n  To paraphrase the great Irish poet and Nobel laureate, Seamus Heaney, \nit is possible--with courage and diplomacy--for cooperation to replace \nconfrontation and hope to triumph over history.\n  We have been horrified in recent days by the reprehensible murders in \nNorthern Ireland of two unarmed British soldiers and a police \nconstable. The two soldiers were days away from being dispatched to \nAfghanistan. They were the first British soldiers killed in Northern \nIreland since that Good Friday agreement. The police constable's death \nwas the first terrorist killing of a member of Northern Ireland's new, \ncarefully balanced police force. The police force was created a couple \nyears ago, and it is an important symbol of political reconciliation.\n  Their deaths appear to be the work of isolated extremists who have no \nplace and no support in Northern Ireland today.\n  If it is possible for any good to come from these despicable acts, it \nis in the reactions of people in Northern Ireland. In the wake of the \nkillings, we have seen a renewed commitment to peace and \nreconciliation. Former enemies on both sides of ``the Troubles'' have \ncondemned the killings and vowed not to retaliate with violence.\n  Martin McGuiness, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland's power-\nsharing Government and leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the \nIRA, called the perpetrators of these killings: ``traitors to the \nisland of Ireland.''\n  Leaders of Northern Ireland's two largest loyalist paramilitary \ngroups--the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association--\nhave also condemned the killings and vowed that they will not return to \nviolence.\n  Most poignantly, we have seen the commitment to peace in the resolve \nof thousands of ordinary people in Northern Ireland.\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n  Last Monday, on the morning after the killings of the two British \nsoldiers at a military base, hundreds of people gathered in the nearby \ntown of Antrim for a prayer service at the police cordon where the \nshootings took place.\n  The worshipers included members of the local Catholic, Presbyterian, \nChurch of Ireland, and Methodist Churches--all praying together.\n  A Catholic priest told a reporter his parishioners were determined to \nshow their outrage over the murders, but they wanted to do so \ncollectively with their neighbors from other churches.\n  The priest told a reporter:\n\n       In the past, if something like this happened, people would \n     withdraw into their own [separate] community. This time, \n     everybody was united because it was an attack on everybody--\n     on the peace we all own.\n\n  Last Wednesday, thousands more people attended dignified, silent \n``peace rallies'' in Belfast, Derry, and other towns in Northern \nIreland. Young and old, men and women, Protestants and Catholics stood \nshoulder to shoulder in the cold to express their horror at these \nkillings and their resolve to maintain the Good Friday peace.\n  Signs carried by many of the more than 2,000 people who gathered at \nBelfast City Hall seemed to express their collective resolve. The signs \nread simply: ``No going back.''\n  Many of us remember how difficult the Northern Ireland peace \nnegotiations were, how often they seemed on the verge of collapse. But \ntheir collective determination, and the wise leadership of George \nMitchell, led them to an agreement, led them to use diplomats and \npoliticians but also the faith and courage of ordinary people to bring \norganizations and institutions that had been at war for decades \ntogether in peace.\n  Last weekend, in Chicago, we had a great St. Patrick's Day \ncelebration. We dyed the Chicago River green, drank a lot of beer, \nmarched in parades. Everybody wore their green and had a glorious time.\n  I attended a breakfast honoring a great organization. The Irish \nAmerican Partnership is working to create a more hopeful future for the \nchildren of Ireland--both north and south. They support educational and \nother efforts to replace old divisions with understanding and \ncooperation.\n  On this St. Patrick's Day, we want the people of Northern Ireland, \nthe Republic of Ireland, and Great Britain to know America shares their \ngrief and outrage over these killings. We also share their resolve \nnever to go back.\n  Just as it was in America's national interest to help broker the Good \nFriday peace agreement, it is in our interest now to help the people of \nNorthern Ireland reclaim that peace.\n  Now, before I yield the floor, I cannot let St. Patrick's Day pass \nwithout saying a word about a great man whose family has become \nsynonymous with Irish America, with peace in Northern Ireland, and with \nso many other noble causes.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy--known as Sir Edward by those of us who are \nhonored to call him a colleague--is not here on the Senate floor today. \nBut we see his pride in his Irish heritage in the shamrock sugar \ncookies and green punch he had delivered to the Democratic cloakroom \ntoday, as he has done on every St. Patrick's Day for decades.\n  More importantly, we feel Ted Kennedy's influence in this Senate's \nefforts to promote justice and opportunity in our own Nation--to \nprovide more Americans with jobs, health care, and education, so they \ncan make a good life for themselves and their families.\n  On this St. Patrick's Day, I know I speak for all my colleagues in \nthe Senate in wishing Senator Kennedy slainte.\n  To your health, Ted. We look forward to seeing you back soon.\n  A few months ago, Senator Kennedy's wife Vicki, at the Democratic \nConvention in Denver, handed me this little blue plastic bracelet. It \nhas a word on it they made up for the occasion, so all of us who stand \nby Ted and think of him every day would carry this little reminder with \na bracelet that says one word: Tedstrong.\n  Well, we are strong in our love for this great Senator. He has been \nstrong in his love for this great country. It is a good thing to \nremember him on one of his happiest days, St. Patrick's Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the floor, I \nwonder if he might answer a question, and that is whether some of us on \nthis side of the aisle could also celebrate our colleague, Ted's, \nappreciation for St. Paddy's Day, if there are any more of those \ncookies and punch left in the Democratic cloakroom.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to check. If there are, we will bring some \nacross because I know Ted would do that himself.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NOMINATION OF DAN ROONEY TO BE AMBASSADOR OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to speak about a very happy and \npositive topic, something that is close to my heart but I think also \nclose to the heart of a lot of Americans. Today, we have the double \nbenefit of it being not only St. Patrick's day, but in my case, as a \nPennsylvanian and one of Irish descent, I had the great news announced \ntoday by the President of the United States that Dan Rooney--from the \ngreat Rooney family of Pittsburgh, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and \na great friend of the people of Ireland, who has been active in the \npeace process, as has his family for a generation or more with their \ntime, their effort, their money, and their wisdom--has been nominated \nto be Ambassador to Ireland. He is a Pittsburgher and a Pennsylvanian, \nand we are so very proud today to be able to report that for those who \nhaven't yet heard the news. I will work, as a member of the Committee \non Foreign Relations, to get him confirmed because we should confirm \nhim.\n  Dan Rooney is well known as the owner of the Steelers, the Super Bowl \nchamps several times over in the last generation, and that is wonderful \nthat he is, but he is a son of Pittsburgh, a very humble man, a very \ndecent, kind, caring, and compassionate man, someone who has the kind \nof integrity and the kind of commitment to service you would want in an \nambassador to any country but especially one such as Ireland. \nPennsylvania has a pretty significant percentage of its population that \ntraces its ancestry to that small island, and across the ages we have \nbeen proud of that connection, that affinity we have for the people of \nIreland. In this case, if all goes as it should with the confirmation--\nand I am sure it will--we will have a son of Pittsburgh, a son of \nPennsylvania, a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania serving as \nAmbassador to Ireland.\n  Dan is someone who not only has the character and integrity and \ncommitment to his country, and his concern about the Irish people, but \nhe is also someone who has broad experience in running a major \norganization and motivating people to meet goals. There is so much that \nour country can do together with the people of Ireland. That country \nwill see, if they do not already know, what we have always seen in the \ncharacter and the decency and the strength and experience of Dan \nRooney. So we are very proud today that President Obama made that \nannouncement, especially for someone who has the kind of character and \ncommitment to public service that Dan Rooney has.\n  One final note about the celebration today of St. Patrick's Day. \nThere are a lot of reasons to celebrate, even in the context of some of \nthe recent violence in Ireland. There are more reasons than not to \ncelebrate the enduring peace of Ireland, even in the midst of that \nsetback, even in the midst of that violence. We have a lot to be \nthankful for, those of us who care about that kind of peace--one of the \nlongest conflicts in the history of the world brought to resolution \nback in the 1990s. George Mitchell and the Clinton administration \nworked very hard on this, and I know the Obama administration will be \nequally committed to making sure that peace endures.\n  As we are thinking today about Ireland and thinking about St. \nPatrick's Day and thinking about the bond between our two countries--\nand earlier today I heard Senator Durbin speak of the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for a whole variety of reasons--I \nthink of Ted Kennedy as someone who spent a lot of his time in the \nSenate working on peace issues the world over but in particular working \non the peace process in Northern Ireland. Over his lifetime of service \nin the\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nSenate, he is someone who has given meaning to the values we cherish on \na day like today--values of service, the value of peace over war, the \nvalue of integrity, and the value of trying to love one another the \nbest we can.\n  Ted Kennedy has a long connection not just with the peace process and \nnot just with the people of Ireland and his heritage, but his family \nhas had a long connection with my home State of Pennsylvania--and not \njust on St. Patrick's Day but on a lot of other days. In fact, one of \nthe reasons I highlighted Senator Kennedy and am thinking of him \ntonight is because of all the work he has done on health care, on civil \nrights, on education, as well as issues as important as the peace \nprocess in Ireland.\n  I am also thinking of him tonight because of the Friendly Sons of St. \nPatrick of Lackawanna County, which has had many storied speakers, but \none of the greatest speeches given at that dinner--really in the \nhistory of the American Irish--was given by then-Senator Robert Frances \nKennedy of New York in 1964. So we are thinking tonight of the \ninspiration Senator Robert Kennedy provided to the American people, to \nthe people of the State he served, New York, and to people across the \ncountry in his Presidential campaign in 1968 before his tragic \nassassination.\n  In a special way, I am thinking of the speech he gave not long \nafter--literally just a few months after his brother, President \nKennedy, was killed. I had the occasion a little more than a year ago \nto give an audio recording of that to Senator Ted Kennedy. I know he \nhad heard of the speech and maybe even heard the actual recording, but \nI wanted to make sure he had a CD of that speech.\n  So we are thinking of him tonight and thinking of his family and the \ngreat sacrifice the Kennedy family has made for the American people; \none as President, two in the Senate, and one of them in the Senate who \nserved as Attorney General. That is just a highlight of the kind of \nservice they have provided.\n  So on this St. Patrick's Day, we cherish the memory of so many things \nthat are Irish, but we are also whispering a silent prayer for our \ncountry, whispering a prayer for the people of Ireland and for those \nwho made this peace possible, people such as Ted Kennedy and George \nMitchell, and others who worked so hard.\n  In this very special way today, I am grateful for the chance to be \nable to stand on the floor of the Senate and say that a friend of mine, \na friend of Pennsylvania, and a proud son of Pittsburgh has been \nnominated by President Obama to be Ambassador to Ireland. That friend \nis Dan Rooney.\n  So congratulations, Dan. We are thinking of you and your family \ntonight as we celebrate St. Patrick's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3158-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AD HOC SUBCOMMITTEE ON CONTRACTING OVERSIGHT RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, with the coming parliamentary elections \nscheduled for April 5, Moldova is once again at a crucial juncture in \nits domestic political development.\n  In recent years, Moldova's cooperation with the United States has \ndeepened, with steady progress through the initial stages of the \nMillennium Challenge Threshold Program, which promises to bring \nsignificant material assistance to Moldova in the near future. \nAdditionally, Moldova has advanced in its quest for greater European \nintegration. To continue to build upon and consolidate these positive \ndevelopments, it is crucial that the current campaign and voting on \nApril 5 be conducted in a manner consistent with Moldova's commitment \nto meeting OSCE election standards.\n  Since achieving independence in 1991, Moldova has had a generally \npositive record in conducting and respecting the results of free \nelections. However, there have been shortcomings and it is essential \nthat Moldova avoid repeating practices that have drawn criticism in \nprevious contests.\n  Specifically, national and local authorities must make every effort \nto ensure a level and transparent playing field for all candidates \nduring the campaign and avoid the use of administrative resources to \nhamper political rivals. It is also important that the authorities make \nefforts to ensure access to the media for all candidates and \nrepresentatives of political parties. Finally, law enforcement bodies \nmust safeguard the public's basic right to freely and publicly assemble \nto express their views in a peaceable manner.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI would underscore the importance that all involved in Moldova's \nupcoming parliamentary elections ensure compliance with international \nnorms. This is crucial, not only for the future of democratic reform in \nMoldova, but also for the country's further economic development and \nprogress along its chosen path of European integration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3158-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3158-S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My husband and I moved to Shelley in May of 2007, and drive \n     to work in Idaho Falls Monday through Friday. Since we work \n     different hours, we are unable to carpool. When we first \n     moved here, we budgeted approx. $210 per month for gas and we \n     now budget approx. $320. We do not drive new, gas-guzzling \n     cars. My husband drives a 1987 Ford Bronco II (we are on our \n     third engine) and I drive a 1995 Ford F-150 pick-up. Both \n     cars have four-wheel drive, which is necessary in the winter \n     months, and the pick-up is needed as we own 6 acres. Add this \n     increase to the gas needed for a riding lawnmower and a quad \n     (both are needed to maintain our property), we probably spend \n     $350 a month in gas. I believe Congress has no idea of what \n     the average wage earner/homeowner goes through every month \n     just trying to get by and pay bills. There will be no \n     vacations this year as we cannot afford to pay for gas and \n     travel anywhere. Along with the increase in gas prices, we \n     have found our grocery bills have increased along with just \n     about everything else. (the trickle-down effect) Wages in \n     Idaho are not high and the cost of gasoline seriously impacts \n     our budget. I am in support of more domestic drilling and \n     believe we depend too much on foreign oil.\n     Laurie, Shelley.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I both work at the Idaho National Laboratory \n     and also operate a small beef cattle ranch. The rising costs \n     have been affecting us but really started hitting hard last \n     year.\n       First, we live in Howe and work at the INL. We work at one \n     of the closest facilities to Howe, yet, it is still 20 miles \n     one way. I work a 410 schedule and my husband works a \n     rotating 412 schedule. Our schedules do not coincide with one \n     another so we are unable to carpool. So, we both have to \n     drive separate vehicles 4 days a week. He is unable to \n     carpool because no one else in Howe works his same schedule. \n     I carpool with another neighbor who works 410s at my \n     facility, so I drive twice a week. We are driving a minimum \n     of 240 miles per week. All of our vehicles are ranch vehicles \n     so they get between 8 and 16 mpg (with all the rising costs, \n     we'd be hard pressed to afford a vehicle payment for an \n     economy car). We try to ride our motorcycles when we can (40-\n     60 mpg) but that is hard to do with a carpool. We are using \n     15-30 gallons of fuel a week, minimum, at a cost of $60-120/\n     week or $240-480/month. That just for going to a steady \n     paying job.\n       Second, our cattle graze on private ground 20 miles away. \n     That was the closest we could get at a reasonable cost (which \n     was 4 years ago). Because of the problems we have had with \n     trespassers cutting fence lines, tearing up gates, cattle \n     disappearing, and irrigation issues, we have to check on this \n     daily from May to November. That is another 280 miles/week. \n     So, another $140/week or $560/month.\n       The closest full-service shopping is 80 miles away in \n     Rexburg, Idaho Falls, or Blackfoot. We have tried to keep the \n     trips to town to a minimum, but, that too is hard to do with \n     cattle, owning a home, and just plain living. We carpool to \n     town to do our grocery shopping and only go every other week. \n     That is another 180 miles once you spend the day driving all \n     over town to get everything in one trip--and believe me it is \n     an all day trip when you are shopping for 2 weeks worth of \n     supplies for 2-3 families. Another potential $40 in fuel. We \n     do not get to see our children, grandchildren or other family \n     very often anymore because they are scattered all over the \n     state. They cannot afford to spend the money on gas to come \n     and visit and we have had to cut way back on these \n     excursions. The cost for vehicle maintenance has shot through \n     the roof, too. Tires are up about 50%, motor oil has double \n     over the past couple of years, other maintenance supplies \n     have increased and the cost of labor to have a \n     ``professional'' do it is ridiculous (that is if you can get \n     someone honest and reputable to do the work!).\n       Because we lost our BPA credit and Rocky Mountain Power \n     raised the rates, our electric bill has gone up $60-100/month \n     depending upon how much water we are pumping and how cold it \n     is.\n       The hay prices shot up from about $85/ton to $150/ton--\n     nearly double. So we are forced to either sell off half the \n     herd or double our cost for hay/feed (for 50 head of cattle \n     we'll be paying over $20,000). The market price for beef at \n     auction has not increased making our profit margin take a \n     nose dive. When there is less beef produced, the store cost \n     goes up--but we do not see that money as a producer. Everyone \n     else is getting their cut but the producer. Feed grain has \n     gone up about 33%, and veterinary supplies have gone up.\n       The cost of everything has gone up to account for the fuel \n     prices. Flour has doubled, milk went up $1/gallon, bread is \n     $3/loaf (can you believe it--so I make my own). The cost of \n     fencing supplies has gone up 75%. These are just a few things \n     that cut into our bottom line.\n       I hear taxes (at least federal) are going back up and the \n     marriage penalty will be back. Is there anyone in Congress \n     that can keep their hand out of the piggy bank? My husband \n     and I live within our means. With all of these rising costs, \n     we are having to cut back on many other things--but we are \n     doing it. It just seems that our government representatives \n     are so wealthy and are ``entitled'' to special treatment \n     wherever they live that they have grown completely out of \n     touch with how the common person lives from day to day.\n       We are just one small family. We are spending well over \n     $1000/month in fuel costs and just a few years ago I thought \n     it was highway robbery to spend $400/month. The US needs to \n     get off the ``enviro-nazi'' kick and start utilizing the \n     resources we have.\n       Thanks for listening. Maybe this will help you make a \n     difference for Idahoans and our country.\n     Tekla, Howe.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking the time to hear from those you \n     represent. Yes my family has had to cut back our spending as \n     the fuel prices are driving up the costs of everything else. \n     There is one area I am deeply concerned with, that is with \n     the good people who help the less fortunate. There are \n     companies like Meals on Wheels that are hurting because of \n     the energy costs, the food costs, as well as the other \n     expenses they have to bear. When I hear that these good \n     people are trying to help others, it warms my heart, but when \n     I hear these same companies are struggling to scrape together \n     enough funds to continue to do the incredible job they do I \n     am deeply sadden. The costs are rising to a point that it \n     makes it difficult to be able to donate to these wonderful \n     organizations. When I hear the oil companies are making \n     record profits it angers me and I feel we are being taken \n     advantage of. I do believe in free enterprise, but at what \n     cost to the great people of our fantastic nation.\n       Please help,\n     Scott.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is in response to your request for citizens to ``share \n     your energy stories.''\n       Here are some of the results I am observing, of gas being \n     more expensive:\n       Traffic is (slightly) down on the overcrowded roads in and \n     around Boise.\n       People are getting rid of their gas-guzzlers and getting \n     more economical modes of transportation.\n       People are making more responsible transportation choices. \n     (Dare I say it? Might they even consider carpooling, or \n     utilizing public transportation?)\n       Air pollution is down.\n       There is some real market-driven innovation going on, in \n     the automotive world.\n       In other words, the results of higher fuel prices aren't \n     all negative. Please think long and hard before getting the \n     government more involved. (In the past, it hasn't always had \n     the desired effect.)\n       If you could figure out some way to give the freight \n     industry some relief, that would be a good thing. But let the \n     free market run its course with regards to personal \n     transportation, I say. If our economy is based on every \n     citizen 16 and over having a private motor vehicle and \n     unlimited access to cheap fuel . . . it is a house of cards.\n       Ride a bicycle.\n     Josh, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       These days of high fuel and energy costs have been coming \n     for a long time now. Since the 1970s, the writing has been on \n     the wall. Had the government taken the lead and required \n     meaningful efficiency standards of the auto industry, we may \n     have avoided a war and would already be on our way to energy \n     independence. Had we raised the fuel tax by a couple of \n     pennies each year and invested it into mass transit and \n     infrastructure, we would not be faced with crumbling roads \n     and bridges.\n       We let the marketplace get into this mess; the marketplace \n     will get us out of this mess, if we let it. The marketplace \n     is merely correcting for the poor decisions of the past. \n     Progress built on the promise of an unlimited supply, of a \n     finite resource, is hardly progress at all. To call for more \n     production is no solution. We have squandered an immense \n     resource on gas guzzlers, motor sports of all kind. \n     Agriculture's dependence on fossil fuels and petroleum based \n     chemicals is coming back to haunt us.\n       The best time to plan for energy independence was 30 years \n     ago. The second best time to plan for energy Independence is \n     today. There are other contributing factors to the mess we \n     are in such as, the failing dollar, former third world \n     countries whose demand for energy will soon exceed ours. We \n     brought all this on ourselves and now we do not like it. I \n     would be willing to bet, ``we ain't seen nothin' yet''.\n                                                             Doug.\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       We moved from southern California and left a lucrative \n     business four years ago to come to Idaho and put our children \n     into smaller schools. We also began a business here that has \n     done pretty well. Lately though, gas is eating up any chance \n     of savings for college or cars for teens who need cars to \n     work.\n       Beside working many hours and employing locals when we can, \n     we also volunteer hundreds of hours coaching kids in youth \n     sports. I also began an all-girls youth group 18 months ago, \n     that has presently 40 girls that have attended and come \n     pretty regularly. We are in a poorer area so up till now we \n     provide many rides for these kids, many from single parent \n     homes, welfare homes, etc. These kids have been so \n     appreciative of all the time and effort we invest in them and \n     we see many making much better choices today that once were \n     traveling down a very bad path in life.\n       How is gas affecting us, family of five? For one, we have \n     started turning down some pretty good jobs we would usually \n     bid within a 90-mile radius due to gas prices. Since my \n     husband has to drive a truck to carry all of his heavy \n     equipment to do the jobs, he has no choice but to pay for \n     higher gas. For me, I have to choose to not pick up all the \n     kids that I have been to keep them in youth group and sports. \n     Some of these parents do not even own cars, so now that means \n     some of these kids who were responding so positively either \n     have to walk a great deal to get to a place I can pick them \n     up (also a danger in today's world) or they do not always get \n     to attend. I too may have to cut my hrs in volunteering soon \n     as we just cannot afford the gas to do as much as we always \n     have in the past.\n       One more way it is affecting us is we have a son ready to \n     begin college and he may actually have to go without a \n     vehicle. His older car broke down and, in order to purchase \n     an energy-efficient vehicle, we would have to give up paying \n     for college basically. We cannot afford to do both. We have \n     another son also driving, but he cannot afford the gas prices \n     to get to a job at minimum wage on a part-time basis. He \n     works for his dad all summer, but gas prices is preventing \n     him from working all school year for the minimum wage on a \n     part-time basis (15 hr average locally for youth jobs during \n     school year).\n       We ask the Congress to push harder to drill here at home, \n     to open another refinery while they continue exploring all \n     other energy efficient ideas. We too want the environment \n     protected, but first we must make certain people can afford \n     to go to school and to work. We do think the congress needs \n     to put some pressure on and get our gas prices lowered \n     (environmentalist caused in our opinions), but we do not \n     believe the government should be taking over the oil \n     companies.\n       We thank you for your time and hope that you can work to \n     get this resolved before none of us are able to work.\n     Ken and Rossa, Lenore.\n                                  ____\n\n       I wanted to write you about the insanely high price of gas. \n     My wife and I both hold jobs in different parts of Boise so \n     we could not carpool together. Her car gets great gas \n     mileage; mine, on the other hand, does not. When the price of \n     gas going up, I was looking at paying almost $200 in fuel a \n     month for my own transportation probably closer to $300 with \n     both of our cars together. We simply cannot afford $300 a \n     month for just gas. I decided to find a new means of \n     transportation to work--my bicycle. While I am not \n     complaining about riding my bike to work, I have to keep \n     looking down the road and know that winter is coming and with \n     $135 barrel of oil prices that means high gas prices when it \n     is cold out, too. Congress or the House or the President or \n     someone needs to take the reins and get control over this \n     crisis. I keep hearing about how we went to war in Iraq for \n     oil. If that is true, then why are not we taking oil out of \n     Iraq to repay all the money that we have spent over there to \n     increase our national debt to an insane amount? Why are we \n     not drilling in Alaska? Or on the Outer Continental Shelf? Or \n     exploring the coal to oil possibility? With all of the \n     unemployment that is happening right now in our country \n     opening up even one of these possibilities could create new \n     jobs for people that are out of work right now, bring down \n     the price of gas and oil, and we could stop funding countries \n     that hate America. I do not understand how simple working \n     Americans can see the solutions to this problem but our \n     elected officials either cannot see the solutions or just do \n     not care to fix the problem they helped to create. Thank you \n     for your time.\n     Kyle, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Despite the fact that a month ago I have recently acquired \n     a higher paying job (more than I have ever made), we are \n     having to now decide which bills get paid and which ones do \n     not. My fiancee and I over the past few years, worked \n     diligently to reduce or eliminate our debt, save money for \n     both short term and long term. We were being very responsible \n     middle Americans.\n       We have not been able to successfully budget the increases \n     in what we have to pay for gas and everything else that has \n     gone up in price.\n       Now all that our debts have gone up and our emergency funds \n     our depleted.\n       It is not as though we have been spending more. We have \n     made as many cutbacks as we could. Gotten rid of cable, \n     switched all of our bulbs to fluorescent, do not go out to \n     eat anymore, and quality time family excursions including \n     movies just do not happen anymore.\n       What else do we do when suddenly prices go up and you have \n     to get to work, but the tank is empty and bills need paid or \n     they shut off the power, etc.? Companies never give you a \n     raise as quickly as prices go up. In fact, most people do not \n     even get raises anymore. We are paying on average of $150 to \n     $200 more a month than before. We do have to drive more than \n     the average person until the wedding over and house is sold.\n       I already work long hours, leave the house at 6:45 am to \n     arrive back at 7 pm exhausted go to bed at 10 pm. When would \n     I have time to get another job? We have been selling off \n     things we own for extra money. We have not had time to \n     adjust. These rapid increases are killing us financially.\n     Monte.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am taking this opportunity to respond to you call for \n     input on high energy prices. I live in Pocatello and must \n     drive to work daily to go to work in Idaho Falls, a 100-mile \n     round trip. My wife owns a restaurant in Pocatello, so moving \n     would only change who commutes. The high gasoline prices have \n     affected my personal driving habits in that I have started \n     driving at 55 miles per hour again. If I drive at 75 mph, my \n     car will go 19 to 20 miles per gallon of gasoline. I have \n     found that when I drive at 55 mph, my car will go 32 to 34 \n     miles per gallon. I only have to leave the house 15 minutes \n     earlier in the morning to get to work on time.\n       I was in Nebraska a few weeks ago. I noticed that while \n     Nebraska has not lowered posted speed limit for trucks, \n     almost all trucks were cruising between 60 and 65 mph. Since \n     a truck is much less streamlined, I would guess that their \n     fuel efficiency gains are even more dramatic than mine.\n       I realize that, for most Americans, the vast majority of \n     driving is done in a city where the speeds are much lower and \n     the traffic is stop and go, so simply driving slower will not \n     have a significant impact on fuel efficiency. But gasoline \n     use can be greatly reduced in urban areas also. I have two \n     sons who both get all over Pocatello very easily, and neither \n     one of them drives an average of ten miles a week. They both \n     walk or ride bicycles almost everywhere they go. They even \n     takes backpacks to the grocery store and laundromats, which \n     for one of them are over a mile and a half from his house \n     (the other lives only around the corner from a grocery store, \n     and his laundry seems to mysteriously appear at my house).\n       I do believe that urban planners in the West have long \n     neglected pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods and business \n     districts, not to mention the almost complete lack of \n     attention towards mass transit systems both in and between \n     urban areas. Congress should address these items as viable \n     tools to curb energy demand along with promoting development \n     of alternative energy sources. Congress should also mandate \n     the diversification of our energy supply, which, by the way, \n     should also be a Homeland Security priority.\n       Congress has known that our energy availability is getting \n     more and more questionable for over thirty years, and has \n     done little to promote developing new energy resources or \n     promote curbing energy use. Simply exploring for more oil \n     within the United States will not solve the problems, it will \n     only prolong the problem at great cost.\n     Bob.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO ST.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man from \nArkansas\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nwho had a strong sense of duty toward his country from a very young \nage. COL Alva Bryan Lasswell, known as ``Red'' to friends, was a World \nWar II war hero whose service has gone unrecognized for most of his \nlife. I believe it is finally time to honor Colonel Lasswell for the \nbrave servicemember that he was.\n  When he was only 13 years old, Colonel Lasswell tried to join the \nMarine Corps. Due to age requirements, the future hero would have to \nwait until his 21st birthday to enlist. Throughout his distinguished \nmilitary career, Colonel Lasswell was awarded the rank of 2nd \nlieutenant and served in Navy intelligence.\n  During World War II, he was stationed at Pearl Harbor and was \nselected as one of 10 officers to take part in the elite intelligence \ngathering unit. In May 1942, Colonel Lasswell intercepted an unusual \nmessage that he reported to Navy headquarters. The message was a \nJapanese Operational Order authorizing the Battle of Midway. As a \nresult of Lasswell's heroic service, the Navy was able to prepare for \nthe attack, and the Battle of Midway would go on to become the first \nmajor victory for the Navy in World War II.\n  This was not the end of his service however. Colonel Lasswell later \ntranslated a message which led to the shooting down of a plane carrying \nJapanese Adminral Isoroku Yamamoto in 1943, and in 1944 he recovered \nintelligence which involved a plot to assassinate GEN Douglas \nMacArthur. In addition, Lasswell's intelligence helped the U.S. Navy \nAntisubmarine Group sink at least five submarines in 1944. Lasswell \ncompleted his military career in 1956, serving as Chief of Staff for \nthe Marine Recruit Depot.\n  Despite his tremendous service to his country, Colonel Lasswell never \nreceived distinction or recognition for his intelligence recovery \nefforts during World War II. At this time, I would like to pay him the \ntribute he has deserved for so long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3161-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3161-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3161-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSMITTING CERTIFICATION THAT THE EXPORT OF FINE GRAIN GRAPHITE TO BE \nUSED FOR SOLAR CELL APPLICATIONS AND FOR THE FABRICATION OF COMPONENTS \nUSED IN ELECTRONIC AND SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION IS NOT DETRIMENTAL TO \n  THE U.S. SPACE LAUNCH INDUSTRY, AND THAT THE MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT \nWILL NOT MEASURABLY IMPROVE THE MISSILE OR SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES OF \n                 THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA--PM 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 \n(Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify to the Congress that the export \nof fine grain graphite to be used for solar cell applications and for \nthe fabrication of components used in electronic and semiconductor \nfabrication, and two dual-motor, dual-shaft mixers to be used to \nproduce carbon fiber and epoxy prepregs for the commercial airline \nindustry is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that \nthe material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit \nthat could be derived from these exports, will not measurably improve \nthe missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of \nChina.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 17, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3161-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 987.

A bill to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of \n1986 to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture regarding \nadditional recreational uses of National Forest System land that are \nsubject to ski area permits, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nto revise the 1986 law dealing with use of National Forests for ski \nareas in order to reflect current ways those areas are used and to \nprovide clear authority for the Forest Service to allow additional \nrecreational uses of those areas.\n  I have long thought it is in the national interest to encourage \nAmericans to engage in outdoor recreational activities that can \ncontribute to their health and well-being, and that National Forest \nlands, including ski areas, can play a role by providing opportunities \nfor such activities.\n  My interest in the subject was heightened last year when \nrepresentatives of the National Ski Areas Association brought to my \nattention the fact that the National Forest Ski Areas Permit Act of \n1986. This law speaks only to ``nordic and alpine skiing'' and does not \nreflect the full spectrum of snowsports for which ski areas are now \nused. They described this problem as the absence of clear authority for \nthe Forest Service to permit use of ski areas for other summer, \nseasonal, or year-round outdoor recreational activities and facilities \nin support of those activities.\n  To better understand the matter, I sent a letter asking the Under \nSecretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment \nwhether current law could be clearer on those points. Under Secretary \nMark Rey replied that the 1986 legislation indeed did not address those \nmatters and that, if requested, the USDA ``would be happy to work with \nyou to amend'' the law to provide the Forest Service with clear \nauthority regarding such activities and facilities.\n  I did request and receive technical suggestions from the Forest \nService, and have considered their input as well as suggestions from \nthe National Ski Areas Association and other interested parties in \ndeveloping the bill that I introduced in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives last year.\n  Today, I am introducing this bill in the Senate.\n  The bill intentionally uses a number of terms and phrases based on \nthe terminology of the Forest Service's regulations, manual, or other \nofficial documents because those terms and phrases are familiar not \nonly to the Forest Service but also to permittees and others with an \ninterest in the management of the National Forests. Thus, as used in \nthe bill the term ``developed\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nrecreation'' means recreation that occurs at an area which has been \nimproved or developed for that purpose--such as camping in constructed \ncampgrounds or developed opportunities for off-highway-vehicle use as \nwell as downhill skiing. Similarly, the term ``natural-resource-based \nrecreation'' is intended to have the same meaning as when used in the \nForest Service manual 2300, Recreation, Wilderness, and Related \nResource Management.\n  It also should be noted that the bill deals only with the 1986 \nNational Forest Ski Areas Act, and would not in any way affect any \nother law applicable to management of the National Forests or any \npermits issued under any of those laws.\n  Ski area permits under the 1986 law do give their holders a priority \nwith respect to commercial use of the lands subject to the permits, but \nthey do not preclude general use of those lands by the public for \ncompatible, non-commercial uses, and the bill would not change that. In \nfact, the bill does not affect the status, the duration, or any other \nprovision of any permit already issued under the 1986 law, nor does it \nprovide for any new permits. Instead, it makes clear that the Forest \nService is authorized--but not required--to allow a current or future \nholder of a permit under the 1986 law to provide opportunities for \nadditional developed recreational activities, and to place associated \nfacilities, on the lands covered by that permit if the specified \nrequirements are met and if the Forest Service decides it would \nappropriate for that to occur.\n  And it would not affect any existing or future permit related to use \nof lands that are not subject to ski area permits under the 1986 law or \nin any way reduce or otherwise modify the extent to which the Forest \nService can allow any particular use on any of those lands outside ski \nareas.\n  This is a narrowly-targeted bill that I think can be valuable \nregarding an important aspect of the management of the National Forests \nand in facilitating the provision of additional opportunities for \nseasonal and year-round recreational activities on the parts of those \nlands that are subject to permits under the 1986 law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Outline of the Bill\n\n       Section 1 sets forth findings regarding the basis for the \n     legislation, and states its purpose. The findings note that \n     it is in the national interest to provide, and encourage \n     Americans to take advantage of, opportunities to engage in \n     outdoor recreational activities that can contribute to their \n     health and well-being; that National Forests, including those \n     areas used for skiing, can provide such opportunities during \n     all four seasons; that increased use of ski areas for that \n     purpose can reduce impacts on other National Forest lands; \n     and that it is in the national interest to revise the \n     National Forest Ski Area Permit Act. The purpose is to amend \n     that 1986 law so as to reflect that other snowsports, in \n     addition to nordic and alpine skiing, occur at ski areas and \n     to clarify the Forest Service's authority to permit \n     additional appropriate seasonal or year-round recreational \n     uses of lands subject to permits under that law.\n       Section 2 would amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit \n     Act of 1986 in three ways: (1) by replacing current language \n     that refers only to ``nordic and alpine skiing'' with broader \n     terminology to reflect that additional ski areas are also \n     used for additional snowsports, such as snowboarding.\n       (2) by providing specific authority for the Forest Service \n     to authorize the holder of a ski area permit under the 1986 \n     law to provide additional recreational opportunities (and to \n     have associated facilities) on lands covered by that permit. \n     This authority is limited to activities and facilities that \n     the Forest Service determines appropriate, that encourage \n     outdoor recreation, and that harmonize to the natural \n     environment to the extent practicable. The bill makes clear \n     that the activities and facilities will be subject to such \n     terms and conditions as the Forest Service determines \n     appropriate. It also specifies that no activity or facility \n     can be authorized if the agency determines that authorization \n     would result in the primary recreational purpose of lands \n     covered by a permit under the 1986 law would not be skiing or \n     other snowsports.\n       (3) Finally, the bill would delete from the 1986 law \n     obsolete language related to a deadline for conversion of \n     previously-issued ski-area permits to permits under the 1986 \n     law, while retaining the requirement that regulations be \n     promulgated to implement that law--a requirement that will \n     apply to the law as it would be amended by the bill.\n       Section 3 specifies that the bill will not affect any \n     authority the Forest Service now has under laws other than \n     the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, including \n     authority with respect to recreational activities or \n     facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TESTER:\n  S. 608. A bill to amend the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act \nof 2008 to exclude secondary sales, repair services, and certain \nvehicles from the ban on lead in children's products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Common Sense \nin Consumer Product Safety Act of 2009 on behalf of the folks across \nAmerica who are outdoor enthusiasts and budding sportsman and women. \nThis bill will bring a common sense approach to restrictions we place \nupon access to children's products.\n  Last fall, in response to the high lead paint content found in a \nnumber of toys and products intended for children, the Congress passed \nlegislation to limit children's access to these dangerous products. \nMany of these products were imports from China and other places where \nconsumer protection is weak or non-existent. I supported this \nlegislation, as did 78 of my colleagues.\n  Today, however, we have learned that this bill has had some \nunintended consequences. Any product sold that is intended to be used \nby children up to the age of 12 must be tested and certified to not \ncontain more than the allowable level of lead.\n  While the goal is admirable, it is important to inject a little \ncommon sense into the process. I want our kids and grandkids to be safe \nand protected from harmful toys, but we all know that most kids who are \npast the teething stage do not chew on their toys. It is important to \nenact responsible safety requirements while at the same time \nrecognizing that overzealous restrictions can interfere with a way of \nlife enjoyed by not just Montanans, but outdoor enthusiasts across \nAmerica.\n  As the Vice Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I am \nproud to stand up for Montana's outdoor heritage at every chance. \nUnfortunately, the new law goes too far and limits younger Montanans' \nopportunities to be a part of that heritage.\n  My bill will protect small businesses and allow families better, \nsafer access to the outdoors.\n  The current law extends to all products intended for the use of \nchildren through the age of 12. This includes ATVs, dirt bikes and \nother vehicles built specifically for the use of older kids and adults; \nthe way the vehicles are built, parts that might include lead are not \ntotally sealed away and therefore they do not pass the standard of \ninaccessibility required by law. As a result of this requirement, a \nnumber of ATV sales and retail establishments have halted the sale of \nall ATVs for kids. In an abundance of caution, they have also refused \nto repair any equipment intended for kids use.\n  I have heard from many Montanans--consumers and retail sales people \nalike--expressing their concern about the impact of the legislation \nupon outdoor motor sports. Therefore today, I am introducing this bill \nto designate an exception for vehicles intended to be used by children \nbetween the ages of 7 and 12.\n  In addition to manufacturers and merchants, thrift stores and other \nretail establishments are also implicated because of the wide-reaching \nscope of the legislation. It is possible that even holding a yard sale \ncan lead folks astray from the new law. Therefore, my bill also removes \nliability for lead paint content in any product that is repaired or is \nresold by thrift stores, flea markets or at yard sales. The liability \nin place at the time of primary sale of these products is sufficient \nand it could cripple the profitability of the secondary merchants if \nthey were to be liable for testing the products they resell or repair.\n  In this tough economy, second-hand resellers simply can not afford \nthe third-party testing requirement put in place by last fall's bill. \nAt the same time, more and more of Montana's families are finding their \nbudgets tighten and are relying upon thrift and resale stores for toys, \nchildren's clothing and other household goods. I want to make sure that \nlaws intended to keep our kids safe end up doing more harm than good.\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n  I think this a very important bill, bringing a dose of common sense \nto the very important goal of protecting our kids from lead paint and \nother substances that will harm their health. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 552(b)(3) of title 5, United States \nCode (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act) to \nprovide that statutory exemptions to the disclosure requirements of \nthat Act shall specifically cite to the provision of that Act \nauthorizing such exemptions, to ensure an open and deliberative process \nin Congress by providing for related legislative proposals to \nexplicitly state such required citations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, our Nation celebrates Sunshine \nWeek--a time to recognize and promote openness in our Government. At \nthis important time of year, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn \nto reintroduce the OPEN FOIA Act--a bipartisan bill to promote more \nopenness regarding statutory exemptions to the Freedom of Information \nAct, FOIA.\n  This bipartisan bill builds upon the work that Senator Cornyn and I \nbegan several years ago to reinvigorate and strengthen FOIA. Together, \nwe introduced, and Congress ultimately enacted, the OPEN Government \nAct--the first major reforms to FOIA in more than a decade. I thank \nSenator Cornyn for his work and leadership on this important issue. I \nalso thank President Obama--who was a cosponsor of the OPEN Government \nAct when he was in the Senate--for his deep commitment to FOIA. \nPresident Obama clearly demonstrated his commitment to open Government \nwhen he issued a new directive to strengthen FOIA during his first full \nday in office.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act simply requires that when Congress provides for a \nstatutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress must state its \nintention to do so explicitly and clearly. This commonsense bill \nmirrors bipartisan legislation that the Judiciary Committee favorably \nreported, and the Senate unanimously passed, during the 109th Congress, \nS. 1181. While no one can fairly question the need to keep certain \nGovernment information secret to ensure the public good, excessive \nGovernment secrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  For more than four decades, FOIA has served as perhaps the most \nimportant Federal law to ensure the public's right to know, and to \nbalance the Government's power with the need for Government \naccountability. The Freedom of Information Act contains a number of \nexemptions to its disclosure requirements for national security, law \nenforcement, confidential business information, personal privacy and \nother circumstances. The FOIA exemption commonly known as the ``(b)(3) \nexemption,'' requires that Government records that are specifically \nexempted from FOIA by statute be withheld from the public. In recent \nyears, we have witnessed an alarming number of FOIA (b)(3) exemptions \nbeing offered in legislation--often in very ambiguous terms--to the \ndetriment of the American public's right to know.\n  The bedrock principles of open Government lead me to believe that \n(b)(3) statutory exemptions should be clear and unambiguous, and \nvigorously debated before they are enacted into law. Too often, \nlegislative exemptions to FOIA are buried within a few lines of very \ncomplex and lengthy bills, and these new exemptions are never debated \nopenly before becoming law. The consequence of this troubling practice \nis the erosion of the public's right to know, and the shirking of \nCongress' duty to fully consider these exemptions.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act will help stop this practice and shine more light \non the process of creating legislative exemptions to FOIA. That will be \nthe best antidote to the ``exemption creep'' that we have witnessed in \nrecent years.\n  When he recently addressed a joint session of the Congress and the \nAmerican people, President Obama said that ``I know that we haven't \nagreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the \nfuture when we will part ways. But, I also know that every American who \nis sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. \nThat must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming \nmonths, and where we return after those debates are done.''\n  Sunshine Week reminds all of us that open Government is not a \nDemocratic issue, nor a Republican issue. It is an American issue and a \nvirtue that all Americans can embrace. Democratic and Republican \nSenators alike have rightly supported and voted for this bill in the \npast. It is in this same bipartisan spirit that I urge all Members to \nsupport this bipartisan FOIA reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``OPEN FOIA Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIFIC CITATIONS IN STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute \n     (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute--\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\n       ``(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the \n     public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the \n     issue; or\n       ``(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or \n     refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and\n       ``(B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN \n     FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Hagan, Ms. Cantwell, and Mrs. \n        McCaskill):\n  S. 614. A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots (``WASP''); to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nis sponsored by every woman in the Senate. All 17 of us have come \ntogether to introduce legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal \nto the Women Airforce Service Pilots, called the WASP. Senator Mikulski \nand I are taking the lead on this with the other 15 women Senators to \nfinally honor over 1,000 of the bravest, most courageous women in U.S. \nmilitary history.\n  This is a picture of those brave World War II pilots. They were the \nfirst women in history to fly America's military aircraft. Between 1942 \nand 1944, they were recruited to fly non-combat missions so every \navailable male pilot could be deployed in combat.\n  The women pilots who graduated from Army Air Force flight training \nearned their silver WASP wings in Texas. The first class graduated at \nEllington Field in Houston and the remaining classes from Avenger Field \nin Sweetwater, TX.\n  Throughout their service, these courageous women flew over 60 million \nmiles in every type of aircraft and on every type of mission flown by \nArmy Air Force male pilots except direct combat missions. Although they \ntook the military oath and were promised military status when they \nentered training, they were never afforded Active-Duty military status, \nwere never commissioned, and were not granted veteran status until \n1977, over 30 years after they had served. All these women volunteered \nto serve their country in wartime. They paid their own way to Texas for \ntraining, and when victory seemed certain and the program was shut \ndown, they paid their own way back home.\n  Over 25,000 women applied for the program, but only 1,830 qualified \nwomen pilots were accepted. Unlike the males, females were required to \nbe qualified pilots before they could even apply for the Army Air \nForce's military flight training program. By the time the war ended, 38 \nwomen pilots had lost their lives while flying for their country. Their \nfamilies were not allowed to have an American flag placed on their \ncoffins.\n  I wrote about the WASP in my 2004 book, ``American Heroines: The \nSpirited Women Who Shaped Our Country.'' I wanted to raise public \nawareness about these military pioneers who have had a tremendous \nimpact on the role of women in the military today. Their examples paved \nthe way for the Armed Forces to lift the ban on women attending \nmilitary flight training in the 1970s and opened the door for women to \nbe fully integrated as pilots in the Armed Forces.\n  Today, women fly every type of aircraft, from combat fighter aircraft \nto the space shuttle. However, despite their cultural impact, the WASP \nhave never received honors, nor have they been formally recognized by \nCongress for their wartime military service--until now. We, the women \nof the Senate, are introducing legislation to award the Congressional \nGold Medal to the courageous WASP of World War II.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest and most distinguished \naward this body can award to a civilian. These women are certainly \nworthy.\n  There are precedents for this action. In 2000 and 2006, this body \nawarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the Navajo Code Talkers and the \nTuskegee Airmen, respectively. Those heroes deserved the same type of \ndistinction, and they, too, served in World War II and were finally \nappropriately honored by their Government. Now it is time for Congress \nto celebrate the courage of another group of remarkable Americans who \nserved with courage and honor and whose example brought historic change \nto our Nation. Of the 1,102 WASP, approximately 300 are still alive \ntoday and are living in almost every State of our Nation. They have \nearned this honor, and the time to bestow the honor is now before any \nof them are away from us and not able to come to the ceremony which I \nhope we will have.\n  I am so pleased that every female Senator, all 17 of us, are \ncosponsors of this bill, and I hope the rest of our colleagues will \nalso join and that we can pass this bill expeditiously.\n  I would like to take a moment, with this wonderful picture in the \nbackground, to read from the bill that we have just introduced today:\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII, known as the \n     ``WASP'', were the first women in history to fly American \n     military aircraft;\n       (2) more than 60 years ago, they flew fighter, bomber, \n     transport, and training aircraft in defense of America's \n     freedom;\n       (3) they faced overwhelming cultural and gender bias \n     against women in nontraditional roles and overcame multiple \n     injustices and inequities in order to serve their country;\n       (4) through their actions, the WASP eventually were the \n     catalyst for revolutionary reform in the integration of women \n     pilots into the Armed Services;\n       (5) during the early months of World War II, there was a \n     severe shortage of combat pilots;\n       (6) Jacqueline Cochran, America's leading woman pilot of \n     the time, convinced General Hap Arnold, Chief of the Army Air \n     Forces, that women, if given the same training as men, would \n     be equally capable of flying military aircraft and could then \n     take over some of the stateside military flying jobs, thereby \n     releasing hundreds of male pilots for combat duty;\n       (7) the severe loss of male combat pilots made the \n     necessity of utilizing women pilots to help in the war effort \n     clear to General Arnold, and a women's pilot training program \n     was soon approved;\n       (8) it was not until August, 1943, that the women aviators \n     would receive their official name;\n       (9) General Arnold ordered that all women pilots flying \n     military aircraft, including 28 civilian women ferry pilots, \n     would be named ``WASP'', Women Airforce Service Pilots;\n       (10) more than 25,000 American women applied for training, \n     but only 1,830 were accepted and took the oath;\n       (11) exactly 1,074 of those trainees successfully completed \n     the 21 to 27 weeks of Army Air Force flight training, \n     graduated, and received their Army Air Force orders to report \n     to their assigned air base;\n       (12) on November 16, 1942, the first class of 29 women \n     pilots reported to the Houston, Texas Municipal Airport and \n     began the same military flight training as the male Army Air \n     Force cadets were taking;\n       (13) due to a lack of adequate facilities at the airport, 3 \n     months later the training program was moved to Avenger Field \n     in Sweetwater, Texas;\n       (14) WASP were eventually stationed at 120 Army air bases \n     all across America;\n       (15) they flew more than 60,000,000 miles for their country \n     in every type of aircraft and on every type of assignment \n     flown by the male Army Air Force pilots, except combat;\n       (16) WASP assignments included test piloting, instructor \n     piloting, towing targets for air-to-air gunnery practice, \n     ground-to-air anti-aircraft practice, ferrying, transporting \n     personnel and cargo (including parts for the atomic bomb), \n     simulated strafing, smoke laying, night tracking, and flying \n     drones;\n\n  In October 1943, male pilots were refusing to fly the B-26 Martin \nMarauder, known as the Widowmaker, because of its fatality record. \nGeneral Arnold ordered WASP director Jacqueline Cochran to collect 25 \nWASP to be trained to fly the B-26 to prove to the male pilots that it \nwas safe to fly.\n  During the existence of the WASP, 38 women lost their lives while \nserving their country. Their bodies were sent home in poorly crafted \npine boxes. Their burial was at the expense of their families or \nclassmates. There were no gold stars allowed in their parent's windows, \nand because they were not considered military, no American flags were \nallowed on their coffins.\n  In 1944, General Arnold made a personal request to Congress to \nmilitarize the WASP, and it was denied.\n  On December 7, 1944, in a speech to the last graduating class of \nWASP, General Arnold said:\n\n       You and more than 900 of your sisters have shown you can \n     fly wingtip to wingtip with your brothers. I salute you . . . \n     We of the Army Air Force are proud of you. We will never \n     forget our debt to you.\n\n  With victory in World War II almost certain, on December 2, 1944, the \nWASP\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\nwere quietly and unceremoniously disbanded. There were no honors, no \nbenefits, and very few thank-yous. Just as they had paid their own way \nto enter training, they paid their way back home.\n  After their honorable service in the military, the WASP military \nrecords were immediately sealed, stamped ``classified'' or ``secret,'' \nand filed away in Government archives unavailable to the historians who \nwrote the history of World War II or the scholars who compiled the \nhistory textbooks used today, with many of the records not being \ndeclassified until the 1980s. Consequently, the WASP story is a missing \nchapter in the history of the Air Force, the history of aviation, and \nthe history of the United States of America.\n  In 1977, 33 years after the WASP were disbanded, the Congress finally \nvoted to give the WASP the veteran status they had earned, but these \nheroic pilots were not invited to the signing ceremony at the White \nHouse, and it was not until 7 years later that their medals were \ndelivered in the mail in plain brown envelopes.\n  In the late 1970s, more than 30 years after the WASP flew in World \nWar II, women were finally permitted to attend military pilot training \nin the U.S. Armed Forces. Thousands of women aviators flying support \naircraft had benefited from the service of the WASP and followed in \ntheir footsteps.\n  In 1993, the WASP were once again referenced during congressional \nhearings regarding the contributions women could make to the military, \nwhich eventually led to women being able to fly military fighter, \nbomber, and attack aircraft in combat. Hundreds of U.S. servicewomen \ncombat pilots have seized the opportunity to fly fighter aircraft in \nrecent conflicts, all thanks to the pioneering steps taken by the WASP.\n  The WASP have maintained a tight-knit community, forged by the common \nexperiences of serving their country during war. As part of their \ndesire to educate America on the WASP history, WASP have assisted Wings \nAcross America, an organization dedicated to educating the American \npublic, with much effort aimed at children, about the remarkable \naccomplishments of these World War II veterans, and they have been \nhonored with exhibits at museums throughout our country.\n  Now it is time to give these incredible women pioneers the \nCongressional Gold Medal, who, along with the Tuskegee Airmen and the \nNavajo Code Talkers, are people who have served with courage and valor \nto our country, and they are people who really have not complained. \nThey are people who did their duty, even with some discrimination in \nthe Armed Forces. But they were never bitter, and they always knew what \na service they had given. We have now honored the Navajo Code Talkers \nand the great Tuskegee Airmen, and I hope we will also accord the \ngreatest honor we can bestow as a Congress to the WASP of World War II.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \na bipartisan bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots--the WASP. We are introducing this bill in \nMarch, which is Women's History Month. It is time to honor and \nrecognize women who have made a difference in our Nation's history. It \nis a time to honor women who serve as role models. That is exactly what \nthis legislation does.\n  The WASP were women pilots from across the Nation who volunteered to \nserve in World War II. They flew America's military aircraft during the \nwar, risking their lives in the service of their nation. They came from \nall walks of life, but they came together to serve our country as the \nfirst women trained to fly American military aircraft. They faced \noverwhelming cultural and gender bias, received unequal pay, did not \nhave full military status, and were barred from becoming military \nofficers, even though their male counterparts performing similar duties \nall received officer rank.\n  In 1943, General Arnold combined two women flying organizations and \nformed the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Within months, these women \npaid their own way to Texas to enter training. Each woman was already a \nlicensed pilot, a requirement not imposed on men to apply to flight \nschool. The WASP were still required to learn to fly ``the Army way.''\n  The WASP were assured they would be militarized and become part of \nthe Army. These promise were not kept. The WASP took the same oath of \noffice, they marched, but as pilots, they received less pay than men. \nThey did not receive benefits. No VA benefits, no GI bill, no burial \nrights for the 38 WASP who were killed in service to our Nation. Fellow \nWASP had to ``take the nickels out of the Coke machine'' to help send \ntheir bodies home.\n  Over 25,000 women applied to be part of the war effort in the WASP. \nMany volunteers received a telegram asking for their service. \nUltimately, 1102 women earned their wings as pilots. Thirteen of these \nbrave women were from Maryland: women like Barbara Shoemaker, who \njoined from the Women's Auxiliary Flying Squadron; Elaine Harmon, who \nas a WASP trained male pilots in instrument flying; Iola Magruder, who \nflew the B-18 ``Bolo''; Jane Tedeschi, who stretched all night before \njoining the WASP so she could meet the minimum height requirement; and \nFlorence Marston, who flew the B-26 ``Widowmaker,'' notorious for its \nnumber of early accidents.\n  These brave women flew over 60 million miles in 2 years. They flew \nevery type of aircraft and every type of mission as the men, except \ncombat missions. They towed aerial targets while being shot at with \nlive ammunition. They transported cargo. They tested repaired aircraft. \nThey ferried aircraft from factories like Fairchild in Hagerstown, MD, \nto points across the country. They were stationed at 120 air bases \nthroughout the country.\n  The WASP were not established to be a replacement for the men; \ninstead, they enabled men to fly the combat missions. They found and \nfulfilled the service they could. These women were committed and they \nbelieved they could do what our country needed at the time we needed \nit.\n  The WASP were disbanded in December 1944, when they were told they \nwere ``no longer needed.'' Just as they paid for transport to training, \nthey paid their own way home. For 33 years their military records were \nclassified. For 33 years, their contributions were hidden from \nhistorians and textbooks. For 33 years, these brave women were denied \nveterans benefits.\n  These women were trailblazers. They displayed honor and courage and \nflew the most complex aircraft of the age. They are patriots. They are \nan inspiration to today's women in aviation. They opened the door for \ntoday's women to fly in the military in aircraft ranging from cargo and \ntrainers, to fighters and bombers, and even the space shuttle. They \ninspire young girls to pursue technical fields and aviation. They are \nrole models who deserve to be honored. We owe the WASP our ``thank \nyou''--not in words, but in deeds. For their courage, service and \ndedication to our Nation, they deserve the most distinguished honor \nCongress can give: the Congressional Gold Medal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n  S. 615. A bill to provide additional personnel authorities for the \nSpecial Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith Senators Lieberman, Coburn, Levin, Grassley, McCaskill, McCain, \nand Voinovich, a bill that will provide the Special Inspector General \nfor Afghanistan Reconstruction, SIGAR, with the authority it needs to \nquickly hire experienced, well-qualified staff to conduct rigorous \noversight of reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.\n  The United States has provided approximately $32 billion in \nhumanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan since 2001. \nCongress created the SIGAR in the fiscal year 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act to conduct and oversee independent and objective \naudits, inspections, and investigations relating to these funds.\n  Although the SIGAR was sworn into office on July 22, 2008, the office \nhas not yet conducted any independent audits or investigations. The \nSIGAR has filed two quarterly reports, but both of those reports were \ndescriptive in nature and reviewed the work of other oversight \nentities.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n  Staffing shortages have constrained the SIGAR's oversight efforts. \nAlthough authorized a total of 18 auditors, 13 inspectors, and three \ninvestigators, SIGAR had only five auditors, two inspectors, and one \ninvestigator as of last week.\n  SIGAR's efforts to quickly hire experienced staff have been hindered \nby the often long and difficult government hiring process. The office's \nhiring needs are further complicated by the challenging task of \nrecruiting well-qualified staff willing to spend a year in a dangerous \nenvironment.\n  The bill that we introduce today will provide the SIGAR with the \nauthority to select, appoint, and employ the staff needed to perform \neffective oversight of Afghanistan reconstruction efforts. The \nauthority is similar to that provided to other government ``temporary \norganizations.'' The legislation will allow SIGAR to identify and \nquickly hire candidates, avoiding the bureaucratic hurdles that beset \nthe normal civil service hiring process. Employees hired under this new \nauthority can serve until the termination of the SIGAR's office.\n  The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, which served \nas the model for the legislation to create the SIGAR, faced comparable \nhiring challenges. This bill contains hiring authority similar to that \nprovided to the SIGIR so that office could quickly hire experienced \nstaff.\n  With his staff, the SIGIR has been successful in providing thorough \noversight of reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Since 2004, the SIGIR has \nproduced 20 quarterly reports, 135 audits, 141 inspections, and 4 \n``lessons-learned'' reports. SIGIR's oversight work has saved or \nrecovered more than $81 million in U.S. taxpayer funds and has put $224 \nmillion to better use.\n  If the SIGAR would have had this authority from the office's \ninception, it likely would be much further along in conducting its \noversight work. We expect that once the SIGAR can quickly hire the \nskilled and experienced auditors and investigators it needs, the \noffice's oversight activities will greatly increase.\n  I urge every Senator to support this constructive and bipartisan \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 618. A bill to improve the calculation of, the reporting of, and \nthe accountability for, secondary graduation rates; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this past fall our Nation's high school \ngraduation class of 2012 took their first steps into their local high \nschool as freshmen. The best research, based on data from all 50 \nStates, tells us that one third of that class of freshmen will not walk \nacross a stage and receive their diploma with their peers in four \nyears.\n  The numbers are clear: we face a national high school dropout crisis. \nEvery year, an estimated 1.23 million students drop out of high school. \nTo put that number in perspective, it is equivalent to the entire \npopulation of the ninth largest city in the country, Dallas.\n  The President laid out the crisis we face in his February 24 address \nto Congress:\n  ``In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is \nyour knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to \nopportunity--it is a prerequisite.''\n  ``Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations \nrequire more than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our \ncitizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high \nschool dropout rates of any industrialized nation.''\n  By any measure, my home state of Iowa is a national leader in terms \nof graduating students in four years. According to Education Week's \nDiplomas Count, Iowa has the second highest graduation rate in the \ncountry, at almost 83 percent for the class of 2005. Iowa should be \napplauded for continually graduating such a high percentage of its \nstudents in spite of the challenges present in many rural and low-\nincome school districts.\n  Yet such a lofty number masks a pervasive inability to graduate \nAfrican-American and Latino students on a level equal to their peers. \nThe graduation rate for African-American children in Iowa is 25 points \nbelow the overall 4-year rate. The discrepancy between the rate of \nLatino children graduating in four years and their peers' rate is even \nhigher at 30 percent.\n  Just as the data on racial and ethnic minorities paints a grim \npicture, a look into the Nation's graduation rates for students with \ndisabilities shows many students continue to be failed by the system. \nThe most recent data indicates that slightly more than half of all \nstudents with disabilities graduated from high school with a regular \ndiploma. Those rates go down when examining different categories of \nstudents with disabilities. For instance, only 43 percent of students \nwith emotional disturbances graduate from high school with a regular \ndiploma. Bear in mind that many of these students do not have a \nlearning disability, and with the proper supports and interventions \nthey can achieve at the same levels expected of their peers.\n  To reiterate, States like Iowa should be lauded for their success in \ngraduating so many of their young people from high school in four \nyears, but we must also hold those states accountable for their success \nor failure with vulnerable populations, or we are doomed to pay the \nprice, both morally and economically. That is why I was proud to \nintroduce the Every Student Counts Act last September, and why I am \nhere to reintroduce this legislation in the Senate today.\n  Since I introduced the first Every Student Counts Act, the Department \nof Education has taken laudable action to implement a 4-year high \nschool graduation rate through regulations issued last October.\n  However, the Department's action was not enough to address this \ncrisis. The regulation leaves the specifics of the graduation rate \ngoals and growth targets, and how to calculate Adequate Yearly Progress \nup to the States. In doing so, the Department indicated that it was \nmore appropriate for Congress to define graduation rate goals, growth \ntargets, and adequate yearly progress through statute. The Every \nStudent Counts Act is designed to do just that.\n  Because if we do not set clear, consistent, and high graduation rate \ngoals, with aggressive and attainable graduation rate growth targets, \nwe risk falling into the same trap of mediocrity and flat graduation \nrates that have led us to this crisis.\n  Schools, school districts and States that are not already graduating \na high number of students must be required to make annual progress to \nhigh graduation rates.\n  This act sets a graduation rate goal of 90 percent for all students \nand disadvantaged populations. Schools, districts and States with \ngraduation rates below 90 percent, in the aggregate or for any \nsubgroup, will be required to increase their graduation rates an \naverage of 3 percentage points per year in order to make adequate \nyearly progress required under the No Child Left Behind Law.\n  In addition to setting high standards for graduation rates, the Every \nStudent Counts Act will also make graduation rate calculations uniform \nand accurate. The bill requires that all states calculate their \ngraduation rates in the same manner, allowing for more consistency and \ntransparency. This bill will bring all 50 States together by requiring \neach State to report both a 4-year graduation rate and a cumulative \ngraduation rate. A cumulative graduation rate will give parents a clear \npicture of how many students are graduating, while acknowledging that \nnot all children will graduate in four years.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to recognize the work of \nmy colleague in the House, Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia, who \nfirst sought to address this issue last year and today joins with me in \nreintroducing the Every Student Counts Act.\n  I would also like to thank the growing list of organizations \nrepresenting the interests of children across the country who have \nsigned on to support the Every Student Counts Act. Specifically, I \nrecognize the Alliance for Excellent Education and their President, \nformer Governor of West Virginia Bob Wise, who have been champions in \nthe movement to improve our high schools and turn back the dropout \ncrisis.\n  We have no more urgent educational challenge than bringing down the \ndropout rate, especially for minorities and children with disabilities. \nFor reasons we all understand--poverty, poor nutrition, broken homes, \ndisadvantage\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nchildhoods--not all of our students come to school everyday ready to \nlearn. In some cases, it is as though they have been set up to fail. \nThey grow frustrated. They drop out. And, as a result, they face a \nlifetime of fewer opportunities and lower earnings. Economically, our \nnation cannot afford to lose one million students each year. Morally, \nwe cannot allow children to continue to fall through the cracks. I \nbelieve the Every Student Counts Act puts us on the right track towards \nturning back the tide of high school dropouts and I ask my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 11, 2009.\n       Dear Senator Harkin and Representative Scott: We, the \n     undersigned education, civil rights, and advocacy \n     organizations thank you for introducing the Every Student \n     Counts Act to ensure meaningful accountability for the \n     graduation rates of our nation's students. As you know, \n     educators and policymakers at all levels of government agree \n     that change is necessary on this issue.\n       Only 70 percent of our nation's students graduate with a \n     regular diploma. Worse, just over half of African American \n     and Hispanic students graduate on time. Special education \n     students also have graduation rates of just over 50 percent. \n     Such poor graduation rates are untenable in a global economy \n     that demands an educated workforce. According to the \n     Department of Labor, 90 percent of the fastest-growing and \n     best-paying jobs in the United States require at least some \n     postsecondary education. It is imperative that the nation's \n     schools prepare their students to succeed in the twenty-\n     first-century workforce.\n       The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has focused the \n     nation's attention on the unacceptable achievement gap and \n     the need to improve outcomes for all students, particularly \n     minority students, English language learners, and students \n     with disabilities. However, NCLB does not place enough \n     importance on graduating the nation's high school students; \n     this fact--combined with weak state action in this area--has \n     given states, districts, and schools little incentive to \n     improve their graduation rates. As a response, the Secretary \n     of Education released regulations that created a uniform high \n     school graduation rate calculation and ensured that improving \n     high school graduation rates for all schools is part of the \n     federal accountability system. Although the regulations are a \n     laudable step in the right direction, we believe that the \n     Every Student Counts Act is a better approach to graduation \n     rate accountability because it provides clear and high \n     expectations for graduation rate goals and growth.\n       The Every Student Counts Act would:\n       Require a consistent and accurate calculation of graduation \n     rates across all fifty states and the District of Columbia to \n     ensure comparability and transparency;\n       Require that graduation rate calculations be disaggregated \n     for both accountability and reporting purposes to ensure that \n     school improvement activities focus on all students and close \n     achievement gaps;\n       Ensure that graduation rates and test scores are treated \n     equally in Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) determinations;\n       Require aggressive, attainable, and uniform annual growth \n     targets as part of AYP to ensure consistent increases in \n     graduation rates for all schools;\n       While maintaining the expectation that most students will \n     graduate in four years, recognize that a small number of \n     students take longer than four years to graduate and give \n     credit to schools, school districts, and states for \n     graduating those students; and\n       Provide incentives for schools, districts, and states to \n     create programs to serve students who have already dropped \n     out and are over-age or undercredited.\n       Again, we thank you for introducing the Every Student \n     Counts Act and for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Excellent Education.\n       American Association of University Women.\n       American Federation of the Blind.\n       American School Counselor Association America's Promise \n     Alliance.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Council of Administrators of Special Education.\n       First Focus.\n       Journey Programs.\n       Knowledge Alliance.\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America.\n       Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n       National Association for the Education of Homeless Children \n     and Youth.\n       National Association of Federally Impacted Schools.\n       National Association of School Psychologists.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of State Boards of Education.\n       National Center for Learning Disabilities National \n     Collaboration for Youth.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Education Association.\n       National Parent Teacher Association.\n       Project Grad USA.\n       Public Education Network.\n       School Social Work Association of America.\n       Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.\n       United Way of America.\n       Youth Service America.\n                                                       Joel Klein,\n                         Chancellor, New York City Public Schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself and Ms. Snowe)):\n  S. 619. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npreserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics used in \nthe treatment of human and animal diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today we face growing concerns about \ninfectious disease which few could have anticipated. Over a half \ncentury ago, following the development of modern antibiotics, Nobel \nLaureate Sir McFarland Burnet summed up what many experts believed when \nhe stated, ``One can think of the middle of the twentieth century as \nthe end of one of the most important social revolutions in history, the \nvirtual elimination of infectious diseases as a significant factor in \nsocial life''.\n  How things have changed! Today many of the world's greatest killers \nare infectious diseases--including HIV, tuberculosis, malaria--and \nincreasingly our Nation is susceptible. We have concerns about both \nnatural pandemics--such as those caused by influenza--as well as \nmanmade threats.\n  At the same time that the threat has grown, we have seen an alarming \ntrend as existing antibiotics are becoming less effective in treating \ninfections. We know that resistance to drugs can be developed, and that \nthe more we expose bacteria to antibiotics, the more resistance we will \nsee. So it is critical to address preserving the lifesaving antibiotic \ndrugs we have today so that they will be of use in treating disease \nwhen they are needed.\n  Today over 9 out of 10 Americans understand that resistance to \nantibiotics is a problem. Most Americans have learned that colds and \nflu are caused by viruses, and recognize that treating a cold with an \nantibiotic is inappropriate. Our health care providers are more careful \nto discriminate when to use antibiotics, because they know that when a \npatient who has been inappropriately prescribed an antibiotic actually \ndevelops a bacterial infection, it is more likely to be resistant to \ntreatment.\n  When we overuse antibiotics, we risk eliminating the very cures which \nscientists fought so hard to develop. The threat of bioterrorism \namplifies the danger. We have supported increased NIH research funding, \nas well as bioshield legislation, in order to promote development of \nessential drugs, both to address natural and manmade threats. It is so \ncounterproductive to develop antimicrobial drugs and see their misuse \nrender them ineffective.\n  Yet every day in America antibiotics continue to be used in huge \nquantities when there is no disease present to treat. I am speaking of \nthe nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agriculture. Simply put, the \npractice of feeding antibiotics to healthy animals jeopardizes the \neffectiveness of these medicines in treating ill people and animals.\n  Recognizing the public health threat caused by antibiotic resistance, \nCongress in 2000 amended the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \nto curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine. Yet today, it is \nestimated that 70 percent of the antimicrobials used in the United \nStates are fed to farm animals for nontherapeutic purposes including \ngrowth promotion, poor management practices and crowded, unsanitary \nconditions.\n  In March 2003, the National Academies of Sciences stated that a \ndecrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will not solve \nthe problem of drug resistance. Substantial efforts must be made to \ndecrease inappropriate overuse of antibiotics in animals and \nagriculture.\n  Four years ago five major medical and environmental groups--the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, \nEnvironmental Defense, the Food Animal Concerns Trust and the Union of \nConcerned Scientists--jointly filed a formal regulatory petition with \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration urging the agency to withdraw \napprovals for\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nseven classes of antibiotics which are used as agricultural feed \nadditives. They pointed out what we have known for years--that \nantibiotics which are crucial to treating human disease should never be \nused except for their intended purpose--to treat disease.\n  In a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nresearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 17 \npercent of drug-resistant staph infections had no apparent links to \nhealth-care settings. Nearly one in five of these resistant infections \narose in the community--not in the health care setting. While must do \nmore to address inappropriate antibiotic use in medicine, the use of \nthese drugs in our environment cannot be ignored.\n  Most distressingly, we have seen the USDA issue a fact sheet on the \nrecently recognized link between antimicrobial drug use in animals and \nthe methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureas, MRSA, infections in \nhumans. These infections literally threaten life and limb!\n  So it should be clear why I have joined with Senator Kennedy in again \nintroducing the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act. \nSenator Kennedy is truly a champion of public health and understands \nhow critical it is to preserve the drugs we must have in our arsenal to \ncombat infectious diseases. I am honored to join with him in an effort \nto preserve vital drugs and reduce the development of drug-resistant \norganisms which threaten human health.\n  This bill phases out the nontherapeutic uses of critical medically \nimportant antibiotics in livestock and poultry production, unless their \nmanufacturers can show that they pose no danger to public health.\n  Our legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw \nthe approval for nontherapeutic agricultural use of antibiotics in \nfood-producing animals if the antibiotic is used for treating human \ndisease, unless the application is proven harmless within 2 years. The \nsame tough standard of safety will apply to new applications for \napproval of animal antibiotics.\n  This legislation places no unreasonable burden on producers. It does \nnot restrict the use of antibiotics to treat sick animals, or for that \nmatter to treat pets and other animals not used for food.\n  As we are constantly reminded, the discovery and development of a new \ndrug can require great time and expense. It is simply common sense that \nwe preserve the use of the drugs which we already have, and use them \nappropriately. I call on my colleagues to support us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 620. A bill to repeal the provision of law that provides automatic \npay adjustments for Members of Congress; considered and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to coordinate \nFederal congenital heart disease research efforts and to improve public \neducation and awareness of congenital heart disease, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on legislation I am \nintroducing today that relates to congenital heart disease \nresearch. Congenital heart disease is a rapidly growing national health \nproblem. Congenital heart defects are the most common and most deadly \nform of birth defects, affecting nearly 1 percent of births, \napproximately 36,000 a year. In fact, a child is born with a congenital \nheart defect every 15 minutes. A congenital heart defect occurs when \nheart structures are malformed, missing or in the wrong place. There \nare over 30 types of congenital heart defects. These defects cause \ncongenital heart disease--cardiovascular problems caused by the birth \ndefect.\n\n  The good news is that modern medicine has made major advances in \ntreating heart defects in newborns. In 1950, a child born with a \ncongenital heart defect only had a 20 percent chance of surviving, but \ntoday that number has increased to 90 percent. Due to the increase in \nchildhood survival rates, the congenital heart disease population \nincreases by an estimated 5 percent every year.\n  However, the bad news is that there is no cure for congenital heart \ndisease. Even survivors of successful childhood intervention face \nlifelong risks, including heart failure, rhythmic disorders, stroke, \nrenal dysfunction, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Sadly, the estimated \nlife expectancy for those with congenital heart disease is \nsignificantly lower than for the general population. The life \nexpectancy for those born with moderately complex heart defects is 55, \nwhile the estimated life expectancy for those born with highly complex \ndefects is between 35 and 40.\n  Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of adults living with complex \ncongenital heart disease currently receive the cardiac care they need, \nand many don't know that they should have life-long specialized health \nsurveillance. Even with access to the best care, living with congenital \nheart disease involves risk. But for people who don't have the medical \ncare or who don't have it promptly, the risks of premature death or \ndisability are much higher.\n  In 2004, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a \nworking group on congenital heart disease. This group recommended \ndeveloping a research network for clinical research, establishing a \nnational database of patients, and creating an outreach education \nprogram on the need for continued cardiac care.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Congenital Heart Futures Act, \nwhich builds on these recommendations in several ways. First, the \nlegislation authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC, to lead a comprehensive public education and awareness campaign \naround congenital heart disease. Next, it authorizes a National \nCongenital Heart Disease Registry at the CDC to track the epidemiology \nof congenital heart disease and creates an advisory committee to \nprovide expert information and advice to CDC. And, finally, it \nauthorizes congenital heart disease research through NHLBI.\n  Despite the prevalence and seriousness of congenital heart disease, \nresearch, data collection, education, and awareness are limited. The \nCongenital Heart Futures Act will help prevent premature death and \ndisability in this rapidly growing but dramatically underserved \npopulation.\n  I say to those who are interested in promoting health research, this \nis an area where we can expend more effort and save more lives. I hope \nmy colleagues will take a look at this legislation which we are \nintroducing today and join me in cosponsoring it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted int he Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Congenital Heart Futures \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n         Congress finds the following:\n         (1) Congenital heart defects are the most common and most \n     deadly group of birth defects and affect nearly 1 percent of \n     all live\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\n     births, approximately 36,000 births a year. A child is born \n     with a congenital heart defect every 15 minutes.\n         (2) Congenital heart disease is a rapidly-growing \n     national health problem. Childhood survival has risen from \n     below 20 percent in 1950 to more than 90 percent today. Due \n     to the increase in childhood survival, the congenital heart \n     disease population increases by an estimated 5 percent every \n     year.\n         (3) Approximately 800,000 children and 1,000,000 adults \n     in the United States are now living with congenital heart \n     disease and require highly-specialized life-long cardiac \n     care.\n         (4) There is no cure for congenital heart disease. Even \n     survivors of successful childhood treatment can face life-\n     long risks from congenital heart disease, including heart \n     failure, rhythmic disorders, stroke, renal dysfunction, and \n     neurocognitive dysfunction.\n         (5) Less than 10 percent of adults living with complex \n     congenital heart disease currently receive recommended \n     cardiac care. Many individuals with congenital heart disease \n     are unaware that they require life-long specialized health \n     surveillance. Delays in care can result in premature death \n     and disability.\n         (6) The estimated life expectancy for those with \n     congenital heart disease is significantly lower than for the \n     general population. The life expectancy for those born with \n     moderately complex heart defects is 55, while the estimated \n     life expectancy for those born with highly complex defects is \n     between 35 and 40.\n         (7) Despite the prevalence and seriousness of the \n     disease, Federal research, data collection, education, and \n     awareness activities are limited.\n         (8) The strategic plan of the National Heart, Lung, and \n     Blood Institute completed in 2007 notes that ``successes over \n     several decades have enabled people with congenital heart \n     diseases to live beyond childhood, but too often inadequate \n     data are available to guide their treatment as adults''.\n         (9) The strategic plan for the Division of Cardiovascular \n     Diseases at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, \n     completed in 2008, set goals for congenital heart disease \n     research, including understanding the development and genetic \n     basis of congenital heart disease, improving evidence-based \n     care and treatment of children with congenital and acquired \n     pediatric heart disease, and improving evidence-based care \n     and treatment of adults with congenital heart disease.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to ensure parity between the temporary duty imposed on \nethanol and tax credits provided on ethanol; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Imported \nEthanol Parity Act of 2009.\n  This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Gregg, Bingaman, Collins, \nCantwell and Martinez.\n  First, let me explain what this bill does.\n  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act instructs the President to lower the \nsecondary ethanol import tariff, so that tariffs on ethanol are no \nhigher than the subsidy for blending ethanol into gasoline.\n  This would restore parity between the real tariff faced by imported \ngasoline and ethanol, which currently compete.\n  This legislation is necessary because last year's Farm Bill shifted \nthe function of ethanol tariffs.\n  Historically, there has been relative parity between ethanol \nsubsidies and ethanol tariffs. The tariffs served to ``offset'' \ndomestic subsidies for ethanol use, thereby preventing imported ethanol \nfrom benefiting from domestic subsidies.\n  But after passage of the Farm Bill, these tariffs began to serve as a \nreal barrier to trade.\n  The Farm Bill maintained the primary 2.5 percent tariff and extended \nthe secondary tariff for two more years at $0.54 per gallon, creating a \ncombined tariff of $0.56 to $0.59 per gallon, depending on the sale \nprice. But the Farm Bill reduced the ethanol blending subsidy that \nthese tariffs are intended to offset to $0.45 per gallon.\n  This disparity means that an ethanol importer pays more tariff than \nhe gets back in subsidy, and parity has been lost.\n  Specifically, an ethanol importer pays $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon of \ntariff to the U.S. Treasury that he never gets back from the ethanol \nsubsidy.\n  Ethanol is therefore disadvantaged when it competes directly with \nother imported transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel.\n  It increases the cost of gasoline in the United States by making \nethanol more expensive.\n  It prevents Americans from importing ethanol made from sugarcane. \nSugar ethanol is the only available transportation fuel that works in \ntoday's cars and emits considerably less lifecycle greenhouse gas than \ngasoline.\n  It taxes imported transportation fuel from our friends in Brazil, \nIndia, and Australia, while oil and gasoline imports from OPEC enter \nthe United States tax free.\n  It hinders the emergence of a global biofuels marketplace through \nwhich countries with a strong biofuel crop could sell fuel to countries \nthat suffered drought or other agricultural difficulties in the same \ncrop year. Such a global market would permit mutually beneficial trade \nbetween producing regions and stabilize both fuel and food prices.\n  It makes us more dependent on the Middle East for fuel when we should \nbe increasing the number of countries from whom we buy fuel. When it \ncomes to energy security for the United States, which has less than 3 \npercent of proven global oil reserves and 25 percent of demand, we must \ndiversify supply.\n  Bottom Line: Until the tariff is lowered, the United States will tax \nthe only fuel it can import that increases energy security, reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and lowers gasoline prices.\n  This legislation responds to the Tariff's defenders.\n  In 2006 I introduced legislation to eliminate the ethanol tariff \nentirely, and in 2007 I cosponsored an amendment to the Energy Bill \nwhich would have eliminated the tariff.\n  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act is a different proposal that I \nbelieve addresses the concerns of tariff defenders.\n  The advocates of the $0.54 per gallon secondary tariff on ethanol \nimports have always argued that the tariff is necessary in order to \noffset the blender subsidy that applies to the use of all ethanol, \nwhether produced domestically or internationally.\n  They argue that the ethanol subsidy exists to support American \nfarmers who produce ethanol at higher cost than foreign producers. For \ninstance, on May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nstated on the Senate floor that, ``the U.S. tariff on ethanol operates \nas an offset to an excise tax credit that applies to both domestically \nproduced and imported ethanol.''\n  On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels Association stated in a press \nrelease: ``the secondary tariff exists as an offset to the tax \nincentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of ethanol they \nblend, regardless of the ethanol's origin.''\n  In a letter to Congress dated June 20, 2007, the American Coalition \nfor Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the \nNational Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated \nthat the blender tax credit is available to refiners regardless of \nwhether the ethanol blended is imported or domestic. To prevent U.S. \ntaxpayers from subsidizing foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed \nan offset to the tax credit that foreign companies pay in the form of a \ntariff.\n  In 2008, the Renewable Fuels Association's Executive Director \nasserted that ``The tariff is there not so much to protect the industry \nbut the U.S. taxpayer.''\n  I ask tariff advocates to either support this legislation or explain \nhow a tariff can justifiably be higher than the subsidy it is designed \nto offset.\n  Bottom Line: Ethanol from Brazil or Australia should not have to \novercome a trade barrier that no drop of OPEC oil must face. The \ntariffs cannot be justifiably maintained at $0.56-$0.59 per gallon if \nits intent is to offset a $0.45 per gallon blender subsidy, and it \nshould be reduced.\n  Climate Change is the most significant environmental challenge we \nface, and I believe that lowering the ethanol tariff will make it less \nexpensive for the United States to combat global warming.\n  Here is how: the fuel we burn to power our cars is a major source of \nthe greenhouse gas emissions warming our planet. In California, it \naccounts for 40 percent of all of our emissions. To reduce this impact, \nwe need to increase the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and lower the \nlifecycle carbon emissions of the fuel itself.\n  For this reason, in the 110th Congress I introduced the Clean Fuels \nand Vehicles Act with Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.\n  The legislation proposed a ``Low Carbon Fuels Standard,'' which would \nrequire each major oil company selling gasoline in the United States to \nreduce the average lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of \nenergy in their gasoline by 3 percent by 2015 and by 3 percent more in \n2020.\n  This concept became a major aspect of the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007, in which Congress requires oil companies to use \nan increasing quantity of ``advanced biofuels'' that produce at least \n50 percent less lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline.\n  Unfortunately the ethanol tariff puts a trade barrier in front of the \nlowest carbon fuel available, making it considerably more expensive for \nthe United States to lower the lifecycle carbon emissions of \ntransportation fuel.\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n  The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol vary depending on \nproduction methods and feedstocks, and these differences will impact \nthe degree to which ethanol may be used to meet ``low-carbon'' fuel \nrequirements under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\n  For instance, sugar cane ethanol plants use biomass from sugar stalks \nas process energy, resulting in less fossil fuel input compared to \ncurrent corn-to-ethanol processes. By comparison, researchers at the \nUniversity of California concluded that ``only 5 to 26 percent of the \nenergy content in corn ethanol, is renewable. The rest is primarily \nnatural gas and coal,'' which are used in the production process.\n  The most recent research compiled by the California Air Resources \nBoard concluded that the direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of \nimported sugar based ethanol are 73 percent lower than gasoline, while \nthe direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol \nfrom the Midwest are 31 percent lower than gasoline.\n  Even when land use change is factored in, the lifecycle greenhouse \ngas emissions of sugar-based ethanol from Brazil is the single least \nemitting fuel option available for today's vehicles. It is only \nsurpassed on an emissions basis by electric and fuel cell cars, which \nare unfortunately at least a few years away from widespread adoption.\n  Biofuels that protect our planet may be produced abroad, and we \nshould not put tariffs in front of these fuels, if we import crude oil \nand gasoline tariff free.\n  This legislation accomplishes two goals: it corrects the Farm Bill's \nmistaken policy that imposed a real trade barrier on clean and climate \nfriendly ethanol imports, giving gasoline imports a competitive \nadvantage over cleaner fuel that simply should not exist at a time we \nare trying to combat climate change.\n  It prevents ethanol producers abroad from receiving American ethanol \nsubsidies, which is supposedly the intent of the ethanol tariff.\n  I think it strikes the right balance, and I urge Congress to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974, title XXVII of the Public Service Act, and the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit preexisting condition \nexclusions in group health plans and in health insurance coverage in \nthe group and individual markets; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pre-\nexisting Condition Patient Protection Act, legislation to provide \ncrucial protections for individuals with chronic and preexisting \nconditions. Unfair insurance market rules, including those which allow \ninsurance companies to exclude coverage for preexisting health \nconditions, have forced thousands of American families into dire \nmedical and financial situations. Addressing this issue is a priority \nof the President and should be a priority for Congress.\n  As we begin to consider comprehensive health reform, including \nsignificant coverage expansions for the uninsured, this reform should \nalso address the gaps in coverage for the 25 million Americans who are \nunderinsured often due to their preexisting condition. Health insurance \ncoverage should be meaningful and available when people need it.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that \nnearly 45 percent of Americans--or 133 million people--have at least \none chronic condition. Furthermore, a report recently published in the \nAnnals of Internal Medicine found that nearly one-third of all \nuninsured Americans in 2004 had received a chronic condition diagnosis. \nEarly intervention and adequate treatment for those with chronic \nconditions is vital. Unfortunately, preexisting condition exclusions \nare often a barrier for individuals seeking access to comprehensive \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct of 1996, HIPAA, P.L. 104-191, over 10 years ago with the objective \nof protecting Americans from interruptions in health insurance coverage \nresulting from job changes or other life transitions. HIPAA provides \nthis protection by restricting when private insurers can use \npreexisting conditions to limit health insurance coverage. HIPAA has \nbeen successful, and many individuals have come to rely on its \nprotections. However, after more than a decade, certain gaps in HIPAA's \nprotection have become apparent.\n  First, individuals who have been without health insurance coverage \nfor 63 days or more are at risk of being permanently uninsurable. This \nis particularly true of individuals with preexisting conditions, \nbecause a 63-day gap in coverage eliminates any prior creditable \ncoverage. If an employee cannot demonstrate that he or she had prior \ncreditable and continuous coverage, an employer can exclude coverage \nfor preexisting conditions for up to 12 months.\n  Second, employers can restrict coverage for preexisting conditions to \notherwise qualified employees based on a 6-month ``look-back'' period. \nThis means that an employer may use medical recommendations, diagnoses, \nand treatments within the most recent six months to deny health \ncoverage for a ``preexisting condition'' for up to 12 months.\n  Third, the protections offered to individuals moving into a group \nhealth plan, or moving into the individual insurance market from a \ngroup plan, are not available to individuals attempting to shop around \nfor policies within individual market. As a result, individuals who \npurchase policies in the nongroup market and never have a gap in \ncoverage still have no protection against the preexisting condition \nexclusions that insurers may choose to impose. In most cases, there is \nno limit on the length of time an insurer can deny coverage under an \nindividual insurance policy for a preexisting condition. An individual \nwith a chronic condition who is buying coverage in the individual \nmarket today is likely to pay a high deductible, have a large monthly \npremium, and have the very illness they need coverage for written out \nof their policy.\n  The Pre-existing Condition Patient Protection Act I am introducing \ntoday would address all three of these gaps in the current HIPAA law by \neliminating preexisting condition exclusions in every single market. \nWhile this change is not the only insurance market reform necessary, it \nis a great step forward in improving the health coverage available to \nthe 133 million Americans living with at least one chronic condition.\n  Access to treatment is critical for these individuals, and a \npermanent fix to the law regarding coverage exclusions is crucial for \nour Nation in reforming our health care system. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. The time for \naction is now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preexisting Condition \n     Patient Protection Act of 2009''.\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the United States Census Bureau, \n     45,700,000 individuals were uninsured in 2007.\n       (2) According to a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, \n     the number of underinsured adults ages 19 to 64 has jumped 60 \n     percent over the last 4 years, from 16,000,000 in 2003 to \n     25,000,000 in 2007.\n       (3) According to the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, approximately 45 percent of Americans have at \n     least 1 chronic condition.\n       (4) Forty-four States currently allow insurance companies \n     to deny coverage for, limit coverage for, or charge increased \n     premiums for a pre-existing condition.\n       (5) Over 26,000,000 individuals were enrolled in private \n     individual market health plans in 2007. Under the amendments \n     made by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \n     Act of 1996, these individuals have no protections against \n     pre-existing condition exclusions or waiting periods.\n       (6) When an individual has a 63-day gap in health insurance \n     coverage, pre-existing condition exclusions, such as limiting \n     coverage, can be placed on them when they become insured \n     under a new health insurance policy.\n       (7) Eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions for all \n     individuals is a vital safeguard to ensuring all Americans \n     have access to health care when in need.\n       (8) According to a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School \n     of Public Health public opinion poll, 58 percent of Americans \n     strongly favor the Federal Government requiring health \n     insurance companies to cover anyone who applies for health \n     coverage, even if they have a prior illness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide 100,000,000 people with first-time access \nto safe drinking water and sanitation on a sustainable basis by 2015 by \nimproving the capacity of the United States Government to fully \nimplement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Later this week we will mark World Water Day. It is an \nimportant reminder of the many challenges we continue to face in \nproviding clean water and sanitation to the world's poor.\n  We have made progress in recent years, but around the world today, \nnearly 1 billion people continue to lack access to clean, safe water. \nMore than 2 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. Most of \nthese people live on less than $2 a day. They are the voiceless and the \npowerless of the world.\n  That is why today, Senator Bob Corker and Senator Patty Murray and I \nare introducing the Paul Simon Water for the World Act in the United \nStates Senate. Congressmen Blumenauer and Payne have introduced the \nsame bill in the House.\n  Our bill will reestablish U.S. leadership on one of the defining \nchallenges of the 21st century: water.\n  The goal is to reach an additional 100 million of the world's poorest \npeople with sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic \nsanitation by 2015. This would represent the largest single commitment \nof any donor country to meeting the Millennium Development Goal on \nwater, which is to reduce by half the proportion of people without \naccess to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015.\n  The bill targets aid to areas with the greatest need. It helps build \nthe capacity of poor nations to meet their own water and sanitation \nchallenges. It supports research on clean water technologies and \nregional partnerships to find solutions to shared water challenges.\n  The bill provides technical assistance--best practices, credit \nauthorities, and training--to help countries expand access to clean \nwater and sanitation. Our development experts will design the \nassistance based on local needs.\n  The Water for the World Act also designates within the State \nDepartment a high-level representative to ensure that water receives \npriority attention in our foreign policy, and establishes a new Office \nof Water at USAID to implement development assistance efforts related \nto water.\n  We ought to be assigning some of our best minds to solve the global \nwater challenge. Right now, however, we don't have the staff at USAID \nto meet our goals on water or any other urgent development need.\n  At a time when it is more important than ever to win the hearts and \nminds of those around the world, as well as to address the challenges \nof fragile and failed states, our top development agency is suffering \nfrom an inexcusable shortage of expert staff.\n  In the 1960s, USAID had more than 5,000 Foreign Service Officers; \ntoday, when the needs are greater than ever, it has just over 1,000.\n  To correct this imbalance and help rebuild our smart power, I \nrecently introduced a bill that would triple the number of USAID \nForeign Service Officers by 2012. It's called the Increasing America's \nDevelopment Capacity Act, and it's an essential part of our efforts to \nrebuild America's smart power role in the world--on food security, \nhealth, economic development, and yes, water.\n  I owe my passion on water to my friend and mentor, the man whose seat \nI now occupy in the U.S. Senate: the late Senator Paul Simon.\n  He was a profoundly good and wise man. He was also a visionary. He \nsaw connections that many people missed. He saw answers to problems \nbefore most people even saw the problems.\n  As many of you know, solving the global water crisis was his last \ngreat campaign. In 1998, he wrote a book called ``Tapped Out: The \nComing World Crisis in Water and What We Can Do About It.''\n  Paul Simon would go anywhere, and talk to anyone, to try to get \npeople and governments to take the global water crisis seriously. In \nthe last year of his life, he traveled to Israel to moderate a panel \nbetween the Israeli and Palestinian water commissioners. He said that \nhe and most of the people in the audience--were amazed that the two \ncommissioners agreed on almost everything.\n  But when he looked in the newspapers the next day, there was nothing \nabout the meeting. Not a word. He said that was ``because nobody was \nshouting at each other.'' That's part of the challenge.\n  The global water crisis is a quiet killer. In the developing world, \nwater-related diseases claim the lives of 5,000 children every day. \nDiarrhea alone kills nearly 2 million children under the age of 5 each \nyear. As CSIS's ``Global Water Futures'' report hauntingly points out, \nthat is the equivalent of all the children under age 5 in New York and \nLondon combined.\n  Mothers who fear the deaths of their children bear more, in a \ndesperate race against the odds. The lack of clean water enslaves poor \nwomen in other ways, as well. In many poor nations, women and girls \nwalk two or three hours or more each way, every day, to collect water \nthat is often dirty and unsafe.\n  The UN estimates that women and girls in Sub-Saharan Africa spend a \ntotal of 40 billion working hours each year collecting water. That is \nequivalent to all of the hours worked in France in a year.\n  A developing economy cannot grow if its people are too busy \ncollecting water, or too sick from drinking unsafe water, to work or to \ngo to school.\n  What Senator Simon knew 10 years ago, and the rest of us are slowly \ncoming around to see, is that we can't begin to solve the problems of \nglobal hunger and poverty without addressing the global water crisis.\n  And water is not simply a humanitarian challenge. It is a threat to \nglobal stability and the global economy.\n  Last June, Goldman Sachs held a meeting to assess the top five risks \nfacing the world economy. Resource scarcity--including competition for \nwater, food and energy--was at the top of the list.\n  Fortune magazine recently predicted that the global water crisis will \nbe as serious in the 21st century as the oil crises were in the 20th, \npotentially leading to war.\n  Paul Simon understood the potential for conflicts over dwindling \nsupplies of clean water. It alarmed him. He used to say, ``Nations go \nto war for oil, but there are substitutes for oil. There are no \nsubstitutes for water.'' We see that in the roots of the conflict in \nDarfur.\n  I have seen the challenge of water in so many of my recent trips \nabroad.\n  Two years ago I travelled to Jordan after a trip to Iraq. I went to \ntalk with people there about the impact of the\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nwar in Iraq on one of our most important allies in the region.\n  The Jordanian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Ms. \nSuhair-al-Ali, told me that between 600,000 and 700,000 Iraqi refugees \nwere living in Jordan at that time. That was equivalent to 10 percent \nof Jordan's entire population. For us in the U.S., that would be the \nequivalent of 30 million refugees.\n  The massive influx of Iraqi refugees had strained the ability of \nJordan's government to provide basic services almost to the breaking \npoint. What did the minister identify as one of Jordan's biggest \nproblems? Water.\n  It is not just Jordan. Water is central to the fate of the entire \nMiddle East.\n  In his book, Paul Simon quoted former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak \nRabin as saying, ``If we solve every other problem in the Middle East \nbut do not satisfactorily resolve the water problem, our region will \nexplode. Peace will not be possible.''\n  You do not have to travel halfway around the world to see the \ndevastating consequences of lack of access to clean water.\n  A few months ago I traveled to Haiti. This was my second visit and it \nis always a shock. A 90-minute plane ride from Miami takes you to \nanother world.\n  There are no public sewage treatment or disposal systems anywhere in \nthe country. Even in the capital, Port-au-Prince, a city of 2 million \npeople, the drainage canals are choked with garbage and sewage.\n  It is no wonder that Haiti has the highest infant and child mortality \nrate in the Western Hemisphere. One-third of Haiti's children do not \nlive to see the age of 5. The leading killer? Water-borne diseases: \nhepatitis, thyphoid and diarrhea.\n  While there, I visited a rural health clinic run by a group called \nPartners in Health, co-founded by Dr. Paul Farmer. Dr. Farmer is a \nwonderful man who has improved the lives of so many, from Rwanda to \nHaiti.\n  He showed me a water purification kit that his clinic gives to \nnursing mothers with HIV/AIDS. This allows them to make formula for \ntheir babies and not transmit the virus through breastfeeding. It is \nsimple, inexpensive, and life-saving.\n  Some years ago I visited Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in \nLatin America. Bolivia is an example of what awaits many countries' \nwater supplies because of global warming.\n  Much of its population relies on melting glaciers for its water. But \nbecause of climate change the glaciers are not being replenished and \nsome are already disappearing. These trends are happening from the \nsnows of Mount Kilimanjaro to the Alps to the Himalayas.\n  How will the world respond to the water needs such as Bolivia and \nothers who rely on glaciers for their water supplies?\n  I recently returned from a visit to Cyprus. The island has been \ndivided now for more than 30 years. The leaders on both sides are \nengaged in brave and important discussions to reunify the island. Amid \nthis hopeful progress toward peace, another problem plagues this \nisland--water.\n  The groundwater in Cyprus is being depleted too quickly, often for \nagriculture, and it is being replenished too often with salt water that \ncreeps into the water table. Global warming is causing rainfall to \ndecrease.\n  In recognition of the vast water challenges we face around the world, \ntwo years after Paul Simon died, Congress passed the Paul Simon Water \nfor the Poor Act. President Bush signed it into law in December 2005.\n  It represents the first time the U.S. has codified our commitment to \nany of the Millennium Development Goals. The Paul Simon Water for the \nPoor Act makes safe water and basic sanitation a top priority for all \nU.S. foreign assistance.\n  In 2007 alone, it helped provide nearly 2 million people in over 30 \ncountries with access to a better source of drinking water, and more \nthan 1.5 million people with better sanitation.\n  The Water for the Poor Act is saving lives, but its impact could be \ngreater. The Paul Simon Water for the World Act will help us expand \nthese efforts to make a profound and sustainable difference in the \nlives of the world's poor.\n  As we prepare to mark World Water Day this Sunday, let us recommit \nourselves to a new effort on safe water and sanitation.\n  Throughout history, civilized nations have put aside political \ndifferences to address compelling issues of life and survival. Our \ngeneration owes the world nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 318, \n     which--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Sanitation; and\n       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public \n     health, poverty reduction, economic and social development, \n     and the environment.\n       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n     sanitation efforts--\n       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack \n     access to safe drinking water; and\n       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to \n     basic sanitation services.\n       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n     poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and\n       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n       (6) The effects of climate change are expected to produce \n     severe consequences for water availability and resource \n     management in the future, with 2,800,000,000 people in more \n     than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water \n     shortages by 2025.\n       (7) According to the November 2008 report entitled, \n     ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National \n     Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future \n     population growth to exacerbate already limited access to \n     water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.\n       (8) A 2009 report published in the Proceedings of the \n     National Academy of Sciences projects that the effects of \n     climate change will produce long-term droughts and raise sea \n     levels for the next 1,000 years, regardless of future efforts \n     to combat climate change.\n       (9) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n     commissioned by the United Nations, more than \\1/5\\ of the \n     world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted \n     or excessively withdrawn.\n       (10) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n     instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n     the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n     has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic \n     groups and local farming communities.\n       (11) In order to further the United States contribution to \n     safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the \n     challenges described in this section; and\n       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the \n     highest levels of United States foreign assistance and \n     diplomatic deliberations, including those related to issues \n     of global health, food security, the environment, global \n     warming, and maternal and child mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     lead a global effort to bring sustainable access to clean \n     water and sanitation to poor people throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to provide first-time access to safe water and \n     sanitation, on a sustainable basis, for 100,000,000 people in \n     high priority countries (as designated under section 6(f) of \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2152h note) by 2015; and\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\n       (2) to enhance the capacity of the United States Government \n     to fully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \n     Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in the Lower \nMississippi River Area in the State of Louisiana as a unit of the \nNational Park System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled the Lower Mississippi River National Historic Site Study Act. \nThis bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in Plaquemines Parish \nalong the Lower Mississippi River Area as a unit of the National Park \nSystem. I cannot think of a more timely occasion to reintroduce this \nbill as Secretary Salazar is expected to be touring southeast Louisiana \ntomorrow.\n  The first step to becoming a unit in the National Park System is to \nconduct a special resources study to determine whether an area \npossesses nationally significant natural, cultural, or recreational \nresources to be eligible for favorable consideration. This is exactly \nwhat my bill does--it asks the Department of the Interior to take the \nfirst step in determining what I already know--that the Lower \nMississippi River Area would be a suitable and feasible asset to the \nNational Park Service.\n  I am proud to come to the floor today to reintroduce this bill. This \narea has vast historical significance and is an area with rich cultural \nhistory. In the 1500s, Spanish explorers traveled along the banks of \nthe river. In 1682, Robert de LaSalle claimed all the land drained by \nthe area. In 1699, the area became the site of the first fortification \non the Lower Mississippi river, known as Fort Mississippi. Since then, \nit has been the home to 10 different fortifications, including Fort St. \nPhilip and Fort Jackson.\n  Fort St. Philip, which was originally built in 1749, played a key \nrole during the Battle of New Orleans when soldiers blocked the British \nnavy from going upriver. Fort Jackson was built at the request of GEN \nAndrew Jackson and partially constructed by famous local Civil War \nGeneral P.G.T. Beauregard. This fort was the site of the famous Civil \nWar battle know as the Battle of Forts which is also referred to as the \n``night the war was lost.'' Mr. President, as you can see, from a \nhistorical perspective, this area has many treasures that provide us a \nglimpse into our past. These are areas that have national significance. \nThey should be maintained and preserved.\n  There are also many other important and unique attributes to this \narea. This area is home to the longest continuous river road and levee \nsystem in the United States. It is also home to the ancient Head of \nPasses site, to the Plaquemines Bend, and to two national wildlife \nrefuges.\n  Finally, this area has a rich cultural heritage. Over the years, many \ndifferent cultures have made this area home including Creoles, \nEuropeans, Indians, Yugoslavs, African-Americans and Vietnamese. These \ncultures have worked together to create the infrastructure for \ntransportation of our nation's energy which is being produced by these \nsame people out in the Gulf of Mexico off our shores. They have also \ncreated a fishing industry that contributes to Louisiana's economy.\n  I think it is easy to see why this area would make an excellent \naddition to the National Park Service. That is why I am reintroducing \nthis bill--to begin the process of adding this area as a unit to the \nNational Park Service by conducting a study to determine the \nsuitability and feasibility of bringing this area into the system. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to quickly enact this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/17/senate-section/article/S3188-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 675.

The term of such \n     additional repayment contract shall be no less than 1 year \n     and no more than 10 years, however, mutually agreeable \n     provisions regarding the rate of repayment of such amount may \n     be developed by the parties. In the event that the final cost \n     allocation indicates that the costs properly assignable to \n     the contractor are less than what the contractor has paid, \n     the Secretary is authorized and directed to credit such \n     overpayment as an offset against any outstanding or future \n     obligation of the contractor.\n       (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's \n     compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment \n     of the construction costs as provided in subsection \n     (a)(3)(A), the provisions of section 213(a) and (b) of the \n     Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) shall apply to \n     lands in such district.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of subsection (a), or subsection \n     (b), upon a contractor's compliance with and discharge of the \n     obligation of repayment of the construction costs as provided \n     in paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall waive the pricing provisions of section \n     3405(d) of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \n     Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) for such \n     contractor, provided that such contractor shall continue to \n     pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and other \n     charges applicable to such repayment contracts pursuant to \n     the then-current rate-setting policy and applicable law.\n       (3) Provisions of the Settlement applying to Friant \n     Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term water \n     service contracts shall also apply to contracts executed \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (d) Reduction of Charge for Those Contracts Converted \n     Pursuant to Subsection (a)(1).--\n       (1) At the time all payments by the contractor required by \n     subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed, the Secretary shall \n     reduce the charge mandated in section 10007(1) of this part, \n     from 2020 through 2039, to offset the financing costs as \n     defined in section 10010(d)(3). The reduction shall be \n     calculated at the time all payments by the contractor \n     required by subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed. The \n     calculation shall remain fixed from 2020 through 2039 and \n     shall be based upon anticipated average annual water \n     deliveries, as mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the \n     contractor, for the period from 2020 through 2039, and the \n     amounts of such reductions shall be discounted using the \n     Treasury Rate; provided, that such charge shall not be \n     reduced to less than $4.00 per acre foot of project water \n     delivered; provided further, that such reduction shall be \n     implemented annually unless the Secretary determines, based \n     on the availability of other monies, that the charges \n     mandated in section 10007(1) are otherwise needed to cover \n     ongoing federal costs of the Settlement, including any \n     federal operation and maintenance costs of facilities that \n     the Secretary determines are needed to implement the \n     Settlement. If the Secretary determines that such charges are \n     necessary to cover such ongoing federal costs, the Secretary \n     shall, instead of making the reduction in such charges, \n     reduce the contractor's operation and maintenance obligation \n     by an equivalent amount, and such amount shall not be \n     recovered by the United States from any Central Valley \n     Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the \n     obligation of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a \n     transfer agreement with a non-federal operating entity.\n       (2) If the calculated reduction in paragraph (1), taking \n     into consideration the minimum amount required, does not \n     result in the contractor offsetting its financing costs, the \n     Secretary is authorized and directed to reduce, after October \n     1, 2019, any outstanding or future obligations of the \n     contractor to the Bureau of Reclamation, other than the \n     charge assessed and collected under section 3407(d) of Public \n     law 102-575, by the amount of such deficiency, with such \n     amount indexed to 2020 using the Treasury Rate and such \n     amount shall not be recovered by the United States from any \n     Central Valley Project contractor, provided nothing herein \n     shall affect the obligation of the contractor to make \n     payments pursuant to a transfer agreement with a non-Federal \n     operating entity.\n       (3) Financing costs, for the purposes of this subsection, \n     shall be computed as the difference of the net present value \n     of the construction cost identified in subsection (a)(3)(A) \n     using the full Treasury Rate as compared to using one half of \n     the Treasury Rate and applying those rates against a \n     calculated average annual capital repayment through 2030.\n       (4) Effective in 2040, the charge shall revert to the \n     amount called for in section 10007(1) of this part.\n       (5) For purposes of this section, ``Treasury Rate'' shall \n     be defined as the 20 year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) \n     rate published by the United States Department of the \n     Treasury as of October 1, 2010.\n       (e) Satisfaction of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the first release of Interim Flows or \n     Restoration Flows, pursuant to paragraphs 13 or 15 of the \n     Settlement, any short- or long-term agreement, to which 1 or \n     more long-term Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit \n     contractor that converts its contract pursuant to subsection \n     (a) is a party, providing for the transfer or exchange of \n     water not released as Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection \n     3405(a)(1)(A) and (I) of the Reclamation Projects \n     Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) \n     without the further concurrence of the Secretary as to \n     compliance with said subsections if the contractor provides, \n     not later than 90 days before commencement of any such \n     transfer or exchange for a period in excess of 1 year, and \n     not later than 30 days before commencement of any proposed \n     transfer or exchange with duration of less than 1 year, \n     written notice to the Secretary stating how the proposed \n     transfer or exchange is intended to reduce, avoid, or \n     mitigate impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim \n     Flows or Restoration Flows or is intended to otherwise \n     facilitate the Water Management Goal, as described in the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall promptly make such notice \n     publicly available.\n       (2) Determination of reductions to water deliveries.--Water \n     transferred or exchanged under an agreement that meets the \n     terms of this subsection shall not be counted as a \n     replacement or an offset for purposes of determining \n     reductions to water deliveries to any Friant Division long-\n     term contractor except as provided in paragraph 16(b) of the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall, at least annually, make \n     publicly available a compilation of the number of transfer or \n     exchange agreements exercising the provisions of this \n     subsection to reduce, avoid, or mitigate impacts to water \n     deliveries caused by the Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     or to facilitate the Water Management Goal, as well as the \n     volume of water transferred or exchanged under such \n     agreements.\n       (3) State law.--Nothing in this subsection alters State law \n     or permit conditions, including any applicable geographical \n     restrictions on the place of use of water transferred or \n     exchanged pursuant to this subsection.\n       (f) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--\n     Implementation of the provisions of this section shall not \n     alter the repayment obligation of any other long-term water \n     service or repayment contractor receiving water from the \n     Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would \n     otherwise have been properly assignable to the Friant \n     contractors absent this section, including operations and \n     maintenance costs, construction costs, or other capitalized \n     costs incurred after the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     other such contractors.\n       (g) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall \n     be construed to affect the right of any Friant Division, \n     Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit long-term contractor to use a \n     particular type of financing to make the payments required in \n     paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(A) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 10011. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK \n                   SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal laws and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n     the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and the \n     State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for any \n     species listed pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the \n     reintroduced population of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon, including protections pursuant to \n     existing biological opinions or new biological opinions \n     issued by the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries; and\n       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the \n     reintroduction.\n       (e) FERC Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley \n     Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the \n     Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its \n     authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in \n     proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, \n     Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with \n     subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the \n     Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the \n     designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends \n     first.\n       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing \n     prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species \n     because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to \n     such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon.\n       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended \n     or shall be construed--\n       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.); or\n       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other \n     application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.).\n\n              PART II--STUDY TO DEVELOP WATER PLAN;
