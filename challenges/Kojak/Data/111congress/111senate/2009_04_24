Mr. President, today I rise in honor of the victims of the \nArmenian Genocide, as we mark the 94th anniversary of this horrific \ntragedy.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began a campaign of forced \ndeportation against the Armenians. Around 2 million Armenian men, \nwomen, and children were driven from their homeland, 1.5 million of \nwhom were killed. Hundreds of thousands were massacred outright, while \nothers perished from forced marches, deliberate starvation, and \nepidemics that ravaged through concentration camps. Yet despite an \noutcry of condemnation by Great Britain, France, Russia, and the United \nStates, no action was taken against the Ottoman Empire, as the first \ngenocide of the 20th century continued.\n  Today, the thriving, vibrant Armenian community in the United States \nis a testament to their endurance and strength. Yet we can never forget \nthe loss and sacrifice of previous generations. Earlier this week, we \nalso paid tribute to those killed in the Holocaust, and together, these \nanniversaries mark this week as a solemn reminder of what can occur \nwhen prejudice and hatred go unchecked. Just as we cherish the memories \nand stories of the Armenians persecuted by the Ottoman Empire and their \nsurvivors, so must we also honor them by recommitting ourselves to \ncombat intolerance in all its forms.\n  In my own home State of Nevada, I am proud to represent thousands of \nArmenian-Americans, many of whom gathered to commemorate the 94th \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide this past weekend in Las Vegas. I \ncongratulate the Armenian American Cultural Society of Las Vegas for \nyet again organizing such a successful and meaningful event. This is a \nwonderful opportunity for the Armenian-American community and their \nsupporters to come together in our State, which I am pleased is one of \nat least 40 other States who have recognized the Armenian Genocide.\n  I extend my best wishes to the Nevadan Armenian-American community \nback home and thank them for their many contributions to our great \nState.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to address the \nSenate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4708-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4708-S4709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there are so many things I \nwould like to talk about, not the least of which--which I will not \nconfine my remarks to--is our space program, which is adrift.\n  The White House continues to deliberate on who should be the \nadministrator of NASA. The previous administration starved NASA to \ndeath by asking it to do too much with too little. The result of that \nis that now NASA is coming to the end of the life of the space shuttle, \nas we complete the construction of the International Space Station. \nWith the remaining nine flights--and those nine flights NASA thinks it \ncan get in during the next year and a half, but they can't--we are \ngoing to have to fly the space shuttle into 2011, and we ought to do \nthat deliberately and slowly to make sure we don't sacrifice safety.\n  At the end of that time, upon the completion of the space station--\nthe International Space Station, with components from a number of \ncountries around the world and something that is larger than two \nfootball fields long, 200 miles into the cosmos, circling the globe at \n17,500 miles an hour, with research laboratories, with habitation \nmodules for the astronauts and cosmonauts on board--the United States, \nwhen we shut down the space shuttle, will not have a manned vehicle \nbecause we didn't have enough money for the development of the new \nvehicle--the new rocket, the Aries--and so we are going to have a gap \nand we will have to rely on the Russians. We will have to buy a ride on \ntheir spacecraft in order to get to our space station, which is a $100 \nbillion investment.\n  Now, that is the sad state of affairs, and that is where NASA finds \nitself. NASA is adrift because it doesn't have a vigorous leader, \nappointed by the Obama administration, to take charge; someone who \nunderstands space flight, who understands management, who understands \naeronautics. By the way, aeronautics is the first ``A'' in NASA--the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA does not have a \nleader as yet who understands how to motivate people and capture the \nspirit of the American people, which is that we are explorers and \nadventurers by nature. There is not a heart in America that does not \nbeat more quickly when they think of the potential we have in the \ncosmos and the exploration of new worlds.\n\n  Look at what the Hubbell space telescope has done for us. How do you \nthink we have been able to have the revelations from the Hubbell space \ntelescope? It is because we have been able to send astronauts out there \nwhen it could not even see because it had an incorrectly ground lens \nwhen we launched it, over a decade and a half ago. We sent astronauts \nthere to repair it in orbit.\n  Lo and behold, in 2 weeks another flight with astronauts will go to \nthe Hubbell space station, will repair it, will give it new \ninstruments, and for the next 2 decades it will continue to peer into \nthe universe and unlock those secrets about where did we come from and \nwhen did it happen and how are we positioned in this universe that is \nso vast, so infinite that our human minds cannot even grasp. That is \nthe excitement of the future.\n  Yet NASA is adrift. I call on the White House to please put in an \nadministrator of NASA who is a leader, who understands space, who \nunderstands how to motivate people and who can capture the American \nspirit and help inspire, standing by our President who wants it, a \nvigorous space program.\n  I did not come here to speak about that, but I get pretty exercised \nbecause I have been the beneficiary of being a part of this space \nprogram. I do not like what I see now and I do not like what I have \nseen in the last 5 years. I have said so on the floor of this Senate, \nover and over. The more we try to get additional funding in the budget \nto develop this new rocket--and we were successful in the Senate--the \nmore we would have our legs cut out from under us by the previous White \nHouse budget office because they kept starving NASA of funds. That has \nled us to where we are today.\n  I personally know our President is a space aficionado. We have talked \nabout it hours on end. I know he wants us to have a vigorous space \nprogram. I know President Obama understands how to accomplish the very \nthing he wants to do with young people, in getting them educated and \nparticularly educated in math and science and engineering. Look to \nhistory. Look at what happened in the Apollo program when young people \nby the thousands starting going into math and science and engineering \nbecause they were challenged by what we were doing in the cosmos. We \ncan do that again if the President will give the full support to the \nspace program and if he will put the right leader in NASA.\n  I came today to speak about another subject, but I do not think there \nis a much more important subject at this time. With all the problems \nfacing this country--the economy, the national security situation--you \nhave to tend to your knitting. America's space program and America's \npreeminence in space--that we do not lose the high ground--is a highly \nimportant issue, high among the items on the agenda to which this \ncountry must attend.\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4709-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4709-S4710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           CHINESE WALLBOARD\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to talk about something \nelse that is afflicting this country. A lot of people don't know about \nthis, but we have to get it front and center. One of the exports coming \nfrom China into the United States has been drywall. Drywall is the \nboards that you put up on the studs when you build a house. Normally \nwhat it is is a material called gypsum. Gypsum is a byproduct in the \nmining and manufacturing of phosphate. A lot of that phosphate goes \ninto fertilizer but a byproduct of that is gypsum. And gypsum, put into \nthe form of a flat sheet with thick paper on either side, in boards \nabout 10 feet high and about that wide, is called wallboard. In the \nmodern construction of houses, when you build a house and you divvy up \nthe rooms and you put up these studs to be a wall and you put \ninsulation in there, and then on the outside of the studs you put the \nwallboard and then you put a finish over the wallboard and you paint \nthat, that is the wall of a house.\n  The problem is that wallboard that has been imported into this \ncountry from China is defective because it has contained some kind of \norganic compound that is having absolutely disastrous effects in \npeople's houses. When you compare a piece of this wallboard from China \nwith wallboard from America that is gypsum, you can actually see the \ndifference. Gypsum is dry. It is absorbent, which is what you want for \na wall if there are contaminants or vapors in a house. But this Chinese \nwallboard is giving off vapors.\n  What do we find in our houses? This is not only in Florida, this is \nall over the southern United States. They have discovered it in \nLouisiana. They have discovered it in California, in Texas, they have \ndiscovered it in Georgia, and some people are now discovering it in the \nAtlantic coast, the north Atlantic region of the United States. What \nthey are discovering is that, first, you walk into a house with Chinese \nwallboard and you notice a smell. It is a different smell. It is \npungent. Some people call it like a rotten egg smell. As I have gone \ninto these homes over the course of the Easter break back in Florida, \nto me the smell is not so much rotten eggs but you detect the smell of \nsulfur, but it starts searing the nasal passages.\n  I am kind of like a canary in the coal mine because my respiratory \nsystem is very sensitive to these kinds of things, for example, mold \nand mildew. I will get congested if I walk into a home with mold and \nmildew and I will start coughing. When I walked into those homes a week \nand a half ago in Florida, the same thing happened to me. I would only \nbe in the home 10 minutes and my nasal passages started to constrict, \nmy voice got scratchy. I started to get what we call getting clogged \nup. I started hacking and wheezing, my eyes started watering.\n  Lo and behold, that is happening to these homeowners. This is their \nhome. This is their life investment. Now, through no fault of their \nown, they are finding out they have a part of their home that is now \nirritating their respiratory system and in some cases their family \nmembers have had to go to the hospital and in other cases their \npediatricians are telling them to get their children out of those \nhouses. The family has vacated the home, their life investment--\nvacated. Hopefully they have some relatives they can go live with, and \nin some cases they do not. You can imagine the financial burden.\n  What else are these homeowners telling me? They are telling me that \nin the homes, these vapors that are being emitted are suddenly \ncorroding any kind of metallic substance in the home. I went into homes \nwhere I looked at the air conditioning unit and the coils on the air \nconditioner are completely corroded and the homeowners tell me over the \ncourse of the last 4 years they have had to change the air conditioner \nthree times because it is not only a corrosion, it is eating through \nthe coils.\n  I took a screwdriver and I went over to one of the copper pipes on an \nair conditioner unit and I started scraping it. It was completely soot \nblack. Copper, when it ages, turns green. Not this. I started scraping \noff that soot black exterior and, sure enough, there was the copper \nunderneath. And the coils that were metallic on the air conditioner, of \nsome other metal, had been corroded through. And here is this homeowner \nand that homeowner and that one over there who have had to replace the \nair conditioner three times in the last 5 years. It is unbelievable.\n  I talked to a husband and wife in one of the homes. In this case I \nwent to homes down near Fort Myers. I went to homes near Bradenton. I \nwent to homes near West Palm Beach. The couple had been on a cruise to \nMexico in January. They bought a beautiful silver bracelet. You know \nthat silver will tarnish over time. You have to polish it up. In this \ncase, that silver bracelet had been in the house for 1 month and it was \nblack as soot. These vapors that are coming off whatever this organic \nmaterial is in the Chinese drywall are making people sick, their houses \nare uninhabitable, their appliances, including the dishwashers, are \ncorroding, and their life investment in their home is going up in \nsmoke. That is not right.\n  Needless to say, there is a bunch of lawsuits. But who are they going \nto sue? They are going to sue a Chinese wallboard manufacturer who is \nin China. Maybe there is a distributor here. We have a U.S. Government \nand there is an arm of the U.S. Government called the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. This, by the way, is the same Consumer Product \nSafety Commission that was letting in all of those defective Chinese \ntoys that were killing our children, 2 and 3 and 4 years ago. So last \nyear the Congress, bipartisan, reformed the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in the reform of \nthis legislation, has the authority, No. 1, to stop the import of this \nChinese drywall and also exact a recall of this product.\n  But has the Consumer Product Safety Commission done it? No. To their \ncredit, they sent in an investigation team, and that investigation team \nreported to the staff of the Senate yesterday. I happened to go and \ntalk to them. So I asked them three questions yesterday. I said: How \nharmful is this stuff?\n  And they said: We do not know.\n  And I said: Well, you are doing an investigation.\n  Well, it is going to take us a while.\n  Well, did you see the same effects?\n  A member of that investigation team concurred with what I have just \nshared about how it affected his respiratory system, his eyes were \nwatering, he was clogging up, and so forth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So as of yesterday, they did not have a \nconclusion. I would urge them to hurry their conclusion. They ought to \nbe doing this in conjunction with the EPA and the Centers for Disease \nControl because if this thing is in what we think it is, 100,000 homes \nin this country--and perhaps half of those are in Florida because that \nis where a lot of the building was going on in the aftermath of the \nfour hurricanes that hit Florida in 2004--if this is in 100,000 homes, \nwe have a real problem.\n  You cannot get the home builders. Look, most of them are financially, \nif not bankrupt, down to their last pennies as it is. There has to be \nsomeone financially responsible, and you cannot expect the homeowner to \nbear this cost. But what about the effects on their health?\n  Well, as of yesterday, they did not have an answer. So then I asked \nthem: Well, you have done an investigation. How widespread is it?\n  They said: We do not know.\n  Well, we better start knowing.\n  So I said: Well, since you do not know how harmful it is, and you do \nnot know how widespread it is, what are you going to do about helping \nhomeowners?\n  They said: We do not know.\n  Well, a number of us, Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, both of them \nfrom Louisiana--because a lot of this drywall came into Louisiana \nthrough the Port of New Orleans, they are getting the same kind of \ncomplaints from their State that I am getting from the State of \nFlorida.\n  We can file legislation that will suggest what to do. It is too bad \nwe have to file legislation because the CPSC has the legal authority \nunder the law to ban the import of this wallboard and\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nto exact a recall and to freeze the assets of the companies that are \nattributable to that drywall that is manufactured in China. They have \nthat authority.\n  If they are not going to act on that authority, then the Congress is \ngoing to have to act for them. That is the bill Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Vitter and I and others also who have joined have filed.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, our dear friend. I did \nnot even know this, but the Senator must have heard some of this \nproblem in his State of Oklahoma. This is a problem of monumental \nproportions.\n  I will close by saying, because of that report yesterday from the \nstaff of the commission to the staff of the Senate committees, there \nare a couple of news articles today: ``Drywall Clamor Is \nIntensifying.'' Another headline cries out, ``Agency Outlines Strategy \nTo Deal With Chinese Drywall.'' Another headline cries out, ``Efforts \nOn Chinese Drywall Fix Too Slow.''\n  I close with this: Put yourself in the place of the poor homeowner. \nThey are there with their children. This is their dream home. They have \nput all of their assets into their home. They are current on their \nmortgage, and suddenly they start realizing the symptoms they and their \nchildren have had over the last several months, and in some cases \nyears, is attributable to this. They now understand why they have \nreplaced their air-conditioning unit three times. They now see why they \ncannot keep their silver polished. They now know why the refrigerator \nmetal and the dishwater metal is constantly corroding, and their \npediatrician is telling them to get their child out of that house. As a \nresult, they have vacated their dream home.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So I close by saying my plea to the Senate is \nto insist, if we have to, through the passage of this legislation, to \naddress this problem head on.

Let me say this to my friend from Florida. \nCoincidentally, I was talking to my friend, Senator Vitter, who went \nover this with me. I have instructed my staff to add me to the \nSenator's bill as a cosponsor.\n  As the Senator from Florida will remember, he and I have agreed on a \nlot of the problems we are having today with China; for one thing, the \nthreat that is out there, both in terms of energy and military buildup. \nI have been very much concerned as I go through--and my friend from \nFlorida and I are both very active in trying to get things done in \nAfrica--as we go through Africa, individually or together, we notice \none of the major things we see taking place there, particularly in the \narea of the Sea of Guinea and other places in Nigeria where they have \nhuge oil reserves, is the Chinese are building all of these new and \nshiny bridges and all that, which is competing with us since we have \nthe same problem they have in terms of a lack of energy.\n  So I would enjoy joining him in some of these problems we see that we \nare having with China.\n  I wanted some time this morning. I actually have four causes going on \nright now. I am not going to have time to address all four of these. \nBut I will just briefly say what they are, then I will start with the \none I think is the most critical right now. First of all, one of my \ncauses is having to do with Guantanamo Bay.\n  The fact that people are talking about closing it, President Obama \nhas stated--actually in his inaugural address he did not, but then \nlater on said, yes, we are going to close it in spite of the problems \nthat would come to us if we did close it.\n  I am anxious to have time on the floor to talk about the frequent \nvisits I have made to GITMO. One of the few good deals the Government \nhas today is Guantanamo Bay. It might be that the Presiding Officer is \nnot aware of the fact. It is one of the good deals out there. We only \npay $4,000 a year, the same thing we paid in 1903, for the use of this \ngreat facility.\n  There has been no evidence of any kind of abuse of prisoners or \ndetainees. They have a judicial center that is unlike anything in the \nUnited States. These are tribunals.\n       We cannot put these terrorists, these detainees, into our \n     prison system. That is not going to work. If it does, I would \n     like to know which Member of the Senate wants to have those \n     detainees housed in their own State. I am sure the Presiding \n     Officer is not excited about having them in Illinois. I am \n     not excited about having them in Oklahoma.\n  What would happen is, anyplace where they would be detained in the \nUnited States would be a magnet to terrorist activity. But I hope I \nwill have a chance to talk about that.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  The next thing would be on some of the recent developments in what \nthey used to call the global warming problem. Since we are in the fifth \nyear of a cooling period, they are trying to change that to ``climate \nchange.'' But this is something a lot of people in this body are \npursuing.\n\n  I would say this: There are not the votes for a major tax increase. A \ncap and trade on carbon would now constitute somewhere between $350 and \n$400 billion each year as a tax increase, and it is something that \nwould not accomplish anything.\n  In fact, if there are a few people still remaining out there who \nbelieve global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and we need to \nrestrict it in some way, let's keep in mind, if we do something \nunilaterally in the United States of America, then what few \nmanufacturing jobs we have left in this country are going to go to \nplaces where they can provide energy in places such as China and \nMexico, where they have no restrictions on emissions on CO2.\n  So I would only say I hope we have time to talk about that.\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  The last thing is TARP, the program that started here. I was critical \nof the Bush administration back in October when then the Secretary of \nthe Treasury came along and talked about, well, we have to have $700 \nbillion to buy damaged assets. I looked at that thing and read it. \nThere was nothing in there that compelled the Secretary of the Treasury \nor the President to use that $700 billion for anything. There is no \naccountability to Congress. It is unprecedented.\n  So I was criticizing the Bush administration, only to find out it was \nTim Geithner, who is now the Secretary of the Treasury, who was behind \nthis whole thing. He started the Bear Stearns problem. So I no longer \ncriticize the Bush administration and Hank Paulson.\n  But, nonetheless, if you stop and think, it is so hard for me and for \nother people to envision what $1 trillion is or $100 billion is. The \n$700 billion, if you will do your math, you take the number of \nhouseholds who file tax returns and pay taxes and that is $5,000 per \nhousehold. That is shocking when you tell people.\n  A lot of people who voted for that in the first place, in fact, 75 of \nthe Senators who voted for that monstrosity back in October now are \nregretting that they did. Their comments are, well, they lied to us. \nThey said that was going to be used for damaged assets.\n  They did lie to us. They flat lied. They never had any intention of \nusing that money to buy damaged assets. Now, after they have bailed out \nseveral banks and put billions of dollars in banks, now they are \nsaying, well, we need to buy damaged assets. Well, where were they when \nthe problem was there?\n  I do want to talk about that and will be talking about that in a lot \nof detail as time goes by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4710-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4710-S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MILITARY BUDGET\n\n  Last Monday, I did not have much time on the Senate floor to get into \nthe problem that I see, and the problem was with the announcement that \nwas made by Secretary Gates, the Secretary of Defense. It happens by \ncoincidence that I was in Afghanistan when that happened. I was looking \naround\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\nand I saw the Bradleys going back and forth and the helicopters and \nthese kids getting ready to go on their patrols and I was thinking: \nWait a minute. Why is the President of the United States gutting the \nmilitary right at a time when we are at war? This has never happened \nbefore.\n  So I did a YouTube from there. I talked about the problems I had with \nthe announcement made by Secretary Gates. I had to say, and I will \nrepeat it over and over during the course of this discourse, it is not \nreally Secretary Gates. He is in a position where he is given a \nnumber--I know he cannot say this, and he will probably deny it--he is \ngiven a number to say: You try to defend America within the confines of \nthis number.\n  So what do we have? We have the F-22, the only fifth generation \nfighter that is being stopped. We have China and Russia, both of them, \nwith vehicles that are fifth generation, but our kids are not going to \nhave that if they are successful in making these cuts, and I do not \nthink they are going to be successful in making these cuts.\n  The C-17--we all remember the C-17 is the best high-lift vehicle this \ncountry has ever seen or that the world has ever seen. We need many \nmore of them, but they have stopped this. The national missile defense \nsystem--we will get into all of this, the future combat system, the \nfact that we are sending kids out there with equipment that is not as \ngood as some of the prospective adversaries.\n  Nonetheless, I happened to be responding to the Gates statement from \nAfghanistan. This new thing--I don't understand all the technology, but \nI was using YouTube. They said: Just talk on this, and they will pick \nit up. And I mean, it hit the fan. I came back, and every liberal \njournalist in America was just outraged.\n  MSNBC's Ed Schultz featured my video as part of his regular beat, the \nso-called ``Psycho Talk.'' He said: Inhofe is as wrong as he could be. \nKeith Olberman said I should do the math. And his guest, an unbiased \nguest, was Speaker Pelosi. And they said my criticism of Obama's \ndefense budget was simply desperation, and on and on and on.\n  Not to be left out, Rachel Maddow used the same talking points and \nsaid, once again, the budget was actually going to increase. Then she \nbrought on a guest, Eugene Robinson, associate editor and columnist, \nwho is supposed to be some unbiased party, saying: Inhofe is making \nthis stuff up. He is lying.\n  Rich Sanchez didn't want to be outdone. That is CNN. He came on and \ntalked about: I am going to do a fact check and it is ridiculous.\n  It is interesting how hateful these extremists are. All you have to \ndo is say: We need to put America in a position where we have the best \nof everything because we don't know what contingencies are coming, and \nthey go crazy. Fortunately, there are more responsible people around. I \nenjoyed the editorial, after getting all this criticism, in the Wall \nStreet Journal where they are talking about how the Navy is left with a \nfleet of fewer than 300 ships. Is that adequate? I don't think it is. I \ncan remember when it was 700. Now we see the piracy, all the problems. \nWe know there is a need for more carriers, and yet this cut is being \nmade.\n  They criticized the Gates decision for killing the stealthy F-22 \nfighter. That is true. Originally, we were going to have 750 F-22s. Now \nhe wants to stop it at 187--totally inadequate--saying that the F-35 is \ngoing to be cheaper. That is technology down the road. The mission \nisn't the same. It certainly can't compete with the F-22.\n  They criticized the Gates budget priorities as giving no indication \nas to how the Pentagon is going to ensure military dominance and extend \nthe battlefield to the future in outer space. Outer space is where the \nfuture battles are going to be fought, but not according to this \nreport, $1.4 billion cut. This is out of the Wall Street Journal \neditorial. I already have this in the Record. I put it in last Monday.\n  This is something we are talking about. Many of us were concerned \nover the ability, in some places such as Iran--could be Serbia, \nsomeplace else, Syria perhaps--of being able to hit Western Europe and \nthen, with the longer range, hit the east coast of the United States. \nSo we went to the Czech Republic, talked personally with the President \nVaclav Klaus. He is one of the best Presidents in the history of \nEastern Europe. Their Parliament agreed to let us put radar in there. \nAnd then next door in Poland, their Parliament agreed to have us put in \na launching system. Now we are coming along and pulling the rug out \nfrom under them, and this is all covered.\n  By the way, if you don't like the Wall Street Journal, there is an \norganization called the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \nI defy anyone to criticize this organization. The chairman of that \norganization is Sam Nunn. We all remember him. I served with Sam Nunn. \nIf you look at the people on this--Richard Armitage, former Defense \nSecretary Bill Cohen, Bill Frist, Henry Kissinger--you can't find a \nheavier list of people. James Schlesinger, Brent Scocroft were a part \nof this organization. They came through and talked about all of the \nsystems proposed for termination by Secretary Gates as very valid \nmissions and real requirements. None of them is a wasteful program. \nThese are Democrats and Republicans. This is not partisan.\n  They go on to say that Congress should legitimately question spending \npriorities and perhaps take the next step, which we intend to do. I am \nsecond ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Certainly, the \nPresiding Officer is serving on that. I will be looking for his support \nto try to look at these cuts and see what is really necessary for us to \nkeep to defend America.\n  They talk about the B-52 bomber. By stopping the advanced bomber, \nwhich is in this program, the Obama program, we are going to be relying \nupon this B-52 that has been in existence for 50 years. It is twice the \nage of the pilots who are flying it. We can't continue to do this.\n  I want to go ahead, after the conclusion of my remarks, and put in \nthis report, which is the report of the CSIS, the Center for Strategic \nand International Studies. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The problem is focused on one number. If they talk about \nthat this is not a cut in defense spending, we need to look and examine \nthat, which I will do in a few minutes. Actually, thanks to the Obama \nadministration, overall defense spending has been cut by $10.7 billion \nin 2009. You might say 2009 was not his year. It was. The second half \nof the emergency supplemental fell under his jurisdiction, so that is \nan accurate figure. It would be cut again in fiscal year 2010, based on \nprojected inflation and the potential use of what is now being called \noverseas contingency. I call that the global war on terror. They want \nto rename it now. It sounds a little more palatable to some of these \neditorial liberals to whom I have already referred.\n  We have reached a crossroads where we will have to choose to either \ninvest in the modernization and readiness of our military or kick the \ncan down the road. That is what we have been doing for a long time.\n  We had a hearing yesterday in the Readiness Subcommittee, chaired by \nEvan Bayh. The ranking member is Richard Burr. We went over all of this \nwith some of the top people in the military. Quite frankly, they agreed \nwith all these comments that I am making today and I made yesterday on \nthis committee. Based on the projected defense budget for the next 10 \nyears, it looks as though the administration is taking us down the same \npath that led to a weaker and poorly equipped military.\n  It is interesting that a lot of the people over the years who have \nbeen critical of defense spending--talking about liberals who are here \nin this Chamber--are the same ones now saying: Wait a minute, our Guard \nand Reserve can't handle the op tempo. That is a term used, ``operation \ntempo,'' number of deployments and all this. The problem we have is \nthat we gone through--and I will show this in a minute--a period of \ntime in the 1990s where we downgraded the military, and then we turned \naround and along comes 9/11. All of a sudden, we have a President who \nhas to prosecute a war, at the same time trying to build a military.\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n  The plan he announced is intended to reshape the priorities of \nAmerica's defense establishment and profoundly reform how DOD does \nbusiness. I agree that we need to have procurement reforms in the \nPentagon. There is no question about that. But let's don't use that for \nan excuse to cut modernization programs.\n  I was in Afghanistan at the time this decision was announced, and it \ncomes at a time in our history when we have dramatically increased our \ndomestic spending in trillions of dollars under the umbrella of \nemergency bailouts and stimulus packages and all of that. If you stop \nand think about the amount of money this administration has really \nspent--look at the $700 billion bailout. Then you have the $789 billion \nstimulus package. Then you have the omnibus bill that is $410 billion. \nThat adds up to $2 trillion. That is in the first 3 months. So when you \nlook and think of the stimulus package, how much better would it have \nbeen if we could have had more defense spending at that time. There is \nnothing that employs more people, that better stimulates the economy \nthan defense spending. We tried to do that. Of course, that was \ndefeated. So this President is on track to grow this country's \nobligations to 22 percent of our GDP while he shrinks defense spending \nprobably down to 3 percent. Right now, it is at 4 percent of GDP. As I \ncalculate, it will be down to 3 percent.\n\n  Let's see the chart. I would like to show people so there is no \nquestion about this. The chart we have here shows what happened back in \nthe 1990s. The black line on top is when Bill Clinton came into office. \nThat is fiscal year 1993. As it is projected forward for the next 8 \nyears, the black line would say--let's say we want to keep defense \nspending in terms exactly as it is today, back in 1993, except for \ninflation. That black line is where it would be if we had kept that \nlevel of defense spending. The red line was the Clinton budget. That is \nwhat I am saying. We are going through the same thing now percentage-\nwise, almost the same thing that we went through there. So the \ndifference between the Clinton budget and what would have happened with \nthe level of spending is $412 billion. So you can say that is a $412 \nbillion cut.\n  Many of us on the floor of the Senate in the 1990s--me probably more \nthan anybody else--talked about these dramatic, massive cuts in \nprocurement and modernization. With very few exceptions, our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines have been using the same weapons systems \nwhile fighting a two-pronged war for 8 years, weapons and weapons \nsystems from back during the Cold War, the same ones we are using \ntoday. We have been unsuccessfully trying to get past this bow wave \ncreated in the 1990s when the military budget was cut by $412 billion \nand acquisition programs and research and development were pushed to \nthe right. That is a term we use that means if you are going to delay \nsomething, you push it to the right.\n  The cost of kicking our military modernization down the road is \ntwofold in that the increase in the cost to modernize and the increased \ncost to develop and fuel new weapons is an increased cost to operate \nand maintain. It gets to the point where it is like the car you drive. \nYou buy a new car. You drive it for 20 years. At least that is what I \ndo. You finally get to the point where you are paying more to maintain \nthat car than if you would get a new one. A lot of that is because of \nthe accounting system that Government has. It is somewhat guilty of \nforcing this type of thing. But that is what has happened. We have \nforced ourselves to use older and older stuff.\n  Our major combat systems that our troops are using today are those \ndeveloped and procured during the 1980s. Some of them go all the way \nback to the 1950s. The Reagan administration was handed a military, \neveryone agrees now, that was a hollow force. No one questions that. At \nthat time, people thought: There is not going to be any problem now. \nAnd then when the Cold War was over, everyone had this euphoria: We no \nlonger have a threat out there. The Cold War is over. The term they \nused, if you will remember, was--I can't remember what it was now. It \nwas a great benefit to put that money into social programs, which is \nwhat we are doing today. A peace bonus, that is what it was.\n  So anyway, our combat systems are older and older, and the Reagan \nadministration expanded the military budget, increased troop size, \nreenergized weapons procurement, revived intelligence capabilities, and \nreturned this country to its superpower status that it had been in the \npast. He guaranteed the superiority of the U.S. military's weapons \nsystems capabilities through long-term investments and ensuring that \nour troops were provided with the most advanced equipment available.\n  Secretary Gates said in January of 2009:\n\n       Our military must be prepared for a full spectrum of \n     operations, including the type of combat we are facing in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as large-scale threats that we \n     face from places like North Korea and Iran.\n\n  I want to say one more time that I don't blame Secretary Gates. I am \nglad he is the Secretary of Defense. I just wish he had a better hand \ndealt him so he could do a better job. I think he is operating under \nthe limitations of a White House that is just not a prodefense White \nHouse. Far too often, we have learned the hard lessons that we don't \nhave a crystal ball to precisely predict what our needs will be in the \nfuture.\n  This actually happened to me. The last year I served in the House was \n1994.\n  I was on the House Armed Services Committee at that time. I will \nalways remember we had someone come in and testify and say that in 10 \nyears we will no longer need ground troops. They were talking about all \nthe precision stuff the Air Force does and the technology that was \ncoming. That was testimony a lot of people rejoiced to hear so they \ncould start cutting the Marine Corps and the Army, which is exactly \nwhat happened. Then what happened? Then we had Bosnia and we had Kosovo \nand we had Iraq and we had Afghanistan. Now, after 7 years engaged in \nthe war on terror, we know he was wrong.\n  The strategic environment has become increasingly complex, dynamic, \nlethal, and uncertain. Today, our military is fighting with equipment \nthat is decades old and with a force structure that is 40 percent less \nthan it was in the 1980s. That is essentially what was cut during this \ntimeframe right here. It was a cut of about 40 percent, if we take the \nbudgets at the beginning and the end of it.\n  So we are talking about force structure and modernization. Right now, \nthe Air Force has 2,500 fewer aircraft. The Navy has cut its fleet size \nin half. The Army has reduced its force to half the number of divisions \nit had during the first gulf war. This all happened in the 1990s. For \nthe past 17 years, our military has been asked to do more with less.\n  One of the concerns I had back during the 1990s, when they were \ncutting the force strength--that was back during the time they were all \nrejoicing with this euphoric attitude I mentioned that the Cold War was \nover and we do not need a military anymore--so they were cutting it \nback at that time and believing we were not going to have to have the \nneeds we were going to have. Unfortunately, what took less than a \ndecade to field in the 1980s will now take us several decades to field. \nIn the case of KC-X, the KC-X was supposed to be online. We were \nsupposed to actually have it by this time. Right now, our fueling \ncapability is done with KC-135s.\n  I will say this: At Tinker Air Force Base, they do a great job of \ntaking these ancient aircraft and continuing them in service. But there \nwill come a point where we can no longer continue to do that. In the \nUnited States, we are going to have to build and sustain military \ncapabilities required to respond to possible future threats across the \nspectrum.\n  Wouldn't it be great if we knew what the next war was going to be \nlike? We have never been in that position. We have tried to guess, but \nwe have always been wrong. The next war will not be like the past one \nor even like the one we are in now. History has taught us that very \nhard lesson. It also does not mean the next war will be like the one we \nmight have to fight 5 or 10 years from now. The decisions we make today \non the Senate floor will set the stage for what happens in the next 40 \nyears. I wish there were time. I wish we could instantly determine what \nour needs will be 20 years from now and not\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\nhave to prepare in advance. We cannot do that. Does anyone want to \nhazard a guess what the world will be like in 20 years?\n  There is a Marine Corps general. I have his name down here somewhere. \nIn just this past February, he made this statement to a bunch of young \nmarines. I was over there at the time he made it. This is a quote I \nwant to read:\n\n       You say the next conflict will be a guerrilla conflict. I \n     say, it depends. In my lifetime, we have been in 5 big fights \n     and a bunch of little ones. In only one of those 5 big ones--\n\n  And Desert Storm is what he was referring to--\n\n     had we prepared for the type of war we wound up having to \n     fight.\n\n  That is one out of five.\n\n       It is one thing to say that a certain type of fight is more \n     or less likely; it is quite another to say it is certain to \n     be one or the other. In war, the only thing certain is \n     uncertainty.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It may be that nobody can beat us in a conventional fight \n     today, but what we buy today is what we will have to fight \n     with in 2020.\n       Furthermore, advertising that our focus of effort is on the \n     low-to-mid intensity fights of the future reduces the \n     deterrence that powerful conventional capabilities \n     demonstrate to traditional state actors. Non-state actors, \n     guerrillas, terrorists are not likely to be deterred by our \n     capabilities. Nation-states are.\n\n  See, we are used to that. He is dead right in this case. We knew \nduring the Second World War who the enemies were: Germany and Japan. We \nknew their capabilities. During the Cold War, we knew the capabilities. \nI sometimes look wistfully back on the days of the Cold War because at \nleast then it was predictable. We knew how they thought, their thinking \nprocess. We knew their capabilities.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We had better well have the capability to fight the \n     guerrilla and the nation-state, regardless of which of these \n     is more or less likely.\n\n  That is a very wise man. He is advising his young marines, and they \nlistened, and it makes sense.\n  We were not able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, the rapid \ngrowth of the ballistic missile capability of North Korea, or the rise \nin the asymmetric warfare in which we are currently engaged. It does \nnot matter how great our military leaders or intelligence is, our \nstrategic thinking will always be imperfect. We have a lot of smart \ngenerals out there, and they are going to try to tell us what we are \ngoing to need 10 or 15 years from now, and they are going to be wrong \nbecause they have always been wrong. They understand that, as that \nMarine Corps general stated.\n  In order to provide stability, America is going to have to be able to \ndeter or defeat any threat, be it an insurgency or a challenge from a \nnear-peer competitor. We cannot any longer fool ourselves that we are \nstill sending our sons and daughters out with the best equipment.\n  When I talk to people around the country, there is an assumption out \nthere that when we go to war, regardless of what kind of war--\nasymmetrical or conventional warfare--we are sending our kids out with \nthe best of equipment. That is not true.\n  In a minute, I am going to show you that there are other countries \nthat have things that are better than what we have in our defense \ncapability, in our effort to conduct warfare. But before I do that, let \nme at least address what all these critics of me were saying when we \ntalked about how much less money right now we are going to be \nprojecting into our force structure, in our military spending, if we do \nthe math. So let's go ahead and do it.\n  As I stated earlier, we need to look at the total defense budget--\nwhat DOD actually spends on all its operations.\n  During the Bush administration, the sources that funded our defenses \nwere not all just DOD or the Department of Defense, appropriations and \nauthorizations. They were also the DOE funds. DOE has a lot of funds \nfor nuclear ships and weapons. We have certainly wartime supplementals. \nAll of those added up to what we spent on defense. What they are trying \nto do now is say, well, the DOD appropriations are actually going to be \ngreater today than they were in fiscal year 2009. Well, that may be \ntrue, but that is not the total amount of defense spending. That is \njust a small part of it.\n  I think the best evidence of that is to see what systems we have to \ncut in order to act under the confines of this budgeting.\n  First, there is a net loss in defense spending in 2009 of $10.7 \nbillion. This is the second increment of the supplemental that came \nunder the jurisdiction of the current administration, the Obama \nadministration. President Bush increased the total defense budget in \n2009 by $37.2 billion.\n  He also approved $65.9 billion in supplemental funds for the first \npart of fiscal year 2009.\n  President Obama's supplemental request of $75.5 billion for defense \nneeds funds an increase of 21,000 troops. Well, I agree with his \nmessage that we need to increase the number of troops and increase the \nnumber of troops in Afghanistan. That is very reasonable. But we are \ngoing to have to pay for those troops, and we cannot pay for those \ntroops with the same amount of money we had when we had 21,000 fewer \ntroops.\n\n  The GAO report on the cost of the Iraq withdrawal said it will be a \n``massive and expensive effort'' . . . that costs would more often \nincrease in the near term. In other words, as you draw down in Iraq, \nthat is going to increase the actual cost.\n  It went on to say that the cost of equipment repairs, replacements, \nclosing, and turning over 283 military installations in Iraq and moving \ntroops and equipment home ``will likely be significant.''\n  Unfortunately, defense spending actually decreases in 2009 by $10.7 \nbillion due to President Obama's decreased total supplemental request \nfrom $189 billion to $141 billion.\n  So let's compare 2009 to 2010, where I have been accused of not being \nable to do the math.\n  Defense spending does increase from 2009 to 2010 by $14.9 billion. \nBut according to President Obama's letter to Speaker Pelosi, there will \nbe no more supplementals. If we take the supplementals out, then it is \na dramatic reduction in spending. That would mean DOD would have to \nfund all wartime operations out of the hide to the tune of $100 \nbillion-plus.\n  However, President Obama does fence off $130 billion for ``Overseas \nContingency Funds.'' Well, that is within the budget, and I guess that \nis what he now calls the war on terror. Even adding the $130 billion to \ndefense spending--which is never the case with supplemental funding--\nthe overall increase in defense spending for 2010 is $3.5 billion.\n  I say that because we know when we have an emergency supplemental, \neverybody puts everything they can into it, and that is where the \neffort is taking place.\n  Now, we add the accelerated growth of the Army and Marine Corps--a \n65,000 and 22,000 increase, respectively--at a cost of approximately \n$13 billion to cover pay and health care costs, and we start to see the \nbeginnings of how our military modernization gets gutted.\n  The DOD has certain ``must pays,'' things they have to pay. They have \nto pay personnel, operations and maintenance, ongoing wartime, and \ncontingency operations. With a zero supplemental fund, the money to pay \nfor these ``must pays'' will be taken from the base Defense budget, and \nthe areas that are always hit are research and development and \nacquisition. There we are talking about modernization.\n  So what I would like to do--well, first of all, just look at what is \nbeing cut. We know about the Future Combat System. I am going to cover \nthese in a minute, but there are the F-22s, the C-17s, the national \nmissile defense system, the future bombers, and it does not stop in \n2010.\n  As we look at the projected defense budget through 2019, we see a \ndecreasing defense budget compared to GDP starting at 3.8 percent in \n2010 and ending with 3 percent in 2019.\n  This is interesting to compare, to use the percentage of GDP. If we \ngo back and look at what happened in the entire 20th century--for 100 \nyears--and we take the average of defense spending as a percentage of \nGDP, it is 5.7 percent--5.7 percent. I have been asking to just keep it \nat no less than 4 percent. Right now, it is a little under 4 percent, \nbut it would go down to 3 percent with the budget expectations we are \nlooking at right now.\n  So when compared to a sustained annual defense investment of 4 \npercent of GDP to recapitalize and modernize our military, the 10-year \nproposed Obama defense budget is $1.3 trillion in the\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\nred. It is so similar to what we went through in the 1990s. I do not \nlike to be overly critical, but there are a lot of people who are \nliberal people who generally, in their own mind, do not think we need a \nmilitary. I have listened. They will never admit it. But they say, \nwell, if all nations would stand in a circle and hold hands and \nunilaterally disarm, all threats would go away.\n  I respect people who have this opinion, even though the opinion is \nwrong.\n  So we have ships and naval aircraft that currently average being 18 \nyears old, and Marine Corps aircraft that now average being over 21 \nyears old. Refueling tankers--I am talking about the KC-135s--are over \n44 years old; Air Force fighter aircraft, 19 years old; special \noperations aircraft, over 27 years old. Special ops--everyone realizes \nwhat a great job they are doing. It is kind of like the Marine Corps. \nThey always have to make do with older equipment but never complain \nabout it.\n  In order to keep 40-year-old KC-135s in the air, the DOD had to \nreprogram almost $3 billion from the KC-X to repair KC-135s. For the \nKC-X, we might remember--that was kind of confusing--a contract was \nlet, and that contract was challenged. That would have given us--not \nimmediately, certainly, but over the next 20 years, we would be able to \nreplace the KC-135s.\n  I think it is easier--rather than to spend any more time talking \nabout very complicated things in terms of budgeting--to just look and \nsee service by service. The Army's current fleet of combat vehicles was \ndeveloped and procured between 30 and 60 years ago.\n  We have the M1 Abrams tank, which has done a great job, that was \ndeveloped back in the early 1970s and fielded in the early 1980s. The \nM2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle--we are still using that right now, and it \nis 25 years old. It is on its third significant modification, and it \nhas been crucial in defending our troops against the IEDs the RPGs. \nBoth of these combat-proven vehicles continue to undergo fleetwide \nresets. Yet they are so old.\n  So let's look at another particular one, the best artillery piece we \nhave in the U.S. Army. It is called a Paladin. The Paladin is a \ntechnology developed in World War II. You actually have to get out \nafter each shot and swab the breech.\n\n  Now, it has gone through some new reiterations, and currently there \nis another one that is taking place. But again, this is what we have. \nThere are five countries now, including South Africa, that make a \nbetter artillery piece than our Paladin. This is one of the programs \nthat is a part of the FCS program that is going to be cut. Secretary \nGates didn't say it was completely cut; he just said it is delayed. \nThat is a nice way of saying it is cut, it is gone.\n  So I would hope one thing: That when we are going through what they \ncall the PIM Program--the Paladin Integrated Management Program--we \nkeep these running, to upgrade them so they will be somewhat \ncompetitive in the battlefield. I would say at the very least we should \nkeep that PIM Program going if we cut the future combat system. We \nshould keep the future combat system on track, but if we dump the FCS, \nwe don't want to dump the PIM with it. So even with that PIM update, \nthe Army expects to keep the Paladin in use until 2060, and that is 100 \nyears on the battlefield.\n  Our Army is long overdue for a thorough and comprehensive \nmodernization. I would just go back again to 1994 when we had people \ntestifying that in 10 years we would no longer need ground capability \nor ground fighters. The proposed Defense budget would cancel the Army's \nfuture combat system and the modernization programs intended to replace \nthe Paladin. FCS would bring improved armor and would save lives. \nNonetheless, that was one of them that was cut.\n  Let's go to the Air Force. For nearly two decades, our Air Force has \ndominated the skies and ensured air superiority. But a recent GAO study \nstated that air sovereignty alert operations--the post-9/11 operations \nthat protect our homeland--are at risk due to aging aircraft and \ninsufficient procurement. The Air Force grounded 259 of its 441 F-15 \nEagles from November 1997, and last May the service parked 500 of its \nT-38 Talons, the trainers. A lot of those were taking place at Vance \nAir Force Base in my State of Oklahoma. They don't have quite enough of \nthem yet, but again, that is part of the problem we are having right \nnow. Our aging fleet is out of service. Last October, the Air Force \nordered more than half of its 356 A-10 fighters to stay put because of \ncracks inside the wings. While we have enjoyed the benefit of \ninvestment during the 1980s of the F-15, the F-16, the A-10, the F-117, \nwhich is now out of service, the service is talking about retiring 137 \nF-15s, 177 F-16s, and 9 A-10s. I say that creates a problem.\n  We had a very courageous general named John Jumper. John Jumper ended \nup being the Chief of the Air Force, but before he was Chief of the Air \nForce--and this was about 1998, so it was during the Clinton \nadministration, and it took a lot of courage for a uniform to stand up \nand admit publicly, with his background that no one would question, \nthat now--back in 1998--he said the Soviets--the Russians--are making \nthe SU series that are really fifth-generation fighters and we don't \nhave anything that can really compete with them that is better than our \nF-15s or F-16s, which is all we had at that time. So in spite of all of \nthe above, President Obama is shutting down the F-22, the only fifth-\ngeneration fighter we have. Remember, we were going to have 750 of \nthem, and he is going to stop at 187. If you stop the production line \nat 187, we are not going to be able to produce any more of these \nthings.\n  If some President comes along in 4 years and says: No, they made a \nmistake 4 years ago, we are going to have to get that line going again, \nthe first ones would cost about twice. So this is one of the problems \nwe are having.\n  They are talking about increasing the F-35s--that is the Joint Strike \nFighter--but that is a different mission. It certainly can't compete \nwith the F-22.\n  Well, we have a very serious problem. Again, it gets down to, do we \nreally have an expectation in America--we send our kids into battle in \nthe air or on the ground--that we are going to get them the best \nequipment to work with? I wish that were the case, but it is not the \ncase.\n  The Navy. At a time when the U.S. Navy is being called on to project \nits presence in more parts of the world than ever before, the \nrecommendation that is coming from the White House is that the Navy \nshrink its carrier fleet to 10 aircraft carriers by 2012 and delay the \nacquisition of the other portions of its fleet. We see what is \nhappening now. We have these aircraft carriers staged all over the \nworld, and to be cutting that fleet, to me, is totally irresponsible.\n  I remember when I was first elected to the House. My first year was \n1987. The first weekend I was in the House of Representatives, and I \nwas going to be on the House Armed Services Committee, I spent the \nweekend down off the coast of Virginia on the USS Coral Sea. I went out \nthere and landed on the carrier. I thought I had died and gone to \nheaven, it had such capability. At that time, in 1987, as we looked as \nthe Sun was coming up, we could see the Soviet ships that were going \naround with their periscopes, the submarines, looking at what we had. \nNow that is out of commission; the Coral Sea is gone. These things \ndon't last forever. The opposition--China, right now, is building these \nthings. We have to stay better than they are. Yet we are cutting our \ncarrier fleet.\n  This reduction of aircraft carriers goes further below the previous \nQDR--that is the Quadrennial Defense Review--of 12 carriers required \nfor moderate risk. So we have a situation where we need 12 carriers--\nnot 10 but 12--for moderate risk. Moderate risk is a term that is used \nin the military as to lives. If you have no risk, you are not going to \nlose human lives. If you have high risk, you are going to lose a lot of \nhuman lives. This is moderate. So we are saying we are willing to cut \ntwo aircraft carriers below what we call moderate risk or loss of life. \nI am not willing to do that.\n  In the last few weeks, we have seen how important the Navy is in \nwatching some of the pirate counterterrorism operations off the coast \nof Africa. I was over there in Somalia and in that area just a week \nago. We are having some successes in our battle with the pirates, but \nagain, a very critical part of that is our carrier capability.\n  Meanwhile, Russian and Chinese submarines continue to be a threat to \nour\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\nforces, with China operating over 60-something quieter subs. Since the \n1990s, China has been unilaterally hedging its maritime power to \nexclude the U.S. Navy from the Taiwan Straits and along China's coasts. \nWe all know that. Now we have China, Japan, Australia, India, Malaysia, \nPakistan, Indonesia, Singapore, Bangladesh, and South and North Korea \neither now or planning to acquire submarines to compete against ours. \nIn all, we now have found it acceptable in this budget that is coming \nout of the White House to cut our total ships down to 300. I remember \nwhen there were 700 ships.\n  Missile defense. This is something I think everyone should understand \nnow. We think about the tragedy of 9/11. We think, as bad as that was, \nhow much worse it would have been if they had had the capability of the \nnuclear warhead on a delivery system, hitting a major city in America. \nWe wouldn't be talking about 3,000 deaths; we would be talking about \n300,000 or maybe 3 million deaths.\n  On February 3, Iran launched a satellite on the 30th anniversary of \nthe 1979 Islamic revolution, demonstrating key technologies of \npropulsion, staging, and guidance. This is what they did. We are \ntalking about just 2 months ago in that demonstration. Then, going all \nthe way back to 1979, I recall in--I was concerned in 1998 as to what \nthe capability was going to be for North Korea in terms of having a \nmultistage rocket capability, and the administration at that time, the \nClinton administration, said it will be from 8 to 10 years, on August \n24 of 1998. Seven days later, even though they said it would be 8 to 10 \nyears before they had the capability, they fired one, and that \ndemonstrated the capability they had.\n  It makes you wonder how accurate we are right now in our assessment \nof their capability. Nonetheless, this budget recommended a 16-percent \ncut in the missile defense budget by $1.4 billion, and this is \nsomething that is totally unacceptable. We are going to have to reverse \nthis.\n  It wasn't long ago that we recognized we had to have a capability in \nthe Czech Republic and in Poland. We wanted to have a radar capability \nin the Czech Republic and an interception capability in Poland, next \ndoor. Why do we need this? Because as they develop their capability in \nIran and they want to come and shoot something at Western Europe and \npossibly to get to the east coast of the United States of America, the \nonly place we can reliably, with our technology, shoot that down would \nbe in that area of Eastern Europe.\n  So we went and negotiated with the Parliaments. I was there. Vaclav \nKlaus, the President of the Czech Republic, who happens to be one of my \nfavorite people in the world--and he is one who helped us get this \nthrough Parliament. It wasn't easy. The thinking was: Well, is this \ngoing to be a threat? Are we going to have Russia coming down and \ncomplaining, saying this is an act of aggression? No. We are just \ntrying to knock down a missile that might be coming from a place such \nas Iran or Syria or someplace else going toward Western Europe and the \nUnited States. Well, they finally agreed. The Parliaments of Poland and \nthe Czech Republic agreed, and now we pull the rug out from under them \nwith this proposed budget.\n  The airborne laser--where is the chart on the missile defense?\n  All right. I know this is heavy lifting, and this is not an easy \nthing to understand. But if you look at a missile defense system--let's \nkeep in mind, this is the 26th anniversary of Ronald Reagan, saying \nSDI--members of the Strategic Defense Initiative--everyone criticized \nthem: No one will ever be able to hit a bullet with a bullet. Well, \nthey hit a bullet with a bullet. We have had several tests \ndemonstrating that we can do it. Well, how do you knock down a missile \ncoming in? You have three phases. There is a boost phase, a midcourse \nphase, and a terminal phase. We are currently in good shape on the \nmidcourse phase and the terminal phase, but the main area where we are \nstark naked is in the boost phase. We don't have anything.\n  We have the airborne laser. That is getting very close to being able \nto deploy a system to knock down an incoming missile when it is easiest \nto hit them. That is the boost phase, before they are going all that \nfast. And they cut that out of this budget.\n  We need to have--we decided on a policy several years ago, and \ncertainly the Senate Armed Services Committee as well as on the House \nArmed Services Committee that was headed at that time by Duncan Hunter \nand I think agreed to by the Democrats and Republicans at that time, \nthat we need to have redundancy in all three areas if we are going to \nbe able to knock down an incoming missile.\n  I don't think there is anyone in America today who denies that the \ncapability of, No. 1, hitting America is there and, No. 2, of being \nable to knock it down is there if we continue with this program. But we \nhave to have that capability in the boost phase, and this budget takes \nthat out. I am just as concerned about that as I am about the fact that \nwe really lied to the Czech Republic and to Poland and put them in a \nvery awkward position.\n  So I guess in conclusion I agree with the President and Secretary \nGates that we are going to have to reform our Defense acquisition \nsystem. There is a lot of waste in that. The Presiding Officer and I \nboth serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and we know we need \nto do some work, but we don't want to be doing this at the risk and at \nthe expense of properly modernizing our services. I have stated many \ntimes in this Chamber that the greatest trust placed upon Congress by \nthe American people is to provide for their security by maintaining a \nstrong national defense.\n  Tom Cole, a House Member from Oklahoma, said it best the other day. \nHe said that eloquence and charm are a poor substitute for a strong \nnational defense. You can be very eloquent, as our President is, and \nvery charming, as our President is, and talk about these things and act \nas if the threat is not there, but we need to have a strong national \ndefense.\n  I think Ronald Reagan said it better. He said just to be sure we are \nprepared. He said: Trust but verify. Trust but verify. We trust these \nguys over there that they are not going to attack us, but let's verify \nit.\n  We can avoid this far too frequent debate on the defense budget by \nensuring a minimum level of funding for our military.\n  So this is where we are today in our situation. I again look at \nsomething totally unprecedented. I have something here, if I can find \nit, that is rather interesting to compare. What we have done--and this \nis something no one has seen yet because we are still working on it, \nbut we are taking a comparison of 1993 and today. That was the year \nPresident Clinton was elected. He also had control of the House and the \nSenate and the White House, just as the Democrats do today. And we went \nthrough the election process. We understand that. But the things they \nare doing, that President Clinton did at that time and President Obama \nis doing today, are just remarkably similar.\n  In the military, the Army was cut back in the Clinton administration \nby 18 divisions down to 12 divisions, and here we are doing the same \nthing today. At that time on health care--right now, the President is \ntalking about a universal Government-run health care system. Back then, \nthey called it Hillary health care.\n  They called it Hillary health care, the same thing. Gun control, the \nsame type of thing. I will wait and do this all at once. I am trying to \nget to the amount of money. I was on the floor criticizing President \nClinton because he proposed $243 billion in tax increases. The current \nPresident is talking about $1.4 trillion in tax increases. The budget \nthey are operating with right now--I don't have it here--at that time, \nhe talked about a budget of $1.5 trillion. That was Bill Clinton in \n1993. Now it is over twice that much. These are numbers we never \nthought about before. If you add together the $700 billion bank \nbailout, the $789 billion stimulus plan, and the $410 billion omnibus \nspending bill, that adds up to over $2 trillion, which is unheard of. \nIt is very similar. It is just on a larger scale than that of 1993.\n  That is the concern I bring to the floor today. I have only a few \nminutes left. I will cover one of my other three concerns. I have \ntalked about the TARP funding on the floor. The TARP funding was \nsupposed to be used to buy damaged assets. At that time, in October of \n2008, the Secretary of the Treasury promised that if we would give him\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n$700 billion, he would spend it to buy damaged assets. Some in this \nChamber believed him. I didn't. I said put it in writing, let's get it \ninto the law. But they were in too big a hurry and said: We have to do \nit now or we will have another Great Depression. He spent the money to \nbail out many banks that didn't even want to be bailed out and banks \nthat previously both Geithner and Paulson were associated with. So that \nwas a problem and we should now try to salvage what we can out of that \nprogram. So that is another subject--one I have spent quite a bit of \ntime on over the last 7 years.\n  Seven years ago, when the Republicans had a majority in the Senate, I \nbecame chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. At that \ntime, we were very close to ratifying the Kyoto Treaty. We remember \nthis all started with the United Nations and then, of course, the \npeople in Hollywood, the Hollywood elitists, moveon.org, and the \nMichael Moores of the world--and they had a right to do it--were saying \nwe are going to have to stop emissions of greenhouse gases, and that \nthe anthropogenic gases and manmade case gases were causing global \nwarming.\n  I remember so well, in 1975, in the State legislature, at that time \nthe same magazines that are putting on the front page this idea that \nglobal warming is taking place--they are not doing it now, but they \nwere up until about 5 years ago. Back then, they were saying: Get \nready, another ice age is coming, we are all going to die. I remember \nusing the term that this has to be the greatest ``hoax'' ever \nperpetrated on the American people.\n  Fast forward to the late 1990s, when Kyoto was there, when I was \nchairman of the committee and I believed that manmade gases were \ncausing global warming, until the Wharton Business School came out with \nthe Wharton econometric survey. They showed clearly that if we were to \nsign on and ratify the Kyoto Treaty, it would cost the American people \nin the range of between $300 billion and $330 billion a year. Then, if \nyou fast forward that to the next McCain-Lieberman bill, it was even \nmore than that, and the Warner-Lieberman bill was even more than that.\n  When I looked at it at that time, back when we were very close to \nratifying the treaty, I found out that the science was not there. A lot \nof scientists were saying it was there, but it wasn't. Today, if \nanybody wants to get into my Web site, inhofesenate.gov, you can see \nall of the scientists. We have over 700 of them who used to be on the \nother side of this protecting their grants. They had to play this game \nto do it. They are now coming over to the skeptic side.\n  As we listen to the current administration, they are now going to try \nto, by regulation, impose this giant tax on the American people because \nthey know they cannot get it through this Chamber. We defeated it a \nyear ago today--the last effort to have a cap-and-trade tax on the \nAmerican people--by almost a 2-to-1 margin. They are going to try to do \nit again. When you talk about the $700 billion bailout and the stimulus \nbill, at least that is a one-shot deal. With this, you are talking \nabout a regular annual tax increase on the American people of about \n$350 billion. The estimates are between $3,000 and $4,000 a year per \nfamily. What good would that do? Even if it is true, if people \nlistening to me today, including fellow Members, believe manmade gases \nare causing global warming--if they believe that to be true, what good \nwould it do us in the United States to unilaterally say we are going to \nimpose these restrictions and pay $400 billion a year? And what good \nwill it do if we do that, because our manufacturing base will go into \ncountries where they have no restrictions. That would happen.\n  I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think the other speakers are here. Later \non, I will talk about the assets we have, and that we have to keep \nGuantanamo Bay--Gitmo, as it is referred to. It has performed well for \nus since 1903. I cannot think of one statement, other than political \nstatements, as to why we have to get rid of that great asset.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for his tolerance and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     To: CSIS J. Board of Trustees, Advisers, and Friends\n     From: John J. Hamre\n     Date: April 13, 2009 (Number 298. Two pages)\n     Re: Cancelling weapons systems\n       I was out of the country last week when Secretary of \n     Defense Gates announced his recommendation for wholesale \n     termination of a large number of weapon systems. This was \n     such a big deal that he skipped the 60th anniversary \n     celebrations of the founding of NATO in order to prepare for \n     the announcement.\n       Secretary Gates epitomizes what Americans want in public \n     service--fairness, decisiveness and decency. And he clearly \n     captured broad public support with his recommendations. In \n     dozens of conversations, I always heard some version of ``it \n     is about time we had a leader that did this.'' This is \n     usually followed up by a question ``do you think he will be \n     reversed by Congress?''\n       There is a myth in American politics, that defense \n     contractors are powerful manipulative forces in Washington. \n     Ever since President Eisenhower coined the term ``the \n     military-industrial complex'' the popular sense is that \n     defense companies manipulate the Department and the Congress \n     to get whatever they want. I have been in and around the \n     defense business for 30 years. My experience has been that \n     they are not the all-powerful force of popular imagination. \n     Defense contractors are hugely vulnerable because they are \n     entirely dependent on the attitude of one customer--the \n     Defense Department. If the Secretary of Defense decides we \n     don't need something (and the Joint Chiefs go along with the \n     decision--a crucial factor), defense contractors have \n     virtually no recourse.\n       Yes, Congress has occasionally reversed the decision of a \n     defense secretary. I remember when the Congress kept the B-1 \n     bomber alive after President Carter recommended its \n     termination. But the B-1 would never have been built had it \n     not been for President Reagan who used it to symbolize his \n     different approach to defense policy.\n       I suspect that most of the Secretary's recommendations will \n     hold. Every year the Congress receives the president's \n     defense budget, tears it apart and puts it back together, and \n     usually approves 97% of what is requested. A powerful member \n     of congress can add $10-20 million here or there for \n     something, but adding billions of dollars to reverse the \n     Secretary's decision on a single weapon system is almost \n     impossible. We are again returning to an environment when \n     adding something to the defense budget must be offset by \n     cutting something out. A congressman can strongly plea to add \n     $2 billion for program X, but very rarely offers offsetting \n     cuts in other programs. And with each instance, the pleading \n     congressman has to ultimately argue ``my judgment is superior \n     to that of the Secretary of Defense''.\n\n\n                    Board of Trustees and Counselors\n\n       CSIS trustees are drawn equally from the worlds of public \n     policy and the private sector. They contribute a wealth of \n     expertise to the Center's mission and management.

Mr. President, I was saddened to learn about the passing \nof a man who gave many long years of dedicated service to this Capitol.\n  If you only know this Senate through C-SPAN, it is likely you never \nsaw Steve.\n  But if you had the privilege to work in this beautiful building, \nSteve's work was indispensible.\n  Steve was a valued member of the Senate Sergeant at Arms' Capitol \nFacilities team for 32 years--since he was 20 years old.\n  He was part of the team of hard-working men and women who care for \nthis historic building.\n  If a room in the Capitol needed to be set up for a meeting, set up \nagain an hour later for a hearing, and set up again for a reception, \nyou knew you could count on Steve to do the work right, and on time.\n  When a filibuster seemed imminent, Steve was part of the crew that \nwould retrieve the cots from storage and set them up in the Capitol--\njust in case.\n  Steve's willingness to be helpful was invaluable. Not long after I \nmoved into my office on the third floor of the Capitol, Steve was in my \noffice to install a rug.\n  He saw that there was a problem. He told my staff that he had seen \nthe problem in another office--the way the rug was to be laid out, \nvisitors would trip on the corner of the rug and might fall.\n  This was just one example of how Steve cared for this institution and \nthe people who visited this building every day.\n  Whatever it took to make this Capitol work for visitors and \nemployees, Steve did--with pride and professionalism.\n  Steve was a friendly man who liked almost everyone--except the Dallas \nCowboys.\n  He was a generous man who never called attention to his generosity. \nIf a coworker needed a ride, Steve was the first to offer. He brought \nEaster baskets to his friends' children.\n  Steve Mosley died suddenly and unexpectedly Wednesday night of a \nheart attack.\n  I join my colleagues and all who work in this Capitol in offering our \ndeep condolences to Steve's wife of 26 years, Michelle, and their only \nchild, Steven Jr., whose 25th birthday is today.\n  He was much admired and he will be much missed, in this Capitol and \namong those who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4717-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE CUMBERLAND GAP NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe great national parks in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Cumberland \nGap National Historical Park, located southeastern Kentucky, near \nMiddlesboro. The park will celebrate its 50th anniversary this year.\n  In the 1920s, the idea of creating the Cumberland Gap National \nHistorical Park was formed, and after 30 years of planning and hard \nwork, the park was finished and dedicated, 50 years ago this coming \nJuly.\n  The park will hold several special events in July celebrating the \nanniversary of the historic dedication, including the gathering of oral \nhistories from people who were present during the creation, early days, \nand dedication of the park.\n  At the time of the dedication, Cumberland Gap National Historical \nPark included 20,184 acres--10,679 in Kentucky, 7,478 in Virginia, and \n2,027 in Tennessee. Until 1980, it was the largest historical park in \nthe country. It is estimated that more than 1 million people will visit \nthe park this year.\n  Efforts have been made by the National Park Service since 1997 to \nprevent surface coal mining in the area surrounding Fern Lake. In \ncooperation with my friend in the House, Congressman Hal Rogers, we \nwere able to pass legislation that authorized the Secretary of the \nInterior to acquire Fern Lake and the surrounding watershed to preserve \nthis natural resource.\n  I value the importance of this park and have consistently secured \nfunds to help acquire and preserve the lake. Located just southeast of \nMiddlesboro, Fern Lake serves as the primary water source for the \ncommunity and is visible from the Pinnacle Overlook, which is a popular \nvisitor attraction at the Cumberland Gap National Park.\n  This park shows the importance Kentuckians place on our natural \nenvironment, and I applaud the work of the individuals who helped make \nthis park a reality and those who continue to safeguard its natural \nbeauty for many generations to come.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in celebrating the \n50th anniversary of the dedication of one of our Nation's most \nbeautiful historical parks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4717-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4717-S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               94TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 94th Anniversary \nof the Armenian genocide.\n  Ninety-four years ago today, the Ottoman Empire--now modern-day \nTurkey--began the systematic destruction of the Armenian people. \nArmenians were driven from their homes and villages, marched to their \ndeaths in the deserts of the Middle East, and slaughtered in cold \nblood. Before it was over, approximately 1.5 million Armenians lost \ntheir lives in the first genocide of the 20th century.\n  Recently, the Armenian and Turkish Governments announced important \nprogress toward achieving the full normalization of relations between \ntheir two countries. I support this effort, and am hopeful that this \nprocess will lead the Turkish Government to finally acknowledge the \nirrefutable truth of the Armenian genocide and also to greater peace \nand prosperity for the people of Armenia.\n  As President Barack Obama has said, ``The Armenian Genocide is not an \nallegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely \ndocumented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical \nevidence. The facts are undeniable.'' There is no need for further \nstudy or debate because we must never legitimize the views of those who \ndeny the very worst of crimes against humanity.\n  On this solemn anniversary, we remember those who were lost in the \nArmenian genocide, while honoring the survivors and their descendants \nwho have done so much to make America and the world a better place. I \nam personally grateful that so many of those individuals have chosen to \ncall California home.\n  We also take pause to acknowledge that such crimes are continuing \ntoday. There is perhaps no more fitting example than the genocide that \nis raging in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\n  Since 2002, the Sudanese Government has attempted to exterminate the \nAfrican Muslim population of Darfur with horrific acts of brutality. \nVillages have been burned to the ground, innocent women and children \nslaughtered by helicopter gunships, and rape has been used as a tool of \ngenocide. What happened to the Armenians is genocide. What is happening \ntoday in Darfur is genocide, even though the Government of Sudan denies \nthis.\n  Genocide is only possible when people avert their eyes. Any effort to \ndeal with genocide--in the past, present or future--must begin with the \ntruth. By acknowledging the truth of the Armenian genocide, we can end \nthe phony debates and strengthen our ability to stand up against mass \nkilling today.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, my fellow \nRhode Islanders, and the Armenian-American community to observe the \n94th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  Each year, on April 24, it is fitting that we pause to remember and \nreflect on one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century, the \nsystematic killing of Armenians. From 1915 through the end of 1923, \nnearly 1\\1/2\\ million Armenians were killed and over half a million \nsurvivors were exiled.\n  The Armenian genocide demonstrated the evils humans are capable of, \nand unfortunately, it was only the first of several 20th century \ntragedies.\n  As we reflect and recall this tragic time, let us call for our own \ncountry to recognize the Armenian genocide, just as my own State of \nRhode Island has done, along with many other States and governments.\n  Menk panav chenk mornar--We will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4718-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SOMALI PIRACY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was glad earlier this week to join \nSenator Leahy in passing a resolution commending Captain Richard \nPhillips for his brave conduct, and those members of our armed \nservices, particularly members of the Navy and Navy SEAL teams, who \nrescued Captain Phillips. I also commend the leadership of the \nPresident and the efforts of many U.S. Government departments and \nagencies in their response to this crisis. These many acts of bravery \nand leadership are deeply inspiring, and we should recognize them.\n  However, while the episode involving the Maersk Alabama was resolved, \nwe are likely to see more such episodes if we do not take comprehensive \nmeasures to address not only piracy on the waters but also conditions \non land that enable it. We cannot ignore the fact that piracy off the \ncoast of Somalia is an outgrowth of the state collapse, lawlessness, \nand humanitarian crisis that have plagued the country for over a \ndecade. In recent congressional testimony, both Director of National \nIntelligence Blair and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Army LTG \nMichael Maples cited lawlessness and economic problems on land as the \ncause of the rise in piracy at sea. Until we address those conditions, \nwe will be relying on stopgap measures, at best, to deter this piracy \nproblem and we are unlikely to succeed in reversing the growing violent \nextremism in Somalia.\n  For years I have been calling for the development of a comprehensive, \ninteragency strategy to help establish stability, the rule of law, and \nfunctional, inclusive governance in Somalia. This is the only sure and \nsustainable solution to address the problem of piracy--and the \ninstability in Somalia--over the long term. Moreover, I am convinced \nthat we have a unique window of opportunity for progress as a result of \nthe Ethiopian troop withdrawal earlier this year and the establishment \nof a new unity Government relocated back to Mogadishu. This Government \nhas the potential to unite Somalia if it demonstrates a genuine \ncommitment to inclusion and begins to make a real difference in \npeople's lives--in terms of security and basic services, such as \nprotection, trash collection and job creation. Helping the Government \nto find tangible solutions to expand effective and inclusive governance \nmust be a central part of our overall strategy to stabilize Somalia and \naddress the threats of piracy and terrorism.\n  To that end, I continue to urge the Obama administration, as it \ndevelops its response to piracy, to make it a priority to engage at a \nhigh level with the new Somali Government. I have written to President \nObama, asking him to personally call Somali President Sheik Sharif and \nindicate a clear commitment to work with his Government not just on \nmaritime insecurity but also on establishing security and governance \nwithin the country. We have been engaging with President Sharif at the \nambassadorial level for quite some time now, and I met the President in \nDjibouti in December. In addition, there needs to be a stronger and \nmore sustained diplomatic push to engage with a wide range of actors \nwithin Somalia and stakeholders in the wider region--both in the Horn \nof Africa and the Middle East--if we are going to address the \nunderlying problems that have contributed to piracy and rising \nextremism.\n  The events with the Maersk Alabama earlier this month have finally \nbrought increased attention to the problem of piracy in Somalia's \nwaters. But it will be insufficient if our response only deals with the \nsymptoms and not Somalia's central problems. I urge my colleagues and \nthe different committees who will examine this issue over the coming \nweeks and months to take this seriously. For if we do not finally deal \nwith Somalia's lawlessness and instability, we will continue to see \nthem manifest themselves in activities--be they acts of piracy or \nterrorism--that threaten U.S. and international security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4718-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4718-S4720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for providing your constituents the opportunity \n     to share our thoughts and ideas regarding energy with you. \n     Your willingness to listen is yet another reason I am glad \n     you represent me in Washington.\n       For my family, the ridiculous cost of fuel has affected \n     almost every area of our lives. My husband pastors a church \n     here in Twin Falls and we have always lived within our means. \n     We are not in debt and have put away a tidy amount toward our \n     children's university education.\n       However, with gas prices rising toward $5 a gallon, we have \n     had to rethink our budget and spending on items like \n     groceries, clothing, dental insurance and home remodeling and \n     repairs. We had planned to repair the sidewalk in front of \n     our home since it has cracked and chipped over many years and \n     presents a hazard to passers-by. My husband decided not to go \n     ahead with the project this summer because he is afraid gas \n     prices will continue to soar and we will be left in a \n     precarious position this coming winter.\n       Our children usually participate in some form of athletic \n     activity over the summer, and this summer was supposed to be \n     golf. We have cut back on the frequency of their golf rounds \n     and did not purchase a set of clubs for our younger daughter \n     as we had planned. In addition, we cancelled plans to spend \n     two weeks at a resort in Sun Valley in July and will instead \n     go camping near home.\n       If things do not improve soon, we will have to cancel our \n     weekly ski trips this winter as well, because the high cost \n     of fuel will prohibit us from making the drive to Ketchum \n     each week.\n       Perhaps these cutbacks sound frivolous to some who surely \n     have it much harder than we do, but when we consider that \n     there are alternative, less costly energy sources available, \n     and when we read that once again, the democratic machine has \n     stalled drilling for existing oil, and when we combine that \n     with the fact that our government can afford to promote \n     initiatives for credits on the manufacture and purchase of \n     alternative energy sources, it makes no sense.\n       Surrounded by naysayers, a wise little boy once remarked, \n     ``Momma! The emperor is naked!'' It is high time those of us \n     feeling\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\n     the pinch of escalating fuel prices cry out, ``The emperor is \n     naked!'' All the rigmarole and double-talk thrown at us from \n     politically savvy liberals does not keep us warm in winter, \n     nor get us to work on time.\n       Please use your position to support off-shore drilling, \n     research and develop alternative sources of energy including \n     nuclear, and push for tax credits and rebates on the \n     manufacture and purchase of solar panels and other energy \n     alternatives.\n       Thank you again for representing me with dignity, wisdom \n     and courage in Washington D.C.\n     Summer, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Simply put, I stopped driving. I ride my bike, telecommute, \n     and use mass transit. I carpool when I can and am considering \n     purchasing a smaller, diesel engine vehicle and converting it \n     to run on vegetable oil. Sounds crazy, but it is better than \n     supporting the big oil companies.\n       For those of us who have been paying attention the past few \n     years, the high price of oil (and consequently gas) is no \n     surprise. It is about time that Americans started valuing oil \n     and gas as the precious commodities that they are. We could \n     continue to build an economy based on a non-renewable fuel. \n     And that would validate our history of short-sighted \n     solutions for complex problems. Need more oil, ally with the \n     Saudis, no problem. Befriend African rogue nations, they've \n     got plenty. Who cares if they commit atrocious human rights \n     violations. It comes down the cheap price of oil, right?\n       OK, so let us drill in our own backyards. How would you \n     like an oil rig in your wilderness area or off your \n     coastline? Ask the residents of Pinedale, Wyoming, who not \n     only deal with the high price of housing spurred by the \n     natural gas drilling in the area, but have also contended \n     with near unacceptable ozone levels throughout three of the \n     past four winters (March 13, 2008 Casper Star Tribune). Keep \n     in mind, this is a county in rural Wyoming, approximately \n     5,000 square miles, with about 6,000 residents (as of the \n     year 2000) in which there exists not a single stoplight!\n       Or ask those who lived in Santa Barbara in 1969 (June 23, \n     2008 NPR website). I remember my first trip to the beach as a \n     kid . . . and cleaning the oil off the bottom of my feet with \n     olive oil at the end of the day.\n       Or ask those who live near the tar sands in Canada about \n     their quality of life and health concerns (http://\nwww.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/20/60minutes/\nmain1225184_page1.shtml)\n       Or we could look for a solution that addresses the truly \n     complex nature of this issue. Our economy and way of life are \n     based on petroleum, a non-renewable resource. Some predict we \n     have even reached the critical ``peak oil'' point, yet we \n     insist on continuing to look for more of something that will \n     eventually, without a doubt, run out. Maybe the high price of \n     gas is a blessing in disguise. Maybe it will force us to take \n     a serious look at alternatives before it really is too late.\n     Kim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The following is my response to Senator Bingaman (thus to \n     Congress) regarding his comment about energy in his \n     newsletter. This pretty much says it all, and thus sums it up \n     for us, the taxpaying citizens of this nation--those paying \n     over $4.00 a gallon for gas, and consequently outrageous \n     prices for food!\n       ``You are `working to get a clear picture what actually is \n     going on in oil and gasoline markets . . .' ? Where have you \n     been? And, you are the chairman of the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee?!\n       ``The citizens of this nation have been trying to get \n     Congress to drill for oil for years, only to have Congress \n     [miss the mark due to special interest and environmental \n     lobbying]. Consequently, ten years later, you are still \n     studying the problem . . . and we are paying through the nose \n     for gasoline, and consequently for food.\n       ``We need to drill on land and sea, wherever the oil may \n     be!\n       ``Congress [has failed] to provide short-term as well as \n     long-term energy solutions.

And do not \n     forget to process that oil shale that everyone said, `when \n     the price of oil hits $50 a barrel, it would be profitable!'\n       ``The rising price of gasoline, consequently food, is \n     hurting every family in America. We are tired of Congress \n     doing nothing but finger pointing and bowing down to the \n     environmentalists and special interest groups.\n       ``Oh sure, there is a problem with the oil companies, but \n     the real problem is Congress! Congress must lead and demand \n     drilling commence immediately in Alaska, North Dakota, the \n     western states, and oil shale must be processed, too! If the \n     oil companies need an incentive, simply tell them to choose \n     between paying a huge windfall profits tax or invest that \n     money in drilling immediately!\n       ``It is time for Congress to implement a program, which \n     allows for the exploration of America's energy sources \n     without being overly concerned about the environment. Yes, we \n     should be concerned about any reckless exploration, and not \n     permit such folly, but remember, you have asked the balance \n     of the world to drill, while overly protecting our \n     environment . . . and yes, to our detriment. Because of you \n     our economy and citizens suffers--suffering needlessly! \n     Because of Congress' inaction, for years, Congress has put \n     this nation in a position whereby OPEC and speculators can, \n     and do, extort exorbitant prices for oil out of this nation!\n       ``And, about the `excuse' that it will take a few years to \n     get the oil into the pipeline. [With the many years of foot-\n     dragging, our country is paying dearly for inaction.]\n       ``As you very well know, once this country commences \n     drilling, seriously, for oil . . . and we do have a huge \n     supply, the price will immediately drop, and then we will be \n     on the road to becoming self-sufficient! Yes, if we announced \n     that we were going to drill in the gulf, in Alaska, in North \n     Dakota and in our western states, as well as process oil \n     shale, the price of oil would drop 50 to 70 dollars a barrel \n     overnight!\n       ``Inaction has cost this country dearly, and our economy \n     suffers because of it--but, even worse, the working man is \n     finding it difficult to make ends meet! You must stop playing \n     petty, partisan politics and put our families, the citizens \n     of this nation, and the welfare of our country first!\n       ``We need to drill on land and sea, wherever the oil may \n     be!'' . . .

No more excuses!\n     Bruce.\n                                  ____\n\n       After having read the stories on your site, and myself \n     feeling the same pain, I would just like to ask a few \n     questions. One, what is our current president doing? [While \n     he may not have financial worries, he needs to pay attention \n     to the rest of the country.] Two, what are all of you \n     politicians, senate leaders and other elected officials doing \n     to help solve all of these problems in our country. And I \n     mean what are you doing about it, not just talking about what \n     could be done. I could tell my story, but it would be the \n     same as all others. Pretty soon none of us will be able to \n     afford to drive to work, except of course the bigwig making \n     all the bonus bucks execs at the oil companies. Pretty soon \n     we will not have to worry about how many overweight people \n     there are in our country because people will not be able to \n     feed themselves. We will become one of the foreign nations \n     with starving people living on the streets and killing \n     children because people cannot afford to have a family. I am \n     sure the suicide rate is going up as we speak. So I am asking \n     you along with all other elected officials, please do \n     something! Take action! Let us know there is hope!\n     Lynn, Star.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is the 3rd response I have sent to you in regards to \n     saving energy. I want you to know that we have several new \n     long-haul trucking companies using the Ferox Fuel Tabs with \n     great success. I am enclosing one of the testimonial trial \n     runs for your view. Ferox is different from anything on the \n     market as it is a catalysis and was developed in 1986 from \n     work done on experimental burn rate modifiers for solid \n     rocket propellant systems use in the aerospace industry. With \n     a near 100% burn rate, significant changes in normal \n     circumstances change for the better: Increased gas mileage up \n     to 20% or more; emissions are reduced by 95% (this is as \n     green as you can get for the environment); oil life is \n     extended by 80%; horsepower increased by 15%; octane \n     requirements are reduced and it is very easy to use, cost can \n     get as low as .07 cents per gallon. This is as professional \n     product as it can get having been used in the commercial \n     industry for more than 20 years with documented success. If \n     everything I am saying is true, why would you not give it \n     some attention so you can see for yourself. I realize there \n     are many out there that are claiming something similar, but \n     many questions remain as to them working as they claim. This \n     one is for real and would make a tremendous difference in \n     many respects. Please respond as I would like to know where \n     to go from here to try to help make a difference.\n     Gordon, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a student at Brigham Young University of Idaho. Each \n     summer I take the time to earn money for education and reduce \n     my amount of loan-borrowing. The city of Rexburg is rather \n     small and has a shortage of job opportunities for college \n     students. Naturally, many students in my same situation seek \n     employment in Rigby or Idaho Falls. The commute may only be \n     about 30 miles. Nonetheless, after the cost of gasoline was \n     subtracted from my paycheck, it was barely worth commuting \n     out of town. This year I intend to work within Rexburg in an \n     effort to save money on gas. I hope to make slightly more \n     than minimum wage, but that is negotiable to circumstance. As \n     was mentioned in national news, many BYU-Idaho students \n     donate their plasma to help pay for groceries, dates and, of \n     course, gasoline. Many of my friends donate plasma on a \n     weekly basis. I suppose this is one way to buffer the effect \n     of gas prices now, but it can only last so long. It is also \n     unfortunate for those whose health impedes them from selling \n     their plasma. It is ridiculous to think of how much money I \n     spend at the pump on my little Honda Accord. I do not know \n     how some people afford to drive their huge SUVs or trucks! I \n     am starting to worry because the prices do not appear to be \n     stopping or slowing. Not every semester of classes will allow \n     for an evening job due to their academic rigor and demand of \n     time. Education remains very expensive even after receiving \n     government financial aid (which, by the way, I am very \n     grateful for). Bottom line, the price of gas is really \n     hurting me and my classmates. Thanks for listening.\n                                                 Matthew, Rexburg.\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Our energy independence is easily bought by reducing the \n     usage, or waste. We as Americans drive around in our SUVs and \n     pickups when there is no need to do so, we have only one \n     person in a vehicle and it is a huge waste of energy to drive \n     it helping only the ego of the person driving it. We would do \n     a lot better if we had some sort of mass transit and drove \n     smaller cars instead of some huge dinosaur eating toy. If a \n     person wants to drive that sort of vehicle it is up to them \n     to pay the penalty for it.\n       As far as gas prices go I personally would not mind to pay \n     five dollars a gallon if a much larger percentage of the cost \n     of the fuel was a tax that went straight toward a mass \n     transit system to get us all where we need to go in an \n     efficient manner, it is done in Europe so it is possible \n     here!\n       As for all those complaining about the high fuel prices, \n     buying a vehicle that gets poor mileage is like not putting \n     money in the bank for retirement or hard times.

Our summer vacations consist of going 200 or 300 \n     miles to see our children and grandchildren. We are not \n     extravagant and travel frugally. This summer our trips have \n     been slashed in half or more because we cannot afford the gas \n     to get there. We filled our propane tank to be prepared for \n     winter, and are already $1000.00 in debt for heating. This \n     amount will not last all winter, by February or before we \n     will need to fill it again, that is if it is a mild winter. \n     Our heating bill has tripled in the last year and a half. Our \n     food bill has gone up at least one third. We have to drive 8 \n     miles one way to work; we have to have money for gas to get \n     to work, so everything else has to go. We are trying to find \n     ways to cut back on other things, because we do not have \n     enough money to reach the end of the month.\n       We need to have common sense regarding our energy \n     resources. We can develop fuel sources and be smart about it \n     at the same time. Our dependence on foreign oil has got us \n     around the throat.\n     Arlene.\n                                  ____\n\n       You know all the stories that us Idahoans could send you \n     would not make any difference. The difference will be when \n     the elected officials of this country start doing the right \n     thing for the American public. Only you and the other elected \n     officials can put a stop to all the hullabaloo that is going \n     on at our nation's capital.\n       It has been said time and time again that a democracy can \n     only last a couple of hundred years until [corruption takes \n     root]. I think we are pretty close to that now. We cannot \n     even take care of the American citizens properly!\n     Jack, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I thought you would like to know of our experience with the \n     increasing prices of gasoline and how our family has been \n     affected. A few months ago my husband was diagnosed with \n     esophageal cancer. We live in a small farming community with \n     the nearest center for chemotherapy and radiation being just \n     over 100 miles round trip. His cancer treatment was \n     administered five days per week for 6\\1/2\\ weeks. We had to \n     make this 100-plus mile trip Monday through Friday 28 times. \n     As if the financial burden of the medical treatment and the \n     loss of work was not enough, the price of gasoline did not \n     help. We spent well over $500 on fuel to drive him to receive \n     his cancer treatments. Although he is finished with the \n     treatment he will have several follow up visits over the next \n     few months. There is no public transportation in this area, \n     and the rising cost of fuel makes it difficult to want to \n     leave your home!

Dr. Howlett was a man of strong faith, high \nintegrity, commitment to challenges, and a true family man. It is said \nthat he never missed a game, meet, tournament or even practice in the \nsports lives of his five children. He taught his children to respect \nour tremendous natural resources and imparted his love of hunting, \nfishing, sailing, and camping to them.

Mr. President, on April 17, Wisconsin bid farewell \nto a pioneer in politics. Midge Miller was a remarkable woman, and I \nwant to take a few moments to honor her service, her activism, and her \nextraordinary spirit.\n  Midge arrived in Madison, WI, in 1957. By that time in her young life \nshe had served as a missionary in Japan after the bombing of Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki, had lost her husband to a tragic shipwreck, and was about \nto begin graduate school in Madison. She was also the mother of four \nyoung children.\n  She went on to serve as assistant dean of UW's College of Letters and \nScience, one of Wisconsin's most effective State senators, a 9-year \nmember of the Democratic National Committee, and a founder of the \nNational Women's Political Caucus. Along the way she found time to \nvolunteer for a host of causes, all of them aimed at advancing peace \nand equality and giving hope to people who too often found themselves \noutside the ``system.'' She defended civil liberties, expanded civil \nrights, protected the environment, and fought for consumers.\n  Always mindful of her many roles, Midge could all at once be a \nremarkable leader, active constituent, and a responsible steward of \neverything, and to everyone, she touched. When the phone rang and her \ngentle voice came through on the other end, no matter on what subject \nor cause, listening, learning, and being compelled to action were the \nonly obvious responses when she was finished with you. From my first \ndays in office right up until recently, Midge was always there to \nadvise me but also hold me accountable. She showed her loved ones in \nher family and those she came to love in her\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\ncommunity what it meant, in the words of Gandhi, to be the change we \nwant to see in the world. Countless people, especially women in our \nState, credit her for the opportunities and inspiration she provided \nthat helped them reach their potential.\n  She was an extraordinary mentor, motivator, and mother. She was \ntireless and tenacious. She never lost her zeal to make the world a \nbetter place. Throughout her life, Midge Miller exemplified public \nservice, social responsibility, goodness, and grace. For all those \nreasons and many more, I am honored to have known Midge Miller and send \nmy heartfelt condolences to her family.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nremember a good friend, a great Wisconsin progressive, Midge Miller, \nwho recently passed away at age 86.\n  Midge was famous for many things, including her vital work on Eugene \nMcCarthy's Presidential campaign, her efforts to help found the \nNational Women's Political Caucus and the Madison Institute, and her \nservice on the Democratic National Committee, in addition to her many \nyears of service representing the west side of Madison in the Wisconsin \nState Assembly. Above all, though, Midge was known for who she was \nrather than the many things she accomplished. She was, very simply, a \nforce of nature. Midge was a dynamo who was always striving to do more \nand to get those around her to do the same. That was why she was loved \nby so many and why she will be so greatly missed.\n  I was proud to serve with Midge in the State legislature, where she \nwas a legendary figure. She was a true reformer, a role model, and a \ntreasured colleague. When I arrived in the State Senate as a young \nlegislator, Midge was always complimentary and supportive, which meant \na great deal to me. At the same time, in true Midge fashion, she never \nfailed to give me either additional work or a reading assignment. It \nwas that determination to keep working for change, and to make sure \nthat the rest of us were working for change alongside her, that truly \nmade Midge one of a kind.\n  Midge was an outstanding representative for the people she served. In \nthe State assembly, she used the skills she had honed from her work on \nthe McCarthy campaign, advancing women's rights, and as a leader in the \nDemocratic Party, to great effect. She was a terrific ally, a \nformidable opponent, and an unfailing advocate for the people she \nrepresented. And, in the end, she didn't just represent the west side \nof Madison, she represented all who care about economic and social \njustice, and the countless other causes she championed.\n  As I make this tribute to Midge, I am particularly proud of the way \nshe represented what is best about our State's progressive tradition. \nShe was absolutely committed to making democracy work for everyday \npeople, people who deserve a decent wage, safe working conditions and \ngood health care, and who deserve to be treated equally, no matter \ntheir gender, their religion, or the color of their skin. Her values \nwere the progressive values that have helped to strengthen our State, \nand the Nation, for more than a century.\n  Like so many Wisconsinites, my thoughts are with Midge's wonderful \nfamily, as people across the State and across the country mourn her \nloss. We are so fortunate that Midge devoted her tremendous energy, \ndevotion and skill to bettering all of our lives. I am grateful to have \nknown Midge Miller, and I am honored to pay tribute to her \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4721-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 895.

A bill to limit Federal spending to 20 percent of GDP; to the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Limitation On \nGovernment Spending Act of 2009. This legislation will set limits on \nthe amount of Government spending in comparison to the Nation's gross \ndomestic product.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said, ``You cannot keep out of trouble by \nspending more than you earn.'' While we remain in an economic \nrecession, the Obama administration continues to spend our way out of \nit, disregarding the future consequences.\n  As we continue on this route of reckless government spending, we \ncontinue to increase our debt that will be passed down to our children, \ngrandchildren, and many generations to come. The only way to repay this \ndebt is to increase taxes. That is why I believe it is so important \nthat we restrict ourselves from spending too much, especially during \nthis economic recession.\n  At a time when Utahns and Americans are tightening their wallets, \nthis budget grows the size of Government, excluding nondefense-related \nspending in just 2 years by 22 percent.\n  Many Americans, as demonstrated last week through TEA parties, are \nasking if this Government spending will ever stop. After trillions for \nbailouts and other Government spending, this budget makes no hard \nchoices to reform runaway spending.\n\n  I keep hearing my friends on the other side of the aisle eagerly \npoint out that President Bush never vetoed a spending bill. While I may \nagree that the former President should have restricted more in \nGovernment spending, President Obama's budget spends more than \nPresident Bush's did every year, even after adjusting for inflation.\n  Furthermore, the spending in this budget is so massive that \nindependent estimates suggest roughly 250,000 new Government \nbureaucrats may be needed to spend it all. While President Obama would \nlike to claim this as job growth, I think this is a false sense of \neconomic recovery. Long after our economy has hopefully recovered, we \nwill need to continue financing these new 250,000 new Government \nbureaucrats through, you guessed it, more Government spending.\n  My Republican colleagues want to work with the President to improve \nthe economy. This should be done by focusing on the issues that are \nhurting Americans the most. Fixing housing, reforming financial \nmarkets, developing clean energy and providing affordable health care \nare all common goals that both sides of the aisle share. But President \nObama's European-style approach to achieve these goals is to socialize \nAmerica--to spend, spend, spend and not worry about the enormous price \ntag it will leave.\n  If you look at the proposed budget, you can see the reckless \nspending. This budget increases discretionary spending by $490 billion \nover 5 years, and it promises much more spending than that--$1.3 \ntrillion over 5 years--through 27 reserve funds. The total spending in \nthis budget is $3.9 trillion in 2009, or 28 percent of GDP, the highest \nlevel as a share of the GDP since World War II. This is absurd.\n  How can we tell the American public, who are budgeting themselves and \nmaking sacrifices, that we are going to spend our way out of this, then \ncome back to them and tax them until they are back in the same \nposition? It is ludicrous.\n\n  We are moving toward what I call the Europeanization of America. To \nunderstand what I mean, it is helpful to compare European countries' \ntotal government spending as a percentage of GDP with our Nation's \nGovernment spending. In France, for example, government spending is \nclose to 50 percent of GDP. England's government spending is roughly 44 \npercent of GDP. In Germany, government spending is 45 percent of GDP. \nIn the US Federal Government spending has been around 20 percent. \nHowever, to accurately compare the US to European nations, it is \nnecessary to include state and local spending. Once that is factored \nin, US Government spending exceeds 37 percent of GDP, and that is \nbefore President Obama's stimulus package and budget for this year are \ntaken into account. Thus, it is almost a forgone conclusion that by the \nend of this year, total government spending in the US will be in line \nwith most European governments. Do we really want to move toward this \nEuropeanization of America?\n  Despite what you may hear, trivial attempts to cutback will not make \nan impact on Government spending. This past week, President Obama \nadmirably asked his administration to trim $100 million in Government \nspending. While this amount would be significant a century ago, it \ndoesn't do much today to reduce government spending. This cut would \namount to just 1/400 of 1 percent of total Federal spending for fiscal \nyear 2009. The Federal Government spends $100 million about every 13 \nminutes. So, while President Obama's restraint on Government spending \nis admirable, it is just a drop in the bucket for what we really need \nto achieve.\n  It is time for us to take a stand on Government spending. We need to \nshow self-discipline when dealing with Government spending. Since World \nWar II, Federal spending has been between 18 and 22 percent of GDP. I \nam calling upon my colleagues to restrict Government spending to the \nhistorical average of 20 percent. This limitation may be waived by an \napproval of 3/5 of members of this body.\n  It is time that we restrict government spending. It will cause us to \nmake some tough decisions about what is really important. One thing is \ncertain, we cannot continue down the path we are headed. We owe it to \nour children and grandchildren to change\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\ncourse and get back on the path to fiscal sanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/24/senate-section/article/S4723-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
