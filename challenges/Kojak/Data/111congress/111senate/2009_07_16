Madam President, I have five children. As they have grown, \nwe have moved on a number of occasions. But I have been able to keep, \nas one of my prized possessions and bring back memories of my younger \ndays, a number of things. If you have children, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, it is hard to keep things from being broken or \nmisplaced. But I have a number of things I have been able to keep. One \nis the badge I wore when I was a Capitol policeman here on Capitol \nHill. I still have that. It is in my conference room, and occasionally \nI will look up and see it. It reminds me of my days here in a different \ncapacity as a police officer.\n  I came to Washington, DC, as a young man to get my law degree. I had \na wife and a little baby. I worked from 3 to 11 every night except \nSunday. I went to law school full time. But my time as a Capitol \npoliceman was something I will always remember. We did not have the \ntraining the police officers have today. That is a gross \nunderstatement. We had very little training. But I carried my six-\nshooter and my uniform, of which I still have some pictures. I am very \nproud of that. I did not do anything dangerous. I have said here on the \nSenate floor before, the most dangerous thing I did was direct traffic. \nI say that because the old streetcar tracks caused the cars to bounce \naround, and you sometimes would wonder if they would get you because \nthey were going fast up Constitution.\n  So having had little experience as a police officer, in the sense \nthat we now see these police officers protecting us, I have a deep and \ngenuine appreciation for the sacrifice the men and women who are \nCapitol police officers make. When I was a Capitol policeman--all men, \nno women. But now, all over the Capitol complex, there are hundreds of \nwomen who help protect us.\n  The reason I make this brief introduction is yesterday afternoon, our \nCapitol police once again did their jobs with great bravery and skill. \nFortuitously, this came at such an interesting time. Next week, a week \nfrom tomorrow, we are going to have a ceremony here in the Capitol, as \nwe do every year--I believe this is the 11th year--where we recognize \nthe bravery\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nof two Capitol police officers who were killed, Officers Chestnut and \nGibson.\n  Gibson I knew. We were on a Senate retreat in Virginia, and my wife \nbecame ill. Gibson is the man who ran with all of the paraphernalia to \nmake sure she was going to be OK. He was profusely perspiring. I can \nstill remember very clearly this wonderful hard-working man. He came to \nsave my wife.\n  Well, these two officers were killed. In the process of their being \nmurdered by a madman, we do not know how many people's lives were saved \nin the Capitol complex. But it was the impetus that caused us to \ncomplete this great Capitol Visitor Center that we have, in the \nsacrifice that they certainly did not intend to make but they did make \nbecause of their training and skill.\n  Yesterday, an armed man fled a traffic stop, driving erratically \naround Capitol Hill. We do not know all of the details, but we do know \nthat he struck a parked car, we understand now a motorcycle and a \npolice car, a Capitol police car, and he almost ran over two police \nofficers.\n  But when he got out of the car, a block from where we are right now, \nhe came with an Uzi-type weapon, semiautomatic weapon, and started \nfiring at the police and anyone else around them.\n  Fortunately, the Capitol police officers stopped him before he had a \nchance to do any harm. He was shot numerous times as was required under \nthe circumstances. But the interesting part about this is what did the \npolice officers do when the firing stopped, when they could no longer \nhear the bullets. They immediately ran over and administered first aid \nto this domestic terrorist. They tried to save the life of a man who \nseconds earlier tried to take theirs.\n  I do not know how we define heroism, but I think that is a pretty \ngood description. An investigation is, of course, underway. We do not \nknow all of the details, nor can we know how many lives these officers \nsaved yesterday. And we cannot sufficiently thank them for what they \ndid. But on behalf of the entire Senate, we appreciate each of them. I \nadmire what you do. Wherever we go on this Capitol complex, there are \npeople looking over us. That is not the way it always was, but now with \nterrorism, with there being a war that is being waged against our great \ncountry, we have had to have all of these police officers protect not \nonly us but all of the people who come here on a daily basis.\n  We have people whom we can see in uniform. We have people we do not \nknow are police officers; they are in plain clothing. We deeply value \nthe honorable work these men and women do for us every day, putting \ntheir lives on the line to protect people they do not know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7584-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the past several weeks I have come \ndown to the Senate floor just about every day we have been in session, \nand I have brought a simple message: Americans want health care reform, \nand both parties want to deliver that reform. What Americans do not \nwant is a government takeover masked as a reform that leaves them \npaying more for less. And they don't want us to rush something as \nimportant and as personal as health care reform just to have something \nto brag about at a parade or a press conference.\n  So it was perplexing to hear the President say yesterday that the \n``status quo . . . is not an option.'' I cannot think of a single \nperson in Washington who disagrees with that statement. No one is \ndefending the status quo, no one. What we are defending is the right of \nthe American people to know what they are getting into: the exact \ndetails and the cost.\n  That leads me to another distressing aspect of the administration's \napproach to this debate, the artificial timeline for reform. The \nPresident has said he wants to see a health care reform bill out of the \nSenate in 3 weeks and on his desk in October. His rationale seems to be \nthe same as it was during the debate over the stimulus. The economy's \nin bad shape, so health care reform has to happen right away.\n  Certainly the two are connected. But the problem is that many of the \nDemocrat proposals we have seen would not make the situation better, \nthey would make it even worse. And due to our current financial \nsituation, we need to be even more careful about how we spend our \nmoney, not less. We saw the consequences of carelessness on the \nstimulus bill. We rushed that, and Americans got burned. We must not \nmake that mistake again.\n  But we can start with a point of real agreement: Americans want \nreform, but they want us to be careful.\n  An artificial deadline virtually guarantees a defective product--\nvirtually guarantees a defective product. Look no further than the \ndrafts coming out of the House and Senate this very week. Both of them \nare shot through with weaknesses and deficiencies typical of a rush \njob. First, they cost way too much. According to early estimates, the \nHouse bill would cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years and \nyet--listen to this--it still wouldn't cover all the uninsured; $1 \ntrillion and it wouldn't cover all the uninsured. It includes a new tax \non small business that could keep companies from hiring low-wage \nemployees. It creates a new nationwide government-run health plan that \ncould force millions off their current insurance. One of the worst \nparts is that advocates of the House bill want small businesses and \nseniors to pay for it; small businesses and seniors they want to pay \nfor it. Businesses would pay through new taxes, seniors through cuts to \nMedicare, cuts that hospitals in my home State simply cannot sustain.\n  I have talked to the hospitals in Kentucky that are worried about the \nimpact these Medicare cuts would have on the services Kentucky \nhospitals currently provide to seniors. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to talk to the people who care for patients day in and day \nout at hospitals in their own States and see what they have to say \nabout this proposal. It may be a lot different than what some of the \ninterest groups here in Washington are saying.\n  Small businesses are worried too. At a time when the unemployment \nrate is already approaching 10 percent, the new tax on small business \nwill inevitably lead to even more job losses. Business groups across \nthe country that have seen the details of the House bill are warning \nthat it would certainly kill jobs. Under the House bill, taxes on some \nsmall businesses could rise as high as roughly 45 percent. Let me say \nthat again: Taxes on small business up to 45 percent, meaning their tax \nrate would be about 30 percent higher than the rate for big \ncorporations. So small businesses, which have created approximately two \nout of three new jobs over the past decade, get a bigger tax increase \nthan big corporations. It is worth asking why small businesses, which \ncreated about two-thirds of the new jobs in this country over the last \n10 years, get hit so hard under the House bill. Is it because they \ncan't fight back as hard as big businesses? Either way, the House bill \nwould lead to some small businesses paying higher taxes than big \nbusinesses, even though the U.S. corporate rate for all of our \ncorporations is already one of the highest in the world.\n  The Senate bill is as bad. As currently written, the HELP Committee \nbill would increase the Federal deficit by at least $645 billion, at \nleast that\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nmuch. If we add all the Medicaid changes the HELP Committee \nanticipates, it increases the Federal deficit by more than $1 trillion \nat a time when we are already spending about $500 million a day on \ninterest on the national debt so far this year--$500 million a day in \ninterest on the national debt so far this year. It too would kill jobs \nby requiring businesses to either insure all of their employees or pay \na tax if they do not. It would levy a tax on those Americans who don't \nhave or cannot afford health insurance. It also fails to reform \nmalpractice laws. It spends billions of dollars on projects unrelated \nto the crisis at hand. It forces millions of Americans off of their \ncurrent plans--forces millions of Americans off of their current \nplans--despite repeated assurances from the administration that it does \nnot. And like the House bill, it creates a nationwide government plan \nthat could lead to the same kind of denial, delay, and rationing of \ncare that we see in other countries.\n  Health care reform is vital but it is not easy. If the House bill and \nthe HELP bill are any indication, it is certainly not something that \nshould be rushed. Both bills are too expensive, particularly for small \nbusinesses and seniors. They are too disruptive of the health care \nAmericans currently have, and they are ineffective in addressing the \nhealth care problem in its entirety.\n  Americans have a right to expect that we will take enough time on \nthis legislation not to make the same mistake we made on the stimulus. \nThe House and Senate bills we have seen this week show we are not there \nyet, not even close. We need to slow down and let the American people \nsee what they are getting into with these so-called reforms. We all \nwant reform, but we want the right reform.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak about where we find \nourselves today. This is a momentous time in our country's history, as \nall of us in both bodies on both sides of the aisle find ourselves \nfocused on the issue of health care reform. In the middle 1990s, I had \nthe tremendous honor of serving the State of Tennessee in a position \nthat allowed me to oversee the State's Medicaid Program and many other \nprograms in our State that focused on the needs of many of the \nunderserved. Since that time, I have been convinced that we, all of us, \nhave a moral responsibility to do everything we can to ensure that \nAmericans of all walks of life have the opportunity for affordable, \nquality private health insurance.\n  I have probably attended 50 meetings in the last 90 days working with \nothers toward that end. I am convinced that there are at least 90 \npeople in this body who share the goal of ensuring that Americans of \nall walks of life have the opportunity for affordable quality health \ncare. It is my hope that we will end up with a bipartisan solution.\n  I have been disappointed in the results, though, of legislation that \nhas come forward thus far. My sense is that the House of \nRepresentatives is promoting a bill that does not meet the mark. The \nHELP Committee just passed out, on a party-line vote, a bill that, \nagain, does not meet the mark. What concerns me is there are so much \nthat we could agree on, yet we tend to focus on what is out of bounds \nand does not take us to the place we would all like to be. It is to \nthat end that I rise to talk about this issue.\n  All of us know that our country has seen unprecedented debt levels. \nThe leader of the Senate Republicans just spoke about that issue. The \nPresident in some ways found himself in this place, but on the other \nhand, since being in office, he has accumulated debt on top of debt for \nfuture generations. All of us understand that our biggest obligations \nexist in entitlements, with Medicare and Social Security. Most of us \nthought, as we came into this Congress, that one of our major focuses \nwould have to be to get entitlements under control so that while we are \ndoing this unprecedented short-term spending, which I oppose, at least \nthe world community would realize we are trying to tackle our long-term \nobligations so they would continue to buy our bonds in order that we \ncould go on here in this country.\n\n  I hoped strongly we would focus on that, and last Congress we had a \nbipartisan bill, by the way, supported by Republicans and Democrats, to \ndo that.\n  What has happened, though--and this is pretty unfathomable to me--is \nthat during health care reform, what has been focused on is Medicare, \nwhich has a $38 trillion unfunded liability, a program where the \ntrustees have said that it is insolvent and is going to go into the \nhole in a huge way in 8 years. What is being discussed in this body, \nand what has already been agreed to by many on the House side, is \ntaking money from Medicare, a program which is insolvent, one that, \ninstead of taking money from, we should be trying to make solvent, but \nwe are taking money from that program to create a whole new set of \nentitlements that will add incredible amounts of debt to our country's \nbalance sheet.\n  It is almost unfathomable to believe that people in this body would \nbe looking to make a program that is insolvent even more insolvent by \nleveraging it to create another program.\n  For that reason, because I know the Finance Committee is in meetings, \nin small groups but also as a committee, to try to figure out a way to \nsolve this health care problem--and it is my hope that they will do it \nin a way that makes sense, in a way that builds bipartisan support--I \nhave delivered today to the majority leader a letter signed by 35 \nSenators making this body, making the President aware of the fact that \nwe will not support further jeopardizing the Medicare Program by using \nit to leverage a new entitlement. It is my hope that in delivering this \nletter, while we have 35 signatures at this moment, there will be more \nadded. While these are all Republican signatures, I actually think \nthere are many on the other side of the aisle who question leveraging \nan insolvent program for a new program. I have delivered this letter in \nthe hopes that the Finance Committee, the leadership on the Democratic \nside of the Senate, and the President will seek a solution that is \ndifferent than taking money from this insolvent program that aids our \nseniors to create a new entitlement.\n  One of the most discouraging issues is, it is my understanding--and I \nhope I am wrong--that the folks who are talking about using Medicare \nmoney to create a new entitlement are not even dealing with SGR. Every \n18 months, we sit down and discuss the doc fix. Doctors all across the \ncountry call us wanting to make sure that their payments are not going \nto be cut by 21 percent this year. So each year we kick the can down \nthe road and solve that for a year, year and a half, because of \nbudgetary constraints. It is my understanding that what is being \ndiscussed at this moment is taking money from Medicare, leveraging a \nnew program which will add increasing debt, and not solving that \nproblem even during the 10-year budget window this legislation will \ndeal with.\n  Again, I have attended every meeting I have been asked to. I went to \nthe White House yesterday. I met with a bipartisan group last night. I \nbelieve that this country does need to figure out a way so that all \nAmericans can access affordable quality health care. I know all \nAmericans are concerned about the cost of health care. I stand here as \none Senator committed to\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\ndoing that in the right way, but I also stand here with 35 other \nSenators saying that to do that and make another program that exists \nmore insolvent is not acceptable.

Madam President, I wish to begin my comments \non this year's national defense authorization by first thanking all the \nmembers of the Personnel Subcommittee. And I particularly would like to \nthank the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator Lindsey Graham. He and \nI have worked together for several years on this subcommittee, changing \nthe chairmanship back and forth, and I have always found our time on \nthe subcommittee is decidedly nonpartisan, bipartisan, regardless of \nwho currently chairs it.\n  All the Members of the Personnel Subcommittee strive to do what is \nright by servicemembers and their families, and any disagreements we \nhave are minimal, and are always focused on how best to serve those who \nserve us.\n  The annual National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation that Congress passes every year. It \nprovides authority for everything the Department of Defense does, from \nthe ships and planes it buys, to the pay and compensation of \nservicemembers, to retirement and disability benefits. So I look \nforward to this year, once again, passing a Defense Authorization Act \nfor the 48th year in a row.\n  As in past years, the committee has focused heavily on personnel \nissues, including taking care of the families of servicemembers. There \nis an old axiom in the military that you recruit the soldier but you \nretain the family. So providing support to those families is more \nimportant now than ever before. I am happy with the bill, and I \nrecommend it to my fellow Senators. I wish to emphasize that the \ncommittee also voted this bill out of committee unanimously.\n  The bill before us authorizes $135.6 billion for military personnel, \nincluding pay, allowances, bonuses, death benefits, and permanent \nchange of station moves. The bill contains many important provisions \nthat will improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform \nand their families.\n  First and foremost, the bill would authorize a 3.4-percent pay raise, \nwhich is half a percent higher than the increase in the Employment Cost \nIndex and the administration's request and reauthorizes over 25 types \nof bonuses and special pays aimed at encouraging enlistment and \nreenlistment.\n  The bill also addresses the administration's request to increase the \npermanent end strengths of all the services over last year's \nauthorization. The bill authorizes fiscal year 2010 end strengths of \n547,400 for the Army; 202,100 for the Marine Corps; 331,700 for the Air \nForce; and 328,800 for the Navy. The Active Duty end strength of every \nservice will increase over last year's levels. Moreover, the bill \nauthorizes additional Army Active Duty end strength in fiscal years \n2011 and 2012, if needed.\n  The bill also authorizes pay for travel and transportation expenses \nfor Reserve component members to go home when training has been \nsuspended at their temporary duty station. Operation Airlift, as we \ncall it, came to my attention when members of the 110th Medical \nBattalion, based in Lincoln, NE, were stranded at Fort Lewis, WA, when \ntraining was suspended and the base was shut down for the holidays. \nMilitary rules prohibited using military funds to pay for their travel \nback to Nebraska until training resumed. This measure addresses this \nproblem which has occurred in many other States and to many other \nreservists and guardsmen and demands that the military commands \nappropriately plan and schedule training exercises.\n  The bill also supports the continued provision of world-class health \ncare to our servicemembers and their families, authorizing $27.9 \nbillion for the Defense Health Program.\n  The bill authorizes TRICARE standard coverage for National Guard and \nReserve retirees previously in an uncovered so-called gray area. The \nTRICARE gray area retiree measure ensures nearly 225,226 eligible \nretirees nationwide will have the opportunity to purchase coverage \nunder the military's TRICARE health care program.\n  In support of our increasing number of wounded warriors, the bill \nauthorizes special compensation for caregivers for the time and \nassistance they provide to servicemembers with combat-related \ncatastrophic injuries or illnesses requiring assistance in everyday \nliving. Additional support is provided through this bill which \nauthorizes travel and transportation allowances for nonmedical \nattendants of very seriously wounded, ill or injured servicemembers.\n  To ensure we continue to increase the care of our wounded warriors, \nthis bill requires the establishment of a task force to assess the \neffectiveness of the policies and programs to assist and support the \ncare, management, and transition of recovering wounded, ill, and \ninjured servicemembers.\n  To help resolve the dire shortage of physicians needed to care for \nthe mental health of combat proven servicemembers, the bill authorizes \nthe service Secretaries to add up to 25 officers each year as students \nat accredited schools of psychology for training leading to the degree \nof doctor of psychology in clinical psychology. In an effort to ensure \nour servicemembers get the mental health care they need and to help \novercome the stigma associated with seeking mental health care, the \nbill requires person-to-person mental health assessments at designated \nintervals for servicemembers deployed in connection with contingency \noperations.\n  The bill also requires initiatives to increase the number of military \nand civilian behavioral health personnel at the Department of Defense.\n  Continuing our efforts to support wounded warriors and their \nfamilies, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to undertake a \ncomprehensive assessment of the impacts of military deployment on \ndependent children of servicemembers, and a review of the mental health \ncare and counseling services available to military children.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $45 million in impact aid to local \nschool districts, including $5 million for educational services for \nseverely disabled children, and $10 million for districts experiencing \nrapid increases in the number of students due to rebasing, activation \nof new military units or base realignment and closure.\n  These are just some of the highlights. There were over 60 legislative \nprovisions affecting personnel policy, pay, end strength, health care, \nand family support. It is paramount we take care of our servicemembers \nby ensuring their pay and compensation is what it should be, and needs \nto be, to sustain the All-Volunteer Force and enable them to fight and \nwin the Nation's wars and to take care of them and their families when \nthey return home injured and wounded.\n  So, again, I would like to thank Senator Graham and all the members \nof the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. I look \nforward to working with our colleagues to pass this extremely important \nlegislation as we continue the process of authorization of the parent \nbill.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  With that, I conclude my remarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to speak for a moment about \nanother bill Senator Inhofe and I introduced earlier: the Foreign \nAdopted Children Equality Act. This would make a small but important \nchange in the way orphans are identified or classified when they are \nadopted overseas so that they can become automatic citizens.\n  I was very proud to work with Senator Kennedy on this issue, with \nSenator Don Nickles from Oklahoma when he served in the body. We worked \nvery hard to find a way, when families go overseas to adopt, once that \nadoption is final--we believe the active adoption itself puts that \nchild in automatic custody of that parent. That parent, being an \nAmerican citizen, should automatically be able to transfer that \ncitizenship to that adopted child just as if you are born in the United \nStates to an American citizen or you are born in the United States, you \nare an automatic American citizen; and most certainly if you are born \noverseas, but if your parents are citizens, you are an automatic \ncitizen of the United States. You don't need any extra paperwork done \non your behalf because we believe the act of adoption should be treated \nthe same way as the act of birth. We believe this right should be \ntransferred to orphan children adopted overseas.\n  Right now, there is a little bit of a glitch in the law that is not \nallowing this. This act would correct that.\n  I will finally end with one of my most wonderful memories of my time \nin the Senate, which was in Faneuil Hall in Boston with Senator Kennedy \nand with Congressman Delahunt, when we, on one special day, were able \nto swear in as citizens of the United States thousands of children who \nhad been waiting to become citizens, having been adopted by American \nfamilies. That was a very proud moment of mine and something many of us \nworked on. But this bill will take that to a new level. When families \ntravel overseas to adopt, as my sister and many relatives and friends \nof Members of Congress took the opportunity to do, at the time the \nadoption is official in that country, the child becomes an automatic \ncitizen of the United States, which is a great benefit.\n  As I grow older in my life, I realize what an extraordinary privilege \nit is to be a citizen of the United States of America. So as our \nfamilies adopt, that citizenship will be automatically transferred to \ntheir adopted children.\n  So I thank you. Again, it is the Foreign Adopted Children Equality \nAct I am speaking about this morning and introducing for consideration \nof the body the Families for Orphans Act.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Madam President, I rise to speak of two topics. The first \nis health care.\n  We had a significant development yesterday in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, where we \nactually voted the bill out of the committee. It is the first time in \nmany years that a major piece of health care legislation, other than \nmajor initiatives such as children's health insurance, has been voted \nout of the Senate committee.\n  We have a long way to go. We have the Senate Finance Committee \nworking on this, the House is working on this, and President Obama has \nmade this a major priority of his administration and I believe part of \nhis economic recovery short-term and especially long-term. I commend \ntwo people for their work: Chairman Dodd, working in place of our \nchairman, Senator Kennedy. Between the two of them, they did a great \njob of leading this effort, not just in the course of some 60 hours of \nhearings and probably another 20 or more hours prior to the hearings--\nprior to the markup when we were offering amendments--but many months \nand weeks and, in the case of both of these Senators, years working on \nhealth care. I also commend the staffs, and my staff, especially Morna \nMurray, who did great work.\n  I say all that because it was a significant development. We know it \nis just one chapter in a long book. We have a long way to go. I think \nit is significant that a bill is out of a committee and moving through \nthe Senate.\n  I wish to focus in particular on a couple of aspects of the bill and \nthen move to some reactions on the question of health care that we get \nfrom across Pennsylvania.\n  The bill itself has as its foundation this principle: The status quo \nis not only unacceptable, it is, in fact, unsustainable. We cannot \ncontinue to ignore the issue of health care. We have to act on it this \nyear--not next year or the year after but this year, 2009--at long last \ntackling a problem the American people have been debating for decades \nnow across the country. Now we have a President who is leading, with \nthe opportunity to finally make progress.\n  The bill does a lot. First, as part of its foundation, it covers 97 \npercent of the American people. It is critical that we make that part \nof the final bill. Secondly, in terms of the overall impact of the \nbill, it will reduce costs, it will preserve choices, and it will, in \nfact, enhance quality. All of the issues we have talked about for years \nare now going to be part of this bill.\n  People have been frustrated by the unfairness of the failure of \ninsurance companies to cover preexisting conditions. It is right there \nin the bill. Preexisting conditions, in the bill, will no longer be a \nbar to treatment and to the curing of disease and the treatment of \nindividuals.\n  It also has as a foundation to it the question of what to do to \npreserve choice? The American people have a right to not only keep the \nhealth care they like, but also they should have a choice--if they \ndon't like what they have or if they have no insurance at all, they \nought to be given a choice. I believe part of that choice isn't just \nwithin the framework of private insurance, the insurance companies, \nbut, in fact, a public option, preserving not just choice for the \nAmerican people but also enhancing competition and bringing down costs. \nThat is essential. Even as we are concerned about the almost 50 million \nAmericans, including 5 million children, who don't have coverage, we \nhave to make sure we are preserving that choice.\n  So reducing costs, preserving choice, and enhancing quality are very \nmuch a part of the bill that does change the status quo. At some point, \npeople in Washington are going to have to join one team or the other--\nthe status quo team, the ``can't do it now, satisfied with the current \nsystem'' team, or the side of changing the status quo, the side of \nreform, the team that is working with President Obama to at long last \naddress the question of quality, the question of access, and the \nquestion of bringing down the cost of care for our families and our \nbusinesses. So they have to choose their team. In my judgment, there \nare two teams: the status quo team and the reform change team with \nPresident Obama.\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\n  I wish to highlight just two excerpts of letters I have received from \nconstituents in Pennsylvania. I will read a sentence from each. Before \nI do that, I want to cite an element of one recent report. This is a \nrecent report from Families USA. I will read one line to make this \npoint:\n\n       . . . 44,230 more people are losing health care coverage \n     each week.\n\n  That is 44,230 people, every single week, who are losing their health \ninsurance. With that data staring us in the face--and you can point to \nother data in Pennsylvania and across the country--can anyone really \nmake the argument that we should slow down and maybe not get this done \nthis year, wait a little longer, a year, another 2 years? In fact, if \nyou do that, you are talking about waiting 10 or 20 years. We cannot do \nthat. We have to act with a sense of urgency and a sense of common \npurpose.\n  I will read two lines from two letters. One is from a gentleman in \nPennsylvania and, secondly, a letter from another constituent of mine. \nThey put this into sharp focus. This letter says, in part:\n\n       I, for one, find it impossible to understand how the Nation \n     that sent men to the moon, invented atomic energy, and won \n     the largest conflict in history [a reference to World War II] \n     cannot provide the basic right to medical care to all, and \n     most importantly, its neediest citizens.\n\n  That is a pretty wise summation of why we have to get this done this \nyear.\n  Here is a brief line from another letter I received from a \nconstituent in Pennsylvania. She speaks of the economic pressure she \nand so many families feel with the status quo, the current health care \nsystem:\n\n       I am only trying to keep my family from becoming another \n     statistic.\n\n  Another statistic like 44,230 families losing their health care \ncoverage every single week, a statistic like the number of families \ngoing into bankruptcy every week and every month because of one issue \nprincipally for many families--not all but many--the issue of health \ncare.\n  I think we have to remember the wisdom and also the real-life \nexperiences of the people who write to me, representing Pennsylvania, \nor any other State.\n  I have two more points.\n  The question is of premiums. There was a recent report that indicates \nthat if we don't take action on the issue of health care reform, if we \ndon't act now and finally, at long last deal with quality, cost, \naccess, and preserving choice--this is a report by the New America \nFoundation, issued at the end of last year. It said:\n\n       In Pennsylvania, family health insurance with a price tag \n     of $26,879 in 2016 would consume 51.7 percent of the \n     projected Pennsylvania median family income.\n\n  The national number is very similar to that. So if you look at it \nover a 10-year period or an 8-year period, what we are looking at here, \nif we don't tackle this issue, is families in Pennsylvania and across \nthe country will be paying half or more than half of their income for \nhealth care. That is the reality. That is why there is a sense of \nurgency and purpose and a resolute focus on this issue this year. We \ncannot sustain this. Our economy cannot continue to go in this \ndirection. We have to begin to tackle it this year.\n  Finally, before I move to my second topic, is the issue of children. \nI have made, along with Senator Dodd and so many others--this a central \npriority when we are doing health care reform. We are very happy this \nbill is moving forward, that health care is in sharp focus. One of the \nthings we have to make sure of as we move through the process is that \nno children, especially poor children and those with special needs, \ncome out of this worse off than they have been. One of my themes is \n``No child worse off.'' Just four words: ``No child worse off.'' I add \nas a corollary: especially poor and special needs children.\n  Unfortunately, we have some ideas in Washington floating around that \nrun contrary to that. I urge those who are ignoring the question of \nchildren, who are forgetting about the impact of this bill on \nchildren--and it is a very positive impact--to remember that line from \nScripture where it says that ``a faithful friend is a sturdy shelter.'' \nWe have a lot of people in Washington who do a lot of talking about \nbeing a friend of children, being advocates for children, and standing \nup for children. It is wonderful that they say that. But if we are \ngoing to prove ourselves to be a faithful friend to children by being \nthat sturdy shelter that protects them, not only from the ravages of a \nbad economy, not only from the other horrors so many children face, but \neven protecting them from unintended consequences of health care \nlegislation, if that is what we say we are going to do, we should prove \nit through the work we do in the bill.\n  I have a couple of points about that. One of the things I worked very \nhard on in the bill, working with Senator Dodd, was to make sure that \nenrollment in care, either through the so-called gateway, which is part \nof the health care bill, or through Medicaid or CHIP, is done in a way \nthat we are actively assisting--actively assisting--families to get \nthem enrolled and not just saying: You are on your own and try to \nfigure it out--actively seeking to help families, especially poor \nfamilies, get enrolled.\n  I have worked with Senator Dodd on a requirement that pediatric \npreventive care be included in the list of mandatory preventive \nservices that insurance plans offer, with minimum cost-sharing \nrequirements for families.\n  I have also worked with Senator Dodd on ensuring that medical homes--\nwhich, as we know, is not a place but an approach to care, patient- and \nfamily-centered care that is comprehensive and coordinated; that is \nwhat I mean by ``medical home''--that there is a medical home as well \nfor children. Pediatric medical homes for children are part of the \nbill.\n  Finally, we ensure the establishment of an oral health care \nprevention education campaign at the Centers for Disease Control \nfocusing on preventive measures targeted toward children and pregnant \nwomen.\n  For all these reasons and more, we have to continue to focus on \ngetting health care legislation passed at long last.\n  I was honored to be with the Presiding Officer yesterday at a \ndiscussion about preventive health care. That is a central part of this \nbill. I commend her work in this area. It is a central feature of this \nhealth care bill.\n\n\n                          Global Food Security\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, let me move to a second topic in the \nremaining time I have, in addition to health care, and that is actually \na related issue, the issue of hunger and food security, but on the \nscale of the world, the international stage. I wish to speak briefly on \nthe subject of a significant achievement from last week's G8 summit \nheld in Italy.\n  The G8 leaders agreed to commit $20 billion over the next 3 years to \ninternational agricultural development, of which the United States will \npledge a minimum of $3.5 billion over this period.\n  As the President, the White House, noted, that comprises more than \ndoubling of current U.S. levels of agricultural development assistance \nand represents a dramatic shift in the way our government conceives of \nglobal food security.\n  For too long, the United States has relied on the traditional \nemergency aid model, a testament, of course, to the charity and \ngenerosity of the American people, but also an inefficient and often \ndelayed response to hunger overseas.\n  A real investment in international agricultural development can help \nthe developing world grow self-sufficient in agriculture and provide a \nlivelihood for the significant share of the population that are small \nfarmers across the world.\n  Everyone is familiar with the old saying: Give a man a fish and you \nfeed him for today. Teach a man to fish, and you have fed him for a \nlifetime. We should bear that in mind when we think about this policy \nof global food security. That is exactly what the international \ncommunity, led by the G8 and President Obama, is seeking to do, with an \nemphasis on several key principles, at least three: strategic \ncoordination of assistance to ensure that aid is provided in a fashion \nthat maximizes effectiveness and efficiency; investment in country-\nowned plans to provide genuine domestic ownership and inclusion of \nbenchmarks and other standards of accountability; and a sustained \ncommitment with followthrough at future summits to ensure\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nthat the leading States are carrying through on their pledges.\n  This G8 initiative is a complement to the Global Food Security Act, \nintroduced earlier this year by the ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, and myself. As of today, \neight other Members have cosponsored the Global Food Security Act, and \nI was pleased that Secretary of State Clinton recently offered her \ngeneral endorsement of this legislation.\n  This bill would achieve three major objectives. No. 1, enhance \ncoordination within the U.S. Government so that USAID, the Agriculture \nDepartment, and other entities are not working at cross-purposes. We do \nthat by establishing a new position, a special coordinator for food \nsecurity, in the White House who would report directly to the President \nand would forge a comprehensive U.S. food security strategy.\n  No. 2, the bill expands U.S. investment in the agricultural \nproductivity of developing nations so that nations facing escalating \nfood prices can rely on emergency food assistance and instead take \nsteps to expand their own crop production. A leading agricultural \nexpert recently estimated that every dollar invested in agricultural \nR generates $9 worth of food in the developing world.\n  I am grateful to Senator Lugar for his bold proposal by the acronym \nHECTARE to establish a network of universities around the world to \ncooperate on agricultural research.\n  No. 3, the bill would modernize our system of emergency food \nassistance so that it is more flexible and can provide aid on short \nnotice. We do this by authorizing a new $500 million fund for U.S. \nemergency food assistance.\n  This bill has been worked on and marked up in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and reported out. I am working with Senator Lugar to bring \nthis legislation to the floor so the full Senate can take it up and \npass it.\n  We should not wait--as I said about health care earlier--we should \nnot wait for another massive food crisis such as the one that hit the \nworld last summer, before taking action on this legislation. Global \nfood security is not only a humanitarian issue, of course--and that is \nof immense proportions--but it is also a national and international \nsecurity issue. Hunger breeds instability, and instability can set the \nstage for failed states.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, there are many things going on in the \nCapitol today. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I left \nthe confirmation hearing of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's \nnominee to the Supreme Court. I believe this is her fourth day of \nhearings before the committee. It appears we will be able to wrap up \ntoday or perhaps tomorrow.\n  I think she has done an extraordinarily good job. She comes to this \nnomination with a remarkable life story: rising from public housing in \nthe Bronx, NY, losing her father when she was 9 years old, being raised \nby a determined and capable mother, a brother who became a doctor. She \nwent on to law school after academic success in an Ivy League \ninstitution, and now has served for 17 years on the Federal bench.\n  We have many good witnesses before the Judiciary Committee, but I \nthink she has set a high standard in terms of answering questions with \na clear understanding of the law and a clear understanding of her \nresponsibility if she is given this awesome assignment of serving on \nthe highest Court in the land.\n  I cannot help but watch at these hearings as her family sits through \nhour after weary hour of Senators' questions. They are clearly in her \ncorner and cheering her on; her mother, nodding in agreement when her \ndaughter tells of their life story; others there in testimony to her \nwonderful life, her professional life as an attorney and judge.\n  I hope the Senate will bring her nomination before us in a timely \nfashion so that if she is approved--and I believe she will be approved \nby the Senate--she can cross the street to the U.S. Supreme Court and \nbe there in September to make certain that the Court has a full \ncomplement of Justices to consider important cases.\n  At the same time on the floor, we have the Defense authorization \nbill, an annual exercise to authorize important expenditures for our \nnational defense. There is a pending amendment relative to hate crimes, \nas to whether there will be a Federal cause of action against those who \nare guilty of physically assaulting and hurting people because of their \nsexual orientation, their gender, their race, their ethnic origin.\n  And, of course, there is another major debate underway about the \nfuture of health care in America. I have said that I think this debate \nover health care may be the biggest domestic undertaking of Congress in \nits history. In sheer numbers, the impact of this legislation will \ntouch every single American immediately.\n  We have considered big issues in the past, issues such as Social \nSecurity, but that was a program, when it was conceived and passed, \nthat would affect senior citizens at a later date and only a few people \ninitially. It was passed at a time when few people lived to be age 65, \nthe qualifying age for Social Security. So it was an insurance policy \nfor a small group of Americans. There was a payroll tax imposed on most \nworkers in the country to pay for it.\n  Some 60 years later, President Lyndon Johnson considered the Medicare \nProgram, another far-reaching program which today provides health \ninsurance for 45 million Americans. It, too, is paid for primarily by a \npayroll tax, but it reached retirees. This debate on health care goes \nfar beyond retirees. It affects all of us, every single one of us.\n  There have been so many things said about this debate. Some of the \nthings that have been said at the outset are plain wrong. I was sent an \ne-mail by my brother who lives in California. I don't know the source \nof this e-mail, but it is one with wide subscription. It was loaded \nwith mistakes and errors, suggesting that Members of Congress have some \nelite health care policies that pay for things ordinary Americans could \nnever consider.\n  For the record, speaking for myself and most Members of Congress, we \nare under exactly the same health care plan as 8 million Federal \nemployees and their families. But make no mistake, it is a good one. \nBecause we have such a good bargaining pool, for over 40 years, private \ninsurance companies have been anxious to get in and offer health \ninsurance to not only Members of Congress but virtually every other \nFederal employee. It is a plan that engages us with private health \ninsurance companies. My wife and I can choose from nine different \nprivate health insurance companies that offer coverage to residents of \nIllinois who are Federal employees. We can pick a plan that has limited \ncoverage or one that has more coverage. My payroll deduction depends on \nthe type of plan I choose.\n  The good news is once a year there is open enrollment. If I don't \nlike the way I have been treated in the plan, I can move to a different \ncompany that might give me different benefits or better coverage. Every \nAmerican should be so lucky as every Federal employee and Members of \nCongress. But we don't have an elite plan.\n  Other things that have been said are plain wrong. Members of Congress \ndo not pay into Social Security. I can tell you when I was elected in \n1982, in the House of Representatives, that was a fact. That was \nquickly changed within a year so that Members of Congress do pay into \nSocial Security, as most Americans do today. These are all things that \nneed to be set aside, and we need to get to the heart of the issue.\n  I listened as Republican Senators have come to the floor and talked \nabout this health care debate. I cannot for the life of me understand \nhow most of these Senators feel about the issue of health care.\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe we need to change the \ncurrent system. If they have a good health insurance policy, they want \nto keep it, and the law we propose will allow them to do that, but \nthere is a sense that the cost of health insurance is going up too fast \nand you can't earn enough money to keep up with it. Just over the last \nseveral years, the cost of health insurance premiums has risen three \ntimes faster than the wages of Americans. I have heard about it in \nIllinois; others have heard about it as well.\n  Those who want to keep the current system have to answer the most \nbasic question: How will individuals and families and businesses be \nable to afford health insurance if we don't change? How can we deal \nwith the deficits and debt that are being created by these inflated \nhealth care costs? The United States is the most expensive Nation in \nthe world when it comes to health care. We spend, on average, per \nperson more than twice as much as most other countries. Yet we don't \nhave the medical results to point to which demonstrate that money is \nbeing well spent.\n  Some of the Republicans who have come to the floor--for instance, \nSenator McConnell from Kentucky, the Republican leader--talk about the \nfailure of a plan in Maine, a public plan called--I may mispronounce \nthis; I hope I don't--it looks like Dirigo. This Dirigo relied on \nprivate insurance with very few health insurance companies. Maine would \nbenefit from the increased competition provided by a public option that \nwe are talking about in the current national health care reform.\n  I think States across the Nation have done a good job in exploring \ncreative innovations, but there are some limits as to what a State can \ndo on its own, and many are financial. It is not realistic to expect \nthem to solve health care problems State by State. States don't have \nthe access to the financing levers that the Federal Government has. \nThat makes sustainability difficult over the long term. And cost is \ndifficult to control on a State basis. States don't have access to the \nMedicare Program, the largest buyer of health care in America. Medicare \nneeds to be a leader in quality and cost control initiatives if we are \ngoing to make health care affordable. The States have tried to do their \nbest, but without Federal leadership in addressing the skyrocketing \ncosts of health care, the States are in an impossible position.\n  Health care reform isn't going to be easy, but we need to do it. \nFortunately, we have a President--President Obama--who has said this is \nhis highest priority. He is prepared to spend the political capital \nnecessary to make this change, knowing it has been very difficult in \nthe past.\n  What most Americans want to see is a system where you can walk in the \ndoctor's office and not have to fill out the same form over and over \nand over again; a system where doctors give the time to see their \npatients, can make the right diagnosis, and work through the questions \nthat the patient might have; a system where patients aren't surprised \nby a medical bill they thought was covered under their insurance plan \nand ends up not being covered; a current system where doctors don't \nhave to hassle with insurance companies for approval of medically \nnecessary treatment; a system where you are not denied coverage because \nof an illness you had 5 years ago or because of your age; a system \nwhere health care is affordable; where it will cost less and cover \nmore.\n  That is what 85 percent of the American people say they want out of \nthis debate. This is what I would bet even the 77 percent of the \nAmerican people who are satisfied with their health care today want to \nmake sure is guaranteed in the future.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to agree \nwith the idea of the need for change, the need for health care reform. \nSome of them have focused on medical malpractice. I know a little about \nthis. Before I was elected to Congress many years ago, I handled \nmedical malpractice cases as an attorney in Springfield, IL. For a long \ntime, I defended doctors and hospitals. And then, with a new practice, \nI was on the plaintiff side, representing the injured--the patients who \nwere suing the doctors and hospitals. I have seen it from both sides of \nthe table.\n  It is unfortunate when these lawsuits are filed. It is even more \nunfortunate when innocent people have become victims of medical \nnegligence. There are an awful lot of them each year, and we need to do \nmore to reduce the incidence of medical negligence. Many of these \npeople just went to the doctor, did exactly what they were told, and \nended up in a situation where their health was compromised and where \nthey incurred massive health care costs because a mistake was made. \nSometimes it is an innocent mistake, but other times, clear negligence \nand worse on the part of medical providers.\n  Don't get me wrong. I have the highest regard for the medical \nprofession. And if it is my health or the health of someone in my \nfamily or someone I love, I want that doctor, the very best person \nthere, to help, and I want to give them the benefit of the doubt; that \nthey do not work miracles; they can only do the best they can, and I am \nprepared to accept that. In some cases, though, negligence happens. \nMalpractice occurs. Terrible things happen. And to close the courtroom \ndoors to those who are injured and face a lifetime of pain, suffering, \nscars, limitations, disability, and health care costs is fundamentally \nunfair.\n  The Congressional Budget Office thinks that medical malpractice costs \namount to less than 2 percent of health care spending. Government \neconomists estimate that restricting all patients' rights to go to \ncourt would only lower health care costs less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent. \nSo when we talk about changing the health care system, of course let's \nhave a conversation about patient safety and reducing the medical \nerrors and making sure that doctors who are not guilty of malpractice \ndon't face lawsuits that never should have been filed, but let's be \nhonest about it. This is a very small part of the issue.\n  We also need to make sure that a public option is available. Health \ninsurance companies are some of the most profitable companies in \nAmerica. A public option will make sure there is an option, a choice, a \nvoluntary alternative for every American to choose a public option \nplan, a plan that is a not-for-profit, government-oriented plan--such \nas Medicare--that doesn't have high administrative costs, doesn't take \na profit out of what they are charging you, and doesn't have a lot of \ncosts for marketing. That, to me, is a way to guarantee honesty and \nmore competition.\n  We know if we fail to act that many millions of Americans will \ncontinue to have no health insurance, and others will find the cost of \nhealth insurance going up dramatically. The cost today is overwhelming \nfor some Americans.\n  If you went to Wrigley Field last weekend to watch the Cards and Cubs \nplay, there were about 41,000 people seated in the stands. It is a \ngreat rivalry, a terrific baseball rivalry that draws people from St. \nLouis and from Chicago and all points in between. If that attendance at \nthe stadium was representative of America, 2,000 of those 4,000 people \nseated in the stands are currently paying health care costs of more \nthan 25 percent of their income. That is a back-breaking number. And we \nhave to understand that the costs keep going up, beyond the reach of a \nlot of good people who are trying hard to provide the most basic health \ncare for their families.\n  I notice that my colleague is here from the State of Delaware, and I \nam going to yield in 1 moment, but I wish to say before I yield that we \nhave a chance here. Some of the Members of the Senate are going to see \nthese bills coming out of committees and say, this isn't the bill I \nwould write; in fact, there are parts of this bill I don't like at all. \nI am sure that is the case for me, too. I know what I would like to \nwrite. But I understand the process too.\n  I also understand one other thing. This may be the last time in the \npolitical careers of every Senator on the floor that we can honestly \ntake on this health care issue. If we don't do it in a bipartisan \nfashion, if we don't follow the guidance of those who are telling us \nthis current system is unsustainable, there may never be another \nchance. I urge my colleagues, even if you disagree with some of the key \nelements of the bill coming out of one committee or the other, keep the \nprocess moving forward. Let us work together, debate the issues, vote \non the\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\namendments, and keep the process moving forward. At the end of the day, \nif we end up emptyhanded, it will be a great loss for America. We will \nhave to come back again under even worse circumstances, where there is \na lot more suffering and a lot fewer people with good insurance in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7591-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       In Praise of Jeffrey Knox\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, last week, I spoke about the founding \ngeneration of Americans and the legacy they passed down to us of \nsacrifice and service above self. These are the values that constitute \nthe foundation of our civil service, and it is these values that \nmotivate our Federal employees. It is what drives each of them, each \nday, to perform the small miracles that make the American Government \nwork. Without their dedicated efforts and important contributions, we \ncould not have a government that is responsive and representative. That \nis the birthright the Founders left for us--that the people should be \nrepresented not only by officials they have elected but by civil \nservants entrusted to carry out the people's business.\n  In thinking about these ideas and about the Founders, I cannot help \nbut think of those who risk their safety working as Federal law \nenforcement officers and prosecutors. One such Federal prosecutor is \nJeffrey Knox. As an assistant U.S. Attorney from the Eastern District \nof New York's Violent Crimes and Terrorism Division, Jeffrey is on the \nfront line in both the war on crime and the war on terror.\n  At age 36, Jeffrey has already achieved distinction for prosecuting a \nnumber of important cases. He has become one of the Nation's preeminent \nprosecutors trying suspects in terrorism cases. In his role as head of \nthe Violent Crimes and Terrorism Division, Jeffrey has been a leader in \ninvestigations of terror groups such as al-Qaida, Hamas, and LTTE. His \ncolleagues have praised him for his roll-up-your- sleeves, get-your-\nhands-dirty philosophy, and he has traveled to dangerous hot spots in \npursuit of evidence.\n  One of Jeffrey's landmark cases was the successful investigation, \narrest, and indictment of four suspects who were charged with plotting \nto attack the fuel tanks at JFK Airport. The attack they had planned \nwas intended to be as devastating as September 11. Jeffrey worked \nclosely with the military, the intelligence community, foreign \ngovernments, and local law enforcement agencies in an 18-month-long \ninvestigation.\n  In another high-profile case, he successfully obtained the \nconvictions of a group of conspirators who were attempting to deliver \nmissiles and other weapons to the LTTE in Sri Lanka. He also worked to \nput behind bars an Iraqi translator who stole classified defense \ninformation and passed it to insurgents targeting our troops. Jeffrey \nhas prosecuted violent street gangs in New York City as well.\n  What inspires me most about Jeffrey is that he did not start as a \ncriminal prosecutor. Before September 11, he was a corporate lawyer on \nWall Street. After that terrible day, Jeffrey was motivated to leave \nWall Street and work in the Federal Government as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. When asked why he gave up such a lucrative position on Wall \nStreet for a tough job prosecuting terrorists and gang members, Jeffrey \nsaid:\n\n       If you can put a dangerous individual behind bars so that \n     individual will never have the ability to jeopardize another \n     person's life again, then it's all worth it.\n\n  Jeffrey Knox is just one of many Federal prosecutors and law \nenforcement officials who risk their lives every day to keep Americans \nsafe. The sacrifices they make all too often go unrecognized. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring their service and sacrifices, and I \njoin all Americans in thanking them for the important contribution they \nmake to our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. I am proud to join \nSenator Kennedy as an original cosponsor of this important legislation. \nThis legislation condemns the poisonous message that some human beings \ndeserve to be victimized solely based on their sexual orientation, \ngender, gender identity, or disability.\n  Hate crimes are serious and well-documented problems that remain \ninadequately prosecuted and recognized. Current Federal hate crimes law \naffords important protections against crimes motivated by a person's \nrace, color, religion, or national origin. It fails to protect a \nsignificant number of Americans when victims are targeted based on \ntheir actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, \nor disability. This legislation will expand protection to these groups, \nensuring that all Americans are afforded equal protection under the \nlaw.\n  In addition to recognizing and prosecuting all forms of hate crimes, \nwe must also provide local law enforcement agencies with the requisite \ntools to successfully combat these heinous acts. This legislation \nprovides significant support to local law enforcement agencies across \nthe Nation, including critical technical, forensic, prosecutorial, and \nother assistance to State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials \nfor hate crime investigations and prosecutions.\n  It is essential that we send the message that these crimes will not \nbe condoned. When we fail to prosecute violence driven by hatred and \nprotect Americans' human rights, we risk escalation of such activities.\n  New York State has recently had numerous examples of hate crimes that \nwould be prosecuted under this legislation. Within 3 weeks, three \ncommunities in Queens and Long Island--within an hour's drive--have \nexperienced violent hate crimes targeted at gay, lesbian, and \ntransgender victims. In each instance, the victims were the targets of \nviolent attacks while the assailants communicated homophobic slurs.\n  During one of the incidents in Queens, a transgender female was \nbrutally attacked while walking to her home. As she walked down her \nresidential block, she was repeatedly taunted by two men who only ended \ntheir taunting with homophobic slurs so they could focus on beating her \nwith a metal belt buckle. Her anguished cries for help were met with \nlaughter as the two men removed all of her clothing and left her naked \nand bleeding in the middle of the street.\n  Unfortunately, this case was not investigated as a hate crime because \ncurrent law does not provide protection for gender identity. This \nvictim, like many others around the Nation, was a target of violence \nbecause of who she was. This must end.\n  In 2007, there were 500 such incidents in New York State alone. This \nis a reflection of a larger national trend where we see that the number \nof documented hate crimes is on the rise. In 1991, the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation began collecting hate crimes statistics, and since \nthen the number of reported crimes motivated by sexual orientation has \nmore than tripled.\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n  This legislation, which has received bipartisan support before, is \nsupported by more than 300 civil rights, law enforcement, and civil and \nreligious organizations in addition to the vast majority of the \nAmerican people. It is important we ensure that all Americans and all \nStates are covered under this comprehensive hate crimes legislation.\n  There is some concern this bill would impact the first amendment. It \ndoes not. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 covers \nonly violent acts or attempted violent acts that result in death or \nbodily injury. It does not prohibit or punish speech, expression, or \nassociation in any way. Thoughts and speech are explicitly protected in \nthis bill. This bill is not infringing upon freedom of speech. It is \nabout safeguarding Americans' human rights and equal justice.\n  As Dr. Martin Luther King once said, ``injustice anywhere is the \nthreat to justice everywhere.''\n  I strongly believe freedom and equality are inalienable American \nrights and should not be ascribed based on gender or race, religion or \nsexual orientation or gender identity. This legislation is an important \nstep toward expanding human dignity and respect for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, although I have been an active participant \nin the Judiciary Committee's Sotomayor confirmation hearings, I have \nfollowed with great interest the floor debate on continuing the \nproduction of the F-22A Raptor.\n  Unfortunately, over the years I have heard a number of incorrect \nassertions made about this aircraft, and I have tried to correct them. \nBut after listening to this week's debate and reading misleading \narticles, especially in the Washington Post, about the F-22's \nperformance and capabilities, I believe the Raptor's opponents have hit \nbottom--and have begun to dig.\n  Therefore, I would like to set the record straight about the F-22 and \nits extraordinary war-winning capabilities.\n  Fact No. 1: The F-22 is, and will continue to be, the preeminent \nfighter/bomber for the next 40 years.\n  The F-22 is the stealthiest aircraft flying today. Unlike the F-117 \nNighthawk and the B-2 bomber the F-22s can be deployed on stealth \nflight operations not just at night, but 24 hours a day. This one-of-a-\nkind capability provides our combatant commanders with unprecedented \nflexibility to engage ground and air targets at a time of their \nchoosing--thus denying any respite to the enemy.\n  The Raptor is equipped with supercruise engines that are unique \nbecause they do not need to go to after-burner to achieve supersonic \nflight. This provides the F-22 with a strategic advantage by enabling \nsupersonic speeds to be maintained for a far greater length of time. By \ncomparison, all other fighters require their engines to go to after-\nburner to achieve supersonic speeds, thus consuming a tremendous amount \nof fuel and greatly limiting their range.\n  The F-22 is the deadliest fighter flying today. During a recent \nmilitary exercise in Alaska, the Raptor dispatched 144 adversaries \nversus the loss of only one aircraft.\n  Further advantage resides in the F-22's radar and avionics. When \nentering hostile airspace, the F-22's sensor-fused avionics can detect \nand engage enemy aircraft and surface threats far before an enemy can \nhope to engage the F-22. At the same time, its advanced sensors enable \nthe F-22 to be a forward-surveillance platform capable of gathering \ncrucial intelligence on the enemy.\n  Often overlooked, the F-22 is a very capable bomber. It can carry two \nGPS-guided, 1,000-pound joint direct attack munition bombs or eight \nsmall-diameter bombers.\n  Fact No. 2: The F-22 is not a Cold War dinosaur. It is designed to \nmeet and eliminate the threats of today and tomorrow.\n  As the longest-serving member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \nknow full well the greatest air threat of today and tomorrow is, and \nwill continue to be, the advanced integrated air defense system.\n  Such a system is composed of two parts. The first component is \nadvanced surface-to-air missile systems such as the Russian-made S-300, \nwhich has a range of over 100 miles. The second are highly maneuverable \nand sophisticated fighters like the Su-30, which have been sold to \nChina and India. Coupled together, these anti-access systems make \npenetrating hostile airspace extremely difficult, if not deadly, for \nthose aircraft lacking the F-22's advanced stealth technology and \nsustained supersonic speeds made possible by its supercruise engine. It \nis also important to remember the mainstays of our aerial fleet, the F-\n15, F-16 and F/A-18, are not stealth aircraft and are not equipped with \nsupercruise engines.\n  Unfortunately, integrated air defense systems are relatively \ninexpensive, placing them within the purchasing potential of nations \nsuch as Iran with its seeming insistence on developing nuclear weapons.\n  The advanced integrated air defense system is exactly the threat the \nF-22 was designed to neutralize. In addition, the F-22 will almost \nsimultaneously be able to turn its attention to other ground targets \nthat threaten the national security of the U.S. and our allies.\n  In a related argument, some argue the United States should devote \nmore of its military resources toward bolstering its counterinsurgency \ncapabilities.\n  This is a fair point. Unwisely, the United States did permit its \ncounterinsurgency capabilities to atrophy after the Vietnam war. As \nevents in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown, we continue to pay dearly \nfor that error. However, as we reconstitute our ability to successful \nprosecute counterinsurgency campaigns, we cannot make a similar mistake \nand undermine one of the fundamental foundations of our military \nstrength: hegemony in the air.\n  Even Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this January, ``Our military \nmust be prepared for a full spectrum of operations, including the type \nof combat we're facing in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as large scale \nthreats that we face from places like North Korea and Iran.'' I could \nnot agree more, and the aircraft that will enable our Nation to \ndecisively defeat our adversaries in the air is the F-22.\n  Mr. President, others point out the F-22 has not been deployed in \nsupport of our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is true. \nHowever, there were recent plans to deploy the F-22 to the Persian \nGulf. But according to the July 9, 2008, edition of the widely \nrespected Defense News, the Pentagon overruled those plans, citing \nconcerns about ``strategic dislocation.'' This means the F-22 is hardly \na dinosaur. It is a weapon that can change the balance of power in a \nregion and deter our adversaries.\n  Fact No. 3: 187 F-22s is an insufficient number to meet the minimum \nrequirements of our national military strategy.\n  Our Nation's military requirements are decided upon in detailed \nstudies of the threats our Nation and its allies confront. These \nstudies also recommend force structures to deter and, if necessary, \ndefeat threats to our national security. Accordingly, the Department of \nDefense and the Air Force have conducted a number of studies to \ndetermine how many F-22s are required to meet our national military \nstrategy.\n  I am unaware of any comprehensive study that has concluded F-22 \nproduction should cease at 187 aircraft. Specifically, unclassified \nexcerpts from the Air Force's sustaining air dominance study stated \n``180 F-22s was not enough,'' and the Department of Defense TACAIR \noptimization study concluded the procurement of additional Raptors \n``was the best option.'' On April 16, these conclusions were reinforced \nby comments made by GEN Norton A. Schwartz, the Chief of Staff of the \nAir Force, after the F-22 procurement termination was announced. \nGeneral Schwartz stated, ``243 [Raptors] is the military requirement.''\n  Opponents of the Raptor will most likely dispute this, pointing to \ncomments made by General Cartwright during his July 9 testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nDuring his testimony the general stated the decision to terminate \nproduction of the F-22 is supported by a ``study in the Joint staff \nthat we just completed and partnered with the Air Force.'' However, my \nstaff has inquired about this study and was informed a recently \ncompleted comprehensive, analytic study does not exist.\n\n  No doubt, the Joint Staff has prepared some justification for F-22 \ntermination.Yet I believe it is only natural to question the \nobjectivity of any assessment which justifies previously reached \ndecisions.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday, my suspicions about this so-called analysis \nwere proven correct when Geoffrey Morrell, the Pentagon's press \nsecretary, stated General Cartwright was referring to ``not so much a \nstudy [as a] work product.''\n  Therefore, I believe the Congress should place great significance on \nthe June 9 letter by GEN John Corley, the commander of air combat \ncommand, who stated ``at Air Combat Command we have a need for 381 F-\n22s to deliver a tailored package of air superiority to our Combatant \nCommanders and provide a potent, globally arrayed, asymmetric deterrent \nagainst potential adversaries. In my opinion, a fleet of 187 F-22s puts \nexecution of our current national military strategy at high risk in the \nnear to mid-term. To my knowledge, there are no studies that \ndemonstrate 187 F-22s are adequate to support our national military \nstrategy.''\n  I believe these are important words from the four-star general who is \nresponsible for the Air Force command which is the primary provider of \ncombat airpower to America's war-fighting commands.\n  Fact No. 4: The Washington Post article that alleged technical and \nmaintenance difficulties of the F-22 was misleading and inaccurate.\n  In fact, the Air Force has written two rebuttals to this article. \nAfter viewing the first rebuttal, I found it striking the Air Force \nstated six of the points made in the article were false, four were \nmisleading, and two were not true.\n  Specifically, the primary assertion made by the Post was the F-22 \ncost far more per hour to fly than the aircraft it is replacing, the F-\n15. However, this is misleading. Only when you include all of the one-\ntime costs that are associated with a new military aircraft is this \ntrue. A far more accurate measurement is to compare variable flying \nhours. The F-22 costs $19,750 per hour to fly versus $17,465 for the F-\n15. The F-15 costs less to fly, but the 1960s-designed F-15 does not \nhave nearly the capabilities of the F-22.\n  The article asserts the F-22 has only a 55-percent availability rate \nfor ``guarding U.S. airspace.'' This is misleading. Overall, the F-22 \nboasts a 70-percent availability rate, and that has been increasing \nevery year over the past 4 years.\n  Finally, the article states the F-22 requires significant \nmaintenance. This is true. But the Post article misses the critical \npoint: the F-22 is a stealth aircraft. Making an aircraft disappear \nfrom radar is not accomplished through magic. It is achieved through \nprecise preparation and exacting attention to detail.\n  I believe we can all agree it is far better to expend man hours to \nprepare an airplane that will win wars than to buy replacement aircraft \nafter they have been shot down, not to mention the moral cost of not \nexposing our pilots to unnecessary dangers.\n  Fact No. 5: The F-22's detractors argue erroneously that the Raptor's \nrole can be filled by the F-35, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter. \nBut the Raptor and the Joint Strike Fighter were designed to complement \neach other, not be substituted for each other. The F-22 is the NASCAR \nracer of this air-dominance team. Fast and unseen, the Raptor will \npunch a hole in an enemy's defenses, quickly dispatching any challenger \nin the air and striking at the most important ground targets. The Joint \nStrike Fighter is the rugged SUV of the team. Impressive, but not as \nmaneuverable or capable of sustained supersonic speeds, the F-35 will \nexploit the hole opened by the F-22 and attack additional targets and \ndirectly support our ground forces. This is not to say the F-35 is not \na highly capable stealthy aircraft. But the F-35's role is to \nsupplement the F-22, not substitute for it. Only by utilizing the \nstrengths of both aircraft do we ensure air dominance for the next 40 \nyears.\n  Fact No. 6: Our allies recognize the critical capabilities of the F-\n22 and are eager to purchase the aircraft.\n  This is one of the most compelling reasons for purchasing additional \nnumbers of F-22s. The Japanese and Australian governments have \nconsistently approached our government about purchasing the Raptor for \nthemselves. If the F-22 is such a boondoggle, why would these nations \nbe willing to spend billions of dollars to purchase them. Australia \nalready plans to purchase up to 100 F-35s. Why does it need the Raptor? \nPerhaps it is because these nations realize a number of the threats to \ntheir security can only be defeated using the F-22 Raptor.\n  In conclusion, we have an opportunity to ensure this and future \ngenerations continue to benefit from one of the foundations of our \nnational security: the ability to defeat any air threat and strike any \ntarget anywhere in the world. The world is changing; threats are \ngrowing. Today we have an opportunity to ensure those air threats are \nmet.\n  To be honest with you, our young men and women who fly deserve the \nvery best equipment we can give to them, not equipment that is getting \nold, outmoded, and cannot do the job.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against the Levin-McCain \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johanns pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n212 are located in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions'').\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, yesterday was a wonderful day for this \ninstitution but, more importantly, it was a spectacular day for \nhundreds of millions of Americans who are concerned about our health \ncare system. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \ncompleted the markup of its health care reform legislation. The first \nrule of thumb was that if you are satisfied with the health insurance \nyou have today, you can stay in it. The whole point of health reform is \nto reduce health care costs and expand access to quality care for all \nAmericans.\n  Earlier this week, the HELP Committee had a historic opportunity to \ncut costs for millions of Americans by creating a commonsense pathway \nfor generic versions of what are called biologic drugs. Biologic drugs \nare live cells, unlike the more old-fashioned but still very, very \ncommon chemical drugs that are made and that we have known of for many \nyears. Biologic drugs treat cancer, Parkinson's, diabetes, arthritis, \nrheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, and other serious conditions.\n  Earlier this week, the HELP Committee could have limited what are \ncalled around here exclusivity rights--better known as monopoly \nrights--could have limited monopoly rights for biologics to 7 years \ninstead of enabling that monopoly for 12 years. Earlier this week in \nthe committee, consumers lost and the biotech industry won. How can we \nimprove access to health care if people cannot afford their biologic \ndrugs? How can we reduce costs if we don't inject competition into the \nmarketplace, if we grant monopolies and\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nblock any competitors from coming in and competing for these drugs? \nDuring the debate, we heard a lot of numbers on how many years the big \ndrug companies should have unchecked monopolies. We heard it should be \n13 years or one of them was 13\\1/2\\ years or 12 years or 10 years. I \nwanted 5 years or maybe 7 years at the most.\n  Let me include some other numbers as we debate the minutia of health \ncare reform. Let me include some other numbers that are too often yet \nsometimes deliberately overlooked.\n  Some 190,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. \nHerceptin is the brand-name biologic that treats breast cancer. It \ncosts $48,000 a year. That is $1,000 a week. If you are lucky enough to \nhave insurance, you might get part of this paid for, but you probably \nhave a 20 percent copay, so then it is $200 a week. That is if you are \nlucky. If you are not so lucky, you simply can't afford it.\n  More than 1.3 million Americans live with rheumatoid arthritis. \nRemicade is the brand-name biologic that treats rheumatoid arthritis. \nIt costs $20,000 a year. If you are lucky enough to have insurance, you \nare probably paying a 20 percent copay. That would be $4,000 a year \njust for the biologic drug for your treatment--not counting lost work, \nnot counting paying doctors' bills, not counting trips to the hospital, \nnot counting tests. That is $4,000 a year for that drug, if you are \nlucky enough to have insurance.\n  This year, more than 148,000 people will be diagnosed with colon \ncancer. Avastin is the brand-name biologic that treats colon cancer and \ncosts $100,000 a year, which is $2,000 a week. So if you are lucky \nenough to have insurance, you pay a copay of $400 per week, which is an \nawful lot of money.\n  To put these numbers in perspective, the average annual household \nincome in Ohio is $46,000. So when you look at these drugs--one I \nmentioned, Herceptin, is $1,000 a week; Remicade for rheumatoid \narthritis is $20,000 a year; Avastin for colon cancer is $100,000 a \nyear, $2,000 a week--again, if you are lucky enough to have insurance, \nyour 20-percent copay for that $100,000 a year is $20,000, and an \naverage income in Ohio is $46,000.\n  Brand-name biologics, these relatively new kinds of treatments, will \nmake up 50 percent of the pharmaceutical market by the year 2020. The \nprices for most of these drugs are increasing far faster than \ninflation--far faster even than medical inflation--and we know what \nthat is all about--about 9.3 percent each year. The price for biologic \ndrugs for multiple sclerosis increased by 23 percent last year.\n  I remember about a dozen years ago, if you had a family member who \nwas suffering from cancer, we were outraged and just so surprised and \nshocked and upset that Taxol, the chemical cancer drug, in those days \ncost $4,000 a year. We thought that was outrageous, exorbitant, \nunaffordable, out of reach, $4,000 a year. But this cancer drug now is \n$40,000 a year; Herceptin is more than $40,000 a year. So where is the \noutrage now?\n  I understand drug companies need to protect their investment and \ntheir profit. However, many of these biologics that have been developed \ncame initially from research that all of us as taxpayers funded. We \nappropriate every year about $31 billion for the National Institutes of \nHealth, something I fought for when I was in the House. I was part of \nthe group that doubled funding for NIH, in those days, from about $12 \nbillion to $25 billion a year. It was a wonderful investment. As we \ninvest in these drugs, invest in this research that is the foundation \nfor these drugs, it is a good thing. Then these companies, at their \nexpense and at their risk, develop them into wonderful medicines and \nmedication. But after building their foundation on taxpayer research, \nthey are charging this much for these biologics, and even if you are \nlucky enough to have insurance, you simply can't afford them. So I want \nthese drug companies to protect their investment and their profit, but \nwe can't give companies open-ended protection from competition.\n  The committee voted earlier this week to grant 12 years of monopoly. \nOrphan drugs get a 7-year monopoly protection. Standard drugs, which \nhave been wonderful for so many people in this country--very important, \nvery complicated drugs; pretty much as complicated as these biologic \ndrugs--get 5 years of monopoly protection. So orphan drugs get 7 years, \nstandard drugs get 5 years. Other products on the market that have \npatents, as these do, and have those protections don't get additional \nmonopoly protections. But this committee this week--I thought \noutrageously so--gave 12 years of monopoly protection. That is \nunacceptable to many of us. President Obama says it should be 7 years. \nThe AARP says it should be 5 to 7 years.\n  The Federal Trade Commission reported that additional years of \nmonopoly protection actually crimps innovation, that giving these extra \nyears of monopoly protection actually hinders innovation. I would argue \nthat this monopoly protection harms innovation because it discourages \nbiotechs from searching for new revenues.\n  Let me give an example. If a drug company produces a biologic that \ncan matter a lot in an important treatment and they got a 12-year \nmonopoly protection and consider that the biologic might be \nadministered by injection in a doctor's office; that those same \nscientists who have created that biologic that you inject, after 5 or 6 \nyears, come up with a new way to do it, to take it by aerosol. \nEverybody I know would rather do that than stick a needle in their arm \nevery day or so, however often they need the treatment. But do you know \nwhat. That new innovation is not going to come until the 12 years are \nup.\n  That is why the committee erred so extravagantly when it gave 12 \nyears of monopoly protection to the drug industry. It hinders \ninnovation. That means patients are going to keep getting the shot \nevery day for 12 years. They will have to wait until the 12 years are \nup before they introduce the new aerosol way of administering this \ndrug. If there had been for 4, 5, 6, or 7 years, they would have \nbrought that new drug on the market much quicker.\n  The only argument that the biotechs' allies on the HELP Committee \nused was simple: This hurts innovation.\n  It only hurts their profits. It clearly doesn't help innovation. The \nonly study put forward, other than a study from PhRMA, the big drug \ncompany lobbyist or study from biologic companies--and many are the \nsame companies--other than their studies, the only one out there was a \nFederal Trade Commission study on this 12 years. What good are these \nbiologics if nobody can afford them?\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act, which introduced generic versions of chemical \ndrugs, has proved we can still lead the world in biologic innovation \nwith competition from generics. Twenty-five years ago, the drug \nindustry said the same line they are using now--that there is no way we \nwill innovate, and this will put them out of business.\n  Patients in Akron, Bowling Green, Chillicothe, and Dayton understood \nthat this law from 25 years ago worked to keep prices down. Those same \npeople around my State, people in Xenia, Springfield, Mansfield, and \nPortsmouth need that same access to generic versions of these \nbiologics.\n  The vote this week was not in the best interests of patients \nsuffering from multiple sclerosis, arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer's or \nheart disease. It was not in the best interest of taxpayers. Who is \npaying the bill? Either people are paying out of their pockets--and \nmost cannot afford it--and insurance companies are going to raise rates \nto employers and to patients or the taxpayers are going to pay for it. \nThe beneficiaries are not patients. It hurts innovation. The \nbeneficiaries are the drug executives and the biologic company \nexecutives. It is not in the best interest of taxpayers. An article in \nRoll Call today or yesterday pretty much said that biologic industry--\nthey spent $500,000 in ads in the last few days. The health care \nindustry spends a million dollars a day lobbying, and they were rather \nsuccessful in what they did.\n  I am proud to have been part of the historic health debate that \npassed a bill as good as we passed. I am also proud to have been part \nof this debate that continues to talk and educate the people on \nbiologics.\n  Clearly, the fight for affordable generic drugs is not over. I will \nfight and do whatever is best for taxpayers and patients, and that \nmeans a continued effort to make this law work, as Hatch-Waxman worked \nfor so many Americans.\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\n  I will fight for the breast cancer patient who has to spend $1,000 a \nweek for biologic Herceptin or the colon cancer patient who spends \n$2,000 a week or the person with rheumatoid arthritis who spends $2,000 \na month for medicine they desperately need.\n  I applaud groups such as AARP that put families and consumers first. \nI look forward to working with Members in the House and Senate and the \nadministration who are fighting for what is right.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise because of a document our \nforefathers signed 233 years ago, the Declaration of Independence. \nSpecifically, the Declaration stated:\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  That simple phrase created the bedrock foundation for a nation \nfounded under equality under the law, freedom from persecution, and the \npursuit of happiness by our citizens--government by and for the people \nunder the concept of quality and freedom from persecution.\n  It is an honor to rise to advocate for that philosophy.\n  I rise in strong support of the Leahy amendment that would amend the \nDepartment of Defense bill to include the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act of 2009. First, I thank and acknowledge Senator Kennedy \nfor his strong decade-long commitment to this legislation. I extend my \nappreciation to Senator Leahy for leading this effort in Senator \nKennedy's absence.\n  It has been more than 10 years since Matthew Shepard was brutally \nmurdered simply because of his sexual orientation. It is long past time \nthat we take action to strengthen the Federal Government's ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. There is no room in our society \nfor these acts of prejudice. Hate crimes fragment and isolate our \ncommunities, and they tear at our collective spirit. They seek to \nterrorize our society through brutal violence against targeted \nindividuals. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a \ncritical step to protect those who are victimized simply for who they \nare.\n  Hate crimes legislation is not a new concept. In fact, the United \nStates of America has had hate crime laws in place for 40 years. The \nHate Crimes Act of 1969 was passed shortly after the assassination of \nMartin Luther King. That assassination motivated Congress to action.\n  That law says it is illegal to ``willfully injure, intimidate or \ninterfere with any person, or attempt to do so, by force or threat of \nforce, because of that other person's race, color, religion or national \norigin.''\n  That hate crimes law was passed by our parents' generation to address \nthe hate crimes so evident through the assassination of Martin Luther \nKing and so many other actions in the 1960s.\n  Now it is time for our generation to pass a hate crimes bill that \nwill strengthen the work done by our forefathers 40 years ago and that \nwill address new forms of hate crimes that have become far too \nprevalent in our society. We need to add provisions to prosecute those \nwho commit violent acts based on gender, gender identity, disability, \nand sexual orientation.\n  Of the 7,624 single-bias incidents reported in 2007, more than 16 \npercent resulted from sexual orientation bias, indicating that members \nof the gay and lesbian community are victimized nearly six times more \nfrequently than an average citizen.\n  Just this past spring, we experienced a terrible incident in my home \nState. In March, two men, Samson Deal and Kevin Petterson, were \nvisiting the Oregon coast during their spring break. They wandered away \nfrom an evening campfire and ran into a group of four strangers who \nasked if they were gay and then called them derogatory names. Then \nthese two men were beaten brutally and left unconscious on the beach. \nThis was in the town of Seaside, a place I have visited many times in \nmy life, a beach I have walked on many times in my life. Seaside police \nchief Bob Gross said the Seaside police have ``had some hate crimes \nbefore, mostly threats, but have never dealt with anything this \nserious.''\n  I am happy to report that Samson and Kevin lived through this \nincident, but many do not. The attack could have been worse. According \nto the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 2007 saw the \ngreatest number of anti-LGBT murders in 8 years: 21 gay and transgender \npeople were murdered in the United States in 2007--more than double the \nnumber of 2006.\n  Currently, only 11 States and the District of Columbia include laws \ncovering gender-identity-based crimes. We must make sure gender \nidentity is a protected characteristic included in this legislation.\n  But members of the gay community are not the only victims. We were \nall shocked last month when Stephen Johns, a guard at the Holocaust \nMuseum, was shot and killed by a White supremacist. Recent numbers \nsuggest hate crimes against individuals in the Hispanic community \nincreased by a staggering 40 percent between 2003 and 2007.\n  According to a recent report from the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights Education Fund, in the nearly 20 years since the enactment of \nthe Hate Crimes Statistics Act, the number of hate crimes has hovered \naround 7,500 annually, nearly one every single hour. As if that figure \nis not high enough, it is well known that data collected on hate crimes \nalmost certainly understates the true numbers because victims are often \nafraid to report these crimes or local authorities do not accurately \nreport the incidents as hate crimes, which, unfortunately, means they \ndo not get reported to the Federal Government.\n  What specifically is in this legislation? It gives the Department of \nJustice the power to investigate and prosecute bias-motivated violence.\n  It provides the Department of Justice with the ability to aid State \nand local jurisdictions.\n  It makes grants available to State and local communities to combat \nviolent crimes.\n  It authorizes the Attorney General to provide technical, forensic, \nprosecutorial, and other assistance to State and local governments.\n  It authorizes grants from the Justice Department of up to $100,000 \nfor State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials who have \nincurred extraordinary expenses in the prosecution or investigation of \nhate crimes.\n  It authorizes the Treasury Department and Justice Department to \nincrease personnel to better prevent and respond to allegations of hate \ncrimes.\n  It requires the FBI to expand their statistic gathering so we can \nbetter understand the types and structures of hate crimes in the United \nStates of America.\n  These provisions will strengthen the original facets of the \nlegislation from 1969. That legislation, as I noted, addressed issues \nrelated to race, color, religion, or national origin. All of that is \nimproved in this legislation.\n  In addition, we expand this legislation to address the hate crimes we \nnow see so prevalent in the LGBT community as victims.\n  Our Constitution laid out a vision. We did not have complete equality \nunder that vision in 1776. Indeed, it was a vision far ahead of its \ntime. We have gradually worked toward it. We have extended our law to \nprotect women, to include more folks to vote, to enable people to get \nrid of the racial boundaries that existed for voting, and so on. We \nhave steadily sought to take strides toward that vision of equality \nunder the law and the ability to pursue happiness without the fear of \npersecution. Today I am advocating that we take another important \nstride toward that vision our forefathers laid out before us.\n  Martin Luther King said the long arc of history bends toward justice, \nbut it doesn't bend by itself. It is bent by citizens who say this is \nwrong, and we are going to do something about it. This great \nstrengthening of the hate crimes legislation in the United States is a \nhuge stride toward equality under the law and freedom from persecution.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join in taking this historic \nstride forward.\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak in support of five \namendments that I have introduced to the bill before us, the National \nDefense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2010. Each amendment focuses \non improving the benefits and care for the members of our Nation's \nNational Guard and Reserve forces so that we can improve military \nreadiness and strengthen our efforts to recruit and train quality men \nand women to serve.\n  I know each of us from our States recognizes the tremendous bravery, \ncourage, and the dedication of our National Guard and reservists in \neach of our States. They are part of our community. They certainly, in \nmany instances I know of from our seeing the deployments, are people of \npublic service, but they are also people who are serving their \ncommunities. Whether they are firemen or police officers, maybe they \nare school principals, maybe they have small businesses that hire a \ntremendous number of people in those communities, they are hard-working \nAmericans who also find time to serve their country. They are \ndedicated, they are brave, and we certainly know the critical role they \nplay.\n  It is a reality that our military is relying increasingly upon our \nreserve components as an operational reserve, not just simply a \nstrategic reserve. My amendments reflect that reality by taking needed \nsteps to honor the increased service and invest in these men and women \nwho give so much on our behalf. When duty called, they stepped up to \nthe plate, and now it is time for Congress to do the same.\n  My first amendment is identical to the Selected Reserve Continuum of \nCare Act I introduced in May. This legislation will ensure that \nperiodic health assessments for members of the Guard and Reserve are \nfollowed by government treatment to correct any medical or dental \nreadiness deficiencies that are discovered at those screenings. We know \nwe will begin to see these periodic health assessments, because they \nare mandatory beginning in September, and we need to make sure we \nfollow up on these.\n  As an operational force serving frequent deployments overseas, these \nmen and women require greater access to health care so they are able to \nachieve the readiness standards demanded by current deployment \ncycles. Far too many men and women are declared nondeployable because \nthey have not received the steady medical and dental care they need to \nmaintain their readiness.\n\n  We have all heard the horror stories of the military simply pulling \nsoldiers' teeth and sending them on to Iraq and Afghanistan because \nthey don't have the time to provide adequate dental care to bring them \nup to the medical/dental readiness status necessary in order to be \ndeployed.\n  Now that we are going to have mandatory assessment, there is no \nreason we would not want to provide them the medical care they need in \norder to meet that assessment. This is absolutely unacceptable, that we \nwould not. And it is inexcusable. Considering the sacrifices we are \nasking them to make on our behalf, the least we can do is provide them \nthe care they need to meet the readiness standards we have set. Pulling \ntheir teeth and rushing them to war is simply not going to get it done.\n  This practice itself has become so prevalent, we now have a name for \nthese men and women. They are called pumpkin soldiers. How absolutely \nawful is that? It is awful that it is such a prevalent practice that it \nhas a nickname.\n  Compounding this challenge is the fact that short-notice deployments \noccur regularly within the Reserve Forces. When men and women are \ndeclared nondeployable, it can cause disruption in the unit by \nrequiring last-minute replacements from other units or requiring \ntreatment periods that should be set aside for the predeployment \npreparation and training.\n  Last year, prior to the second deployment of the Arkansas National \nGuard's 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team to Iraq, members from 11 \nunits across our State were pulled to fill out the combat team. Some of \nthese cross-leveled members had as little as 2 or 3 three weeks' notice \nprior to their deployment. They were having to fill in because when it \ncame time, those who were in those units, the regular Guard and Reserve \nwho were there, did not meet the deployable standards, and so \nconsequently we had to pull people from all different units at a late \nnotice to put them in there while these others met that medical and \ndental readiness.\n  My amendment would prevent, in large, all of this from happening in \nthe future by providing the necessary care at the front end of these \nassessments. Instead of compressing treatment costs into a short \npredeployment period or the bottlenecked medical support unit at the \nmobilization station, my amendment would spread the same costs over a \nlonger period, with a more orderly and reliable result.\n  We are having a huge debate right now on health care reform. One of \nthe things we see is that if we can provide prevention or wellness, or \ncertainly make sure that medical care gets there when we first detect \nwhat that medical problem is, the outcome is better and it is usually \nless costly in the overall. The further out from the deployment \nuncorrectable conditions are discovered, the more time a unit will have \nto replace a discharged member and mitigate the effects from that loss. \nSo it is not just the well-being of the soldiers we are looking at, it \nis also the well-being of the unit.\n  We can and should do more to bring our Selected Reserve members into \na constant state of medical readiness for the benefit of the entire \nforce. My amendment does just that. That is why it has been endorsed by \nthe Military Coalition, a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed \nservices and veterans associations representing over 5.5 million \nmembers across this country.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senators Landrieu, Tester, Risch, and \nByrd on this important legislation and thank them for that support and \nrealization of how important, how practical, and how much sense it \nmakes for us to use these assessments to quickly provide the medical \ntreatment that is necessary to ensure our soldiers, when they do \nreceive those orders to be deployed, are meeting the medical and dental \nreadiness they need to meet in order to be deployed.\n  Mr. President, my second amendment calls for an increase in the \nMontgomery GI bill rate for members of the Selected Reserve to keep \npace with their increased service and the rising costs of higher \neducation. I am pleased my friend, Senator Mike Crapo, and I have \njoined in this effort. Mike and I have worked together on so many \ndifferent issues, everything from wildlife to education and certainly \nwith our military, representing States that have large rural areas and \ntherefore large numbers of Guard and Reserve. It has also been endorsed \nby the Military Coalition as well, the group I mentioned earlier.\n  This amendment would simply tie education benefit rates for guardsmen \nand reservists to the national average cost of tuition standard that is \nalready applied to Active-Duty education benefit rates. We have worked \nhard to try to increase the educational benefit to be commensurate with \nthe time these guardsmen and reservists are working on our behalf, who \nare so bravely deploying and working and serving alongside our Active-\nDuty military. The problem is, now that we have increased their access \nto a more commensurate educational benefit, the value of that benefit \nis immediately losing value because they depend on the appropriators \nand us to increase that amount. When it is increasing at half the rate \nof the cost of higher education, then they are getting further and \nfurther behind each year in keeping that commensurate benefit at a rate \nthat makes sense and certainly is adequate for their needs in \neducation. I believe it is absolutely critical that we do this. It \nbuilds upon\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nmy Total Force GI bill, first introduced in 2006, which was designed to \nbetter reflect a comprehensive total force concept that ensures members \nof the Selected Reserve receive the educational benefit more \ncommensurate with their increased service. The final provisions of this \nlegislation became law last year with the signing of the 21st Century \nGI bill. Now it only makes sense that we would maintain that benefit at \na rate, again--just at the rate of increase we are seeing in higher \neducation. It certainly makes sense for our Guard and Reserve.\n  My third amendment would lower the travel reimbursement threshold for \nNational Guard and Reserve members who are traveling for drills from \n100 miles to 50 miles. Our current high threshold has caused undue \nhardships for members of the Selected Reserve, especially those in \nrural areas who often incur significant expenses because they have to \ntravel significant distances. If we cannot ease their burden, I fear we \nare creating significant obstacles to recruiting and retaining men and \nwomen to serve in the Guard and Reserve--particularly during times of \neconomic hardship. We saw the price of gasoline explode last year. We \nknow how difficult it is, particularly for many of our Guard and \nReserve who live in those rural areas. I believe this is a commonsense \nthing we can do on behalf of these brave men and women.\n  I am so very pleased to be joined here by Senators Tester and Wyden \nin offering this amendment. It was among the recommendations of the \nindependent Commission on the National Guard and Reserves. It is \nsupported by numerous military and veterans service organizations. It \nonly makes sense that we would appropriately provide them the \nreimbursement they need and the travel expenses to get to where they \nneed to be for their drills and for their training.\n  My fourth amendment would enable a valuable program, the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program, to expand to new cities and new sites \nand reach even more of our young troubled Americans. Currently \noperating in 22 States, the Youth ChalleNGe Program trains and mentors \nyouth who have dropped out of high school. It puts them on a path to \nbecome more productive, employed, and law-abiding citizens.\n  I recommend to any of my colleagues in this body who have not visited \na National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program to go and visit. I have \nvisited our Youth ChalleNGe Program on more than one occasion and have \nbeen amazed, both at those who have graduated from that program and \ncome back to mentor these other youths--who are disadvantaged, who have \nfound themselves in the court system, have been thrown out of school, \nor are certainly in a troubled nature--and amazed at those who are able \nto come into this environment and to feel the security of the military \nand the rules of the military that prompt them into a sense of pride \nand a sense of courage and a sense of accomplishment so they finish \ntheir education and they go on to do so many great things, so many \nthings that otherwise could have turned sour for these youths.\n  As I said, I encourage any of the Members of this body, if you have \nnever visited one of those National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Programs, I \nreally encourage you to do so.\n  For 22 weeks, these young men and women receive more than 200 hours \nof classroom learning designed to prepare them to take the general \nequivalency diploma exam. I attended the graduation of a class in \nArkansas, and I can attest to the program's positive results.\n  At a time when we know financial insecurity in our country is shaking \nour families, our youth who are finding themselves in, certainly, \ndifferent circumstances than many of us did growing up, with all kinds \nof temptations and distractions and things that can put them on the \nwrong pathway, here we have an opportunity, when they start out on that \nwrong pathway, to grab them and put them into a program that is going \nto continue to build on the positive things they have to offer and set \nthem on a good pathway.\n  Since the inception of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program, \nmore than 85,000 young men and women have graduated from the program \nnationwide, and they have received their high school degrees. Nearly 80 \npercent have gone to college, earned productive jobs, and joined the \nmilitary. Currently, the Department of Defense provides 60 percent of \nthe funding, while States are responsible for the remainder. \nUnfortunately, the current cap on funding has restricted many of our \nStates from establishing additional programs or building on their \nexisting programs.\n  Along with additional funding, this amendment would help jump-start \nthe Youth ChalleNGe Program by fully funding new programs for 2 years \nwhile they get their feet on the ground. When they better understand \nthe tremendous value of this program and, more importantly, how their \nStates can begin to invest in a program such as this, it ensures that \nthe Federal Government's share is 75 percent into the future instead of \nthe current 60 percent that it is right now.\n  This amendment is endorsed by the National Guard Youth Foundation, \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, \nand the National Guard Association of the United States.\n  I am so pleased to be joined by Senators Byrd, Casey, Cornyn, Hagan, \nLandrieu, Murkowski, Risch, Rockefeller, Snowe, Udall of Colorado, and \nWyden in this effort. It is identical to the legislation I have \npreviously introduced which has 32 bipartisan cosponsors. It is a great \nmove, to help our children, particularly our troubled children and, \nmore importantly, it really sends them in the right direction so they \ncan become contributing parts of this great Nation. I encourage my \ncolleagues to look at this amendment and help us get it passed in this \nvery important bill.\n  Mr. President, you have been incredibly patient. I appreciate that \npatience, having to talk about five different amendments, but these are \nissues that are critically important to me and critically important to \nthe people of Arkansas, particularly our Guard and Reserve.\n  My final amendment is an amendment that would grant full veteran \nstatus to members of our Nation's Reserve Forces who have 20 or more \nyears of service. I am joined in this effort by Senator Hutchison of \nTexas. This amendment is endorsed by the Military Coalition, which is \nthe large group, the coalition of military groups.\n  Under current law, members of Reserve components who have completed \n20 or more years of service are considered military retirees. At the \nage of 60, they are eligible for all the benefits received by Active-\nDuty military retirees. Unfortunately, they are denied the full \nstanding and honor that comes with the designation of ``veteran'' if \nthey have not served a qualifying period of Federal Active Duty other \nthan Active-Duty training. As a result, these men and women are \ntechnically not included in various veterans ceremonies and \ninitiatives, such as an effort to have veterans wear their medals on \nVeterans Day or Memorial Day, or in legislation authorizing veterans to \noffer a hand salute during the playing of the national anthem or the \npresentation or posting of the colors.\n  I don't know about you, but when I am at an event at home in \nArkansas--or here as well but certainly at home--when I am surrounded \nby my family of Arkansas people and the flag comes down the parade or \nthe colors are presented, I support making sure everyone who has stood \nup and said ``I am ready to serve my country when it calls on me'' \nshould be given that respect of being noticed as a veteran.\n  My amendment does not seek to change the legal qualifications for \naccess to benefits. Instead, it simply seeks to correct this inequity \nby honoring and recognizing those who have served their country for 20 \nyears or more, those who have said continually over those 20 years: \nWhen my Nation needs me, if my Nation needs me, I will be there. I will \ntake up my arms. I will do what is asked of me as a member of the \nmilitary forces.\n  Those men and women wore the same uniform, were subject to the same \nCode of Military Justice, received the same training, and spent 20 or \nmore years being liable for callup whenever it did happen. This \namendment recognizes their long careers of service and would entitle \nthem to receive proper recognition as a veteran of the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\n  I know of few designations that embody such dignity and honor. These \nmen and women certainly embody those traits, and it is time we grant \nthem the recognition they have earned.\n  I ask my colleagues to give these efforts thoughtful consideration. \nThese five proposals help us keep our promise to these brave men and \nwomen and will help to strengthen recruitment and retention for our \nNational Guard and Reserve and increase their readiness as an operation \nforce in the continued defense of this great Nation that we all love \nand are all so very pleased to be a part of.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2010. First I wish to speak briefly \nabout the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Unfortunately, we \nhave seen far too many cases of these types of crimes of violence \nmotivated strictly by prejudice and hatred of people. This amendment \nwould simply extend the current definition of Federal hate crimes to \ninclude crimes committed on the basis of someone's gender, gender \nidentity, sexual orientation, or disability. This amendment does not \nfederalize all violent hate crimes. Rather, it authorizes the Federal \nGovernment to step in as a backstop, only after the Justice Department \ncertifies that a Federal prosecution is necessary. It also supports \nState and local efforts to prosecute hate crimes by providing Federal \naid to local law enforcement officials. This amendment affirms our \ncommitment to the most basic of American values--the dignity of the \nindividual and the right of that individual to be himself or herself. I \nam pleased to lend my support. That is an issue we will confront in the \ncontext of our armed services bill, and I think we should go forward \nand adopt it.\n  I wish to commend, with respect to the specifics of the armed \nservices bill, my colleagues on the committee for their work, and the \nleadership of Senators Levin and McCain. I hope this is a bill \nPresident Obama can sign. During the committee's markup, I voted \nagainst an amendment to provide funding for additional F-22s and for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine. I remain opposed to these \nprograms. We should not put this bill in jeopardy of a veto, so I urge \nmy colleagues to vote, when it comes to the floor, for the Levin-McCain \namendment to strike the F-22 funding, which I hope will be considered \nsoon.\n  As evidenced by the F-22 issue, this bill is the product of many \ntough decisions. I commend Secretary Gates particularly for his very \njudicious, thoughtful approach to this budget, and his uniformed \ncolleagues. They have thought long and hard about the new world of \nthreats. They have thought long and hard about how we can provide the \nmost necessary resources for our men and women in uniform. They have \nrecommended to us a very sound approach. With certain exceptions, the \nlegislation before us recognizes and accepts those recommendations.\n  The new administration and President Obama have also done a \nremarkable job in terms of trying to change strategic direction, change \nacquisition policies, and to develop a fighting force that will meet \nthe threats of today and prepare ourselves for future possibilities. \nThis Defense authorization bill contains many aspects which are \ncritical to the success of our men and women in uniform. Let me suggest \na few.\n  First, it once again recognizes the extraordinary service and \nsacrifice of these young Americans by authorizing a much needed 3.4 \npercent across-the-board pay raise. The extraordinary sacrifices they \nmake every day can never be compensated by dollars and, indeed, their \nmotivation is not financial. It is to serve the Nation and serve it \nwith courage and fidelity. They do it so well. I have had the privilege \nto travel to Afghanistan and Iraq on numerous occasions and to witness \nthe heroic and decent service of these remarkable people. This pay \nraise reflects, at least in part, the value we place on their service.\n  The legislation fully funds Army readiness and depot maintenance \nprograms to ensure that forces preparing to deploy are properly trained \nand equipped. It also authorizes $27.9 billion for the Defense Health \nProgram and permits special compensation for designated caregivers for \nthe time and assistance they provide to servicemembers with combat-\nrelated catastrophic injuries or illnesses requiring assistance in day \nliving. What we are seeing is success medically on the battlefield, \nwhere the mortality rates relative to the injuries have declined, as \nthey have since World War II. But we have a significant population of \nvery severely wounded young men and women. They need help, and the \ncaregivers need help. This legislation recognizes that.\n  The legislation fully funds the President's budget request of $7.5 \nbillion to train and equip the Afghan National Army and the Afghan \nNational Police forces. The bill also includes a provision that \nemphasizes the need to establish measures of progress for the \nadministration's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan and to report to \nCongress regularly on efforts to achieve progress in that region. I saw \nthe merits of this approach in my recent trip with Senator Kaufman to \nPakistan and Afghanistan in April. In fact, as we observe the increased \ntempo of operations in southern Afghanistan, led by our marines and \nBritish forces, we also recognize the need to partner with more Afghani \npolice and security forces and military forces. Our strategy can't be \njust an American presence. It has to be an American-Afghani presence, \nwhich ultimately will translate to an almost exclusive, if not \nexclusive, Afghan presence. To do that, we have to support the building \nand the professionalization of Afghan security forces.\n  There is within this budget funding for our Navy that is absolutely \ncritical. It includes funding to complete the third Zumwalt class \ndestroyer. This ship is critical to maintaining the technical \nsuperiority of our Navy that it enjoys across the oceans of the world. \nThe future maritime fleet must be adaptable, affordable, survivable, \nflexible, and responsive. The Zumwalt class provides all these \ncharacteristics as a multimission service combatant, tailored for land \nattack and littoral dominance. It will provide an independent presence, \nallow for precision naval gunfire support of joint forces ashore and, \nthrough its advanced sensors, ensure absolute control of the combat \nairspace. All of this capability is based on today's proven and \ndemonstrated technologies. We can't build the same ships we were \nbuilding 20 years ago and hope to maintain our superiority and, indeed, \nhedge against the emerging threats of tomorrow.\n  This Zumwalt technology is also the transition to the next class of \nsurface combatants, which are likely to be a new class of cruisers. The \nhope is that we can leverage what we learn on Zumwalt so that the next \nclass of surface combatants will be even more capable and, we hope, \nextremely cost efficient.\n  I also note that the underlying legislation fully funds the continued \nprocurement of the Virginia class attack submarine. These attack \nsubmarines are on the highest level of demand by area commanders. The \nCINCs, when they are asked what they need in terms of resources, \ninvariably place very close, if not on the top of their list, \nadditional submarines because of their stealth, their ability to \noperate intelligence areas, and their ability to have a forward \npresence without being recognized. These are critical, and I am pleased \nby the recognition of the administration and the committee in this \nregard.\n  This year I was once again extremely fortunate and honored to serve \nas the chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. \nI particularly thank and commend Senator Wicker and his staff. They \nwere true collaborators. Their cooperation was significant in terms of \nimproving the quality of our subcommittee report. We have worked \ntogether very well. I, again, particularly commend and thank Senator \nWicker for his insights, his energy, and for his great collaboration in \nthis effort. The Emerging\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee is responsible for looking at new \nand emerging threats to our security and considering appropriate steps \nwe should take to develop new capabilities to face these threats. In \npreparation for our markup, Senator Levin provided guidelines for the \nwork of the committee including the following two items: Improve the \nability of the Armed Forces to counter nontraditional threats, \nincluding terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nand their means of delivery; and, second, enhance the capability of the \nArmed Forces to conduct counterinsurgency operations.\n  In response, our subcommittee recommended initiatives in a number of \nareas within our jurisdiction. These areas include supporting critical \nnonproliferation programs and other efforts to combat weapons of mass \ndestruction; supporting advances in medical research and technology to \ntreat such modern battlefield conditions as traumatic brain injuries \nand post-traumatic stress disorder; increasing investments in new \nenergy technologies such as fuel cells, hybrid engines, and alternate \nfuels to increase military performance and reduce cost; increasing \ninvestments in advanced manufacturing technologies to strengthen our \ndefense industrial base so that it can rapidly and efficiently produce \nthe materiel needed by the Nation's warfighters; and increasing \ninvestments in research at our Nation's small businesses, government \nlabs, and universities so that we have the most innovative minds in our \ncountry working to enhance our national security.\n\n  Specifically, some notable actions in this bill that originated in \nthe Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee include: authorizing \nfull funding for the Special Operations Command and adding $131.7 \nmillion to meet unfunded equipment requirements identified by the \ncommander of our Special Forces to enable them to conduct \ncounterinsurgency operations and to support ongoing military \noperations; authorizing full funding requested for the Joint IED Defeat \nOrganization, JIEDDO. This is particularly important as we read about \nthe increasing IED attacks against our forces in Afghanistan since our \noffensive began in Helmand Province weeks ago. These IEDs are the No. 1 \nthreat to our forces in the field and our allied forces in the field. \nThis very sophisticated organization uses the information technology, \ninnovation, communication, and new techniques, working closely with \nbattlefield commanders, to protect our forces and our allied forces. \nThey have a critical role and a critical mission. We fully support both \nin this legislation.\n  We authorize the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, providing an \nadditional $10 million for new initiatives outside the former Soviet \nUnion. We provide $3 million for chemical weapons demilitarization in \nRussia and elsewhere, and $7 million for strategic offensive arms \nelimination. We have to recognize that these weapons are distributed \ntoo broadly in many respects, and our efforts to restrict them and to, \nwe hope, dismantle them have to be broad also.\n  We added $50 million to nonproliferation research and development for \nnuclear forensics and other R activities and required the development \nof an interagency forensics and nuclear attribution program. One of the \nhopes--and this must be based on very calculable scientific and \ntechnological research--is that if we can identify the source of a \nnuclear detonation positively, we would have an extraordinarily \npowerful deterrent card which we could use diplomatically to indicate \nthat if any nation, particularly covertly, attempts, directly or \nthrough terrorist groups, to deploy a nuclear weapon anywhere in the \nworld, we could trace it back and respond immediately. That could give \nus, again, an enhanced deterrence. This depends upon the progress we \nmake in research, but we must begin with energy research. We have that \nin the legislation.\n  The bill also highlights the importance of a strong manufacturing \nindustrial base. The bill would create a new position, the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base, to oversee \nthe Department's policies and programs for our Nation's industrial \nbase. Further, the bill increases funding for manufacturing research in \nDOD by roughly $100 million to support the defense industrial base and \nreduce the cost of production of weapons systems and our ability to \nmeet surge requirements demands of operating forces.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the DOD's Small Business Innovation \nResearch program, in coordination with the efforts of Senator Mary \nLandrieu, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship. To support investments in next-generation \ntechnologies and advanced military capabilities, this bill would \nincrease the Department's funding for innovative science and technology \nprograms by over $480 million for a total of $12.1 billion.\n  The bill authorizes the full funding that was requested for chemical \nand biological defense programs and the full amount requested for \nchemical weapons demilitarization in the United States. This funding \ntotals over $3 billion.\n  With regard to counterdrug programs, the bill fully funds DOD drug \ninterdiction and counterdrug activities. It also includes a provision \nthat would extend the authority to use counterdrug funds to support the \nGovernment of Colombia's unified campaign against narcotics cultivation \nand trafficking and against terrorist organizations involved in such \nactivities. It also recommends a $30 million increase in funding for \nhigh priority National Guard counternarcotics programs.\n  This issue of narcotics is particularly central to our efforts in \nAfghanistan. When I was there in April, we were in Helmand Province \nwhich was covered, literally, with opium poppies. The opium trade \nprovides support for opponents of the Taliban. If we disrupt that trade \nand we are able to reduce the flow of resources to the Taliban but also \nprovide legitimate family farmers with the opportunity and the \nprofitability to grow alternate crops, then we can make a successful \ndent in the power and the presence of the Taliban there. These \ncounternarcotics programs, not only in Colombia but also in \nAfghanistan, are absolutely important.\n  This is a good bill. It is, I think, wise legislation, with the \nexceptions I noted. Members of the committee and the committee staff \nhave worked many hours to get this bill to the floor. We are a nation \nengaged in two conflicts and an ongoing struggle in many parts of the \nworld to intercept, interdict, and preempt terrorists. We need to \nsupport our military forces, and I urge my colleagues to work together \nto pass it so we can quickly have a conference with the House and send \nit to the President for his signature.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee is hearing the \ntestimony from the distinguished Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Today I rise in \nstrong support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I believe that while Judge Sotomayor's expansive legal experience \nmakes her a logical choice, it is her background and unique perspective \nthat will make her an ideal selection for a seat on our Nation's \nhighest Court.\n  Certainly no one can argue with Judge Sotomayor's legal \nqualifications. After graduating from Princeton University and Yale Law \nSchool, she served as an assistant district attorney and then had a \nsuccessful legal practice of her own.\n  In 1991, President George H.W. Bush appointed Ms. Sotomayor as the \nfirst Hispanic judge to the U.S. District Court in New York State.\n  Eight years later, President Clinton elevated her to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals, where she serves today.\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\n  Throughout her distinguished career, Judge Sotomayor has been a \nprudent and thoughtful jurist. She has constantly exhibited the highest \nstandards of fairness, equality, and integrity.\n  I was proud to write to President Obama on May 15 urging her \nnomination. However, it is not simply Judge Sotomayor's wealth of legal \nexperience and long public record that make her the best possible \ncandidate for the Supreme Court. Her life story will make her a dynamic \nand thoughtful addition to that august body.\n  Born into relative poverty and raised in a housing project in the \nBronx, young Sonia's childhood was remarkable in that it was \noverwhelmingly normal. She was not a child of privilege. Yet she had \ncome to value her cultural traditions while also embracing the need for \njudicial objectivity and legal impartiality. This delicate balance is \nprecisely what will make her such an important voice on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  As we consider her nomination, we must bear this in mind. When we \nevaluate the makeup of the Court, we seek to build dissent rather than \nconsensus. We seek to engender debate among its members. Diversity--of \nprospective, of background, of opinion--lends legitimacy and integrity \nto judicial rulings.\n  Throughout her career, Sonia Sotomayor has proven herself to be a \nmoderate, restrained judge whose rulings are bound by the weight of \nprecedent. Judgment must remain free from passion, but passion for the \nlaw cannot be lost. Ms. Sotomayor carries with her a lifetime of that \npassion--something I consider a valuable asset.\n  As a Supreme Court Justice, Judge Sotomayor will bring much-needed \ndiversity and a rich understanding of the American dream to every \nopinion she writes. All that she has she has achieved on her own merit, \nand it is this relatable quality that will lend fresh perspective to \nthe Court.\n  I applaud President Obama's nomination of Judge Sotomayor. As her \nconfirmation hearings continue, we must ensure they are tough but fair. \nWe must hold her to the same standard to which we would hold any \nnominee. And just as the Senate has confirmed her twice before, I am \nconfident we will do it once again, with strong bipartisan support this \ntime.\n  It will be an honor for me to cast my vote in favor of her \nconfirmation when the time comes. I look forward to the day when she \ntakes her rightful seat on the bench in the highest Court in our land.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in recent days and weeks, the House of \nRepresentatives has passed legislation sponsored by Congressman Waxman \nand Congressman Markey, called the American Clean Energy and Security \nAct of 2009, that deals with the issue of climate change. And more \nspecifically, it deals with taking steps to decarbonize the energy use \nin this country in order to protect the planet.\n  I support the goals of a low-carbon future by decarbonizing our \nenergy sources to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the \natmosphere. The scientific consensus is that by maintaining our current \ncourse of burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases we are \nthreatening our planet with future warming. So I support the goal of \ntrying to deal with this issue of climate change.\n  The question is, how do we address it? How do we move forward to meet \nthis challenge? The House of Representatives has established one \napproach. I think we need to explore other approaches that still \nachieve the goal of reducing our carbon emissions. This is a very big \nissue with consequences for virtually all Americans--for families, for \nbusinesses, and for our climate.\n  The question for us is: How do we move forward in a way that allows \nus to use our energy resources in a such a way as to protect the \nenvironment and grow the economy?\n  Now, we all wake up in the morning and begin our day taking energy \nfor granted. One of the first things we do, for example, is flick a \nswitch and a light comes on, plug in a hair dryer, or turn on the \ntoaster oven. In so many different ways, virtually everything we do \ninvolves using energy. We get in our cars and drive to work, or we get \non a subway. In both cases, we are using energy. And no doubt about it, \nwe are using a lot of energy.\n  The current Secretary of Energy, Dr. Chu, is a Nobel Prize-winning \nscientist. I once heard him use the following analogy to describe how \nwe use energy today. He talked about going back a couple thousand \nyears. For most of human history, we move no faster than a horse could \ntake us. A couple thousand years ago, if someone wanted to go out and \nfind something to eat, he got on a horse.\n  These days, of course, times have changed. We still use horses, but \nin a different way. We measure the power of our engines in horsepower. \nIf one wants to go get a loaf of bread, then we simply jump in a truck \nand crank up about 270 horses, and away we go to the grocery store.\n  We never think much about the advantage of having energy at our \ncommand at almost any moment, and we certainly don't think--and haven't \nthought very much--about what the use of that energy does to the \nclimate.\n  So here we find ourselves in the year 2009 with what the vast \nmajority of scientists say is a very serious problem for the future of \nthis planet and the security of our civilization. Most of our energy is \nfossil energy. That's the carbon from plants that has accumulated as \ncoal and oil over millions of years. As we burn these fossil fuels to \npower our economy, we release that carbon back into the atmosphere. The \naccumulation of these greenhouse gases warm the planet and cause other \nharmful consequences. Therefore, we need to try to find a way to \ndecarbonize our energy to bring about a low-carbon future, and thereby \nlower our emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.\n  So how do we do that? Well, as I indicated, the House of \nRepresentatives has written a bill, Waxman-Markey. It is a 1,427-page \nbill, and very, very complicated, I might add.\n  Let me describe another path. The Senate Energy Committee worked to \nwrite a new Energy bill. It was completed some weeks ago and passed \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Let me describe just a bit of what we have done in that Energy bill: \nWe included provisions to reduce our dependence on foreign oil; \nincrease domestic production of electricity; electrify and diversify \nour vehicle fleet; create a transmission superhighway so we can produce \nrenewable energy where it is most plentiful, and then put it on the \ntransmission grid to move it to the load centers where it is needed; \nand train our energy workforce of tomorrow.\n  These are just a few of the things we have done. We establish a \nnational renewable energy standard of 15 percent by 2020. And I believe \nthe standard needs to be stronger. But the fact is, this is the first \ntime the Senate has sent a clear signal by demonstrating support for \nsuch a standard. This standard says: We want to maximize the production \nof renewable energy, which means a carbon-free energy source.\n  We are producing green energy when we take energy from the wind, \ngather energy from the Sun, and put that electricity on a transmission \ngrid to send it to where it is needed. This is an essential step to \nbuilding the low-carbon economy we need to address the threat of \nclimate change. And our energy bill does so much more to set the stage \nfor helping address climate change.\n  When we talk about energy, climate is one of the twin challenges that \nwe need to address. With respect to the vulnerability of our country, \nwe must also consider our energy insecurity. It is the case that we \nimport 70 percent of our oil coming from off our shores. We need to put \ninto place an energy policy that will make us less dependent on foreign \noil. One way to reduce our oil dependence is to electrify our vehicles. \nMoving toward an electric drive transportation system has the benefit \nof replacing foreign oil with domestic electricity. Further, as we \ndecarbonize our\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nelectricity generation, we get the additional benefit of reducing the \ngreenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector. Our \nlegislation moves aggressively to promote electrification of our \nvehicles.\n  In addition to producing more renewable energy, the Energy bill \nexpands the production of energy in this country by opening some areas \nthat have not been opened in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas \ndevelopment. As my colleagues know, natural gas is a cleaner-burning \nand lower carbon fossil fuel. We need to increase production of natural \ngas where it is appropriate. So the Energy bill does many things to \nmove toward the low-carbon future we need to ensure the security of our \nplanet and our nation.\n  So I believe we ought to take up the piece of legislation we passed \nin the Energy Committee, bring it to the floor of the Senate, debate \nit, and pass it. I have talked about this at some length in recent \nweeks. I think the Energy bill we have produced is a significant step \ntoward addressing the climate change challenge.\n  So it seems to me it would make sense to do the energy piece first, \nget it to the President, and get it signed. With that progress in \naddressing climate change in the bank, we should then legitimately be \nable to boast about what we have done in a significant way to maximize \nthe production of green energy from wind, solar, and biomass. This \nwould not be an insignificant achievement. I think we ought to do that.\n  Second, I would like to discuss the question of cap and trade or \nWaxman-Markey or some other carbon-constraining piece of legislation \nfor a moment. Clearly, the Senate is going to deal with this issue. My \npreference would be that we not take up the Waxman-Markey bill in its \ncurrent form. I know a lot of work has gone into that legislation, but \nmy preference would be that we start to explore other directions.\n  It is not that I oppose capping carbon. I believe we need to move \ntoward a low-carbon future. I believe we will have to cap emissions of \ncarbon. The question is what are the appropriate targets and timelines \nthat would allow us to mitigate climate change and at the same time, \nprevent a substantial disruption to our economy. We have to be careful \nto avoid creating targets and timelines for reducing CO2 \nemissions that are simply unachievable.\n  We have a lot of people across this country who are doing inventive \nwork--interesting, world-class, cutting-edge research. They are working \nto create the next generation of technologies that could unlock the \nopportunity of capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide, or developing \nways to beneficially reuse CO2. These technologies hold \nthe promise of allowing us to continue to use our abundant fossil fuels \nwhile protecting our environment. I am convinced--absolutely \nconvinced--that we will achieve that goal. The opportunity, through \nresearch, to unlock the mystery of how we separate and capture carbon, \nstore it or reuse it beneficially, is critical, and I am convinced we \nwill do that. I don't think there is much question about that. But what \nI have difficulty with is not the goal. I am for a low-carbon future. I \nbelieve we are going to move in that direction, and I will support that \ngoal.\n\n  I do not support, however, establishing a new trading system for \ncarbon securities, as would be the case under the 400-page cap-and-\ntrade provision of the House bill. Let me describe why.\n  In my judgment, there are better ways to deal with these issues than \nestablishing a very substantial carbon securities trading system. Such \na system is ripe for the biggest investment banks and the biggest hedge \nfunds in the country to sink their teeth into these marketplaces and \nmake massive amounts of money. My profound feeling about this is that \nwe have seen now a decade in which many of these markets have been \nmanipulated and have failed to work at all with respect to the market \nsignals of supply and demand. I have very little interest in consigning \nour low-carbon future to a trading system of carbon securities that \nwill be controlled by the biggest trading companies in the world. And \nit would not be very long before these entities will have created \nderivatives, swaps, synthetic CDOs, and more. It will be a field day \nfor speculation, which I think is not in the interest of this country.\n  Let me just describe something I think might be a harbinger of things \nto come. Here is chart showing how oil prices soared in 2008. We all \nremember what has happened to oil prices in the last two years. They \nwent from $60 a barrel up to $147 a barrel in day trading last July. \nEven as the price of oil was going through the roof, the best experts \nlooking at supply and demand were predicting that the price of oil \nwould only slowly increase over many months. They said: Well, here is \nwhere we think the price of oil is going to be. Straight on across, \nthrough the end of the year. Here is what they suggested in May of \n2007, and here is the price.\n  The fact is, the price of oil shot up like a roman candle. Here is \nwhat they suggested in January 2008. Here is the price they predicted, \nbut the price went up much more quickly. Why is it we have an oil \nfutures market in which supply and demand doesn't determine where the \nprice goes? The price goes right off the chart, and yet supply was up \nand demand was down.\n  So what we saw in the oil futures market last year should be a wake-\nup call. This included speculators engaged in about two-thirds or \nthree-fourths of all the trades. They were trading at 20 to 25 times \nthe amount of oil that is produced every single day, and creating an \norgy of speculation as shown by the red line on this chart--and by the \nway, it went right down like a roller coaster. And the same people who \nmade money going up made money when prices went back down. If we like \nthat sort of thing, we are going to love the carbon market piece in cap \nand trade because we are going to create a big, perhaps trillion-dollar \nmarket for carbon securities. It would not be long before the same \ninvestment banks and hedge funds will all be engaged in trading carbon \nderivatives, swaps, and you name it.\n  I happen to think that makes no sense at all. The New York Times \nsaid: Managing emissions has become one of the fastest growing \nspecialties in financial services. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs \nand Morgan Stanley have rapidly expanded their carbon businesses.\n  I am told, by the way, that most of the large investment banks right \nnow have created carbon trading units.\n  Charlotte Observer: Firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \nalready have carbon desks and teams . . . Peopling those carbon desks \nare the former commodities traders or former securitization or \nstructured finance professionals--like many who've lost jobs at \nWachovia (now Wells Fargo) and Bank of America . . .\n  The New York Times says in a news story: As Congress gears up for a \ndebate on a national ``cap-and-trade'' program to limit greenhouse gas \nemissions, resumes from Wall Street--or from ex-Wall Streeters--are \nflooding into the Nation's few carbon-trading shops.\n  Chris Leeds, the head of emissions trading, carbon trading at Merrell \nLynch, said carbon could become: one of the fastest-growing markets \never, with volumes comparable to credit derivatives inside of a decade.\n  Louis Redshaw, head of Environmental Markets Barclays Capital says: \nCarbon will be the world's biggest commodity market, and it could \nbecome the world's biggest market over all.\n  So do we want to sign up for a future in which we consign our ability \nto constrain carbon and protect this planet by creating a carbon \nsecurities market that, in my judgment, would likely subject us to the \nsame vision of the last decade with unbelievable speculation, movements \nin markets that seem completely disconnected from supply and demand? \nThat is not a future I want to see happen.\n  There are other ways of capping carbon and addressing these issues. I \nwant to be clear, I am for capping carbon. I am for a low-carbon \nfuture, but, in my judgment, those who would bring to the floor of the \nSenate a replication of what has been done in the House, with over 400 \npages describing the cap and ``trade'' piece, will find very little \nfavor from me, and I expect from some others as well. There are better, \nother, and more direct ways to do this to protect our planet.\n  I have been to the floor many times talking about what has happened \nwith credit default swaps, what has happened with CDOs, what has \nhappened\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nwith the oil futures market, on and on and on. If what has happened \ngives anybody confidence, then they are in a deep sleep and just don't \nunderstand it. Again, I come back to the chart I showed a moment ago, \nthe head of emissions trading at Merrill Lynch saying carbon could \nbecome one of the fastest growing markets, with volumes comparable to \ncredit derivatives.\n  Think of this, the unbelievable volumes of credit derivative swaps \nthat most people couldn't even pronounce and didn't know existed, and \nit turns out we had tens of trillions of dollars worth of these things, \nand worldwide these products were supposedly worth hundreds of \ntrillions of dollars.\n  Frankly, I think it is not in the country's interest to establish a \nnew financial market and to have the same players engage in the same \ngames that gamble on this country's future.\n  I think two things: No. 1, there is a piece of energy legislation \nthat is ready to come to the floor, passed by the Energy Committee, \nthat moves in the direction of addressing climate change. We ought to \nget the benefit of that legislation and pass that bill along to the \nPresident for signature. It maximizes renewable energy, and there are a \nlot of things that will dramatically reduce the impact of our carbon \nfootprint.\n  No. 2, those in the Senate who are working very hard and talking \nabout the issue of climate change, and how we can take steps to cap \ncarbon, and what kind of a low-carbon future we might be able to \nachieve. There are some of us--and I speak only for myself--who believe \ncap and ``trade'' in terms of speculative carbon futures markets makes \nno sense. We ought to explore a carbon cap with different approaches.\n  I wanted to raise these concerns at this point, so that those who are \nworking on the climate change bill and attempting to replicate the \nHouse approach will understand that some of us will aggressively resist \nthe carbon market ``trade'' side of cap and trade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask to speak in morning business for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the nomination \nof Judge Sotomayor to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. After \nmuch consideration, I cannot support this nomination.\n  I have been following this process closely. I have been reading her \nrulings and her speeches. I have been watching her hearing at the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I met with her one on one and was able to \nask her questions. Unfortunately, I find her to be unsuitable as a \nmember of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The first problem I would like to discuss is her lack of direct \nanswers to direct questions. I had this problem in my meeting with her \nand it appears from watching the Judiciary Committee hearings that \nother Members have had that problem too. My biggest concern in this \narea is that she answered the questions from the perspective of the job \nshe has, not the job she has been nominated for. As a member of the \ndistrict or circuit court, she must rely heavily on precedent. However, \nas a Justice of the Supreme Court, she is in the position to set \nprecedent. When I asked her simple questions about how she would treat \ncertain subjects, she retreated to saying that she would use precedent \nto decide how to proceed. I found this unsatisfactory because she would \nbe setting precedent as a member of the Supreme Court. In fact, \nthroughout her nomination process I have seen her sidestep direct \nquestions time and time again. We have seen this happen numerous times \nduring her hearing before the Judiciary Committee. I think we deserve \nanswers to these questions and we have not gotten them.\n  However, we can learn about her views and how she might perform on \nthe Supreme Court by studying her record. She has an extensive record, \nwhich includes 17 years as a judge and, prior to that, time spent as a \nprosecutor, in private practice, and as a member of groups such as the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. This gives us much to \nlook at, such as her decisions, speeches, and other sources. I have \nstudied these and I would like to comment on them and her views.\n  When I spoke on the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005, \nI pointed out the problem of the Supreme Court and other judges trying \nto replace Congress and State legislatures. Important social issues \nhave been taken out of the political process and decided by unelected \njudges. I can say with certainty that this was not the way the Founding \nFathers and authors of the Constitution intended for it to work.\n  The creation of law is reserved for elected legislatures, chosen by \nthe people. The Supreme Court is not a nine person legislature created \nto interact with or replace the U.S. Congress. When judges and justices \ntake the law into their own hands and act as if they were a legislative \nbody, it flies in the face of the Constitution. Because of this, \nwhether in the Supreme Court or in lower courts, many people have lost \nrespect for our judicial system. This cannot continue to happen. In \naddition to obvious constitutional concerns, if someday the public and \nthe rest of the political system begin to tune out the courts and \nignore their decisions altogether, it would be grave for our country.\n  During their confirmations, I felt that Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito understood this. That is probably the biggest reason why \nI voted for them. I am afraid that I cannot say the same about Judge \nSotomayor.\n  Much has been said about Judge Sotomayor's ``wise Latina woman'' \ncomments. Even though they have been discussed many times over, they \nare still relevant and speak to her views on the role of judges. In her \ninfamous 2001 speech, she said that ``a wise Latina woman'' would \n``more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male.'' \nThis shows a clear method of her thinking and indicates she accepts the \nidea that personal experiences and emotions influence a judge's \nrulings, rather than the words of the law and the Constitution.\n  She used the ``wise Latina woman'' phrase in at least four other \nspeeches, most recently in 2004. The fact that it was repeated so often \nindicates that she believes it. She has said that the notion of \nimpartiality on the bench is ``an aspiration'' and has gone on to claim \nthat ``by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a \ndisservice both to law and society.'' When President Obama began \ndiscussing what sort of person he wanted to nominate to Supreme Court, \nhe put a premium on the nominee having ``empathy.'' Well, it appears \nthat he got his wish.\n  Empathy in and of itself is not a bad thing. However, in this context \nit means that the law would lose out to a justice who feels an \nemotional pull to rule one way or the other. Empathy belongs best in \nlegislatures, where it can reflect the wishes of the people who voted \nfor the members of those bodies. This is not the job of the Supreme \nCourt, or any other court of law for that matter. I do not have faith \nthat Judge Sotomayor would fully respect the roles of the judiciary and \nthe legislature.\n  While understanding that the role of the Supreme Court is \ninterpreting law instead of making it might be the most important \nquality of a Justice, there will be times when precedent must be set \nand it is crucial that this is done correctly. Now, I understand a \nnominee's hesitancy to discuss a case or issue that might come before \nthem, but I do think they can explain their methods for arriving at a \nconclusion. During the confirmation hearings of Justices Roberts and \nAlito, they were both willing to walk through their decision making \nprocess. However, Judge Sotomayor has been unwilling to do even this. \nIt is unfortunate, but I have no basis to understand how Judge \nSotomayor will think through a case as a member of the highest court in \nthe land.\n  Her views on race, as seen in the Ricci case, are troubling. The city \nof New Haven decided to throw out the results of their firefighter \npromotional exam because they felt that not enough minorities had \npassed it. Many who passed that exam had made great sacrifices to \nprepare for the test, including the lead plaintiff, Frank Ricci, who \novercame a disability to pass it with flying colors. Seventeen White \nand one Hispanic firefighter filed suit that this\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nwas reverse discrimination and Meir case eventually found its way \nbefore Judge Sotomayor at the Second Circuit. She dismissed their \nclaims in a one-paragraph opinion that cited no precedent and was later \nroundly criticized by judges of all stripes. Fortunately, just last \nmonth, the Supreme Court overturned this erroneous decision.\n  Judge Sotomayor also has shown an unacceptable hostility to second \namendment rights. In the recent Heller Supreme Court ruling, it was \nfound that the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and \nbear arms. However, in two cases Judge Sotomayor has lent her name to \nextremely brief opinions that the second amendment is not a fundamental \nright. Her rulings, and the lack of explanation on them, indicate that \nshe is hostile to the second amendment and will not protect it with the \nsame energy as she might for any of the other nine amendments in the \nBill of Rights. She has not stated that she believes a clearly spelled-\nout right, such as the second amendment, is fundamental, but she is \nwilling to recognize that something that is not clearly spelled out, \nsuch as a right to privacy, is fundamental. I fear that her appointment \nto the Supreme Court could undo the progress from the Heller decision \nthat recognizes Americans have the right to defend themselves.\n  Another area of concern is Judge Sotomayor's views on the use of \nforeign law in American courts. Less than 3 months ago, she said she \nbelieves ``that unless American courts are more open to discussing the \nideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, that we are \ngoing to lose influence in the world.'' First of all, the Court's \nresponsibility is to review the laws passed by the government that it \nis a part of, not laws passed by a foreign government. Second of all, \nif there is a foreign law that looks like a good idea, then an elected \nlegislature should consider it and, if it has merit, pass it into \nlaw. Judges should not be looking around the country or the globe for \nlaws they like and then try to implement them.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor has a history of writing or signing on to brief and \ninadequate opinions that are not suitable for the gravity of the \nmatters on which she is ruling. In the Ricci firefighter case I \ndiscussed earlier, half of the judges on her court criticized her \nopinion as ``perfunctory disposition'' that ``rests uneasily with the \nweighty issues presented by this appeal.'' The opinion was only one \nparagraph long. When the Supreme Court issued its majority opinion on \nthat case, it was 34 pages long. In one case I mentioned above, she \njoined the summary panel opinion and discarded the idea of the second \namendment as a fundamental right in a one-sentence footnote. This is \nunacceptable.\n  What is perhaps the most shocking about these exceedingly brief \ninvestigations of the law is that they affected very important cases \nand very important issues. For instance, the Ricci case could become \nthe affirmative action case of this generation, and it received only a \none-paragraph analysis from Judge Sotomayor. Her casual treatment of \nthe second amendment cases flies in the face of the efforts the Supreme \nCourt has put in these decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court is the last \nstop for important legal decisions, and a Justice must provide \nexplanation and insight to the country on how and why they ruled the \nway they did. Judge Sotomayor did not do that for these extremely \nimportant cases.\n  This will be the first time I have ever voted against a Supreme Court \nnominee, and I am not happy I have to do so. However, it is the \nconstitutional role of the Senate to provide confirmation for this \nposition and my duty as a Senator to be part of this process. On \nviewing the record of Judge Sotomayor, I do not find her to be a \nsuitable candidate for Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates and will vote against her whenever the Senate considers her \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have to say there have been some amazing \nproposals coming out of the House and the Senate in the last few weeks \nin some fairly desperate economic times, when job loss is at some of \nits highest rates in years, when borrowing and spending have gone \nthrough the roof. It is pretty amazing that we have come out with \nproposals, such as cap and trade, that are going to add huge taxes on \nelectricity and other energy when we should be doing all we can to \ncreate more energy in our country and to lower the cost, if possible, \nfor Americans. It is pretty amazing to me that we would consider adding \ntaxes and cost onto the cost of living when so many are out of work and \nwe are in very difficult economic times.\n  Now we see this health care proposal that the Congressional Budget \nOffice says is going to hurt our economy, it is going to insure very \nfew uninsured people, and it will cost trillions of dollars. Again, at \na time when we are having difficulty paying the interest on the debt we \nalready owe, we have proposed this massive expansion of government.\n  Here we are today supposedly discussing funding for our whole defense \nsystem in our country, the Defense authorization bill, and the majority \nhas decided to add on to that bill hate crimes legislation. They \napparently have scheduled a vote at 1 a.m. tomorrow morning for hate \ncrimes legislation in the middle of a defense authorization debate \nwhich should be bipartisan, should be focused on the defense of our \ncountry, a clear constitutional responsibility. But we are spending the \nday waiting for a cloture vote at 1 a.m. tomorrow morning on hate \ncrimes.\n  There are many practical problems with this hate crimes amendment \nthey are trying to force us to attach to the Defense authorization \nbill. The broad language will unnecessarily extend Federal law \nenforcement beyond its constitutional bounds, it will undermine the \neffectiveness and confidence of local law enforcement, and it will \ncreate conditions for arbitrary and politicized prosecution of certain \ncases. But instead of the practical problems, I want to focus on basic, \nfundamental problems with Federal hate crimes legislation.\n  The rule of law requires that we oppose this amendment on principle. \nJustice is blind, and under the rule of law justice must be blind--\nblind to the superficial circumstances of the victims and the \ndefendants.\n  The law says crime must be investigated and punished. There is no \nevidence to suggest that crimes defined by this amendment as hate \ncrimes are not being prosecuted today. This amendment is, therefore, \nunnecessary as a matter of criminal law.\n  There is no need, or even any law enforcement benefit, to create a \nspecial class for crimes based on--and I quote from the amendment--\n``the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, \ngender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \nvictim.'' Indeed, as a matter of justice, this amendment is patently \noffensive. It is based on the premise that violence committed against \ncertain kinds of victims is worse and more in need of Federal \nintervention and swift justice than if it were committed against \nsomeone else. I am sure most parents of a minority, homosexual, or \nfemale victim would appreciate the extra concern, but that also implies \nthat certain crimes are better, for lack of a better word. Where does \nthat leave the vast majority of victims' families who, because of the \nwhims of political correctness, are not entitled under this amendment \nto special status and attention? How can a victim's perceived status or \nthe perpetrator's perceived opinions possibly determine the severity of \nthe crime?\n  The 14th amendment explicitly guarantees all citizens equal \nprotection of the laws. This amendment creates a special class of \nvictims whose protection of the laws will be, in Orwell's phrase, more \nequal than others, and if some are more equal, others will be less \nequal; that is, this amendment will create the very problem it purports \nto solve.\n  Let's talk about thought crimes for a minute. This amendment will \nalso move our Nation a dangerous step closer to another Orwellian \nconcept--thought crime. This legislation essentially makes certain \nideas criminal in that those ideas involved in a crime make that crime \nmore deserving of prosecution. The problem, of course, is that \npoliticians are claiming the power to decide which thoughts are \ncriminal and which are not.\n  Canadians right now live under this regime where so-called human \nrights\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\ncommissions operating outside the law prosecute citizens for espousing \nopinions with which the commissioners disagree. This concern is only \nheightened by the last section of this hate crimes amendment which says \nit does not allow ``prosecution based solely upon an individual's \nexpression of . . . religious . . . beliefs.''\n  Let me repeat that because we are being told this would not affect \nanyone expressing a religious opinion or value judgment:\n\n       Prosecution based solely upon an individual's expression of \n     religious beliefs . . .\n\n  Two questions come to mind: First, if the hate crimes amendment is \nreally just about law enforcement, why should it even need a \nrestatement of the self-evident fact that religious expression is \nconstitutionally protected? And second, why include the adverb \n``solely'' if not to allow for the potential prosecution of people's \nreligious speech so long as it is part of a broader prosecution of the \naccused hater?\n  Today, only actions are crimes. If we pass this legislation, opinions \nwill become crimes. What is to stop us from following the lead of \nEuropean countries and American college campuses where certain speech \nis criminalized? Can priests, pastors, and rabbis be sure their \npreaching will not be prosecuted? In Canada, for instance, Pastor \nStephen Boissoin was so prosecuted by Alberta's Human Rights Commission \nfor publishing letters critical of homosexuality, a biblical concept. \nOr will this amendment serve as a warning to people not to speak out \ntoo loudly about their religious views lest the Federal law enforcement \ncome knocking at their door? What about the unintended consequences, \nsuch as pedophiles and sex offenders claiming protected status as \ndisabled under this legislation? There is no such thing as a criminal \nthought, only criminal acts. Once we endorse thought crimes, where will \nwe draw the line? And more importantly, who will draw the line?\n  Let me talk a little bit about equality and how it relates to this \nbill. If my own children were attacked in a violent crime, justice--\ntrue justice--demands that their attackers be pursued no more or less \nthan the attackers of any other children.\n  We also say we want a colorblind society--even Judge Sotomayor. But \nwe cannot have a colorblind society if we continue to write color-\nconscious laws. Our culture cannot expect to treat people equally if \nthe law, if the ruling class treats citizens not according to the \ncontent of their character but according to their race, sex, ethnicity, \nor gender identity.\n  As we wait through the night to vote on this hate crimes bill, I \nencourage my colleagues, first of all, to set this aside and let's \nfocus on it separately, if it needs to be focused on. It is not part of \nthe Defense authorization bill. But they are holding the Defense \nauthorization bill hostage to other things, much like we did a few \nweeks ago when we were trying to pass a defense appropriations bill and \nthey attached a $100 billion giveaway to the International Monetary \nFund. In order to vote for the support of our troops, we had to vote to \ngive away another $100 billion from American taxpayers.\n  This hate crimes legislation makes no sense. It violates all the \nprinciples of equal justice under the law. It makes what we think and \nwhat we believe a crime, rather than what we do. It asks judges and \njuries to determine what we were thinking when we were committing a \ncrime, instead of trying to decide what we really did. This is not what \nis carved above the Supreme Court, which says ``equal justice under the \nlaw.'' It violates all the principles we have talked about as far as \nblind justice, that a judge does not look at who is in front of him but \nconsiders the facts of the case.\n  Hate crimes violate everything that is essentially American and fair \nand equal about a justice system. It makes no sense to bring it up at \nall. It makes even less sense to bring it up under the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues, particularly the majority, to withdraw \nthis amendment and let us move ahead with the debate of the defense of \nour country.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Highway Investment Protection Act\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in September of this year, just a couple \nof months away, the highway bill--the program under which we build \nbridges and roads and highways around the country--is set to expire. \nEven more worrisome, in August of this year--next month--the highway \ntrust fund, which funds all of that activity, is scheduled to run out \nof money. So I think--I hope--there is a broad consensus here that we \nneed to act to continue the ongoing highway program. To not act--to \nallow the highway trust fund to run out of money, to allow the highway \nprogram to end--would be an enormous antistimulus for the economy \nbecause a lot of significant, productive infrastructure spending and \nactivity would just stop overnight.\n  So we must act, and I believe everyone acknowledges that. What I am \nconcerned about is that we are going to go right up to the eleventh \nhour, to the precipice, and then we are going to be given one choice, \nand one choice only, here on the floor of the Senate, rather than have \na calm and reasoned debate about the best way to act and the best way \nto pay for that. So I strongly urge the Senate to take up this matter \nsooner rather than later and to consider all of the reasonable and all \nof the available options.\n  As I understand it, the Obama administration will propose an 18-month \nextension of the current highway program, and I have absolutely no \nproblem with that. I plan to support that. The key issue in my mind is \nhow we pay for that extension, how we replenish the trust fund, at \nleast for the next 18 months. We faced this shortfall late last year, \nand unfortunately there was no good idea, no option presented except to \nspend more money--borrowed money--and increase the debt to keep that \ntrust fund going.\n  I suggest that with our debt rising so dramatically, with all of the \nactions this Congress has taken--the stimulus, the budget that doubles \nthe debt in 5 years and triples it in 10--we need a better solution \nthan merely to print more money or borrow more money from the Chinese. \nThat is why I have introduced my proposal, S. 1344. That bill \nspecifically is called the Highway Investment Protection Act. It would \nextend and reauthorize the highway program for an initial 18 months, \nand it would fund that out of existing stimulus dollars which have \nalready been appropriated.\n  Some may ask: What is the point of that? The point is real simple. If \nwe use existing, already appropriated stimulus dollars, we are not \nborrowing more money, we are not printing more money, we are not \nborrowing more money from the Chinese, and we are not yet again \nincreasing the deficit and increasing the debt. That is very important. \nWe are also not increasing taxes, which is a horrible thing to do, \nparticularly in the middle of a very serious recession.\n  One of the clear lessons from the Great Depression is the things you \ndon't do, which, unfortunately, leaders back then did, in some cases. \nOne of the things you don't do is to increase taxes, which made the \nDepression far worse and far longer in duration than it otherwise \nneeded to be.\n  So this program doesn't print more money, it doesn't borrow yet more \nfrom the Chinese, and it doesn't raise taxes. That is the great \nadvantage of it.\n  In addition, it is specifically structured to give maximum \nflexibility to the Obama administration in terms of where to find those \nstimulus dollars. So we don't say specifically take it from this \naccount, which they may favor; take it from that account, which they \nmay prefer. We give the Obama administration maximum flexibility. And I \nthink virtually everyone acknowledges that at the end of the day, when \nthe entire $800-plus billion stimulus program is worked through, there \nwill be over this amount of money that remains unspent and unobligated. \nThere will be more than what is required for the next 18 months for the \nhighway trust fund--about $20 billion--which cannot be spent out of the \nstimulus anyway. So this is simply capturing that money and using it to \nextend this vital highway program and this important infrastructure \nspending.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n  Several months ago, when we debated the stimulus here on the floor of \nthe Senate, there were many of us--Democrats and Republicans alike--who \nwanted more infrastructure spending, more highway spending in the \nstimulus. It is very clear from every poll that was published that the \nAmerican people felt that way. One of the absolute top categories of \nstimulus spending money the American people supported was highway \nconstruction--roads, bridges, highways. So this is very consistent with \nthe idea of a broad-based stimulus program. It is not inconsistent with \nthat at all.\n  Again, the alternatives are to simply move money from the general \nfund. That means we are borrowing more money from the Chinese or \nwhomever--in a sense, printing more money--or there may be a proposal \nto increase taxes to pay for it, which I believe, no matter what the \nsource, is a very bad idea in the middle of a serious recession. That \nis very antigrowth.\n  My fear is that given our very constricted busy schedule between now \nand the August recess, this matter is going to be pushed to the very \nend, right before we are set to leave for the August recess, and there \nwill be one alternative and one alternative only: Just print more \nmoney. Just borrow more from the Chinese. My fear is there is going to \nbe an attempt to rush that through the Senate, and I don't think that \nis the way to get the best result and the most consensual result on \nthis important issue.\n  I propose we think about this now, sooner rather than later. I \npropose we discuss all the reasonable alternatives and certainly look \nat the very commonsense alternative of using already appropriated \nstimulus dollars--again, no new debt, no new spending; use what has \nalready been appropriated in the stimulus; give the administration \nmaximum flexibility in terms of how to do that.\n  Finally, I would also point out that the bill is drafted very \ncarefully, so that within these 18 months, if the Congress were to \nenact a new highway reauthorization program, a new multiyear program, \nthis extension would automatically dissolve and go away and this money \nfrom the stimulus would automatically stop and whatever the provisions \nof that new multiyear highway bill would be would come into full force \nand effect. I urge all my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to \nconsider this commonsense approach.\n  In that vein, I would like to propound a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1344\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 1344, a bill to use stimulus funds to protect the \nsolvency of the highway trust fund; and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe technical amendment at the desk be agreed to; the bill as amended \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, in light of the objection, I would ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, if the Senator would at least \nagree to a unanimous consent request to allow this bill to be the next \norder of business after the current Defense authorization bill is fully \ndealt with which would provide for limited time agreements and relevant \ngermane amendments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in closing, let me say that I think it is \nunfortunate we don't take up this serious matter next after the Defense \nauthorization bill and that we don't take it up in plenty of time to \nlook at all of the reasonable alternatives.\n  I hope when we finally take it up, it isn't in a mad dash to the \nAugust recess; that it isn't under all of the normal artificial \npressure that is built up where we must act in the next few hours and \nwe have one choice and one choice only. We have heard all that before. \nWe have heard it before when we were forced into quick consideration of \nthe bailouts. We heard it about the stimulus. Now we are hearing it \nabout health care.\n  Let's try to do some things right and not just quick. This has to be \ndone before the August recess because the highway trust fund will run \nout of money during the August recess. So let's take this up sooner \nrather than later.\n  Let's take this up right after the current Defense authorization bill \non the floor is dealt with and look at all the available alternatives, \nincluding using stimulus funds already appropriated so we don't raise \ntaxes in the middle of a recession, so we don't increase the debt and \nso that we don't borrow more money from the Chinese and print more \ndollar bills. The American people are very fearful of that growing \ntrend.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have called me an \n``eternal Optimist.'' Since I entered the Senate more than 12 years \nago, I have consistently worked across party lines to find new \nsolutions and broker bills that then become law. I have a long and \nconsistent track record of working in good faith with my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle. I had hoped, and still hope, to do that \non the complex issue of health care reform.\n  Last Congress, I proposed Ten Steps to Transform Health Care in \nAmerica. I traveled 1,200 miles across my home State last March to \nbring my message of reform directly to the people of Wyoming. My \nmessage was built on the belief that the American people needed more \nchoice and more control over their health care. I put it together by \nworking with people on both sides of the aisle. I found a way to get \ncoverage for everybody if we did all 10 steps, and any one of them \nwould increase access and cut costs.\n  Among other things, my plan attempted to level the playing field in \nthe tax treatment of health insurance and also provide a helping hand \nto low-income Americans in the form of subsidies to ensure access to \nquality, affordable health insurance. My plan also provided greater \nequity and ease to our Nation's small business owners by allowing \ncross-State pooling. Each of my proposals targeted three fundamental \ngoals: Increasing access to health care, reducing costs within our \nhealth care delivery system, and improving the quality of care.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I was and remain very concerned \nabout the effect of any health reform proposal on our Federal budget, \nas well as personal and family budgets. We all want coverage for \neveryone, including preexisting and chronic conditions. We want \nportability. We want health care, not sick care.\n  I have continued my work on health care reform this Congress. As the \nranking member on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, a member of the Finance Committee, and a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I assumed a unique role in the health reform debate this \nyear. I worked hard to foster a constructive dialogue with the members \nof all three committees, and I have met with the President and \nadministration officials to share ideas on how to best craft a strong \nbipartisan bill. As the debate on health care reform progresses in the \nSenate, I continue to stand ready to work on this critical issue. As I \nhave noted many times before, this is likely to be the most important \npiece of legislation that we will work on as Members of the Senate. It \ntouches the life of every single American in a very real way.\n\n  Our health care system is approximately one-sixth of our Nation's \neconomy, and the changes we make in it will ultimately affect the lives \nof every single American. I have never worked on a bill that was that \nextensive. It is a sacred trust we have, and we must not be moved by \nartificial deadlines and short-term political considerations.\n  I do not think a good bill and a bipartisan bill are mutually \nexclusive. To the contrary, I believe a health care reform bill will \nneed strong support from\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle to gain the credibility and the support of our \nconstituents. It is still my hope we can produce a strong bipartisan \nhealth care bill that upwards of 80 Members of the Senate could \nsupport. I see that as a possibility.\n  I remain eternally hopeful we will deliver the American people the \nstrong bipartisan health care bill they deserve. But I have to tell you \nI am disappointed by the recent developments of the House of \nRepresentatives and, more particularly, in the Committee of the Senate \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Yesterday, on a party-line vote, 13 to 10, the committee passed the \nAffordable Health Choices Act. But don't let the name fool you because, \nwith a $1 trillion pricetag, the bill is anything but affordable.\n  Unfortunately, the HELP Committee chose to gallop down a path of \npartisanship. Despite my strong urging that we start with a blank piece \nof paper, HELP Committee Republicans were presented with roughly 600 \npages of longstanding Democratic policies. It seems not a single \nDemocratic member of the committee was told no, as every pet project \nwas included in this bill. Because Republicans were shut out of the \ndrafting process, we were forced to file hundreds of amendments. \nUnfortunately, of the 45 committee rollcall votes on Republican \namendments, 2 were successful. There were a number of amendments that \nwere accepted, but they fall more in the category of proofreading \namendments and some slight changes.\n  President Obama has repeatedly called for a health care bill that \nwill reduce costs. He has called for a bill that will help every \nAmerican get access to quality health care, a bill that allows people \nwho like the care they have to keep it, a bill that will not increase \nthe deficit. Republicans strongly support those goals. Unfortunately, \nthe HELP bill does not meet any of them.\n  In my view, and graded on the criteria specified by the President, \nthe bill voted out of the HELP Committee fails on all counts. The bill \nbreaks the President's promises and falls short on achieving the \ncommonsense goals the Republicans and President share. Instead, the \npartisan HELP bill adds $1 trillion to the deficit, despite the \nPresident's promise that health care reform must and will be deficit \nneutral. The bill increases that deficit by more than $1 trillion over \n10 years. It is not as bad as the House bill. It is my understanding \nthat increases it by $4 trillion over 10 years. Maybe it is just more \nhonest, because there are ways to avoid a cost by phasing in \nauthorizations and by using such sums in authorizations--little tricks \nof budgeting that avoid the score. But this is on the heels of news \nlast week from official scorekeepers that the Federal budget deficit \nwas $1.1 trillion for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2009.\n  According to scorekeepers, this bill will bend the cost curve the \nwrong way, driving up the cost of health insurance for most Americans \nand increasing total spending on health care.\n  I refer people to an article by Lori Montgomery in the Washington \nPost today, ``CBO Chief Criticizes Democrats' Health Reform Measures.''\n\n       Instead of saving the Federal Government from fiscal \n     catastrophe, the health reform measures being drafted by \n     congressional Democrats would worsen an already bleak budget \n     outlook, increasing deficit projections and driving the \n     nation more deeply into debt, the director of the nonpartisan \n     Congressional Budget Office said this morning.\n       Under questioning by members of the Senate Budget \n     Committee, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf said bills crafted \n     by House leaders and the Senate health committee do not \n     propose ``the sort of fundamental changes that would be \n     necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending \n     by a significant amount.''\n       ``On the contrary,'' Elmendorf said, ``the legislation \n     significantly expands the federal responsibility for health \n     care costs.''\n       Though President Obama and Democratic leaders have said \n     repeatedly that reining in the skyrocketing growth in \n     spending on government health programs such as Medicaid and \n     Medicare is their top priority, the reform measures put forth \n     so far would not fulfill their pledge to ``bend the cost \n     curve'' downward, Elmendorf said. Instead, he said, ``The \n     curve is being raised.''\n       The CBO is the official arbiter of the costs of \n     legislation, and Elmendorf's stark testimony is certain to \n     undermine support for the measures even as three House panels \n     begin debate and aim to put a bill on the House floor before \n     the August recess. Fiscal conservatives in the House, known \n     as the Blue Dogs, were already threatening to block passage \n     of legislation in the Energy and Commerce Committee, \n     primarily due to concerns about the long-term costs of the \n     House bill.\n       Cost is also a major issue in the Senate, where some \n     moderate Democrats have joined Republicans in calling on \n     Obama to drop his demand that both chambers approve a bill \n     before the August recess. While the Senate health committee \n     approved its bill on Wednesday with no Republican votes, \n     members of the Senate Finance Committee were still struggling \n     to craft a bipartisan measure that does more to restrain \n     costs.\n       The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad \n     (D-ND), has taken a leading role in that effort. This \n     morning, after receiving Elmendorf's testimony on the \n     nation's long-term budget outlook, Conrad turned immediately \n     to questions about the emerging health care measures.\n       ``I'm going to really put you on the spot,'' Conrad told \n     Elmendorf. ``From what you have seen from the products of the \n     committees that have reported, do you see a successful effort \n     being mounted to bend the long-term cost curve?''\n       Elmendorf responded: ``No, Mr. Chairman.''\n       Asked what provisions would be needed to slow the growth in \n     federal health spending, Elmendorf urged lawmakers to end or \n     limit the tax-free treatment of employer-provided health \n     benefits, calling it a federal ``subsidy'' that encourages \n     spending on ever more expensive health packages. Key \n     senators, including Conrad, have been pressing to tax \n     employer-provided benefits, but Senate leaders last week \n     objected, saying the idea does not have enough support among \n     Senate Democrats to win passage.\n       Elmendorf also suggested changing the way Medicare \n     reimburses providers to create incentives for reducing costs.\n       ``Certain reforms of that sort are included in some of the \n     packages,'' Elmendorf said. ``But the changes that we have \n     looked at so far do not represent the sort of fundamental \n     change, the order of magnitude that would be necessary to \n     offset the direct increase in federal health costs that would \n     result from the insurance coverage proposals.''\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dismissed Elmendorf's \n     push for the benefits tax. ``What he should do is maybe run \n     for Congress,'' Reid said.\n       But Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus expressed \n     frustration that the tax on employer-funded benefits had \n     fallen out of favor, in part because the White House opposes \n     the idea. Critics of the proposal say it would target police \n     and firefighters who receive generous benefits packages. And \n     if the tax is trimmed to apply only to upper income \n     beneficiaries, it would lose its effectiveness as a cost-\n     containment measure.\n       ``Basically the president is not helping,'' said Baucus. \n     ``He does not want the exclusion, and that's making it \n     difficult.''\n       But he added, ``We are clearly going to find ways to bend \n     the cost curve in the right direction, including provisions \n     that will actually lower the rate of increase in health care \n     costs.''\n       Ideas under consideration include health-care delivery \n     system reform; health insurance market reform; and empowering \n     an independent agency to set Medicare reimbursement rates, an \n     idea the White House is shopping aggressively on Capitol \n     Hill.\n       But Baucus is not giving up on the benefits tax. ``It is \n     not off the table, there's still a lot of interest in it,'' \n     Baucus said.\n\n  I would mention the members of the committee are still working to \nfind that bipartisan match, but it does take time. There are so many \nmoving parts to this bill. But the partisan HELP bill breaks the \nPresident's promise, ``if you like what you have, you can keep it.'' \nThe scorekeepers report the bill would force millions of Americans to \nlose their health care plan they have and like. Several Republican \nmembers offered amendments that aimed at ensuring Americans who like \nthe coverage they have they can keep it, but they all suffered the same \nfailing fate.\n  The partisan HELP bill kills jobs and cuts wages. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office concludes the bill will result in lower \nwages and higher unemployment. These jobs and wage cuts would hit low-\nincome workers, women, and minorities the hardest. It is hard to \nbelieve that with unemployment at a generational high, Democrats on the \ncommittee will even consider putting more jobs on the chopping block.\n  Despite passage of the so-called stimulus bill earlier this year, \nAmericans are facing the highest unemployment rate in 26 years. At the \nsame time, the HELP Committee and the House Democrats are attempting to \nimpose new taxes on small employers that will eliminate jobs for low-\nincome minority workers.\n  The partisan HELP bill raises taxes at the worst possible time. \nDespite several amendments offered by Republican members, which the \nDemocrats defeated on party-line votes, the bill breaks President \nObama's promise not to raise taxes on individuals earning less than \n$250,000 per year. The bill would impose a new tax on people without \nhealth insurance. The partisan\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nHELP bill allows Washington bureaucrats to ration health care. The bill \nlays the groundwork for a government takeover of health care, giving \nWashington bureaucrats the power to prevent patients from seeing the \ndoctor they choose and obtaining new and innovative medical therapies.\n  I could go into the cost effectiveness--the clinical effectiveness \nresearch, but I will not go into the details of that at this time. But \nthat is a way that care could be rationed. How do we know? We tried a \nbunch of amendments that would specify what could not be rationed, and \nevery one of those was defeated.\n  The partisan HELP bill traps low-income Americans in a second-tier \nhealth care program. Despite several amendments, the other side refused \nto give Medicaid patients the choice to access higher quality care.\n  The other side claims to support giving patients choices but when the \nchoice is a new government-run health plan. However, they refuse to \ngive low-income Americans the chance to get out of the worst health \ncare programs in the country.\n  I would mention government-run programs, instead of giving the lowest \nincome Americans a choice to enroll in private insurance with \nsubsidies, the HELP Committee bill forces them to stay in a program \nwhere 40 percent of the physicians will refuse to see them and the care \nthey receive will be worse than what is available through private \nhealth insurance.\n  I have to remind you, if you cannot see a doctor, you don't have \nhealth care.\n  Instead of reducing health care costs, the partisan bill will spend \nbillions of taxpayer dollars on new porkbarrel spending. The bill would \nbuild new sidewalks, jungle gyms, and farmers markets through a \nmandatory spending $80 billion slush fund. That is just the first 10 \nyears, which is delayed 2 years; otherwise, it would be $100 billion. \nThat is for additional porkbarrel projects.\n  Talk about a rating system. A rating system is how much difference \nyou have between the low age and the high age, the more well and the \nsicker people. That is being compressed dramatically, which will raise \nthe rates for virtually everybody in America.\n  The partisan HELP bill preserves the costly, dangerous, medical \nmalpractice system. Again, despite several blocked attempts by multiple \nRepublican committee members, the bill fails to reduce medical lawsuits \nwhich drive up the cost of health care and force doctors to order \nwasteful tests and treatments to cover liabilities.\n  The bill worsens doctor shortages. According to an analysis by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the bill would worsen the \nNation's primary care physician shortage by providing fewer medical \nstudents with financial assistance in return for work in underserved \nareas.\n  In short, the HELP Committee bill costs too much, covers too few, and \nif you like what you have you can't keep it. Under this bill, if you \nlike your job, you may not be able to keep that either. With all these \nbad policies comes a $1 trillion pricetag. That is $1 trillion this \ncountry cannot afford right now and a trillion reasons why it is a bad \nbill for America. We have not even talked about clinical effectiveness \nor some other programs that were not actuarially sound.\n  As I said at the beginning of the speech, I am an eternal optimist. \nDespite my comments on the perils and policies in the HELP bill, we \nstill have a chance. We can write a good bill, a bill that ensures \nevery American has quality, affordable health care; a bill that is \nfully paid for with savings exclusively from health care; a bill that \nreverses the cost curve; a bill that lets Americans keep what they have \nif they like it; a bill the American people deserve. We are working on \nthat now. We are trying to put together that bill, but it takes time.\n  Those are all things that can be done. One way to enact real change \nis to sit down and work out the details. Health care is complicated. \nThe laws of unintended consequences are severe and unforgiving. We \ncannot rush into something that will change one-sixth of our Nation's \neconomy and affect 100 percent of Americans. We must take our time and \nget the policies right.\n  I have heard reports of White House staff calling the HELP Committee \nbill a bipartisan bill. I heard White House staff say this bill \nincorporated Republican ideas. White House staff speak for the \nPresident, not for Senate Republicans.\n  I can tell you as the ranking Republican on the HELP Committee, the \npartisan vote speaks for itself. Republican ideas were excluded from \nthe process and from this legislation. We have five bills that have \nideas that would meet the goals of the President and the ones I have \nstated. Parts of those were considered; most were rejected.\n  I passionately want to reform our health care system to improve \nquality, reduce costs, and increase access. I think the HELP Committee \nlegislation fails to meaningfully address those goals and sticks the \nAmerican people with a bill we cannot afford. I hope we can get back to \nwork and construct real reform that has the support of the American \npeople.\n  I appreciate the openness that Senator Baucus has had in dealing with \nFinance Committee members and am optimistic eternally that something \ngood can come out of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in every corner of our country, \ncommunities have been working to end hate crimes. Despite the great \ngains in equality and civil rights throughout the last century, too \nmany Americans today are still subjected to discrimination, violence, \nand even death because of who they are. That is why I have joined with \nmany of my colleagues as a cosponsor of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act. This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will stand \nup for the victims of hate crimes and their families.\n  I am glad it has been offered as an amendment and that we will now \nhave a chance to act on it this week. It takes only a quick glance at a \nnewspaper to see places around the world where people are regularly \nattacked because of their religion or the color of their skin or their \nsexual orientation. It is important to remember that even though we in \nAmerica have made great strides in reducing discrimination, there is \nstill plenty of work to be done. I am proud we are working toward \nending these crimes once and for all in the memory of Matthew Shepard.\n  Matthew, as many of my colleagues have stated, was a 21-year-old \ncollege student who was murdered because of his sexual orientation. \nThat crime was not prosecuted as a hate crime because there was no \napplicable State or Federal hate crimes law that covered sexual \norientation. Just this year we were all saddened by a horrific shooting \nof a security guard at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, a few \nblocks away.\n  But those are only two examples. And not all of these terrible hate \ncrimes make headlines. In 2007, the last year for which the FBI has \nstatistics, there were over 9,000 hate crime offenses. The thousands of \npeople who have been victimized by hate crimes each receive inadequate \nprotection under the law, and that is simply unconscionable. That is \nwhy this amendment we are considering this afternoon is long overdue.\n  This amendment would strengthen our existing laws by providing the \nJustice Department with additional tools to investigate and prosecute \ncrimes that were committed based on a victim's race, color, national \norigin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.\n  Communities across the country have been working to respond to hate \ncrimes, and State and local law enforcement continues to bear the \nresponsibility for prosecuting the bulk of these crimes. This is not a \nFederal takeover. However, States and localities would greatly benefit \nfrom the help the Federal Government can provide. If a State or local \ncommunity is unable to prosecute a hate crime, this amendment would \nmean the Federal Government could lend a hand.\n  This amendment would provide a number of other tools to help end hate \ncrimes. It would provide States and local governments with grants \ndesigned for hate crime prevention. It would expand data collection \nabout hate crimes so that law enforcement will have more information to \nhelp prevent prejudicial crimes committed\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\nagainst women. It would expand the legal definition of what a hate \ncrime is, allowing for stronger prosecution and more cases for a \nviolent crime that is clearly motivated by hatred.\n  In that way, this amendment would put into law what we already know, \nthat crimes are different when they are motivated by discrimination. \nBurning down a building is a horrible crime. But that crime takes on a \nnew character when that building is a church or a synagogue or a \nmosque.\n  It is wrong when one person attacks another person on the street, for \nsure. But it has a different meaning when violence occurs because the \nvictim is a different race, or religion, or sexual orientation.\n  We cannot stand idly by while Americans are subjected to \ndiscrimination, violence, and even death, simply because of who they \nare. Passage of this amendment would be another major victory for equal \nrights in our country.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon simply to urge our colleagues to \nsupport this amendment when it comes to a vote later this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Medicare Reimbursements\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I find myself in a rather unique position \nhere. If you look in the bio sections of all of the outfits that keep \nherd on us, they will record me as a journalist. That is an unemployed \nnewspaper man, by the way.\n  But I have a great family tradition in journalism, three generations, \nfour generations, actually, of the Roberts family and the State's \nsecond oldest newspaper in Kansas. I still carry around my reporter's \nnotebook, have great respect for those of the fourth estate. We shine \nthe light of truth with our own individual flashlight.\n  I do not think I have ever done this in 28 years of public service, \nbut I am irritated. I am more than irritated. I rise today to clear up \nsome recent flagrant mischaracterizations about Medicare payments, \nespecially since the Medicare payments are now being used as a target \nas a pay-for for the health care reform, the alleged health care reform \nthat Senator Enzi was talking about, specifically the statements made \non the front page of today's Washington Post, the fountain of all \nknowledge here in Washington, in an article entitled ``Obama Eyes the \nPurse Strings for Medicare.''\n  I would describe this article--I read it. I read it again. I was a \nrelatively happy person, watching the weather--I do not watch the news \nmuch--had my cup of coffee, was going to turn to the sports pages. Then \nI happened to glance at this, read it, and ruined my whole morning. I \ncame in, I was mean with the staff and everything else. So I thought I \nbetter get it off my chest.\n  This article is patronizing. It is condescending. The bad part about \nit is it is egregious in nature and effect at a crucial time in the \nhealth care debate, and that is most unfortunate.\n  The author of this article describes what she sees as ``one of the \nmost effective and lucrative forms of constituent service,'' i.e. \nsetting reimbursement rates for local hospitals, doctors, home health \ncare centers, and other health care providers.\n  Oh, I wish I had that power, as opposed to CMS, which is the \nsubagency, the acronym agency for the Department of Health and Human \nServices, that does set reimbursement rates for all health care \nproviders in the United States.\n  The author continues, accusing ``longtime Members of Congress'' of \nsuch atrocities as ``championing New York City's teaching hospitals'' \nand making sure ``rural health services are amply funded.'' In this \nauthor's mind, these hospitals and other providers are ``flush.'' Flush \nwith Medicare cash as a result.\n  I must admit in my 28 years in Congress, I have absolutely been one \nof those dastardly Members intent on making darn sure that the rural \nhealth care delivery system can remain alive and serve our people, even \nif it has to be kept on life support, which is the true \ncharacterization of what we face.\n  I wonder, since it never appears anywhere in the person's article, in \nher article, if the author of this piece is aware that the average \nMedicare reimbursement rate for doctors is about 80 percent of what the \ncommercial market pays or that Medicare only pays about 70 percent of \nthe market rates for hospitals. That is why we have hospital after \nhospital after hospital for decades in Kansas passing bond issues just \nto keep their doors open. These are not flush places. These are not \nposh places in regard to hospitals.\n  Then I go back to the fact that doctors get paid 80 percent. That is \nwhy doctors, many of them, are refusing to take--in regard to \nMedicare--patients. And that is that terrible word that people say is \ntoo scary, that is called rationing, that when we set a reimbursement \nrate, we, meaning the CMS--no, not individual Members of Congress, as \nthe article infers--but these agencies cannot reimburse doctors enough \nso they can make a living, or other health care providers, that they \ncease providing Medicare to seniors.\n  What does the senior do then? Well, they are in a very difficult \nsituation. How do you think these providers survive? The answer is that \nthey shift that loss onto the private market to the tune of nearly $90 \nbillion a year.\n  Let me repeat that. Everybody who goes to the hospital, everybody who \ngoes to a doctor and has private insurance, you are paying $90 billion \na year in a hidden tax in regard to the people who basically are not \ncovered by Medicare and by Medicaid, if, in fact, you would do what the \nPresident has suggested, and maybe take some money--``eyes the purse \nstrings for Medicare,'' Medicare being a target, Medicare being the \nservice for seniors. Wake up, seniors. Wake up, AARP. Wake up, everyone \nelse in the health care field. We are targeting Medicare.\n  My word, if any Senator had come down here except during these last 6 \nmonths and said: Let's cut Medicare by 10 percent, they would have been \nexcoriated by this newspaper for hurting senior citizens.\n  Well, in my State of Kansas and in other rural States across the \ncountry, we do not have a private market to shift those losses to. Our \nrural areas do not have the population base to support such a cost \nshift as $90 billion as happens in the rest of the country. In \naddition, the folks in these towns are much more likely to depend on \nMedicare or Medicaid or to simply be uninsured. In short, without some \nsort of special payment from Medicare, these hospitals would not \nsurvive.\n  You tell me, Washington Post, what you would say to the residents of \nSmith Center here, top center in Kansas. What would you say to the \nresidents of Smith Center if their hospital closed?\n  Smith Center is a great town, close to the geographic center of the \nlower 48 States, has a population of a little less than 2,000 people. \nThey have a great football team, high school football program, Smith \nCenter Redmen, the pride of north central Kansas, one of the greatest \nsmall town football teams in America.\n  The town is served by the Smith County Memorial Hospital, a critical \naccess hospital with 25 beds. For those of you who are unfamiliar with \nthe terminology, a critical access hospital is a rural hospital with 25 \nbeds or less which is at least 35 miles away from another hospital and \nwhich provides 24-hour emergency services.\n  Critical access hospitals get special treatment under Medicare. They \nget paid 101 percent of their costs for inpatient, outpatient, and \nswing-bed services. I probably should not mention that or this reporter \nmight run out to Smith Center and say: My goodness, you are getting 101 \npercent. Sure. She should go out and take a look, and talk to the \nhospital administrator and the people in that hospital.\n  In other words, they do not get the usual 70 percent of the market \nrate reimbursement for Medicare, for a very good reason, because of the \ndistances they would have to travel. Without the critical access \nhospital program, the closest hospital for the residents of Smith \nCenter would be all the way in Hays, KS, America, right down here 90 \nmiles away. You tell me what a person's chances of survival are after a \ncar accident or a tractor accident if they have to be driven 90 miles \naway for emergency care.\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n  Smith County Memorial is just one of 83 critical access hospitals in \nKansas. They are absolutely essential to the very lives of the people \nin rural America. Indeed, they are essential to the very existence of \nrural America at all.\n  I have the privilege of being the cochairman of the Rural Health Care \nCaucus, along with Tom Harkin of Iowa. We are fighting tooth and nail, \nholding on by our fingernails to exist, to provide care to the people \nwho live in these small communities.\n  I am happy to admit it, I am happy to admit to this reporter--I hope \nshe comes in for a cup of coffee. I would be happy to give her a cup of \ncoffee, no cream or sugar; there might be a little vinegar in it. But \nat any rate, please come in for a cup of coffee and visit about this. I \nam happy to admit it. I will bend over backward to preserve the payment \nrates that allow these hospitals to stay open and to continue to serve \nthe people in Smith Center, KS, and elsewhere all throughout rural \nAmerica.\n  I believe this position is completely justified. I sleep just fine at \nnight knowing that I have used my so-called influence through \nlegislation, through the rural health care coalition, through the \nFinance Committee, through the HELP Committee, to ensure that Medicare \npays these hospitals just enough to average a 1-percent Medicare \nmargin, 1 percent, when these hospitals are still fighting for their \nlives.\n  I would like to personally invite the author of this article or any \nother member of the Washington Post editorial board, God love them, to \nvisit some of the rural hospitals in Kansas with me. The reporter's \nname--I hope I get it right; I apologize if I do not. I really sort of \napologize. I am picking on her--is Shailagh Murray.\n  Shailagh, why don't you come to Kansas with me and let us go out to \nSmith Center. Here is the hospital. This is this posh resort that you \napparently think we finance with Medicare.\n  It is true, you know, you go through the doors, there are two-inch \nthick carpets, you go in, there is--let's see, I think there is \nMozart's piano concert 21, piano concert No. 21, and they call you by \nyour first name, and you get immediate treatment. Then there are \nmassage facilities and a spa in the back. And that is a lot of what we \nhave in our Dodge City feedlots. That is not the case.\n  Talk to the CEOs, the doctors, the nurses, and the patients. Walk \naround this small hospital and see the equipment and the facilities. \nFlush with the Medicare cash? Come on. And flush with Medicare cash \nthat is somehow influenced by individual Members of Congress? I wish. I \nhave been fussing and fighting and feuding and pleading and cajoling \nwith CMS to try at least to get these payments to doctors and hospitals \nup to the level that they can continue to exist.\n  Flush with Medicare cash? I think not.\n  Look at this hospital. Do you see anything that would lead to a \ndescription of this sort? I am not too sure anybody is going to give up \ntheir vacation. They have the finest people in the world. That is our \nbest commodity in rural areas. I am not picking on Smith Center. They \nare doing a fantastic job with the resources they have. But it just \nmakes me very angry that a Washington, DC, paper and reporter would \ndemonize a program that keeps rural America's heart beating. It is a \npatronizing and dead-wrong description, and it offends me and the \npeople I am privileged to represent in rural Kansas.\n\n  I want to tell Shailagh, Ms. Murray, I am never going to stop \nfighting for these hospitals no matter how many deals the American \nHospital Association cuts with the White House, no matter how many ugly \narticles are written here in DC. I am rather amazed at the deal the \nAmerican Hospital Association allegedly cut--$155 billion in cuts to \nMedicare for senior citizens. Wake up; it is your Medicare. There is \ngoing to be more rationing when doctors say: I am sorry, I just can't \nafford to continue.\n  That is the target now on the Finance Committee--Medicare. I never \nthought I would see the day that would happen. But I will not stop \nfighting for these hospitals. Here we have the American Hospital \nAssociation, the Kansas Hospital Association, the Missouri Hospital \nAssociation, other hospital associations are not happy with the \nnational association when you crawl in bed and get fleas with the \nadministration. What is the old saying? If you go to bed with the \nFederal Government, you wake up in the morning and you got something \nmore than a good night's sleep. And that is exactly what has happened \nwith the American Hospital Association.\n  They come through my door and say: Help, help, please get these \nreimbursement rates up. Every year, we have done that with Medicare and \nthe Medicare Programs. We are being cut by 11 percent, and the cost of \ninflation in regard to where we try to practice has gone up 7 percent, \nand whatever other number they said every year. They blame Republicans. \nOnce in a while, they blame Democrats and say: Why on Earth did you cut \nMedicare? And now we are using Medicare as a target for health care \nreform for this bill that is impossible for most people to even \ncomprehend? It is amazing.\n  The American Hospital Association bought into it with $155 billion in \ncuts. They come through my door every year when they want to keep the \nreimbursement rates level. Don't come through my door for at least a \nmonth until I calm down. That is my duty to the people of my State. I \nfeel comfortable with that.\n  I have been a little tough here on a reporter I have never met, \nobviously. She is spending a lot of her time in the people's house \ntalking with mucky-mucks on the various committees. Those are people \nwith the seniority. I used to be one of those. I used to be somebody. \nBut I urge her to talk to Members who represent rural areas and the \nrural health care delivery system and understand that this is not a \nquestion of this hospital having flush payments. They are hanging by \ntheir fingernails just to keep open. It is not true that Members of \nCongress, even the distinguished Presiding Officer and anybody else who \nmight happen to be listening to my remarks, the great Senator Thune \nstanding to my rear who also represents rural areas and has even a \nsparser area than I do--it is just not true. This article comes right \nat the apex of the debate of the health care reform debate. It is just \nnot right.\n  Let me again say to Shailagh: Why don't you come out to Kansas with \nme. We will visit with Tom Bell, president of the Kansas Hospital \nAssociation. We can go out to Smith Center and visit the hospital or as \nmany hospitals as you want. We will see who is flush in regard to \nMedicare payments. That is certainly not the case with them.\n  I think I have made my point. I must say, as a former journalist, \nformer newspaperman, I used to check my facts. I would ask that they do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas made some excellent \npoints about rural America and rural hospitals, and, as always, he did \nit in a most effective way. It should not be lost on anyone in this \nChamber or around the country, when we talk about health care reform, \nthese decisions we make in Washington have real impacts in the real \nworld. They impact people in different parts of the country \ndifferently.\n  The Senator from Kansas was very clear about the hospitals he \nrepresents. I represent hospitals in rural areas. These are not \nhospitals out there cutting a fat hog. These are hospitals trying to \nprovide service, trying to deliver health care in areas that make it \nchallenging because of geography. Sometimes they don't have the most \nup-to-date, modern equipment, but they are out there providing critical \nhealth care services to people. I associate myself with the comments of \nthe Senator from Kansas.\n  Anybody who cares about the impact of some of these proposals on \nhospitals in rural areas such as Kansas and South Dakota should be \nconcerned about the CBO discussion that occurred this morning in front \nof the Budget Committee. It made it very clear that not only is this \ngoing to cost $1 trillion, probably minimum, in the near term, but in \nthe long term, the costs for the health care reform plan currently \nmoving through the Congress explode. When we get into the outyears, it \nwill be even more expensive.\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\nIt will mean bigger and bigger reductions and cuts from providers, as \nthe Senator from Kansas so eloquently pointed out, in rural areas that \nare already struggling to make ends meet and keep their hospital doors \nopen.\n  This report we got today from the Congressional Budget Office is \nreally pretty stunning, in the context of the debate we are having over \nhealth care reform.\n  The CBO Director, Doug Elmendorf, was asked pointblank by Senator \nConrad whether the cost curve is bent under the health care reform \nlegislation currently being considered. Elmendorf says no. Then he goes \non to say:\n\n       The way I would put it is that the curve is being raised.\n\n  As has been pointed out by President Obama before, he said:\n\n       And I've said very clearly: If any bill arrives from \n     Congress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I \n     can support.\n\n  That was the President's own criteria for health care reform. That \nonly means, based upon the report we got from CBO this morning, that \nthe administration is going to have a very difficult time embracing the \nhealth care plan moving through the Senate that sees costs not coming \ndown, not bending the cost curve in a downward direction but, rather, \nbending it upward so we will see a spike in health care costs.\n  Mr. Elmendorf, when he answered that request, to put it in fuller \ncontext, was asked: So the cost curve, in your judgment, is being bent, \nbut it is being bent in the wrong way; is that correct? His answer is a \nlong quote, but I want to get it into the Record because it puts into \ncontext the very issue he raises with regard to health care reform and \nits costs and when we will see the true effect. Here is what he said:\n\n       The way I would put it is that the curve is being raised . \n     . . As we wrote in our letter to you and Senator Gregg, the \n     creation of new subsidies for health insurance, which is a \n     critical part of expanding health insurance coverage, in our \n     judgment, would by itself increase the federal responsibility \n     for health care that raises federal spending on health care, \n     raises the amount of activity that is growing at this \n     unsustainable rate, and to offset that there would have to be \n     very substantial reductions in other parts of the federal \n     commitment to health care, either on the tax revenue side \n     through changes in the tax exclusion, or on the spending side \n     through reforms in Medicare and Medicaid. Certainly reforms \n     of that sort that are included in some of the packages, and \n     we are still analyzing the reforms in the House package, the \n     legislation was only released as you know about two days ago, \n     but the changes that we have looked at so far do not \n     represent the sort of fundamental change, the order of \n     magnitude that would be necessary to offset the direct \n     increase in federal health costs from the insurance coverage \n     proposals.\n\n  What I conclude from having read that and having heard what he said \nthis morning is that he is very skeptical that there is anything about \nthe health care plan that is pending in the Senate or the one that \npassed the House last week that is going to, in the long term, reduce \ncost.\n  A fundamental principle behind health care reform ought to include \nefficiency, streamlining, finding savings. When most Americans think of \nreform, they don't think of adding costs or making things more \nexpensive, they think: How does this reform actually achieve savings by \nmaking us more efficient and streamlining operations and coming up with \nnew and innovative ways of doing things so that we can do things less \nexpensively?\n\n  That, to me, would be the essence of reform. That is not what is \nbeing talked about here, obviously. Not only do the reforms that have \nbeen proposed, the House version, which has been reported out of the \ncommittee, or at least is being deliberated on in committee over there \nbut hasn't been reported already but will be on the House floor in the \nvery near future, a House Democrat aide--this is a news report--said \nthe total bill would add up to about $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The \naide spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private \ncalculations. You might have a hard time getting used to the concept, \nbut it is $1.5 trillion in the House-passed version. We know the \nSenate-passed version will be a minimum of $1 trillion. There are many \nindependent analyses and estimates that have been done that suggest \nthat it could be north of $2 trillion and perhaps well north of $2 \ntrillion when a lot of these changes actually go fully into effect \nafter the transitional period is over. So we are talking about \ntrillions of dollars at a minimum in the near term, perhaps multiples \nof that, trillions of dollars in the long term.\n  That doesn't meet any sort of criteria or definition of reform. To \nme, reform ought to be: Let's find some savings. Let's see what we can \ndo to achieve some efficiency.\n  As I have suggested, we spend already about $2.5 trillion annually on \nhealth care. That represents about 17 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. That is on its way to 20 percent. Very soon, $1 in $5 in our \nentire economy will be spent on health care. I argue that it is not \nthat we are not spending enough money on health care. It is that we are \nnot spending wisely and well. We are not spending smart. We need to \nspend smarter when it comes to health care. We need to put more of an \nemphasis on wellness and prevention. We need to do things that would \nallow individuals and small businesses to join larger groups, to get \nthe benefit of group purchasing power so they can start buying in \nvolume, driving down cost to create more competition in the marketplace \nwhere individuals can buy insurance across State lines. We need to \naddress the growing cost of defensive medicine that is a direct result \nof lawsuit abuse. There are a lot of remedies that we think make sense \nin terms of bending the cost curve down and actually doing something to \nreform health care, to gain efficiencies, and to get costs on a more \nreasonable and affordable level.\n  It is pretty clear from the CBO report this morning in front of the \nBudget Committee that the current proposal--the House proposal and now \nthe Senate proposal reported out of the HELP Committee yesterday--does \nnothing of the sort. There is no way it can be argued that these are \nreforms. It is certainly not reform that leads to savings in the long \nterm. They will bend the cost curve upward. We will see increased \ncosts. We will see costs spike in the outyears. That came across \nunequivocally in the report that was made by CBO Director Douglas \nElmendorf this morning in front of the Budget Committee.\n  Where does that leave us? I argue that it certainly ought to sound a \nnote of caution to people in Washington, DC, that perhaps this is \nsomething we ought to take our time with. Clearly, what has been \nproposed so far is going to increase costs significantly. It is going \nto lead to the takeover of the health care system by the Federal \nGovernment, which I think most Americans would take issue with. If you \ndon't believe that, again, there are lots of great independent studies \nout there.\n  One of the criteria the President put forward in a health care bill \nhe would sign had to do with, if you have insurance today that you \nlike, you can keep it. That is not true under this bill, either, \nbecause these independent analyses that have been done have also \npointed out that there were going to be about 6 in 10 Americans or \nabout 118 million total Americans who will be driven into the \ngovernment-run program because the private health insurance \nmarketplace, when it has to compete with the government, will not be \nable to do so because the government, due to its very size, is going to \ndrive a lot of the private insurance coverage out of the marketplace.\n  A lot of small businesses that currently offer insurance to their \nemployees are going to say: I am not going to do this anymore. It costs \ntoo much. And they are going to shift everybody into this big \ngovernment-run program, which not only, I guess, do I have issue with \nthe whole notion that we would hand the keys to one-sixth of our entire \neconomy to the Federal Government, but I think, more importantly than \nthat, it gets to the very basic issue that most Americans instinctively \nagree with, and that is they ought to have freedom, they ought to have \nthe choice to choose their health care provider, and they ought to make \ndecisions in consultation with their physicians about what is the best \nprocedure to use.\n  The problem with the approach the Democrats on the HELP Committee \nhave taken--and, incidentally, when it passed yesterday, it was on a \npartisan-line vote. All the amendments that were offered by Republicans \nto try to change it or make it better or improve\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nit or at least have some of their policy ideas incorporated were shot \ndown on a party-line vote.\n  But it seems to me, at least, that if we are going to do something \nabout health care, we should not hand the entire health care system in \nthis country to the Federal Government and have them imposing \nthemselves and them making the decisions that historically have been \nmade by individuals, by consumers, by patients, and their health care \nproviders. That is a fundamental principle of our American tradition; \nthat is, that we believe in freedom.\n  The European model and the Canadian model on health care, which is \noften used and touted, is a different one. But that is not the American \nway. That has never been the American way. The American way is freedom; \nit is choice; it is individual responsibility, all of which should be \nemphasized in any health care reforms we pass; I might add again, all \nof which ought to lead not to higher costs but to lower costs in our \nhealth care system.\n  For the record, as well, there are a number of organizations that \nhave looked very closely at the House bill and are now analyzing the \nSenate HELP Committee-passed bill and have concluded it is a bad idea. \nIt is not just a bad idea for the taxpayers who are going to be stuck \nwith the higher taxes or the increased borrowing from future \ngenerations to finance it, it is not just a bad idea because it puts \nthe government in the way and fundamentally interjects it into the \nrelationship between patients and their health care providers but also \nbecause it would kill jobs in our economy.\n  We have an economy that is very fragile, that is struggling. We have \nunemployment at 9.5 percent. Perhaps it is going to double-digit levels \nfor the first time in a long time in our country.\n  So you have the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, and the Business Roundtable that have sent a \nletter. This letter came out, I think, yesterday. It was in response to \nthe House health care reform legislation. But it objects to a number of \nprovisions in the bill.\n  Specifically, the letter warns that the pay-or-play provision could \nend up killing many jobs. The new Federal health board ``would have \nsignificant power but be highly unaccountable to the American people.'' \nThen it goes on to say that cost shifting created by the government-run \nplan ``would significantly increase costs for every American who \npurchases private insurance.''\n  So the major organizations that represent the job creators in this \ncountry--the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the Business Roundtable; a number of other \norganizations, I would add to that, I think are issuing similar type \nstatements and letters--have concluded it would kill jobs, it would \nreduce the accountability we would have with the American people, and, \nfinally, it would significantly increase costs to Americans who have to \npurchase insurance.\n  So I guess the bottom line in all this is, there is sort of a big \nrush to get this done. The theory is, we have to get this done before \nthe August recess. The House is supposed to have this bill marked up \nnext week and on the floor, perhaps, the following week. And the Senate \nis trying to figure out a way to wedge this into all the things we have \nto do. We have the Defense authorization bill on the floor this week \nand next. We have the Sotomayor nomination that will have to come \nbefore the Senate at some point before the August break. But there is \nsomehow this belief around here that we have to jam through this health \ncare bill because if we do not seize the moment and do it now, we are \nnot going to get it done.\n  Well, I would argue we ought to get it done right rather than do it \nfast and do it in haste. The Hippocratic Oath for physicians is: ``Do \nno harm.'' That ought to be the oath we, as Members of Congress, take \nwith regard to this health care debate. From everything I have seen and \nread from the experts, from the professionals, from the Congressional \nBudget Office, who have analyzed the health care bills--both the one \nthat is going to be debated in the House and the Senate committee-\npassed version--all the analysis that has been done suggests it would \ndo great harm, great harm to the taxpayers who are going to be footing \nthat $1 trillion or $2 trillion bill; great harm to the economy, where \nit will cost us jobs; and great harm, I believe as well, to the \nAmerican consumer, the health care consumer, who is going to have to \npay the cost of this in the form of higher premiums and who will also \ndeal with what could be rationed health care; that is, fewer choices, \nfewer options because the government is going to be deciding which \nprocedures are covered and which are not.\n  So we need to take our time. We need to do this right. There are lots \nof things, as I mentioned earlier, that I think actually do reform the \nhealth care system in the country, do lower costs, and make it more \naffordable to more Americans, and those ought to be what we focus on.\n  But as was reported this morning by the CBO, a program that will bend \nthe cost curve upward--not just from the trillion dollars we all know \nit is going to cost in the near term but perhaps trillions of dollars \nin the long term--is a bad direction to go for health care in this \ncountry, it is a bad direction to go for our economy, and it is a bad \ndirection to go for the American taxpayer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I certainly concur with the statement \nof my colleague from South Dakota as to what he is saying about the \nhealth insurance issue and the need to do it right rather than fast. I \nthink it is critically important.\n  I would like to bring to the body's attention something that was on \nthe front page of the Washington Post today. It is an article about \n``Who Will Succeed Kim Jong Il?'' and the point being: Here is a \ncountry that has recently tested missiles that can reach Hawaii, that \nhas recently tested a nuclear device. He is gravely ill. Some are \nreporting he has pancreatic cancer. We don't know for sure what he has. \nBut the question is, Who will succeed Kim Jong Il? And what does that \nmean to the United States? And what are we doing about it?\n  In our office, we are working on a piece of legislation to try to \nstart some planning on our part as to what we should be doing if the \nleader in North Korea falls and if the state fails in North Korea, \nwhich is a very real possibility: that the overall state apparatus in \nNorth Korea will fail, that you will have hundreds of thousands, \npossibly millions, of people seeking to flee that country or--in a grip \nof searching for food--moving around to try to find food, that nuclear \nweapons will not be well watched, and the missile capacity that is \nthere--all in a state that is failing and may fall altogether.\n  The reason I point this out is, we are on the Defense authorization \nbill. It is a very important piece of legislation. It is a key piece of \nlegislation. It is a piece of legislation we pass every year because it \nis so important to the future of this country and so important to the \ndefense of this country.\n  Here is a moment where we are looking at a potential nuclear threat, \nmissile threat, to the United States and we ought to take up this issue \nand we ought to deal with the Defense authorization bill and, instead, \nwe are on hate crimes legislation. The majority party has 60 votes to \nbe able to move to that on another piece of legislation and should if \nthey want to bring that up. But why here? And why are we eating up a \ncouple days to do this on this bill, when we have these sorts of \nthreats staring us right in the face?\n  I am going to put forward an amendment on the Defense authorization \nbill asking that we relist North Korea as a terrorist country. I think \nwe ought to look at going at their financial instruments. I think we \nclearly need to be planning for the failure of this state, and we ought \nto be looking, as a humanitarian issue, at the failure of this state. I \nthink we ought to be looking, as a security issue, at the failure of \nthis state.\n  If North Korea falls, are we rushing in to try to secure the nuclear \nsites? Is South Korea? Is China? Is everybody in some sort of agreement \nas to what takes place to secure these nuclear sites?\n  What are we doing on humanitarian issues for 20 million people, many \nof whom will be starving during that period of time--where a number of \nthem are starving now in North Korea?\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n  This is a very present and pressing issue and instead we are on hate \ncrimes legislation.\n  As a nation, we will not tolerate violent crime, and I am appalled by \nnews stories of individuals being assaulted or even killed because of \ntheir ethnicity, their beliefs, who they are. I am appalled by violence \ndone to those who choose any sort of lifestyle they may choose. I \nbelieve we must send a strong message through our law enforcement and \njudicial system that such attacks would bring the full force of law \nupon those who commit such terrible acts.\n  I do appreciate the good will and sincerity of those who wish to \nexpand hate crimes legislation. However, I do not believe such \nlegislation in this body from the Federal Government is the answer. I \ndo not think that is something we should be doing on a Department of \nDefense authorization bill when we are facing such key strategic \nthreats internationally and we have forces in the field in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan today. This is not the place. This is not the time.\n  First, I believe that the severity of a crime should be based upon \nactions committed. If a violent crime is committed, then the \nperpetrator should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. \nEvery violent crime ought to be treated as severe, regardless of why it \nwas committed. Every life has value, and every murder is an egregious \ncrime.\n  Our law enforcement and judicial system should be focused on holding \nindividuals accountable for what they do, not what they think, feel or \nbelieve. During the passage of the Statute for Establishing Religious \nFreedom in 1785, James Madison expressed, ``extinguished for ever the \nambitious hope of making laws for the human mind.'' He clearly opposed \nany law that punished the thoughts or motives of people. Laws already \nexist to punish crimes themselves.\n  The Matthew Shepard, hate crimes bill authorizes the prosecution of a \ncrime motivated by actually or perceived race, color, religion national \norigin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \nvictim. This is another example in which a thought or belief becomes an \nelement of prosecuting crime.\n  Second, I oppose this bill because I believe it would usurp the power \nand jurisdiction of the States. It violates constitutional federalism \nby asserting Federal law enforcement power to police local conduct over \nwhich the Constitution has reserved sole authority to the 50 States. No \nmatter how upset Americans and politicians might be about certain \ncriminal behavior, every criminal offense and every authorization of \ncriminal enforcement power should be restricted by the explicit \nprinciples of the Constitution as well as our long-established criminal \nlaw precedents.\n  Currently, 45 States, as well as the District of Columbia, have hate \ncrime laws. Many of these State laws carry heavier penalties than those \nproposed in this hate crimes bill. During the Judiciary Committee's \nhearing on hate crimes, Secretary Holder was asked to prove that there \nis evidence that hate crimes cases are not receiving proper prosecution \nand sentencing at the State level. He was unable to produce any.\n  Even members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the commission \nof the U.S. Federal Government charged with the responsibility for \ninvestigating, reporting on, and making recommendations concerning \ncivil rights issues that face the Nation, oppose this bill. Their \nconcern is that this law will allow Federal officials to reprosecute \ndefendants who have already been acquitted by State juries.\n  Third, all crime victims deserve equal protection under the law. This \nis granted to them under the 14th amendment. Hate crime laws create a \nmultilevel system of justice in which some crime victims' cases are \nprosecuted more severely than others.\n  Recently during the hate crimes debate in the House of \nRepresentatives, amendments to add military personnel, pregnant women, \nthe elderly, and the homeless to the list of protected classes were all \ndefeated. It is wrong to attempt to set up the law to favor one class \nof Americans over another.\n  Fourth, during the Judiciary hearing on hate crimes, Michael \nLieberman of the Anti-Defamation League, when referring to hate crimes, \nsaid that ``these are selective prosecutions.'' We have also heard a \nlot of talk about wanting the Federal Government to send a message \nabout the severity of hate crimes. I cannot endorse the idea that \ncriminal law should be selective or be used to send a message. Its \npurpose is to prosecute criminal action, not to make selective \nstatements.\n  Finally, I oppose this bill because I am concerned that it could be \nused to prosecute against religious leaders and organizations for \nspeaking out against acts they find morally unacceptable. Hate crime \nlaws have already been used in foreign countries to silence people of \nfaith who speak their opinion on homosexuality that is derived from \ntheir faith.\n  The other side continues to insist that this bill does not prosecute \nspeech, only criminal actions. Yet there is great concern within \nreligious communities that the Federal Government could prosecute their \nleaders and members criminally based on their speech or other protected \nactivity. This is a chilling threat to the first amendment right to \nfree speech for people of faith and freedom of religion. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I wish to point out and say to my colleagues, particularly the \nchairman who is on the floor, my hope is, once we get past hate crimes, \nwe will remain on the Department of Defense authorization and take up \nthe issue of North Korea. I know some may say: Well, that is not \ngermane to the Department of Defense bill. I think it is a lot closer \nthan what we are on right now. I would hope we would bring up this \nissue because of the clear and present problems we are facing on this \nissue.\n  I know the chairman of this committee knows this issue very well. I \nhave worked with him on this issue previously. So we have now a \nbipartisan bill to relist them as a terrorist country that we are \nbringing forward. I met with our nominee to be Ambassador to China \ntoday, saying we should begin planning with the Chinese Government \ntoday for the failure of the North Korea state taking place in this \nsuccessionist order.\n  The North Koreans are acting peculiarly, even by North Korean \nstandards, with all the missiles they have launched, the nuclear \nweapons they have put in play, the things they have stated lately. They \nare normally provocative, but this is an all-out scale of provocation \nthat is taking place now.\n  It would be my hope we could bring this up and at least start to \naddress what clearly is opening to be a major problem. Whether the \nObama administration wants to address it now or the Senate wants to \naddress it now, we may not have a choice. If he is facing pancreatic \ncancer and there is a successionist battle taking place in a nuclear-\narmed missile country of North Korea and us having 25,000, 27,000 \ntroops just south in South Korea, we may not have a choice. We need to \nget this addressed. So I would hope the chairman of the committee could \ntake this up at that proper time.\n  I appreciate this chance and to be able to put this statement into \nthe Record. I think it is prudent for us to start to address some \nthings that are right on and in front of us rather than this hate \ncrimes legislation that does not apply to the Department of Defense \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first of all, while my good friend from \nKansas is on the floor, let me say, we look forward to seeing the \nlanguage he is going to be offering on North Korea. His description of \nNorth Korea as a threat is an accurate description. I do not know that \nthe terrorist state list fits them, but surely the threatening state \nlist fits them very directly. We look forward to seeing that language \nand trying to work with him and his colleagues on that amendment.\n  Nobody should be targeted because of the color of their skin, their \nreligion, their disability, their gender or their sexual orientation. \nFor years now, I have joined many colleagues, with the leadership of \nSenator Kennedy, in supporting passage of the Matthew Shepard Local Law \nEnforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n  We have seen hate crimes increase in this country, most recently at \nthe Holocaust Museum here in Washington. \n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nAccording to the FBI, between 1998 and 2007, more than 77,000 hate \ncrimes incidents were reported. The legislation we are offering that \nthe majority leader has introduced will help prevent and deter these \ncrimes.\n\n  This language, the Matthew Shepard bill, passed the Senate with \nbipartisan support as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill in \nSeptember of 2007. This is not new. This language is offered on this \nbill. Cloture was invoked then by a vote of 60 to 39. The hate crimes \namendment before us will, for the first time, give the Justice \nDepartment jurisdiction over crimes of violence which are committed not \nonly because of a person's race, color, religion, and national origin, \nwhich we already have on the books, but also based on gender, sexual \norientation, or disability.\n  There have been some statements made about restraints on speech. The \nlanguage is very clear it only applies to violent acts, and it \nemphasizes explicitly in this amendment that it puts no limits or \nrestraints on constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct, or \nactivities, including but not limited to the exercise of religion, \nwhich is protected by the first amendment, or peaceful activities such \nas picketing or demonstrations. The law we are proposing will continue \nto punish violent acts only, not beliefs. It is crucial that we \nunderstand this legislation only applies to violent, bias-motivated \ncrimes and does not infringe on any conduct protected by the first \namendment.\n  The first amendment right to organize, to preach against, or speak \nagainst any way of life, or any person, is left intact with this \nlegislation.\n  Again, we are not starting from scratch. The law already prohibits \nviolent crimes based on race, color, national origin, or religion. This \namendment would add disability, sexual orientation, gender, and gender \nidentity.\n  The amendment ensures that State and local law enforcement will \nretain primary jurisdiction over investigations and prosecutions. The \namendment has a strong certification provision that authorizes the \nFederal Government to step in only when needed. Prior to indicting a \nperson, the Justice Department must certify that the State in which the \nhate crime occurred either does not have the jurisdiction, the State \nhas asked the Federal Government to assume jurisdiction, or that a \nState prosecution has failed to vindicate the Federal interest against \nhate-motivated violence, or a Federal prosecution is necessary to \nsecure substantial justice.\n  Now, why this bill? Why on this bill? First, it is common practice in \nthe Senate to offer to bills, although the amendment is of a different \nsubject. In other words, this is not the first. For 200-plus years, \namendments have been offered to bills which are not relevant to the \nbill before us. That is the Senate. It occurs dozens of times every \nsession.\n  There are not many subjects that are more important than the subject \nof hate crimes. This bill is an available vehicle for an important \nsubject. We have done this before on this bill.\n  One other thing that I feel keenly about as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, this bill embodies values of diversity and freedom \nthat our men and women in uniform fight to defend.\n  As Senator Kennedy said in 2007 when we debated this legislation:\n\n       We want to be able to have a value system that is worthy \n     for our brave men and women to defend. They are fighting \n     overseas for our values. One of the values is that we should \n     not, in this country, in this democracy, permit the kind of \n     hatred and bigotry that has stained the history of this \n     Nation over a considerable period of time. We should not \n     tolerate it. We keep faith with these men and women who are \n     serving overseas when we battle that hatred and bigotry and \n     prejudice at home. So we are taking a few minutes in the \n     morning to have this debate and discussion.\n\n  Those were Senator Kennedy's words.\n  This is not a long debate by Senate standards. This is a reasonably \nlong debate to give everybody an opportunity to express their views. \nBut we have debated this before 2 years ago. We have adopted this \nbefore 2 years ago. It was the right thing to do then for the men and \nwomen of our country, as well as to keep the faith with the men and \nwomen who put on the uniform of this Nation and fight for the values \nthis Nation represents.\n  Finally, America has taken many steps throughout our history on a \nlong road to becoming a more inclusive Nation, and our diversity is one \nof our greatest strengths. Our tolerance for each other's differences \nis part of the lamp that can help bring light to a world which is \nenveloped in bigotry and intolerance. Hopefully, we can take another \nstep if we adopt this amendment.\n  So the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 furthers \nthe goal of protecting our citizens from crimes of hate and deterring \nthose crimes. I hope we have a resounding cloture vote, and again, \nhopefully, that can occur later on this evening.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Energy and Climate Change\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, earlier today, during the Democratic \npolicy committee luncheon, we were privileged to hear from the CEOs of \nthree of America's largest companies: DuPont, Siemens, and Duke Energy. \nIt seems we are reaching that point in Washington where folks are \nstarting to line up to argue ideological and nonfactual points of view \nwith respect to one of the major issues facing our country. This is not \nunusual. Every great debate in history--certainly since I have been in \nthe Senate and well before that--has always been subject to one \ninterest group's or another interest group's interests. Those are often \nconditioned by phony studies, by one particular industry's funded \nstudy, almost inevitably always not peer-reviewed.\n  So it is that we are beginning to see this kind of a lineup now as a \nresponse to the action taken by the House of Representatives, which \npassed climate change legislation, and a response to the schedule that \nthe majority leader has put us on in the Senate with respect to this \nlegislation. So I wanted to take just a couple of minutes and come to \nthe Senate floor, and I intend to do this on a periodic basis over the \ncourse of the next weeks and months as we begin to think about our own \napproach in the Senate to this critical issue.\n  Let me say to the Chair and to my colleagues that I hope we can all \nkeep open minds so we will look at this in the context that it ought to \nbe looked at, which is the national security interests, the security \ninterests of our Nation; i.e, energy independence, the fact that we \nsend hundreds of billions of dollars every year to parts of the world \nthat doesn't wind up being invested in American jobs, in America's \ndirect future and, in many cases, money which winds up in the hands of \njihadists in one country or another and works against American \ncompetitiveness. That is one reason to think about this issue \nseriously.\n  Another is that China, India, and other countries are taking this \nissue very seriously.\n  Again, today we heard from the CEO of one of America's largest \ncorporations. I think DuPont is one of the largest chemical companies \nin the world. The CEO said very directly to us that he is concerned \nabout China's commitment as opposed to our commitment, and the fact \nthat out of the top 30 solar, wind, and battery companies in the world, \nonly 5 are in the United States of America.\n  We are the country that invented many of these technologies, but \nbecause ideology trumped fact and reason in the course of the 1980s, \nthe guts were pulled from the energy laboratory out in Colorado, and \nthe United States lost its lead in photovoltaics, alternatives, \nrenewables, to Japan, to Germany, and other countries.\n  Ironically, as the Cold War ended and we had invested so heavily in \nthat victory in the beginning of the 1990s, we saw the countries that \nhad been locked in by the Communist bloc--the now Czech Republic, then \nCzechoslovakia,\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nBulgaria, Romania, other countries that sought to undo the devastation \nof the command control policies that had spread ash within 50 miles of \na powerplant so there was no living plant, and you couldn't grow \nanything and the rivers were polluted and the lakes and so forth, and \nthey sought to undo that--where did they go for the technology? They \nwent to Germany and Japan. We lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, \neconomists currently estimate, by the blinders we put on that precluded \nus from buying into the future, from investing in that future.\n  So I hope colleagues will look carefully at the economic realities \nthat are staring at us right now. China is investing $12 million-plus \nper hour in a green economy. They are investing six times the amount of \nmoney of the United States of America. The Pew Foundation has found \nthat from 1996, approximately, until 2007, the greatest job growth in \nour country came from the alternative renewable energy sector, from new \ntechnologies--about 9.1 percent, as opposed to the growth of about 3.7 \npercent or so that we saw in the normal job sector.\n  In a State such as North Dakota, for instance, I think they have had \nabout 30 percent growth in the alternative renewable energy sector, and \nthey rank today 24th in the Nation in terms of wind power production. \nBut the Wind Institute tells us they could be No. 1 because they have \nthe best wind in the world--in the United States, at any rate--and they \ncould produce 10,000 times the entire electricity needs of the State of \nNorth Dakota just from wind power alone. That is a huge amount of jobs \nto be created and a huge amount of money to be gained, a lowering of \ncost for their consumers, and we could go to other States around the \ncountry and find similar patterns, where there are very significant \nincreases in the economic base of the alternative renewable energy \nsector to the exclusion of a very flat level--if not no growth--with \nrespect to normal sectors of our economy. What is critical is that \nChina--I just spent a week there about a month ago, purposefully going \nthere to meet with Chinese leaders about global climate change.\n\n  Obviously, I am as committed as any colleague in the Senate to \ncreating an agreement with other nations that holds everybody \naccountable. Obviously, if the United States does this all by itself, \nit is not going to work. But China is sitting there saying the same \nthing: If we do this and the United States doesn't do it, it is not \ngoing to work.\n  The problem is that the U.S. bona fides on this aren't very good. The \nfact is, we have been deniers of the existence of the problem, while \nother countries are proceeding to try to deal with it. The fact is, we \nwere, until last year, the world's major emitter of global greenhouse \ngases. It is very difficult to go to other countries and say, you have \nto do this and that, and they look at us and say, what have you done \nabout it?\n  For countries in Africa and in the less developed world--Indonesia, \nparts of South Asia, and other places--they look at us and say: Listen, \nfor the last 50 years, you guys have been creating this problem. We \nhave not been able to develop, we are not a developed nation, and you \nare sitting there telling us we have to make up for the problem you \nhave created, and now we have to spend a lot of money for it.\n  The fact is, they are willing to be part of it, they are willing to \nbe part of the solution, but the United States has to step up and show \nleadership and take action. The bottom line is this: If the United \nStates doesn't step up and take action and show leadership, we are not \ngoing to get an agreement in Copenhagen and things will get worse. Some \npeople will say: So what; maybe we will do it down the road. I have \nnews for you--and this is absolutely substantiated in science, as well \nas in technology and economic modeling--if we don't do it now, every \nyear we delay, it gets harder and more expensive and it gets more \ndangerous.\n  If you really want to look out for the citizens in your States, do it \nnow because it will be less expensive to do it now than it will be in \nthe future. The real taxpayer protection effort here is to do climate \nchange now. That is why, as I said, CEOs of major corporations in our \ncountry are saying: Give us certainty in the marketplace and give it to \nus now so that we know what our investments will be as we go forward \nand we can put together a business plan that is intelligent, \nthoughtful, and based on the realities of where the economy is going to \ngo.\n  Huge fluctuation in natural gas prices or in the price of coal or \nwhat is going to happen with respect to sequestration--all those things \ncreate enormous uncertainty. If you are a coal State, a coal interest--\nand we have plenty of them here--you ought to step back and look at \nwhat is happening in the marketplace.\n  Coal is under pressure now. We had Jim Rogers of Duke Energy tell us \ntoday that they have had a whole bunch of coal plants canceled. They \nhave had them canceled on them by States that are refusing to proceed \nforward using coal. The fact is, a lot of States are turning away from \ncoal. They are doing that because of the price issues but also because \nof the pollution issues.\n  If you are a coal State and you want a future for coal, the way to \nprotect that future is not to wait until the EPA regulates on its own, \nwithout coming to the table with help for the transition costs; the way \nto protect it is to recognize that you have to develop a clean coal \ncapacity. The only way to develop a clean coal capacity is to get the \nallowances that come through a cap-and-trade system to be able to \nprovide for a transitional support system that allows those companies \nto transition for the future.\n  The fact is, in the bill that passed in the House--I don't know what \nthe level in the Senate will be--there is a billion dollars a year for \n10 years for clean coal efforts.\n  So the best way to protect coal and protect America, ultimately--\nbecause we have a lot of coal, and it would be wonderful if we were \nable to burn it but do it cleanly--is to commit now to a system where \nwe are able to provide the support necessary to develop clean coal. The \ntruth is that we know what happens if you don't make this a mandatory \nstructure.\n  In 1992, President George Herbert Walker Bush committed us to a \nvoluntary protocol in Rio, at what was called the Earth Summit. I went \nthere, together with other Senators, including Max Baucus, Frank \nLautenberg, Larry Pressler, John Chafee, Tim Wirth, and Al Gore. We \nwent as a delegation. The President came and gave a speech there, and \nwe committed to a voluntary framework to deal with global climate \nchange in 1992.\n  Here we are, years later, and it hasn't worked. During the last 8 \nyears, America's emissions of global greenhouse gases went up four \ntimes faster than during the 1990s. We have gone backward. While we are \ngoing backward, the science is coming back more and more compelling by \nthe day.\n  The Siberian Shelf Study, just released a few months ago, shows \ncolumns of methane rising from the ocean floor because the permafrost \nlid of the floor is melting, as it is on dry land in Alaska, where they \nvoted recently to move the Nutak Village 9 miles inland. There are \ndozens of villages in Alaska that are now moving as a consequence of \nwhat is happening to the ice shelf and the rising sea levels. As the \npermafrost lid melts, methane is being released in Russia, the Arctic, \nand other places where it is exposed. Methane is 20 times more damaging \nthan carbon dioxide. On the ocean floor, you have the columns of \nmethane visibly rising through the ocean, and when they burst out into \nopen air, if you lit a match, it would ignite. That is how potent it \nis. That is an uncontrollably dangerous potential threat to everybody \nunless we tap into it or learn how to do that or commit to some other \nmethods of controlling this.\n  The fact is, a 25-mile ice bridge that has existed for thousands upon \nthousands of years, which connected the Wilkins Ice Shelf to \nAntarctica, shattered, fell apart a number of months ago as a \nconsequence of what is happening. A number of Senators have been up to \nGreenland and have seen the level of icemelt taking place on the \nGreenland ice sheet. That Wilkins ice sheet is floating in the ocean, \nand the Greenland ice sheet is on the rock. Many scientists worry that \nthe river melt that is occurring underneath the ice sheet might, in \nfact, create a slide effect for massive amounts of ice that might break \noff and fall into the ocean. If the West Antarctic ice sheet melts and \nthe Greenland ice sheet melts, that represents a 16- to 23-foot sea \nlevel increase. That is beyond comprehension\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\nin terms of what the impact of that would be. Just a meter of an \nincrease, which is currently predicted for this century--and we are on \ntrack to actually meet or exceed that--just a meter means the \ndisappearance of Diego Garcia, the island we use to deploy important \nsupplies to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and to deal with other issues. That \nwill disappear. Countries such as Bangladesh and many islands will \ndisappear, including the coast of Florida. The threat is enormous. The \npiers in Norfolk, VA, are all cemented to the ocean floor. If that \nrises a meter, that will be a cost. You can run down the list of things \nthat will begin to happen.\n  The Arctic ice sheet had previously, a few years ago, been estimated \nto disappear by 2030 or so. Scientists are now telling us that we will \nhave the first ice-free Arctic summer by the year 2013--4 years from \nnow. That means a lot of different things. It can mean the change of \nocean currents and clearly a change in the ecosystem. It means simple \nthings like as more ice is melted and the ocean is opened up--the ocean \nis dark, the ocean absorbs sunlight. As the sunlight comes down \ndirectly onto the Earth, that is absorbed into the ocean rather than \nreflecting back up, as it used to, off the ice and snow. The result is \nthat the ocean warms even faster, which accelerates what is happening \nin the Arctic and what is happening in Greenland. So there is a \nboomerang effect to all of this.\n  It is ultimately what scientists call the ``tipping point.'' That \nbrings us to the issue of urgency here. Why is this urgent? It is \nurgent because for years scientists have been telling us that you have \nto hold down the level of greenhouse gases to--originally, they said \n550 parts per million. Then they revised that as new science came in \nand people realized things were happening faster than we thought. They \nrevised it to 450 parts per million. Now scientists are revising again, \nand they are revising again because the rate at which the science is \ncoming back tells us this is happening a lot faster than we thought and \nto a greater degree. Now they are revising it from 450 parts per \nmillion to 350 parts per million. Not everybody has accepted that, but \nthat is going on. Why is that alarming? It is alarming because we are \nat 385 parts per million today.\n  With the current rate of coal-fired powerplants coming online, the \nrate of increased emissions through new buildings and the lack of \nadequate standards on automobiles, and other things, we are pouring \nemissions into the atmosphere willy-nilly as if there is no tomorrow. \nWell, that could happen, the way we are going.\n  The fact is, what is up there already--this is scientific fact. There \nis nothing that any opponent of global climate change has ever said or \ndone or produced to indicate that this is not fact: Greenhouse gases \nlive in the atmosphere for 100 to 1,000 years. As they live in the \natmosphere, they continue to do the warming. So the warming we have \ndone already has warmed the Earth by .8 degrees centigrade. So we can \nabsolutely anticipate a compounding of that warming because the same \namount or more is up there, and it is going to continue to do the \ndamage. We don't know how to take it out of the atmosphere. So we are \nlooking at a certainty of another .8 degrees. That takes you up to 1.6. \nAnd scientists are telling us the tipping point is at 2 degrees \ncentigrade.\n  I ask my colleagues to go look at the modeling that has been done by \ncountless different groups around the world. This is not an American \nconspiracy somehow. This is not a Democratic or Republican thing. It \ndoesn't have that kind of label on it. There are thousands of \nscientists who, for 25 years or more, have been drawing conclusions \nbased on scientific analyses, and scientists--if you are a good \nscientist, you are also conservative, because all of the proclamations \nor findings you make are subject to peer review if you are a good \nscientist, if you are a legitimate study. The fact is, there are \nthousands of legitimate peer-reviewed studies that document what is \nhappening in terms of the impact of global climate change. There are \nzero--not one--peer-reviewed studies that deny those thousands--not \none. For all the industry studies you hear, all the scary tactics, like \nChicken Little, saying the sky is falling, and the numbers that are put \nout, no peer-reviewed study supports an analysis that what the \nscientists say is not happening. We are looking at the potential here \nof catastrophic implications, which is why the United States needs to \nmove.\n  The science is one thing; you can put it over here. But what is \nhappening is that other countries have committed to this. Their \npresidents, their prime ministers, their environment ministers, their \nfinance ministers--all of these people have come together and made a \ncommitment for those countries. They are moving. They accept the \nscience. They also accept the dynamics of the marketplace. They want to \nbe leaders in solar, leaders in wind, leaders in alternatives, \nrenewable, biofuels--you name it. The fact is, unless the United States \nseizes this economic opportunity, we are going to lose the chance to be \nleaders in one of the greatest markets in history.\n\n  The market that led us to great wealth during the course of the 1990s \nin the United States was the Internet and data management systems. That \nmarket was about a trillion-dollar market and about a billion users at \nthe time during the 1990s, at least when we saw great wealth created.\n  The energy market is a $6 trillion market with about 4.5 billion \nusers, many of whom are potential users in places such as India, where \nsolar could light a small village and run electricity pumps where they \nhave no water today and no pumps and no development. There are \ncountless things that could happen as a consequence of this that would \nhave profound consequences on elimination of poverty, which has \nprofound implications on eliminating jihadism in places all around the \nworld.\n  This is an opportunity to change the paradigm, if you will, into \nwhich we have been locked. The United States needs to lead. I want \nthose batteries made in Detroit and countless other cities across this \ncountry. I named Detroit because we have the skilled workforce. The \nautomobile industry is hurting. We should be building the cars for \nAmerica's high-speed rail system there. We should be building the \nbatteries there, not in China. We should be developing these \ntechnologies. These are ongoing jobs that repeat for the future, and \nthey cannot be exported. What can be exported is the technology itself, \nwhich we have an ability to go out and sell to other countries, which \nis good for the American marketplace.\n  As these weeks go on, we need to talk about this. I want to come back \nto one particular component. I want to underscore the national security \nimplications.\n  In 2007, 11 former admirals and high-ranking generals issued a report \nfrom the Center for Naval Analysis saying that climate change is a \nthreat multiplier with a potential to create ``sustained natural and \nhumanitarian disasters on a scale far beyond those that we see today.''\n  In 2008, a national intelligence assessment echoed those warnings \nfrom inside our own government. GEN Anthony Zinni, former commander of \nour forces in the Middle East, was characteristically blunt in \naddressing this threat. He says that without action ``we will pay the \nprice later in military terms, and that will involve human lives. There \nwill be a human toll.''\n  The estimates of the intelligence community and those looking at the \nnational security implications are that we could have in a few years as \nmany as 200 million climate refugees. We have an internally displaced \nissue today in Pakistan. We have it in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \ncountries. We can have environmentally displaced people who are forced \nto move because they cannot produce food because they lose water. The \nproblem of failed states will only be compounded as the instability \nthat comes with those moving populations and the challenges of \nproviding for those people grows.\n  Believe me, American ingenuity, American military capacity, American \nlift, American medical capacity, American food aid--all of these things \nwill be called on. And unless we act now, they will be called on to a \ngreater degree than is necessary.\n  So climate change, in fact, injects a major new source of chaos, of \ntension, of human insecurity into an already volatile world. It \nthreatens to bring more famine. I invite my colleagues to talk with the \ndevelopmental people in so many of these countries about the\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nproblems they are having today growing crops, about the change in \nrainfall, about the lack of water, about the desertification that is \ntaking place in places such as Darfur. Time magazine had a headline a \ncouple years ago: Do you want to prevent the next Darfur? Get serious \nabout climate change. There are linkages here, and it is essential for \nus to understand the costs.\n  None of the modeling that has been done to date tries to estimate the \ncost to the consumer, and that is a concern. In fact, there is an \nenormous amount of money being put on the table through the allowances \nto cushion this impact so that American citizens are not paying more \nfor electricity and not paying more as a consequence of these changes.\n  I believe there is a minimal cost. But the truth is that cost has not \neven yet been properly represented because no model to this date shows \nthe impact of energy efficiencies in America that will reduce the cost \nfor families. No study properly shows the cost of technology advances \nthat will reduce the cost for communities and families. And no study \nshows the cost to the American consumer of doing nothing.\n  If the United States does not do this, believe me, that is a tax on \nAmericans, and it is a lot bigger than the costs that are going to come \naffiliated with the transition to a new economy which is sustainable \nfor the long term for our Nation.\n  As we go forward, I want to say to colleagues a couple of concerns \npeople have expressed about cap and trade and other issues. The \nmarketplace: Will the marketplace abuse this? Can we trust the \nmarketplace to function? The answer is, all of us have learned some \nvery tough and bitter lessons as a result of lack of regulatory \noversight of the 1990s and the last 8 years. So we are going to have in \nour legislation in the Senate, which is not in the House, some \nmechanism by which--I am not going to go into all the details now \nbecause we are not going to lay out all the details of what we are \ngoing to do. But we are going to address this concern of market \nregulation in order to adequately guarantee transparency and \naccountability as we go forward.\n  There are other concerns people have expressed. As the next days go \non, we are going to show day for day exactly what the real costs are, \nwhat the real opportunities are, and how we can proceed.\n  I close by saying that here is the choice, really, for us as \nAmericans and as human beings. Let's say that the people who have no \npeer-reviewed studies at all, that people who want to be in the flat \nEarth caucus, or whatever, and argue this is not happening, let's say \nthey are right and we are wrong and we do the things we are going to do \nbecause we think they are the right things to do. What is the downside?\n  The downside is that America would have led the world in terms of \ntechnology because every other country is already doing this. Anybody \nwho sits there today and says: What about China, what about China, \nought to go to China and see what China is doing. China is determined \nto be the world's No. 1 producer of electric vehicles, and they are on \nthe way to doing it. China has tripled its wind power goals and \ntargets. China is putting in place right now a 20-percent reduction in \nenergy intensity, and they are ahead of the curve in almost every \nsector but one and meeting and exceeding that goal. We are not doing \nthat. They are doing that. China is the leader in wind and solar \ntechnology. China has a stronger commitment on automobile levels of \nemissions than we do, and it is going into effect before ours.\n  I have talked with a number of well-respected observers, both in \nbusiness and in journalism, who have been to China recently, and they \nhave come back shaking their heads and saying: If we don't get our act \nin gear, China is going to clean our clock, and we are going to be \nchasing China in 3 or 4 years.\n  If you are concerned about holding China accountable to a system, we \nbetter put something in place because that is the only way we are going \nto get a mechanism in Copenhagen that is going to help hold everybody \nin place.\n  Here is the bottom line. If we don't get that mechanism, the \nPresident is not going to send anything up here, and we are not going \nto pass it at that point. We are not going to accept some global system \nthat does not address this globally. We have been through that with \nKyoto.\n  The fact is the United States has to do what it has to do in order to \nmake Copenhagen happen, in order to lead the globe in this effort. I \nhope our colleagues will recognize that.\n  What else will happen if we are wrong and they are right? We will \nhave cleaned up the air. We will have better health quality in America \nbecause we will have better air quality because we will have reduced \nparticulates in the air by reducing global emissions.\n  The largest single cost of children's health care in the course of \nthe summer in the United States of America is children being committed \nto hospitals because of air quality, asthma attacks, in the course of \nthe summer, and it is rising as a problem in our country.\n  It will have reduced hospital costs, better quality of air, better \nhealth. What else is a downside of doing this correctly? We will have \ncreated millions of new jobs. We see that happening right now. Think of \nwhat happens when we set a global target and when the United States \nsets its own national target and businesses say: Hey, there is money to \nbe made there.\n  We have better transmission lines so we can send electricity produced \nfrom solar in Nevada or in Oklahoma or Texas, or somewhere, and you can \nsell it to the rest of the country because it can actually be \ntransported there. The minute we do that, the private sector is going \nto say: Wow, that is worth investing in because we can make a return on \nour investment.\n  Look at the size of the market. Today we cannot do that because we \ncannot send it around the country because we don't have a transmission \nsystem that allows us to do that.\n  The worst that would happen is we move down the road to have cheaper \nelectricity because we can move it from alternatives, renewables all \naround the country, have a smarter grid, and have the ability to reduce \ncosts for Americans.\n  What is another downside? Another downside is we might actually \nreduce poverty around the world because of technology advances. We \nmight reduce the instability of countries and improve our own security, \nand we will reduce energy dependence because we will be able to produce \nour own energy at home and not depend on sending hundreds of billions \nof dollars to other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. That is \na downside.\n  What is the downside if they are wrong? Catastrophe, absolute \ncatastrophe because we go beyond the tipping point. I cannot stand here \nand tell you everything that is going to happen. But I read enough and \nhave seen enough of what the scientists say are the potential impacts, \nand I have seen enough of those impacts already coming true. Just by \nevidence and common sense, you say to yourself: I don't want to put \nthis to the test because there is no way to come back from it. There is \nno way to go over that tipping point and turn the clock backwards. That \nis the choice for all of us.\n  I hope in the course of this debate we are going to have the kind of \ndebate on the facts, on real studies, peer-reviewed studies, on \nanalyses that make sense so we can make the kinds of judgments that the \nSenate deserves and that the American people deserve.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I heard the Senator from \nMassachusetts laying out the scenario we face not just as Americans but \nas inhabitants of this wonderful planet Earth. I was compelled to come \nto the floor and talk about what we are doing in Colorado in seizing \nthe opportunities that the Senator from Massachusetts points out.\n  He described ably and eloquently what I have characterized as a ``no \nregrets'' policy. We ought to take all of these steps because whether \nor not climate change materializes--and I am one who believes the \nscience is very powerfully pointing in that direction--all of those \nsteps would result in the benefits he described. Today I want to bring \nmy home State perspective to\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\nthis debate over cleaner, safer, and more secure energy sources.\n  When we make this change, we will improve our national security. We \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil, we protect our Earth, and we \npreserve the air we breathe and the water we drink. Most of all, we \nkeep faith with our children. I have long believed that we do not \ninherit the Earth from our parents; we are actually borrowing it and \nall its majesty from our children.\n  Colorado has a unique perspective on this opportunity, and I think \nAmerica can benefit from our experiences.\n  For many years, we have been a national leader in developing energy \nsources that are traditional, such as coal and natural gas. And in \nrecent years, we have begun to lead the Nation in producing renewable \nenergy from the Sun, the wind, and from biomass.\n  In 2004--the Presiding Officer, who is a former Governor, can \nunderstand the symbolism of what we did--I led a campaign along with \nthe Republican speaker of our State house, Lola Spradley, to create a \nrenewable electricity standard for our State. We barnstormed together \nin our State in that highly partisan 2004 election. We surprised people \nthat a Democrat and Republican were campaigning together. It was not a \nRepublican or Democratic issue; it was a Colorado issue and, more \nimportantly, it was a Colorado opportunity.\n  There were naysayers who tried to scare our voters by saying the \nrenewable standard would raise energy costs and harm our economy. But \nour voters decided to take up the challenge and to commit to generating \n10 percent of our electricity from the Sun and from the wind and other \nclean sources of energy. Our clean energy producers went to work after \nwe passed this measure, and just 3 years later our legislature, \nrealizing we were soon to reach that goal, said: Let's double the \nstandard. So we now have a 20-percent standard we are committing to \nreach by the year 2020.\n\n  We are fortunate to have these ample supplies of clean energy \nresources in Colorado. But the real key to this has been releasing the \ningenuity of our people and then setting goals that create a \nsustainable future. I wanted to share some examples from Colorado \nspecifically.\n  Just last week, Tristate, a Colorado utility, joined with a \nsubsidiary of Duke Energy and announced plans to build a wind power \nfacility in Kit Carson, CO, out in our eastern plains.\n  Vestas--which many are familiar with as the Danish wind turbine \nsupplier--recently broke ground on two new manufacturing plants in the \ncity of Brighton that will eventually employ over 1,300 people. It is \nalso building a $250 million plant in Pueblo that will be the largest \nfacility of its kind and employ 500 people.\n  Our Governor, Bill Ritter, has estimated that the solar component--we \nhad a solar component in our renewable electricity standard, \nspecifically to generate solar energy activity--has brought over 1,500 \nnew jobs to Colorado.\n  I think it is fair to say we have wind turbines sprouting and growing \nlike trees on our eastern plains and we have solar farms that are \ncovering the entire San Luis Valley, which is one of our agricultural \ngems. This is as a direct result of Coloradans setting a goal and \nsaying we are going to meet that goal. I guess I am optimistic enough \nabout America to know that America can follow Colorado's lead. For me, \nit is when, not if, we commit to a cleaner, more sustainable energy \nfuture, we will lead the world in this next great technological \nrevolution.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts spoke to the awe-inspiring numbers \nthat are potentials--a $6 trillion economy--waiting for us out there if \nwe will only commit to pursuing it. The Union of Concerned Scientists \nhas estimated that a 25-percent renewable electricity standard by 2025 \nwill lead to almost 300,000 new jobs in America, $260-plus billion in \nnew capital investments, $13 billion in income to farmers, ranchers and \nrural landowners, and $12 billion in local and State tax revenues. \nConsumers would save $64 billion in lower electricity bills by 2025, \nwhile we would reduce the carbon pollution emitted by cars that would \nbe the equivalent of taking 45 million vehicles off of our roads.\n  I am talking about jobs, Madam President, but it goes much further \nthan that. If, and I say when, we develop a clean energy economy, we \nwill create a new manufacturing base. It will protect our lands and our \nwater, and it will align a policy compass that helps us navigate toward \na more prosperous future.\n  I would like to take a minute and emphasize that the clean energy \nfuture I paint doesn't mean the abandonment of traditional sources of \nenergy. We have coal and oil and natural gas in abundance. Nor should \nit shut the door on nuclear power. Quite the opposite. These sources \nwill remain an essential component of our energy mix for the \nforeseeable future. I think, as Colorado's experience shows, a balanced \nenergy portfolio will work and that we can find that sweet spot in an \nenergy mix for the future.\n  We have ample supplies of fossil fuel in Colorado, and we ought to \ncontinue to develop those sources. They are crucial to the livelihood \nof tens of thousands of Coloradans and still comprise the majority of \nour electric generation. Natural gas, in particular, is a clean and \ndomestic source of energy, and it will be a crucial bridge fuel to the \nfuture.\n  We have massive quantities of oil shale potential on our western \nslope, and we should continue to research to see if we can produce it \nin a commercially viable way and in an environmentally sensitive \nmanner.\n  Colorado has been able to bridge the divide, literally, between our \nwestern slope and our eastern plains and between conventional sources \nof energy from the last century and the clean sources of the future, \nand the rest of America must now do the same.\n  The bottom line, though, Madam President, is we must have a \ncomprehensive energy policy that transitions us to cleaner, safer, and \nmore sustainable sources of energy while making full use of existing \nsources in a responsible manner.\n  In Colorado, we have a very tangible interest in America adopting \nbroad clean energy sources and therefore limiting our contribution of \ncarbon into the atmosphere, and I would like to focus on one key \nelement of life on our planet, and that is water.\n  Water is the lifeblood of the entire West. When you grow up in the \ndesert, as I did, you learn to treasure water. You learn that \neverything is shaped by it, and it may not always be there when you \nneed it if you don't husband those resources. My constituents know that \nmaintaining our water supply is crucial to the health of their families \nand to preserving the way of life we so value in the West. We have \nsuffered through water shortages. We have seen drought.\n  My father's generation--not that far removed from our generation--\nexperienced the great Dust Bowl of the 1930s. That was an ecological \ndisaster that reminds us that while we are smart as a species, and we \nare industrious, Mother Nature always bats last.\n  When scientists look at our part of the country, they predict that \ndroughts will get worse and precipitation patterns will decrease in \nWestern States because of our use of and dependence on the traditional \nsources over the last century. People in Colorado know we can't ignore \nthis threat. We have seen acre after acre of our forests devastated by \nthe mountain pine beetle--an epidemic that was exacerbated by a warming \nclimate that will get worse in the hotter drier conditions to come. \nWhen they see that, when I see that, we know that doing nothing is not \nan option.\n  The cost of inaction is simply too high, and you see that point of \nview in all the States in my region of the country, regardless of the \nleadership at the gubernatorial level, at the legislative level. No \nmatter what part of the country we are from, we have a stake in \ncrafting a new energy policy. Beyond regional interests, members of \nboth political parties know we have to meet this challenge because if \nwe don't, it is not only our economic prosperity that is at stake, our \nnational security is at stake.\n  I was inspired this week to see that our former colleague, the highly \nrespected, now retired, Senator John Warner, is traveling across the \ncountry making the case for a plan to address the threats from climate \nchange. We can debate the causes of climate change, and we should \ncontinue to have that debate, but we know what we must do.\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\n  First, we must lead the world in a clean energy revolution, and next \nwe must acknowledge that our reliance on foreign sources of oil and \nfossil fuels isn't a sustainable strategy. Third, we must act soon.\n  I used to think having a discussion about adapting to the changes \nbeing brought about by the emission of carbon was a mistake, and that \nby looking at adapting we were giving in to the problem. But I have \ncome to realize that we have to be realistic and we have to recognize \nthat the changes that are coming will have real impacts on all of us. \nIf we don't act now, the changes that are coming at us and bearing down \non us will have a terrible effect on future generations, and we will be \ndoing those generations a terrible disservice.\n  The longer we wait, the longer we deny, the longer we spend debating, \nthe harder and, frankly, the more expensive it will be to deal with \nthose changes. So the time to act is now. I urge all of our colleagues \nto join together to pass a strong, clean energy bill. We can drive \nAmerica with clean energy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, America has been listening to the \nconfirmation hearings of Judge Sotomayor--the lengthy rounds of \nquestioning, the probative approach of the members of the committee--\nand we have seen an extraordinary jurist in action. We have seen her \nresponses, witnessed the depth, dignity, and clarity of her thoughtful \nobservations. We have seen a skilled, dynamic jurist carefully, \nthoroughly, calmly engage each member of the committee, showing each \nSenator a deference in tone and tenor that speaks directly to her \ntemperament and what she will bring to the debate in the hallowed halls \nof the United States Supreme Court.\n  I believe most Americans watching these hearings, though deeply \nconcerned about the substance of the issues raised fundamentally--at \nthe heart of it--care more about the person. They care about honor and \ndecency and dignity and fairness. They care about her experience. They \ncare about who Judge Sotomayor is and what she has accomplished in her \nlong judicial career. They care about the record. And the record is \nclear.\n  They care that the leaders of prominent legal and law enforcement \norganizations, who know her best and have actually seen her work, say \nshe is an exemplary, fair, and highly qualified judge. They care about \nher work fighting crime, and that as a prosecutor she put the Tarzan \nmurderer behind bars. They care that as a judge she upheld the \nconvictions of drug dealers, sexual predators, and other violent \ncriminals. They care that she respects their liberties and protections \ngranted by the Constitution, including the first amendment rights of \nthose with whom she strongly disagrees.\n  Judge Sotomayor's credentials are impeccable. Set aside for a moment \nthe fact that she graduated at the top of her class at Princeton. Set \naside her tenure as editor of the Yale Law Review. Set aside her work \nfor Robert Morgenthau in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office; set \naside her successful prosecution of child abusers, murderers, and \nwhite-collar criminals; set aside her string of victories along the \nway, not to mention her courtroom experience and practical hands-on \nknowledge of all sides of the legal system. Set aside her appointment \nby George H.W. Bush to the U.S. District Court in New York and her \nappointment by Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals; and the fact \nthat she was confirmed by a Democratic majority Senate and a Republican \nmajority Senate which alone tells this Senator--if she was good enough \ntwice, she must be good enough a third time.\n  Set all that aside, and you are left with someone who would bring \nmore judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice in the \nlast 70 years and more Federal judicial experience than anyone \nnominated to the Court in the last century.\n  Her record is clearly proof that someone so skilled, so committed, so \nfocused on the details of the law can be both an impartial arbiter and \nstill understand the deep and profound effect her decisions will have \non the day-to-day lives of everyday people.\n  Senators should focus on Judge Sotomayor's full 17-year record on the \nbench as well as her career as a prosecutor and corporate attorney.\n  She has been clear and consistent in her answers, despite repeated \nquestions and efforts to trip her up. She has been consistently more \nforthcoming than any other recent Supreme Court nominee.\n  Almost every Republican Senator has asked Judge Sotomayor, in total \nmore than a dozen times, about the same comment made in a 2001 speech, \na single speech over 8 years ago at Berkeley. She has continued to say, \nfrankly, openly, honestly, that her comment ``fell flat,'' that she \nnever intended that any person would have an advantage in judging. She \nhas given the same answer each time and each time made clear that ``her \npersonal experience does not compel a particular result and prejudice \nnever has a role in her judging.''\n  She said again yesterday: ``I do not believe that any racial, ethnic \nor gender group has an advantage in sound judging. I do believe that \nevery person has an equal opportunity to be a good and wise judge, \nregardless of their background or life experiences.''\n  I know no Senator here has ever made a speech in which their quote \nfell flat or their comments fell flat or what they intended to say was \nsomehow misconstrued. I know that has not happened among the 100 \nMembers of the Senate.\n  On gun rights, Judge Sotomayor has consistently followed precedent in \nsecond-amendment cases. Yesterday and today she has reaffirmed her view \nthat the second amendment includes the individual right to bear arms.\n  She reaffirmed, again, today her statement from yesterday, when asked \nif she would be open to considering whether the second amendment \ncreates an individual right applicable to the States, saying:\n\n       I have an open mind on the question. . . . I would not \n     prejudge any question that came before me if I was a Justice \n     on the Supreme Court.\n\n  Consistent with her judicial philosophy, she has strictly adhered to \nthe precedent in considering gun rights and on her commitment to the \nrule of law Judge Sotomayor has repeatedly stated over and over that \nshe is committed to precedent and the rule of law in every case, a \ncommitment reflected not just in words but in her 17-year record as a \nfair, moderate judge.\n  She said, ``As a judge, I don't make law.''\n  That is exactly the approach we should expect and demand from any \nnominee for the Supreme Court.\n  I implore my colleagues to look at her record, listen to her answers; \nthey are clear, focused, respectful, forthright. She has answered every \nquestion directly, honestly, thoughtfully, and without equivocation. \nShe has held nothing back.\n  But I, personally, as I have watched these hearings, am beginning to \nwonder: Are we truly in search of answers or are we badgering the \nwitness? I know that all of America is watching this hearing, but I \nhave to tell you Hispanic Americans are watching it with great \ninterest. Attempts at distorting a record that has been committed to \nthe Constitution, to the rule of law, by suggesting that her ethnicity \nor heritage would be a driving force of her decisions as a Justice of \nthe Supreme Court is demeaning to women and to Latinos, it is demeaning \nespecially in light of a 17-year record that reflects totally the \nopposite.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues think that by repeating that statement \ntime and time again they will generate some opportunity to create an \nimage that is simply not true--that they will create an image that is \nsimply not true. For many of us who come from the Hispanic community \nwithin this great country, we have seen the efforts to have a class of \npeople painted in a certain way, and I implore my colleagues\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nwho seem to be traveling down this road that they are running a great \nrisk--that they are running a great risk. If this judge didn't have the \n17-year record of fidelity to the Constitution, fidelity to the rule of \nlaw, fidelity to precedent--even when that precedent binds her in a \nway, as in the Ricci case, in which she had sympathy for the White \nfirefighters, but nonetheless precedent kept her obligated to the \ndecision that they had--I would say maybe that line of questioning is \nlegitimate. But I must be honest with you, when it was raised once or \ntwice or three times--but when it has been raised a dozen times, \nsometimes by the same Senator asking the same set of questions despite \nhaving gotten a full answer on the issue, it creates great concern for \nsome of us who have been down this road in other paths at other times \nbut with the same tactics.\n  Clearly, this is one of the most gifted jurists in America, and we as \na nation would be honored to have her serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. \nI hope these hearings will come to a conclusion soon. I look forward to \nthe debate that will take place on the floor and I, as well as the rest \nof this country who are riveted on this process, are going to be \nlooking for equal justice under the law--the template that is before \nthe mantle on the Supreme Court: ``Equal justice under law.'' Judge \nSotomayor deserved to be treated with equal justice in this process and \nthis badgering of the witness, particularly in this line of questioning \nwhich has been asked and answered several times, raises serious \nconcerns for those of us who have lived in this community, understand \nthe challenges and understand the way in which people try to paint \npeople in this community.\n  It is time to end that line of questioning. It is time to have us \nhave the committee move beyond it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb pertaining to the introduction of S. 1468 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say for the information of my \ncolleagues, we are working on a unanimous consent agreement so that we \ncan take up the hate crimes issue, the F-22 amendment, and a Republican \namendment. Both sides are working hard to get that resolved.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  This is an interesting time in America and in the Congress. We have \nthe very important Defense authorization bill before us. We have the \nhearings for Judge Sotomayor. We have the HELP Committee reporting out \nits legislation. There may have been more issues before the Congress, \nbut I don't recall them in the years I have been in the Senate.\n  Today we had an event that is in the ``you can't make it up'' \ncategory. I read from the CNSNews.com. It is entitled ``Joe Biden: `We \nHave to Go Spend Money to Keep From Going Bankrupt.' ''\n  I quote completely from the news report from CNSNews.com:\n\n       Vice President Joe Biden told people attending an AARP town \n     hall meeting that unless the Democrat-supported health care \n     plan becomes law the nation will go bankrupt and that the \n     only way to avoid that fate is for the government to spend \n     more money.\n       ``And folks look, AARP knows and the people working here \n     today know, the president knows, and I know, that the status \n     quo is simply not acceptable,'' Biden said at the event on \n     Thursday in Alexandria, Va. ``It's totally unacceptable. And \n     it's completely unsustainable. Even if we wanted to keep it \n     the way we have it. It can't do it financially.''\n       ``We're going to go bankrupt as a nation,'' Biden said.\n       ``Well, people that I say that to say, `What are you \n     talking about, you're telling me we have to go spend money to \n     keep from going bankrupt?' '' Biden said. ``The answer is \n     yes, I'm telling you.''\n\n  That is a very interesting story. The thing that probably makes it \nmore interesting is the Washington Post story today entitled ``CBO \nChief Criticizes Democrats' Health Reform Measures.''\n  I quote from the Washington Post story:\n\n       Instead of saving the federal government from fiscal \n     catastrophe, the health reform measures being drafted by \n     congressional Democrats would worsen an already bleak budget \n     outlook, increasing deficit projections and driving the \n     nation more deeply into debt, the director of the nonpartisan \n     Congressional Budget Office said this morning.\n       Under questioning by members of the Senate Budget \n     Committee, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf said bills crafted \n     by House leaders and the Senate health committee do not \n     propose ``the sort of fundamental changes that would be \n     necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending \n     by a significant amount.''\n       ``On the contrary,'' Elmendorf said, ``the legislation \n     significantly expands the federal responsibility for health-\n     care costs.''\n\n  Here we have on the one hand the Vice President today telling the \nAmerican people that we have to spend money, we have to go spend money \nto keep from going bankrupt, and yet the Congressional Budget Office \nsays that the proposed changes would weaken our economy and expand the \nFederal responsibility for health care costs.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad \n     [Democrat from North Dakota] has taken a leading role in that \n     effort. This morning, after receiving Elmendorf's testimony \n     on the nation's long-term budget outlook, Conrad turned \n     immediately to questions about the emerging health care \n     measures.\n       ``I'm going to really put you on the spot,'' Conrad told \n     Elmendorf. ``From what you have seen from the products of the \n     committees that have reported, do you see a successful effort \n     being mounted to bend the long-term cost curve?''\n       Elmendorf responded: ``No, Mr. Chairman.''\n       Asked what provisions would be needed to slow the growth in \n     federal health spending, Elmendorf urged lawmakers to end or \n     limit the tax-free treatment of employer-provided health \n     benefits . . .\n\n  That has a little echo associated with it. I don't know where that \nidea came from.\n\n       . . . calling it a Federal ``subsidy'' that encourages \n     spending on ever more expensive health packages. Key \n     Senators, including Conrad, have been pressing to tax \n     employer-provided benefits, but Senate leaders last week \n     objected, saying the idea does not have enough support among \n     Senate Democrats to win passage.\n       Elmendorf also suggested changing the way Medicare \n     reimburses providers to create incentives for reducing costs.\n       ``Certain reforms of that sort are included in some of the \n     packages,'' Elmendorf said. ``But the changes that we have \n     looked at so far do not represent the sort of fundamental \n     change, the order of magnitude that would be necessary to \n     offset the direct increase in federal health costs that would \n     result from the insurance coverage proposals.''\n\n  Then incredibly:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid [of Nevada] dismissed \n     Elmendorf's push for the benefits tax. ``What he should do is \n     maybe run for Congress,'' Reid said.\n\n  I have disagreed from time to time with the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I have agreed from time to time with the Congressional Budget \nOffice. But I don't think it is appropriate to use that kind of \nlanguage from the majority leader of the Senate about these hard-\nworking people. This wasn't just Mr. Elmendorf's product. This was the \nproduct of endless nights and days of work on the part of the \nCongressional Budget Office. If you disagree with them, as I have in \nthe past, disagree and give your reasons for doing so. But for the \nmajority leader to say that what he should do is ``maybe run for \nCongress,'' frankly, I don't think is an appropriate response to the \nincredible work that these individuals are doing.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus . . . \n     expressed frustration that the tax on employer-funded \n     benefits had fallen out of favor, in part because the White \n     House opposes the idea.\n       Critics of the proposal say it would target police and \n     firefighters who receive generous benefits packages. And if \n     the tax is trimmed to apply to only upper income \n     beneficiaries, it would lose its effectiveness as a cost-\n     containment measure.\n       ``Basically the president is not helping,'' Baucus said. \n     ``He does not want the exclusion, and that's making it \n     difficult.''\n       But he added, ``We are clearly going to find ways to bend \n     the cost curve in the right direction, including provisions \n     that will actually lower the rate of increase in health care \n     costs.''\n     \n                                *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\n\n       Ideas under consideration include health-care delivery \n     system reform; health insurance market reform; and empowering \n     an independent agency to set Medicare reimbursement rates, an \n     idea the White House is shopping aggressively on Capitol \n     Hill.\n       But Baucus is not giving up on the benefits tax. ``It is \n     not off the table, there's still a lot of interest in it,'' \n     Baucus said.\n\n  Well, what this is all about--what this is really all about--is \nheading in the wrong direction with the wrong fundamentals of what the \nproblems with health care in America are--a fundamental \nmisunderstanding. The health care in America is the highest quality in \nthe world. I went to M.D. Anderson with the Republican leader and the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. At M.D. Anderson--one of the great, \npremier institutions in America, where cancer treatment is incredible--\nthere were people there from 90 countries around the world. Most of \nthose people were wealthy people. They had the choice of going anywhere \nin the world to get the treatment they felt they needed. They came to \nthe United States of America. That is true of the Mayo Clinic. That is \ntrue of many other medical facilities and institutions in America.\n  So the problem with health care in America is not the quality of \ncare. The problem with health care in America is affordability and \navailability. The cost of health care continues to increase--inflation \nof nearly double digits. We cannot afford it.\n  The Vice President is right when he says it is unsustainable. But \nwhen the President says that we want to do nothing, obviously, that is \nnot the view of Republicans. We believe you have to do a lot. We \nbelieve you have to do a lot, and that is increase competition in \nAmerica so people will have choices, affordability, and availability, \nand not a government-run health care system.\n  So the architects of the legislation passed through the HELP \nCommittee and being considered by the Finance Committee and that came \nthrough the House were fundamentally wrong to start with. They were not \nattacking the problem of health care in America, and that is the cost. \nAnd the quality of health care in America is what needs to be \npreserved.\n  How do you install competition? You install competition by letting \npeople go across State lines to shop for the health insurance policy \nthey want. That is prohibited now. Why is that? Why is that?\n  The other is wellness and fitness. We are in agreement, I want to \nsay, on a lot of issues that have not been highlighted in debate on the \nfloor--Republicans and Democrats. Wellness and fitness, insurance \npolicies that will encourage such things; rewards by employers for \npeople who practice wellness and fitness. In fact, probably one of the \nbest known individuals in America today is the CEO of Safeway. They \nhave had an incredibly successful program for their employees, where if \nthey practice wellness and fitness--they do not smoke, they regularly \nengage in exercise, including membership in health clubs--guess what. \nThey are rewarded for doing so. And the overall costs of health care in \nSafeway have gone down. They have told every insurer: Come, if you want \nto insure our employees, encourage wellness and fitness and let them \nmake a choice. Do so.\n  That is the essence of what we have to do. The problem in America \nwith health care is that too often there are fixed costs. There is no \ncompetition, and there are incentives to drive up the costs of health \ncare. We all know that. We all know there are certain procedures which \nare more rewarding than others, and the system is gamed, and that there \nare billions--tens of billions--of dollars of fraud, abuse, and waste \nin the Medicare system that have been identified on numerous occasions.\n  We also know that medical malpractice is a problem, and we need to \nreform it. Some years ago, the State of California--not known as a \nconservative State, to say the least--enacted fundamental medical \nliability practice reform. And guess what. It has resulted in cost \nsavings. It is well known that physicians practice defensive medicine, \nwhich many times accounts for a 10-, 15-percent increase in those costs \nfor fear of being sued. And the new technology, which has made such \ntremendous advances, then, indeed, increases costs because they are \noverused because that physician knows, in some States, in some cases \nand places, unless every kind of test is administered--whether that \nphysician thinks it is needed or not, it is going to be administered \nand prescribed in order to avert the eventuality of appearing in court \nand not having administered all the necessary, or what the plaintiff's \nlawyers believe is necessary, tests and procedures.\n  So look, we know now--we know now--from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, for the second time, that this proposal is not going to cure \nthe health care issues of America. It is time we went back to the \ndrawing board. It is time Republicans and Democrats sat down at the \nnegotiating table--not calling one or two Senators down to the White \nHouse, not trying to pick off one Republican or two Republicans, not \ndoing that.\n  I know that with this plan the Democrats and the administration may \nbe able to pick off a couple Republicans and get 60 votes and enact \nthis massive movement of the government takeover--eventual takeover--of \nthe health care system in America, or we can sit down together for the \nfirst time with incredibly knowledgeable people. There is nobody who \nknows more about health care than our two doctors, Drs. Coburn and \nBarrasso. There is nobody who knows more about health care than Senator \nEnzi, who has been our leader in the HELP Committee--Senator Alexander. \nThere is a lot of knowledge on health care issues. We could sit down \ntogether, scrap this idea, scrap this ``spend money to keep from going \nbankrupt,'' scrap this proposal where the Congressional Budget Office \nsays ``the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility \nfor health-care costs,'' that the measures would ``worsen an already \nbleak budget outlook, increasing deficit projections and driving the \nnation more deeply into debt.'' That is not the proposal the American \npeople want to pay the penalty for.\n  So events today have been very interesting. The fact is, what we need \nto do now is sit down together for a change. I have done it in the \npast, I will admit, on issues that are not of this magnitude. I do not \nknow if there has been an issue that consumes one-sixth of the gross \ndomestic product of this country that I have been involved in. \nCertainly other major issues, certainly working together with my friend \nand colleague from Michigan on the Defense authorization and other \nmeasures to preserve our Nation's security. But this issue, I must say, \ncauses all others to pale in magnitude. But that is also the reason why \nwe should sit down together and not pass legislation that is purely on \na partisan basis.\n  Let's listen to the experts. Let's listen to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I know of no one who believes there is bias in the \nCongressional Budget Office. As I say, sometimes I have been very \ndisappointed or disagreed with them. But I know of no one who thinks \nthey are not doing the very best they can under the intense pressures \nof getting out these numbers.\n  I want to take this moment to salute the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhether I agree with or disagree with them, for the incredible work \nthey have done in the past. I hope at some point to be able, when this \nhealth care debate is over, to enter into the Record the thousands of \nhours that have been put in by the Congressional Budget Office and the \nstaff there in trying to come up with their best assessment so we can \nlegislate with the benefit of the knowledge that, frankly, only they \npossess.\n  So let's listen to them. Let's listen to other outside experts. Let's \nrecognize the fact that this issue has badly divided this Congress. But \nlet's also listen to the fact that the American people are becoming \nmore and more skeptical of the proposals we are considering or that \nhave been reported out by both the House and the Senate HELP Committee \nand maybe start over and do something the American people can believe \nin and for which we can tell the American people we put their interest \nfirst.\n  I note my friend, the Senator from Michigan, is on the floor. I hope \nwe can give a ray of hope to our colleagues and let them know how they \nare going to be able to spend the rest of the evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from Arizona, \nfirst of all, for all the effort he has made today with his staff. Our \nstaffs have been working hard. There is a lot of progress on the \nunanimous consent request which will set out the path forward, not just \nfor tonight. We, obviously, expect votes tonight--a number of votes \ntonight--but also for the coming days, when we come back here for votes \non Monday.\n  But there is progress being made, and the staffs are working very \nhard. We can actually see them in the back of the Chamber at times \ngoing back and forth with different ideas. But we are close. We are \nconfident. We are optimistic we will fairly soon have a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  I again thank my friend from Arizona for all he has done to help \nfacilitate this, and our staffs, because they are working hard and I am \noptimistic they are going to succeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I was going to talk about aircraft and \naircraft procurement, and I will do that. But before I do that, I feel \ncompelled to respond to the comments of our colleague from Arizona with \nrespect to health care.\n  It turns out, literally, as we gather here on the Senate floor today, \nnegotiations are underway between Democrats and Republicans, led by \nSenator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and \nSenator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, to try to find common ground with respect to health care.\n  In a day and age when we spend more money on health care than any \nother nation on Earth, we do not get better results. I think we have \n14,000 people who are likely to lose their health care in our country \ntoday--in a country where we have 47 million folks who do not have \nhealth care coverage. We can do better than that. There is a strong \nbipartisan effort, led by two very good people--Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus--to find common ground.\n  As it turns out, I like to use the words of a friend of mine, Senator \nMike Enzi of Wyoming, who talks a lot about the 80-20 rule and why he \nand Senator Kennedy have gotten so much accomplished--legislation \ncoming out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It \nis because they agree on 80 percent of the stuff, disagree on 20 \npercent of the stuff, and they focus on the 80 percent on which they \nagree.\n  I think the same could be said about the legislation that is being \nnegotiated today, again, in a bipartisan way. The President has said he \nwants a bipartisan bill. Our leaders on the Finance Committee want a \nbipartisan bill. I want a bipartisan bill. I think in order for us to \nactually get something good, something done that improves the quality \nof health care that is provided in this country, that slows the growth \nof health care costs, and bends that cost curve down, and makes it \npossible for us to extend coverage to a lot of people who do not have \nit, it is enhanced by having bipartisan legislation.\n  I will not go further into that at this time. But I felt compelled to \nsay I have not given up hope. My hope is that the efforts that are \nunderway as I speak will bear fruit and maybe provide a roadmap to a \nplan we can agree to here in the Senate and in the House to build on \nthe good work the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has \nalready done here in the Senate, and to enable us to find common ground \nwith the House and, hopefully, with the Obama administration.\n  Having said that--I know this might be a good segue--we are spending \na ton of money on health care in this country. If you look at the size \nof our budget deficits, if you look at how much we spend in the country \nfor health care--I am told it is about one-sixth of GDP--that is not \nsustainable. Medicare is likely to run out of money in about 7 years \nfrom now. That is not acceptable. We end up, meanwhile, not getting \nnecessarily better results, and a lot of other countries are spending \nsubstantially less.\n  We have great models for health care delivery in this country. I will \nmention a few of them that are showing the way to provide better \noutcomes at less money. They include the Mayo in Minnesota and in \nFlorida; an outfit called Geisinger in Hershey, PA; Intermountain \nHealth in Utah, Kaiser Permanente in northern California; a cooperative \ncalled Puget Sound in Washington State; Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, \nOH. There are a number of them. For the most part, they are nonprofits \nor cooperatives that have shown it is possible to provide better care, \nbetter outcomes, for less money than what we are getting in this fee-\nfor-service operation that we now call a health care delivery system.\n  We can do better. My hope is we will keep working at it and not give \nup and that we will continue to try to work across the aisle until we \ncome up with a product we can bring to the floor and negotiate, debate \nit on the floor, and then go to conference with the House.\n  In terms of things that we spend a lot of money on--not just health \ncare--we spend a lot of money on the defense of our country. That is a \nmajor priority for our Nation. If we go back to 1990s, 1980s, 1970s, we \nwent for a long time without balancing our budgets. In fact, it was not \nuntil, I think, fiscal year 1999, under the Clinton administration, \nthat we actually balanced our budget for the first time, I think, since \n1968. It was roughly 30 years, three decades that we went without \nbalancing the budget. I think we did it again in 2000, and then when we \nhad the handover from President Clinton to President Bush, we left the \nnew President with a budget that was, I believe, balanced once more.\n  We sort of went from that point in time, kind of a high-water mark in \nterms of fiscal responsibility, and over the last 8 years we turned \naround and we went in the opposite direction. We ended up running up \nmore new debt in the last 8 years than we ran up in our first 208 years \nas a nation. I will say that again. We ran up more new debt in the last \n8 years than we did in the first 208 as a nation. The debt for the new \nfiscal year, as we go through this worst recession since the Great \nDepression and trying to fight two wars, one in Iraq and one in \nAfghanistan, the meltdown in revenues, very high health care costs; we \nare looking at a budget deficit which, I am told for this year, may \nhave already exceeded $1 trillion, which is the highest on record.\n  I chair a subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee in the Senate. One of our responsibilities is to \nhelp, along with our colleagues, to scrub spending. One of the things \nwe do is we look for spending that doesn't make much sense or where \nthere is waste, fraud or abuse. I might say, in response to my friend, \nSenator McCain's comments on waste in the Medicare system, one of the \nencouraging things in the last 3 years is we have gone out and done \nwhat we call postaudit cost recoveries in three States for Medicare. In \nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida, we have actually gone out to see where \nmoney has been wastefully spent and to see if we can recover that \nmoney. The first year we discovered almost nothing, the second year we \nfound a little bit, and last year we found $700 million. In just three \nStates we did that, and now we are going to be doing the same kind of \nthing in 47 States, hopefully recovering a lot more money for the \nMedicare system and maybe taking our lessons learned from recovering \nmoneys misspent, inappropriately spent for Medicare, and do the same \nkind of thing for Medicaid, and that will put a lot of money back into \nthe Treasury.\n  My subcommittee focuses on, among other things, wasteful spending, \nand one of the things we have looked at is cost overruns for major new \nweapons systems. With the help of the Government Accountability Office, \nwe went back to, I think it was 2001, and we looked for cost overruns \nfor major new weapons systems. In 2001, I think it was about $45 \nbillion. We have seen it ramp up from about $45 billion in cost \noverruns for major new weapons systems, GAO tells us by last year, or \nmaybe it was 2007 or 2008, this number had grown to almost $300 \nbillion--from $245 billion in 2001 over the next 6 or 7 years to almost \n$300 billion in cost overruns.\n  Unacceptable. I think we have finally leveled off the increase. Not \nonly is that kind of trend unacceptable, but the level of that enormous \ncost overrun in weapons systems is unacceptable as well.\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\n  In a day and age when our Nation is awash in red ink and in a day and \nage when we are involved in wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, it is \ncritically important that we spend every dollar--defense dollar and, \nfrankly, nondefense dollars--as wisely as we can, to get the most out \nof that money, whether it is health care to make sure that the dollars \nwe are investing there are spent cost-effectively or whether it is for \ndefense to make sure that the money we are spending there is spent \ncost-effectively.\n  Senator McCain is a Vietnam veteran, and he is a real hero, for me. \nBut we have people who have served here--I think one or two might have \nbeen around in World War II. Senator Inouye won the Medal of Honor \nduring World War II. We have had people who served in the Korean war, \nthe Vietnam war, and other times of peace, as well as in times of war.\n  I spent about 23 years, 5 Active, 18 years Ready Reserve as a naval \nflight officer and much of that as a mission commander of a Navy P-3 \naircraft built by Lockheed. We used the P-3 for years for ocean \nsurveillance, tracking submarines during the Cold War so we would know \nwhere they were, and whenever we went up, we would know where to go \nfind them and destroy them if we had to. The strategy was called \nmutually assured destruction. We, fortunately, never had to do that. We \nused them in the Vietnam war for a lot of coastal surveillance; low-\nlevel flights off the coast of Vietnam and Cambodia. The P-3 was \nintroduced into the fleet in 1960s, and it was introduced as a--\nformerly used as a commercial airplane, a four-engine turboprop. We had \nproblems with the P-3's wings. We used to say we were afraid they would \nfall off. I don't know if it was quite that bad, but we had real \nproblems with the P-3s performing reliably as a naval aircraft and \nbouncing around the skies in all kinds of weather. A lot of work had to \nbe done on the P-3 wing and, within a couple of years, we finally \nfigured out the problem.\n  They are still flying. We are still using them in Iraq--not to track \nsubmarines but all kinds of missions. We have used them for electronic \nsurveillance over the years and we have used them for drug interdiction \nand now they are doing some special work over in Iraq and that part of \nthe world. It is an airplane which started badly as a military \naircraft, but it got a lot better.\n  You can find the C-5As built in the 1960s, C-5Bs in the 1970s and \n1980s--rough startup, rough rampup on the aircraft. We had problems \nwith the aircraft, and we are now overhauling the C-5Bs. We call them \nC-5Ms. And they are flying 85 percent mission capable. So that is very \nencouraging. It took a long while to work out the wrinkles, but I think \nwe have now, and we are going to have a plane we will be able to fly \nfor another 30, 40 years, getting a lot of good use out of it, meeting \nour military needs around the world.\n  The F-22 has been around for a number of years--not as long as the P-\n3, not as long as the C-5, but it has been around for quite a few \nyears. We have, I think, close to maybe 200 of them that either have \nbeen built or we are planning to build.\n  One of the things I find troubling--and I stand in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Levin and McCain and ask unanimous \nconsent to be added as a cosponsor of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Built, I think, largely by Lockheed, and a lot of the \ncontractual work is being done in maybe close to 40, 45 States. But \nLockheed does some great work. This particular aircraft, I am troubled \nby a number of things, as are the sponsors of the legislation. It is \nnot just that they are troubled, and it is not just that I am troubled, \nbut some other folks are troubled too. Let me see if we have a list of \nsome of the people who are calling and maybe suggesting that the F-22s \nwe have ordered are enough.\n\n  Among the people who say, in this case, 187 F-22s, fighter aircraft--\nnot an aircraft that is used for a lot--a plane mainly built and \ndesigned to use for dogfights with aircraft from other nations in an \nearlier day; the Soviets or maybe the Chinese or some other country. \nBut among the leaders of our country, they are saying, maybe 187 is \nenough. Not maybe but saying 187 is enough. Two Presidents, former \nPresident George Bush and our current President Barack Obama, they have \nsaid that not just in giving speeches, but they have actually said that \nwith the budgets they submit to us, and in this case President Obama's \nfirst budget and the last budget, or maybe several budgets from \nPresident Bush.\n  Who else has said 187 is enough? Well, Secretaries of Defense; not \nonly the current Secretary of Defense, who is Bob Gates, but the \nprevious Secretary of Defense, who was also Bob Gates, and I think his \npredecessor as well said 187 should do us.\n  We have had three Chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who have said \n187 F-22s is enough; we think that should do it.\n  We have had the current members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who have \nsaid 187 is plenty when it comes to F-22 fighter aircraft.\n  Finally, two of the most respected Members of the Senate, Senators \nMcCain and Levin, as leaders of this committee, have said: Well, this \nis enough. Given our other demands and our other aircraft we have \navailable to meet this need, 187 F-22s is plenty.\n  Let me take a look at the next chart, if we could, and see what we \nhave. One of the reasons why all the folks I mentioned have said 187 F-\n22s is enough, we think of some of the other aircraft we used, fixed \nwing as well as nonfixed wing aircraft; the F-15 fighter, a number of \nhours flown in Iraq and Afghanistan--these are rough numbers but about \n40,000 flight hours. We have a couple UAVs here, unmanned aerial \nvehicles, one called the ScanEagle, the other is called the Predator. \nThe Predator is better known. But so far the ScanEagle has flown in \nIraq and Afghanistan about 150 flight hours. The Predator has flown \nabout a half million flight hours in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of our \nhelicopters, I think the H-60, generally we think of as the Black Hawk, \nbut Black Hawks have flown 900,000 flight hours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Down here at the bottom, the number of flight hours, as \nfar as we can tell, flown in Iraq and Afghanistan, I am pretty sure \nthis is correct: Zero for the F-22. That is a stark number, a stark \ncontrast.\n  Sometimes we tend to order weapons systems, build weapons systems, \nmaintain weapons systems to fight wars such as the last war we fought, \nnot thinking so much about maybe the weapons systems we need for the \ncurrent war or we will likely to need for a future war. One of the \nreasons why this administration, the last administration, why this \nPresident, this Secretary of Defense and previous ones have said we \ndon't think we want to do any more F-22s is because they believe that, \nfor awhile, we are going to be fighting wars such as unfortunately we \nfought in Iraq and especially Afghanistan. That is going to be more the \nmodus operandi. We are going to be fighting counterinsurgencies, and \nwhat we need are weapons systems and men and women who are trained to \nfight in those wars. The F-22, frankly, does not lend itself to that \nkind of war.\n  I led a congressional delegation with four of my colleagues back at \nthe end of May into Afghanistan and Pakistan, including our Presiding \nOfficer. We learned a lot. It was wonderful, and we came home feeling \nvery much encouraged about our strategy in Afghanistan, the men and \nwomen who are implementing that strategy, both on the military and the \ncivilian side. One of the things we learned going into Pakistan is \nthat, for years, the Pakistanis have been preparing to fight the next \nwar not against the Taliban, not against al-Qaida, which happened in \nthe northwestern province, but they have been preparing to fight the \nnext war forever--I guess since 1947--against the Indians, against the \ncountry of India. They may have a weapons system to work just fine in \nthat particular altercation if that were to occur. But their real \nthreat, frankly, isn't as much India anymore; their real threat is the \nTaliban and the al-Qaida folks hanging out in those northwestern \nprovinces on the border of Afghanistan. While India and Pakistan may \nhave plenty of fighter aircraft, unfortunately, they don't have any \nhelicopters. They need mobility and they need helicopters to be able to \nmove their counterinsurgency forces. They don't have them. Frankly, we \nare sort of guilty in a way of the same thing with the F-22.\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\n  Let's see what we have on the next chart. I will come to this in a \nbit. One of the things we think about when we think of aircraft we use \nis, first of all, the missions we need the aircraft for and the kind of \nwars and threats we are likely to face. That helps us make that \ndecision.\n  Occasionally, we look at how much it costs to fly an aircraft. We \nlook at the dollars we spend to put an aircraft or helicopter into the \nair for an hour. I have seen a wide range of flight hour costs for the \nF-22--that it might be $22,000 per flight hour or as high as $40,000 or \n$42,000 per flight hour. I don't have that at my fingertips, the flight \nhour costs for other aircraft. But that is a lot of money for a flight \nhour for any aircraft, especially a fighter aircraft. Whether it is \n$19,000 or $20,000 or $40,000 an hour, that is a lot of money for the \nkind of job we are looking for the aircraft to do.\n  We also look at who are we preparing to fight or what threat we are \npreparing to counter. Some people say just in case the Chinese ever \ngive us trouble, to take them on we need the F-22s, or we may need 200 \nmore. At one time, General Corley said we needed about another 200. As \nit turns out, we have other aircraft to meet that kind of threat. I \nhope that is not going to ever materialize, because China is a major \ntrading partner. I hope we don't ever get in a shooting war with them, \nnor with the Russians.\n  We have other fighter aircraft. We have the F-15, F-16, and the F-18. \nWe are in the process of building another new fighter aircraft that \nwill be a joint aircraft that will be able to do fights in the air and \nother things, including air-to-ground attacks, which the F-22 doesn't \nlend itself to do. I think we are going to build about 2,500 F-35s. It \nhas broad support. We have built about 50 so far. The cost per aircraft \nfor the F-35 is about $80 million. I think the cost for building a new \nF-22 is roughly $190 million. So the F-35 may be $80 million a copy, \nand the F-22, which doesn't have the capability or the viability of the \nF-35, costs about $190 million--over twice as much. That makes me \npause, and I hope it makes some of my colleagues pause as well.\n  Last, everybody knows we are wrestling through a tough economic time \nin our country. We have lost a lot of jobs. We had a housing bubble and \nmeltdown, a loss of jobs in banking and financial services, and a lot \nof manufacturing jobs. Chrysler and GM have gone into bankruptcy. They \nare coming out of that, and they have a new product line coming through \nthe pipeline. The banks are stabilized and are lending money again, and \nsome are starting to pay back to the government the money they \nborrowed.\n  I am bullish about where we are. It will take a while before jobs \ncome back, but I think there are encouraging signs about our economy.\n  Having said that, a lot of people would like to have a job who don't \nhave one. If we build another 190 or so F-22s, that would save some \n25,000 manufacturing, good-paying jobs. We cannot just sniff at that. \nThose are real numbers, and it is important for us in the States where \nthe jobs are. If we think about it, if we are talking about building \nanother almost 200 F-22s, and they cost roughly $190 million a copy, \nand we are talking about saving 25,000 jobs, if we multiply $191 \nmillion by 194 aircraft, we come up with a total price of about $37 \nbillion for building those extra 194 F-22 aircraft.\n  If the numbers are correct, that is about $37 billion. If we divide \nthat by 25,000 jobs, that turns out to be almost $1.5 million per job. \nI nearly fell over when I saw that number--$1.5 million per job. We \nhave passed a stimulus package, and the Presiding Officer and I voted \nfor it. It was passed with bipartisan support, and I hope it will save \na couple million jobs. Jobs make sense. But this is a lot of money for \njobs.\n  You can look at what we say we are going to spend in the stimulus \npackage, the recovery bill, per job. I am not quick enough to run the \nnumbers, but these are expensive jobs.\n  I hope if we don't build another 200 F-22s, some of the folks who can \nbuild them at Lockheed Martin--hopefully, some of them will be able to \nbuild F-35s. They cost half as much to build, and they do more things. \nHopefully, some of them will be bought by other countries. I am not \naware that other countries have bought the F-22, but I think a lot \nwould be interested in buying the F-35, given the variety of missions, \nthe versatility, and the much lower cost.\n  There you have it, Mr. President. I don't know if I have made a \ncompelling case, but I appreciate the chance to share this with my \ncolleagues and anybody else who is interested at a time when we are \nwrestling with enormous budget deficits, after 8 years where we \nliterally doubled our Nation's debt, and when we are expected to run up \nthe highest budget deficit in the history of our country, at a time \nwhen we have major cost overruns and a new weapon system, and when we \nhave had literally two administrations, two Presidents, two Secretaries \nof State, and all kinds of Joint Chiefs saying: You know, we have a \nbunch of these F-22s. We have enough. It is not that we are going to \nstop spending money on national defense. We are going to spend a fair \namount of money in Afghanistan, and even though we are drawing down the \ntroops in Iraq, we are going to continue spending money in that country \nas well. The war in Afghanistan is the right war, and we need to stay \nwith it and crush the Taliban, help the Pakistanis crush al-Qaida, and \nstay with the folks in Afghanistan until they can help defend \nthemselves and go on to a better economy and a better life. That is the \nimportant thing to do.\n  We don't need the F-22 to do that. To the folks who have spent a \nnumber of years, and a lot of our money building it, we say thank you. \nBut I think we have enough. We have plenty of other challenges to face.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to speak.\n  As I look around the Chamber, obviously, nobody listened with baited \nbreath to what I had to say. Hopefully, they are in their offices and \nare tuned into C-SPAN II.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today we are being asked to defend the \nvery core of our American democracy; that is, the right of people to \nlive freely, to move freely, to do what they would like to do as long \nas they do not bring harm to others. People want to be free from \nviolence, free from fear, free from intimidation. And all too often we \nhear of crimes committed against innocent people based almost solely on \nbigotry and hatred. This Senate needs to send a message, a message that \nthis is unacceptable conduct in our society, that these crimes are \nespecially heinous, that these crimes must be severely punished, \nbecause it tears at the basic fiber of being freedom-loving Americans.\n  An example of the horror that accompanies this kind of hatred is that \non a day last month, someone turned killer because of religious hatred. \nThis individual walked through the doors of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum, which was then filled with visitors from all around the world, \nmany of them children. His name: James Von Brunn. He raised a rifle and \nopened fire, killing Steven Johns, a security guard who was simply \ndoing his duty, and wounding others before the individual was shot and \nsubdued. Not only did Mr. Von Brunn take a man's life and terrorize \nbystanders, but he wanted to destroy this vivid reminder of how vicious \nman's hatred and bias could be against an entire group of people. Over \n6 million Jews died as a result of the Holocaust. Millions of others \ndied also as a result of the Holocaust, stemmed primarily by prejudice \nand hate.\n  The tragic fact is that our history is replete with examples of \nterrible hate crimes. In October of 1998, two men attacked and savagely \nbeat Matthew Shepard, a student who was gay and was there at the \nUniversity of Wyoming. Shepard died of his wounds a few days later, \nsimply because he was a gay person. In June of the same year, who can \nforget that a Black man, James Byrd, Jr., was chained to a pickup \ntruck, dragged along a Texas road, and was killed by declared racists.\n  More recently, we have seen vulgar acts committed in the wake of a \nhistoric happening in America. President Barack Obama, an African \nAmerican, won the Presidential election. In my\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nhome State of New Jersey, after the November election, a cross was \nplaced and set afire on the front lawn of a couple, Alina and Gary \nGrewal. The cross was wrapped in a homemade banner that the Grewals had \nhung outside their home that simply read ``President Obama, Victory \n'08''--pride filled, honoring this incredible accomplishment that took \nplace within America.\n  At a time when our Nation should be celebrating the progress we have \nmade, we must bring the full weight of the law to bear on those who \ncommit such atrocious crimes. Unfortunately, existing Federal law \nhampers prosecutors from trying hate crimes effectively. Right now, \ncurrent Federal hate crimes law applies only when a victim is involved \nin particular activities, such as serving on a jury or attending a \npublic school. This legislation would protect victims of hate crimes in \nall situations, not just when a victim is involved in certain federally \nprotected ones. This amendment would also finally expand Federal hate \ncrimes protection to those victimized based on sexual orientation or \ndisability. Some 15 percent of all reported hate crimes are linked to \nsexual orientation. Gay Americans should not be afraid to walk about \nfreely, and violent individuals should know that the Federal Government \nwill prosecute you if you commit a crime with hatred as the principal \nmotivator. Hate crimes are the ultimate expression of ignorance and \nhate, and we must strengthen our Federal laws to protect people against \nthem.\n  Senator Kennedy first introduced this legislation in 1997, a year \nbefore Matthew Shepard and James Byrd were killed because of bigotry. \nIt is time to pass this critical amendment and stand up for Americans \nwho are victims of vulgar and senseless acts of violence that should \nnot be happening in America without severe punishment, without the \nreminder that we are a nation comprised of many different ethnicities, \ndifferent religions, different habits. It should not go without severe \npenalty if someone is attacked because their habit, their face, their \ncolor, their religion is different from the ones most popular.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you. Madam President, I also ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, thank you, very much.\n  First, I want to congratulate, actually, on the underlying bill, my \nfriend and colleague and the leader of the Armed Services Committee for \nall of his hard work on the bill that is in front of us. It is so \nimportant for the troops. I thank him for his leadership in such a \nstrong way on behalf of the men and women who are serving us every \nsingle day and for all the things they need to be able to be supported, \nalong with their families. So this is a very important bill, and I am \nhopeful we are going to be able to move through this very quickly.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Madam President, I did want to take a moment, though, tonight to talk \nabout health care, about the specifics of the bill we have been working \non now for about a year. We have had forums and meetings and drafts and \nproposals and working sessions for about a year now, I believe. I \ncommend Senator Baucus for the incredible amount of time he has put in, \nas has his staff, with he and Senator Grassley, working, as they always \ndo, so well together.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of effort that has gone into this, \nand we will speak more as the process moves along about the specifics \nof the health care legislation. But tonight I want to take just a \nmoment to talk about why it is so important to do it.\n  If the system worked well now for everyone in the country, if \neveryone could find and afford health insurance, we would not be having \nthis discussion. We would not have had this debate. This would not be \nsomething that would be a top priority for the President of the United \nStates.\n  But the reality is, the current system does not work for everyone. \nEven if you are part of the majority that has health insurance, you are \nprobably seeing your copays go up, your premiums go up. You may be \nworried about whether you will lose your insurance if you lose your job \nor your spouse loses his or her job. You may be in a situation where \nyou cannot find insurance because you have a preexisting condition that \nthe insurance companies will not cover.\n  There are many reasons why people today, even though they have some \nkind of insurance, are incredibly worried about the future, about what \nhappens when they get sick or what happens when the kids get sick.\n  Then, for those who do not have any health insurance, of course, it \nis an even more challenging story. We know there are millions of \nAmericans--47 million and counting, in my home State of Michigan alone \nover 1 million people--who have no insurance at all. What happens to \nthem when they get sick or when the kids get sick?\n  So this is a huge issue, and the time has come to decide that health \ncare is a right, not a privilege, in the greatest country in the world.\n  We have been working for years. It has been 90 years--ever since \nPresident Roosevelt wanted to have a health care system that all \nAmericans would be able to use as part of the Social Security Program--\nthat we have been trying to do this, trying to get it right. At that \ntime, 90 years ago, there were not the votes to do that. Since then, \nHarry Truman wanted to have health care reform. It did not get done.\n  President Johnson initially wanted to have a system that every \nAmerican would be able to benefit from. That did not get done. But I am \nvery proud that a first major step was taken with President Johnson and \na Democratic majority and some Republican colleagues joining with them. \nI hope we are going to see that kind of bipartisan effort now. But we \nended up with something called Medicare.\n  If seniors or people with disabilities could have been able to get \nhealth insurance that they could find and afford at the time, Medicare \nwould not have passed in 1965. It passed, along with Medicaid for low-\nincome seniors and families, because people could not find insurance. \nThey could not afford it. That is why it passed.\n  We are now in the same situation. Since that time in 1965, there have \nbeen a number of different efforts. A very important effort, one that \nthere was bipartisan support to do, children's health insurance, was \nput in place--but still, not a system in America where everyone would \nbe able to afford to buy insurance, to be able to get health care for \nthemselves and their families.\n  So here we are today. It is time to finish the job that was started \nyears ago, to finally say: OK, we understand that health insurance is \nnot like other kinds of insurance. You can choose not to buy a car if \nyou do not want to, and you do not have to have car insurance. You can \nchoose not to buy a house and not have homeowners insurance. You cannot \nchoose not to be a human being and to get sick. So it is different.\n  So the question for all of us is not whether people will ever need to \nuse the health care system or whether they ever, in fact, will get \nhealth care; it is when and how and how expensive it will be.\n  One of the major reasons today that the health care system is so \nexpensive--and, in fact, we spend twice as much as any other country on \nhealth care. When you think about that, how crazy is that? We spend \ntwice as much as any other country on health care and have over 47 \nmillion people with no health insurance. Any economist would kind of \nlook at that and say that is crazy.\n  But we have a system now where the people who are uninsured or \nunderinsured--or have their premiums and copays going up too much where \nthey cannot afford to use their insurance--go to the emergency room, \nmoms and dads going to the emergency room with their children.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit emergency rooms, both when I have \nbeen in an emergency but also just there with emergency room \nphysicians, with the nurses, to watch what happens. Anytime you have \nseen that, you\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\nknow there are lots of moms and dads who have no other choice for their \nchildren than to take them to the emergency room.\n  We also have more and more people who, because of dental problems--\nthe inability to get basic dental coverage--end up in the emergency \nroom of the hospital. When that happens, people are served. That is the \njob of the hospitals, and I believe we should be focusing on emergency \nrooms and emergency room physicians and giving them extra support \nbecause of what they do. But the reality is, they are served. Then who \npays for it? Well, everybody who has insurance pays for it because the \nhospital then takes the uncompensated care and rolls it over into the \ncosts of those with insurance. That is the system today. People get \ncare.\n  They walk in the emergency room sicker than they otherwise would be--\nmaybe waiting until late Friday night to have something happen, hoping \nthey were not going to have to go to the doctor because they could not \nafford it, and they end up in the emergency room on the weekend.\n  The reality is, we have now institutionalized the system that is the \nmost expensive way possible to provide health care in this country. So \nthat is a huge issue.\n  We know if everybody is in it, if everybody is part of the system, \nand we spread all the different ages and health conditions and \ngeographic disparities and all of the different pieces and variables in \nthe system, and we have everybody in some way covered--everybody in--\ncosts actually go down, which is also different than other kinds of \ngoods and services. So health care is, in fact, different.\n  But we now have a system where we are paying for this and providing \nfor this in the most expensive way possible. So there are many \nreasons--many reasons--why we need to have a sense of urgency about \nhealth care and what we are doing here. We need to remind ourselves \ndaily that this does not go away just because we are not paying \nattention. When we are not paying attention, the prices go up. When we \nare not paying attention, people get sick. When we are not paying \nattention, businesses continue either not to be able to cover their \nemployees or drop coverage because of what is happening on the costs.\n  The only question we have is, when are we going to act? That is the \nonly question for us--not whether we are going to pay for it but it is \nhow we are going to pay for it. Are we going to create a system that \nover time actually lowers costs by doing the right thing and having a \nsystem that incentivizes the right things or are we going to continue \nto do what we do now: costs going up, exploding, and the availability \nof care going down? That is the system now.\n\n  As we discuss all of these issues, it is very complicated. All of us \ninvolved in this wish it were not. This is an incredibly complicated \nissue. As we have been working our way through this very hard, we have \nheard from lots of people in this discussion, those who operate as a \nbusiness, who make a profit off this current health care system, those \nwho are involved in it in various capacities. But I don't think we hear \nenough from those who are affected, from people in Michigan, people in \nNorth Carolina, people around the country who are trying to take care \nof their families, trying to be healthy, trying to get the care they \nneed when they are sick, operating under this system.\n  Because of that, I set up on my Web site something I am calling my \nHealth Care People's Lobby. We have lots of lobbyists here. I have \ninvited people from Michigan to be a part of my Health Care People's \nLobby and share their stories about what is happening for them. I wish \nto share a few of those comments with my colleagues this evening, from \nthousands of people who are now a part of my Health Care People's \nLobby.\n  Tricia Kersten from Bloomfield Hills, MI, says she doesn't understand \nwhy some Senators don't seem to understand the ``unbelievable, \ndaunting, and debilitating effect the cost of health care causes their \nvoters.''\n  She is right. We all need to be paying attention to that. The cost of \nhealth care today, as I mentioned, is crushing our families and \nbusinesses, large and small, and that has to be part of--and it is, it \nis--part of the goal. In fact, it is at the top of the list in terms of \nour goals--lowering the cost.\n  Janet Rodriguez, St. Joseph, MI, wrote that her health care premiums \nfor her family of three are over $700 a month. Because her employer \npays a portion of her premium, and because those premiums are going up \nand up every year, she hasn't gotten a raise in 3 years.\n  This is a very common situation for workers who get their insurance \nthrough their employer. More and more people are having to trade off \ngetting a wage increase that would help pay the mortgage and food and \nclothes and send the kids to college for a health care cost increase \nthat is occurring, and their employers having to pay more of that or \ntheir having to pay more of that.\n  Cheryl Crandall of Pontiac, MI, is about to lose her COBRA benefits \nnext month and has been shopping for personal insurance. Within 2 \nweeks, the price had already jumped from $22 a month to $667 a month. \nSo it was $22, and it jumped to $667 a month. That is $150 more than \nher house payment. She says: ``We are very, very frugal people. No big \nvacations, no expensive toys, and we are not impoverished yet. But \npremiums like this for mediocre coverage, large deductibles, large \ncopays, can break even the most stable family.''\n  We know that is what is happening. Her story is shared by thousands \nand thousands of people I know across Michigan.\n  Our current health care system is bankrupting too many families. We \nknow that over 60 percent of bankruptcies are linked to medical \nexpenses. Seventy-five percent of families who file for bankruptcy \nactually have health insurance, and those who have insurance on average \nhave medical expenses of over $18,000 when they file, even though they \nhave a health insurance policy. It is even worse for those without \ninsurance.\n  Sandra Marczewski from Waterford, MI, wrote to me that she and her \nhusband have been without insurance for 7 months. She writes: ``You \nhave no idea the fear I walk around with every day.''\n  This is a fear faced by millions of Americans, tens of millions of \nAmericans, hard-working Americans, people who have done the right thing \ntheir whole life and now find themselves struggling in this economy and \nfacing that fear. After they put the kids to bed at night they say a \nlittle prayer: Please don't let the kids get sick. They stay up \nworrying about what is going to happen if they do get sick; avoiding \nthat cancer screening because they don't want to hear it if it comes \nback positive, because they don't think they can do anything about it. \nIt is a fear that grips the heart of too many Americans, and it is so \ncritical that we move forward in a way that will allow us to address \nwhat is happening with American families.\n  Lee Harshbarger of Ypsilanti lived with that fear. He had no health \ninsurance for 9 years. Thankfully, his wife's job now covers him, but \nthey worry every day: What will happen if she loses her job or if her \nemployer has to cut back on insurance or drop insurance? What will \nhappen then?\n  It is not just families who are hurting either. We know it is our \nbusinesses, large and small. I have had so many small business people \ncome up to me and say: You have to do something. I want to cover my 10 \nemployees, my 5 employees. I can't even find insurance for myself at a \nreasonable rate, let alone the small group of people who work for me.\n  A.J. Deeds from Ann Arbor, MI, used to operate a small business in \nBirmingham. They had 12 employees and they offered them health \ninsurance, but they soon found their competitors didn't offer these \nbenefits and they were left behind competitively, so they faced what \nmany businesses and families face, which is a race to the bottom. You \ncan't compete if you offer health insurance or a good wage, so you drop \nthe health insurance and you push down the wage.\n  By 1997, he wrote, they had to stop providing health insurance \nbecause they couldn't afford it anymore and be competitive with the \nother companies that didn't offer insurance. That same year, A.J.'s \nfirst child was born and his monthly insurance premium shot up to over \n$800 a month for three people.\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\n  Some have argued that a public health insurance plan would put \nbureaucrats between you and your doctor. How many times have we heard \nthat? But right now, we have a bureaucrat between you and your doctor, \nand it is an insurance company bureaucrat. This notion that the doctor \ncan offer whatever tests or procedure he or she feels they should for \nyou is just that; it is not in the real world. It is not real that an \nindividual who has insurance can go out and see a doctor or see any \ndoctor they want, get any procedure, any treatment they want. They \nfirst have to look through mounds of paperwork in the insurance policy \nto see if it is covered, and then the first call the doctor makes is to \nthe insurance company to determine whether they will pay for it.\n  I believe it is incredibly important that we create a system--this is \nwhat we are working to do--that is much more about doctors and \npatients, much more about that. A critical part of this--and I \nappreciate that the industry is supportive of this--is changing the \nsystem so that someone can get insurance if they have a preexisting \ncondition, that we change the rating bands to make it more affordable \nand do a number of other insurance regulation reforms. This is \nincredibly important. But it is also true that right now, your \ndecisions about health care depend upon, A, whether you have health \ninsurance; and B, what it will cover, what the copays are, what the \npremiums are. You are in a box that is dependent on whatever that \ninsurance policy is and what it will cover. The worst thing is when \nsomeone pays in for years and believes something is covered, and it \nshould be covered, and finds out it is not or finds out they are ill \nand are then dropped. So there are a number of changes that need to \ntake place there as well.\n  I have to put a plug in because in Michigan we have, by State \nstatute, established BlueCross BlueShield as a nonprofit to insure \neveryone in the State, the insurer of last resort, and that has worked \nvery well for us, and I am very appreciative of the great work they do. \nThat is not true everywhere. I think we have some serious issues around \nthe for-profit insurance companies that we need to take a look at as \nrelates to the costs that people are paying.\n  Robert Balmes from Negaunee, MI, up in the Upper Peninsula, had to \njump through hoops with his insurance company to get a medical device \nhe needed. He was forced to deal with the company's in-network sellers, \neven though he could have gotten the same device much cheaper from a \ndifferent supplier. His 20 percent copay would have been much lower if \nhe could have gotten the device from the seller of his choice. If he \ncould have gone where he wanted to go, it would have been cheaper, but \nhe wasn't given the choice by the insurance company. He had to pay what \nthe insurance company said or pay the whole thing on his own.\n  Bea Stachiw from Rochester Hills is also fed up with her insurance \ncompany. She has an individual policy, which is one of the most \nexpensive ways you can get insurance, that costs her $400 a month as an \nindividual, which she describes as ``sketchy, at the least, where I \nhave to pay $2,500 up front as a deductible.'' She is limited to two \ndoctors' visits a year. So two doctors' visits. Talk about coming \nbetween you and your doctor--two doctors' visits a year, and she has a \ncopay. She needed a routine medical procedure and had to pay over $700 \nout of her pocket. For people struggling to make ends meet, those kinds \nof costs are not acceptable. People can't afford this.\n  Again, this whole process of health insurance reform is about \nsupporting doctors and nurses to be able to do what they were trained \nand want to do, and to be able to make health care available to \nAmericans, young and old, with families, without, small businesses and \nlarge. That is what this is all about.\n  I am very pleased we are working on an approach that would give \npeople choice, that would allow people to keep their insurance if they \nwish to, and I think that many people--again, my own family would say, \nwe want to keep ours. Well, we are not in the Federal system, so we \nknow that many people would say they are satisfied, that they like what \nthey have. I say, great, to that. We want to make sure, No. 1, that \npeople can keep what they have, but if the system is broken for you, we \nwant to fix it. That is what health reform is about. Keep what you have \nif you like it. Let us fix what is broken so everyone has the \nopportunity to have the health care they need.\n  There are a number of ways in which we are working to do that. I \nmentioned earlier making sure that everyone is covered, a part of \nlowering the costs so we don't have too many people using the emergency \nrooms inappropriately. We know that payments to providers drive the \nsystem, and the proposal we are all working on would focus on quality, \nnot quantity, of tests; would focus on health and wellness, not \nsickness, so we are incentivizing those things that allow people to be \nhealthy, that encourage and support primary care doctors as the first \nline of defense, and nurses as a first line of defense so that people \nbeing able to get the care and the funding they need, the screenings, \nthe prevention they need, that is all part of this very important \nchange.\n  The long-term savings in the system come from changing the system to \nhealth care rather than sick care and quality rather than quantity. We \nalso know that, as I said before, insurance reform is an incredibly \nimportant part of it, so everyone can get the insurance they need, that \nit is affordable, and that they know they won't be dropped if they get \nsick.\n  Finally, it is very important that we have the right mix of choices, \nthat we have private sector options but that there also be a public \nhealth care option that is consumer driven, that is a benchmark on the \ntrue cost of providing health care, so there can be competition. It \nneeds to be level and fair competition. I believe we need that \ncompetition.\n  Madam President, we have a lot of work to do in the coming weeks. It \nis very important work. The American people have waited long enough for \nus to get this done. We know it is complicated. People of good will are \nworking to come together on an approach, but we need to get it done \nbecause people in each of our States--my great State of Michigan and \nacross the country--are counting on us because the system doesn't work \nnow for too many people. It is not acceptable. Getting sick is not a \nchoice. Worrying about your children, your family, your moms and dads, \nyour friends and neighbors, and what will happen to them when they do \nget sick is a fear or a worry we need to be able to address. We need to \ntake that worry off of the American people and say that we get it.\n  Health care should be a right, not a privilege, in the greatest \ncountry in the world. That is what this work we are doing is all about. \nI very much hope we are going to have a product that will be widely \nsupported and that we can move it on to the President as soon as \npossible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 1390.\n  Mr. DODD. And that is the Defense authorization bill; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to spend a couple of minutes \ntalking about one of the issues we are going to be debating and voting \non in the next number of days, and that is the consideration of the F-\n22 Raptor.\n  I, first of all, want to inform my colleagues, as I have on previous \ntimes, of my interest in the subject matter. I am not a member of the \nArmed Services Committee. I have great respect for Carl Levin, one of \nmy dearest friends, chairman of the committee, and John McCain, who is \nthe ranking Republican on the committee, and my colleague Joe Lieberman \nserves on this committee, and many others who worked hard, I know, on \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  One of the matters that is going to be the subject of some debate, as \nI mentioned, is the consideration of the additional F-22 fighters that \nwere voted on by the committee, in a narrow vote, a\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\n13-to-11 vote, I am told. Now Senator Levin and Senator McCain have \noffered an amendment that would strike the $1.75 billion for these \nadditional aircraft. I want to address that subject matter.\n  My State is going to be adversely affected. Somewhere between 2,000 \nand 3,000 jobs will be jeopardized if this amendment carries. \nObviously, that is of great concern to us in Connecticut. It is an \nargument I hope will have some weight with our colleagues as we are all \nfaced with these matters from time to time. I know just making a \nConnecticut argument to 99 Senators is not necessarily going to \nprevail. I hope my colleagues will consider what we are doing.\n  Our Nation leads the world in aerospace. There is no one even close \nto our ability to produce the most sophisticated aircraft in the world. \nThe F-22, without any doubt, is the most sophisticated aircraft in the \nworld. But we are told the Chinese and the Russians are quickly \ndeveloping fifth generation technology to compete with our F-22.\n  My concern is, if we end up doing what the Levin-McCain amendment \ndoes--and that is to terminate this program prematurely--we end up with \na number of F-22s that will hardly provide the kind of security that \nwill be required. And for that $1.75 billion in this budget, we help \nsustain 25,000 jobs nationwide.\n  I cannot help but notice that over the last few months the federal \ngovernment provided $65 billion to prop up a failing automobile \nindustry. Chrysler and GM have gone through bankruptcy. A lot of people \nlost their jobs. I was supportive of the effort to try and make a \ndifference there. The industry had failed in many ways. They had not \nmodernized and had fallen behind world competition. So taxpayers \nprovided $65 billion and acquired significant equity stakes in the \ncompanies to prop up our domestic automobile industry.\n  Here we are talking about $1.75 billion to support an important \nsegment of the aerospace industry that helps to provide jobs to \nthousands of American workers. And we are about to say to our workers \nthat the resulting production gap is acceptable, at a time when \nunemployment rates are expected to exceed 10 percent. But for some \nreason, some of my colleagues insist that we should not sustain part of \nthe most sophisticated and advanced aerospace industrial base in the \nworld for $1.75 billion. In contrast, as I mentioned we are devoting \n$65 billion to the automobile industry, which to many is a different \nmatter.\n  I don't understand that logic. This is the very same government that \nsays our domestic auto industry is worth saving, and I joined with my \ncolleagues on that issue. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I led \nthe fight to help save that industry in the Senate, an industry run \ninto the ground by shoddy management and no business plan whatsoever.\n  While the government is picking winners and losers, I have to ask my \ncolleagues: Do we truly believe that the domestic auto industry is more \nworth saving than a critical portion of America's aerospace industry? \nBecause that is what we are talking about.\n  A government-mandated commission on the future of the U.S. aerospace \nindustry recently recommended that ``the Nation immediately reverse the \ndecline in and promote the growth of a scientifically and \ntechnologically trained U.S. aerospace workforce,'' adding, ``the \nbreakdown of America's intellectual and industrial capacity is a threat \nto national security and our capability to continue as a world \nleader.'' Here we are with unemployment rates going through the \nceiling, and for $1.75 billion--and it is expensive; I am not saying it \nis not--but we are not in any situation to allow any more American jobs \nto be lost. These job losses are entirely preventable; it is within our \npower to protect the jobs of thousands of workers across the country.\n\n  And if the Levin-McCain amendment prevails, I am afraid that some day \npeople will look back, and say: What in the world were we thinking? \nWhat in the world were we thinking of, with jobs at risk and talented \npeople--engineers, machinists--whom we rely on every day to maintain \nour superiority in this area.\n  Madam President and my colleagues, we are about to face a 3-year \nproduction gap between the F-22 and F-35. During that time, we will see \nmany of our most skilled and experienced industry workers walk away. \nAnd it will be incredibly difficult, in fact I am not sure it is \npossible, to reconstitute this type of workforce.\n  So either today or sometime next week we are going to, once again, \nconsider legislation to strip this provision of the bill--the provision \nthat would keep the most advanced fighter jet production lines humming. \nBefore that vote, I hope my colleagues will ask themselves a very \nsimple question: At a time of heightened security concerns and economic \nuncertainty, is it in our interest to cancel this program? According to \nthe F-22's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, the F-22 directly employs \n25,000 people across the Nation and an additional 70,000 in indirect \njobs. With over 1,000 suppliers in 44 States, it has an economic impact \nof over $12 billion.\n  The decision to kill the F-22 will have further ramifications. With \nthis decision, America's production lines of advanced tactical aircraft \nwill grind to a halt, and we are not expected to ramp up again for \nanother 3 years. What happens to that workforce? I know what happens to \nit. If my colleagues vote for this amendment, they will be voting \nagainst our tactical aircraft industry. They will be saying that the \ngovernment can no longer support these 95,000 skilled workers across \nour Nation. And to me, it doesn't add up.\n  The other day I went through a chart explaining the capabilities of \nthis aircraft versus those that exist in nations around the world. We \nare going to put ourselves at some risk, I would say to my colleagues. \nAnd that is not my conclusion alone. Listen to General Corley, who \nheads up the Air Combat Command, and listen to General Wyatt, the \ndirector of the Air National Guard. They have warned us about this very \nissue. This is a very critical and dangerous decision we are making.\n  We have spent billions of dollars to develop this plane--billions. We \nwere supposed to build 381 of them. Now we have reduced that number to \n187. In doing so, we are committing ourselves to ending the production \nline. Terminating the program will eliminate the opportunity for us to \nexplore the merits of developing an export model of the F-22. We have \nallies that would benefit from purchasing a modified version of this \ntechnology. By offering them this capability, we would enhance our \nshared commitment to protecting global security. But this option will \nnot be available if we adopt the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this issue. I know Members are \nfacing a great deal of pressure from all sides of this issue. But I \nthink, as Members, we have an obligation, obviously, to respond to the \ncalls we get, but I would argue that we have a higher responsibility to \nanalyze the implications of a vote such as this.\n  The implications of this vote, I think, are profound and serious for \nour country in terms of not only the economic and national security \nimpact, but, for the thousands of American jobs that are sustained by \nthe F-22. $1.75 billion is small in comparison to the $65 billion we \nhave spent already to prop-up an industry that, frankly, should have \nshown far more leadership. The industries involved in this are not \nfailing. These are solid, sound businesses. Yet they are going to be \ndamaged as a result of a vote that is quite frankly, not in the \ninterest of our national security or our economy.\n  I would urge my colleagues, over the next several days, to think \nthrough this issue, to examine some of these facts before coming here \nto cast a ballot that will jeopardize both American jobs and our \nposition as the global leader in aerospace industry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Smith \namendment on hate crimes. This amendment mirrors the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act, which I have been proud to cosponsor. This \namendment puts America's values of equality and freedom into action.\n  Hate crimes are one of the most shocking types of violence against \nindividuals. They are motivated by hatred and bigotry. But hate crimes \ntarget more than just one person--they are crimes against a community \nbecause of who they are--because of their race, gender, sexual \norientation, religion or disability.\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\n  We are a nation that cherishes our freedom. All Americans must be \nfree to go to church, walk through their communities, attend school \nwithout the fear that they will be the target of hate violence. We are \nnation that is built on a foundation of tolerance and equality. Yet no \nAmerican can be free from discrimination and have true equality unless \nthey are free from hate crimes. That is why hate crimes are so \ndestructive. They tear at our Nation's greatest strength--our \ndiversity.\n  This amendment does two things--it helps communities fight these \ncrimes and it makes sure that those who are most often the target of \nhate motivated violence have the full protection of our Federal laws.\n  The amendment strengthens current law to help local law enforcement \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. It does this by closing a \nloophole that prevented the Federal Government from assisting local and \nState police at any stage of the investigative process. Simply put--\nthis bill authorizes Federal law enforcement officers to get involved \nif State or local governments want their help. That means local \ncommunities, which often have very limited resources for pursuing these \ntypes of crimes, will have the resources of the FBI and other Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies at their disposal to help them more \neffectively prosecution incidents of hate violence.\n  This amendment also improves current law so it protects more \nAmericans. It broadens the definition of hate crimes to include gender, \nsexual orientation and disability. Today, gay and lesbian Americans, \nwomen and those with disabilities are often targets of hate motivated \nviolence, but existing Federal laws offer these communities no \nsafeguards. That is the weakness in our current law. And that is what \nthis legislation will fix. By passing this legislation today, the \nSenate says to all Americans that you deserve the full protection of \nthe law and you deserve to be free from hate violence.\n  Hate crimes are crimes against more than one person--these crimes \naffect whole communities and create fear and terror in these \ncommunities and among all Americans. We need look no further than the \nhorrific killings of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard to know the anger \nand grief that families and communities experience because of hatred \nand bigotry. Hate crimes attack the fundamental values of our Nation--\nfreedom and equality. This bill is another step in the fight to make \nsure that in a nation that treasures these values these crimes do not \noccur.\n  So today I rise to support and urge my colleagues to pass this much \nneeded and timely legislation. It is time that we put these American \nvalues into action and pass this hate crimes bill. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act says that all Americans are valued and \nprotected--regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or \ndisability.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today in support of \namendment No. 1511 to S. 1390.\n  In the midst of my first campaign for Congress in 1998, the Nation \nwas shocked by the tragic death of Matthew Shepard.\n  We all know well the story of Matthew--a 21-year-old University of \nWyoming student who was brutally murdered simply for being gay. He was \nbeaten severely, tied to a fence, and left to die in freezing \ntemperatures. Matthew was taken to a hospital in Fort Collins, CO, \nwhere he never regained consciousness.\n  I was elected to Congress a month after Matthew's murder. And for \nevery year thereafter, I have supported Federal hate crimes legislation \nthat would later be renamed for him--The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act.\n  Ten years later, in 2008, I asked my fellow Coloradans to entrust me \nwith the honor of representing them in the Senate. During that \ncampaign, I was deeply saddened to learn about another tragic murder \nthis time in my home State of Colorado.\n  In July of last year, 18-year-old Angie Zapata was beaten to death in \nthe living room of her Greeley apartment. According to press accounts, \nAngie's attacker claims that he brutally went after her with a fire \nextinguisher, pummeling her until she could not fight back because of \nhis hatred for transgender and gay people. This case is a sobering \nreminder that 10 years after Matthew Shepard's murder, vile prejudice \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity still plagues our \nsociety.\n  Unlike Federal law, Colorado has a strong hate crimes statute. The \nman accused of killing Angie was the first person in the Nation to be \ntried and eventually convicted under any State's hate crime law for \nkilling a person because of transgender orientation. I hope that the \nsuccessful prosecution of Angie's killer in Colorado will be an example \nfor other States and demonstrate to Members of Congress that it is time \nfor the country as a whole to follow our lead.\n  President Obama has promised to sign into law the expansion of hate \ncrimes statute to include sexual identity, gender identity and \ndisability, which is what the amendment before us today would do. I am \na cosponsor and ardent supporter of this amendment because I believe \nnow is the time in remembrance of Matthew and Angie and all other \nAmericans who have been a victim of violent crimes motivated by hate to \nget this done. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which my \ncolleague from Vermont has offered as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill, should not be attached to such an important piece \nof legislation. The Defense authorization bill authorizes nearly $680 \nbillion for national defense programs, most notably the ongoing \noperations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terror. It authorizes \nfunding for such crucial programs as missile defense and foreign \nmilitary aid for Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as a 3.4-percent \nacross-the-board pay raise for the men and women in the military. With \nsuch important issues at stake, we should not attach a controversial \npiece of unrelated legislation that puts passage of the entire bill at \nrisk.\n  Last month, members of the Judiciary Committee received a letter from \nthe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights strongly urging us to vote against \nthe proposed Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n  The Commission states this bill ``will do little good and a great \ndeal of harm.'' Those are very strong words from the Federal body \ncharged with investigating, reporting on, and making recommendations \nrelated to civil rights issues. The Commission's letter details a \nnumber of specific concerns, including that the bill would permit \nFederal authorities to prosecute defendants who have been previously \nacquitted by State juries--a result that it describes as contrary to \nthe spirit of the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution. Like the \nCommission, I believe that hate crimes legislation poses significant \nconstitutional problems and risks undermining important principles of \nfederalism.\n  No less than 45 States and the District of Columbia already have hate \ncrimes laws. I am not aware of evidence that any State has been \nreluctant to aggressively prosecute hate crimes. Furthermore, Federal \nsentencing guidelines already provide for enhancements for hate crimes \nbased on race, color, religion, natural origin, ethnicity, gender, \ndisability, or sexual orientation. In fact, in the case of Matthew \nShepard, for whom this bill is named, his killers are appropriately \nserving life sentences in prison for felony murder.\n  The trend to try at the Federal level crimes that traditionally have \nbeen handled in State courts not only is taxing the judiciary's \nresources and affecting its budget needs but also threatens to change \nthe nature of our Federal system. The pressure in Congress to appear \nresponsive to every highly publicized societal ill or sensational crime \nneeds to be balanced with an inquiry into whether States are doing an \nadequate job in these particular areas and, ultimately, whether we want \nmost of our legal relationships decided at the national rather than \nlocal level.\n  Federal courts were not created to adjudicate local crimes, no matter \nhow heinous they may be. State courts handle such problems. While there \ncertainly are areas in criminal law in which the Federal Government \nmust act, the vast majority of local criminal cases should be decided \nin the State courts which are equipped for such matters. Matters that \ncan be handled adequately by the States should be left\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\nto them; matters that cannot be so handled should be undertaken by the \nFederal Government. Neither Senator Leahy nor other supporters of this \nbill have demonstrated that there is an epidemic of hate-based violence \nthat State and local authorities can't or won't prosecute, therefore \njustifying the need for a hate crimes bill.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate is considering the bipartisan \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 as an amendment to \nthe pending the pending National Defense Authorization Act. This \nimportant civil rights bill has been pending for more than a decade and \nhas passed the Senate numerous times--in 2007, 2004, 2000, and 1999. It \nalso has the support of the Attorney General, and the President has \nasked Congress to take swift action on this bill.\n  I thank Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, and the 33 other bipartisan \ncosponsors for their support for my amendment, which contains the full \ntext of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act introduced by \nSenator Kennedy.\n  I wish my friend could be here with us today. I commend the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts for his steadfast leadership over the last \ndecade in working to expand our Federal hate crimes laws.\n  I thank the majority leader for offering this amendment on my behalf \nwhile I chaired the hearing on Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate \nJustice on the Supreme Court. I had hoped that we would reach a time \nagreement or at least an agreement to proceed to this bipartisan \namendment. Yet some have sought to further delay passage of this \ncritical measure.\n  The hate crimes amendment would improve existing law by making it \neasier for Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes of \nracial, ethnic, or religious violence. Victims will no longer have to \nengage in a narrow range of activities, such as serving as a juror, to \nbe protected under Federal law.\n  In addition, the hate crimes amendment will provide assistance and \nresources to State, local and tribal law enforcement to address hate \ncrimes. It also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal \nGovernment on the problem of crimes committed against people because of \ntheir sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability, which \nis a long-overdue protection.\n  As a former State prosecutor, respect for local and State law \nenforcement is important to me. This amendment was carefully crafted to \nstrike a proper balance between Federal and local interests by allowing \nthe Federal Government to appropriately support, but not to substitute \nfor, State and local law enforcement.\n  I come from a State that passed a law almost a decade ago to expand \nprotections for victims of violence motivated by sexual orientation and \ngender identity and to increase penalties for hate crimes to deter such \nviolence.\n  Unfortunately, not all States offer these protections--protections \nthat all Americans deserve. We need a strong Federal law to serve as a \nbackstop to prevent hate motivated violence in America.\n  The recent tragic events at the Holocaust museum have made clear that \nthese vicious crimes continue to haunt our country. This bipartisan \nlegislation is carefully designed to help law enforcement most \neffectively respond to this problem.\n  We stand to make real progress toward expanding Federal protections \nfor victims of bias-motivated violence when we vote for cloture to end \ndebate on the motion to proceed to this amendment.\n  Senators from both sides of the aisle support this amendment. I call \non all my fellow Senators to join me in support of this amendment and \nto vote to end the delay of Senate consideration of this important \nmeasure because expanding hate crimes protections and providing support \nto State, local, and tribal enforcement efforts are long overdue. That \nis why a vote for this amendment is necessary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak about the Hatch amendment \nwhich will be called up later.\n  As we have had the debate in this Chamber over hate crimes \nlegislation, one obvious fact is revealed again and again. The \nproponents of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act have not \ntaken the time to answer what should have been a threshold question: Is \nit necessary?\n  Just a few short weeks ago, Attorney General Eric Holder was gracious \nenough to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on this \nlegislation. During that hearing, I asked him specifically whether \nthere was any evidence of crimes motivated by bias and prejudice that \nare not being adequately addressed at the State level; whether there \nwas a specific trend indicating that, with regard to hate crimes, \njustice is not being served in State courts. His answer was not \nsurprising to anyone who has been following this debate for these many \nyears. But if your only knowledge of this issue came from the \nstatements made by the Democrats in support of this legislation, you \nwould probably be very surprised.\n  His answer was: No. There is not any statistical evidence indicating \nthat the States are not up to the task of investigating, prosecuting, \nand punishing crimes motivated by bias and prejudice. None. None \nwhatsoever. The Attorney General said quite openly, in fact, that the \nStates were doing a fine job addressing these crimes.\n  This is not a new revelation. In the years Congress has been debating \nhate crimes legislation, many of us have been asking similar questions, \nand we have received similar answers. But in light of the Democratic \nAttorney General's own testimony regarding the States' laudable efforts \nto punish hate crimes, it is even more clear that the supporters of \nthis legislation have not answered what would be a threshold question: \nIs it necessary?\n  The truth is that the vast majority of States have hate crimes \nstatutes on the books. The acts associated with this legislation--\nmurder, assault, et cetera--are punishable in every jurisdiction in the \nUnited States. Under our legal system, defendants will, at times, \nreceive penalties that many believe are not sufficient given the nature \nof their crimes. In addition, because our criminal justice system is \ndesigned to protect defendants and place the heaviest burdens on the \ngovernment, some guilty parties undoubtedly go unpunished. But I have \nseen no evidence whatsoever proving that these inevitable occurrences \nhappen more often in cases involving bias-motivated violence and, to \ndate, no such evidence has been provided.\n  My amendment is similar to legislation I have introduced in the past. \nInstead of expanding the powers of the Federal Government, it would \nmandate a study that would provide us with the information we should \nhave before we even consider taking such an approach. Specifically, my \nalternative would require a study to compare over a 12-month period the \ninvestigations, prosecutions, and sentencing in States that have \ndiffering laws with regard to hate crimes. In addition, it would \nrequire a report on the extent of those crimes throughout the United \nStates and the success rate of State and local officials in combating \nthem.\n  The amendment would also provide a mechanism for the Department of \nJustice to provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial or any other \nassistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime \n``motivated by animus against the victim by reason of the membership of \nthe victim in a particular class or group.'' And it would authorize the \nAttorney General to make grants to States that lack the necessary \nresources to prosecute these crimes.\n\n  Contrary to what some of my colleagues may believe, Congress does not \nhave the power to act in any manner that it chooses. There are a number \nof constitutional issues raised by this legislation, including the \nextent of Congress's power under the commerce clause and prohibitions \nthat could chill free speech in certain sectors of this country. Most \napparently, this legislation would impede on grounds that are \ntraditionally left to the States. Worst of all, it would do so when, if \nthe Attorney General is to be believed, the States are by and large \ndoing a fine job at addressing these crimes.\n  No one in this Chamber wants to see bias-motivated crimes go \nunpunished. That is not the question we are facing today. The question \nis whether, given the current state of affairs in most\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nStates and the limitations on Congress's power, this measure is \nappropriate.\n  It seems to me before we even consider such a broad and sweeping \nchange in the Federal criminal law we should at the very least have \nenough information before us to determine whether such law is \nnecessary. My amendment would have us get that information and, in \naddition, establish a role for the Federal Government that is more \nappropriate respecting the sovereignty of the States and the limits on \nFederal power established under the Constitution.\n  It should be noted that this bill that has been called up is named \nthe Matthew Shepard bill. What happened to Mr. Shepard was brutal, \nheinous, awful, unforgivable. But the fact is, the perpetrators are now \nspending the rest of their lives in prison because the local judiciary \nand system tried and convicted them. There is a real question whether \nwe should put into law this hate crimes bill that I believe is going to \ncause a lot more problems than it will help, especially since there is \nno basic evidence that the State and local governments are incapable or \nunable to take care of these types of crimes.\n  I think there is a lot of beating of the breasts and acting like we \nare doing something when in fact all we are doing is gumming up the law \nif we pass this bill, and I think doing so unconstitutionally, in the \nend, basically is making it possible to bring hate crimes actions all \nover the country in a multiplicity of ways that will cost the Federal \nGovernment untold amounts of money that should not be spent.\n  All of us are against hate crimes. Every one of us would do \neverything we possibly can to get rid of them. But until there is \nevidence that the State and local governments are not doing the job--\nand that evidence we have asked for, for years now, and they have never \nbeen able to produce any. Until that is produced we should not go ahead \nand pass legislation like this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, there is soon to be an announced \nagreement. In that there will be an amendment I am putting forward to \nprotect free speech. I hope all my colleagues would join me in \nsupporting the amendment I am putting forward on the hate crimes bill. \nI think it is very important that we protect free speech. It has been \none of the things my colleagues who support the hate crimes legislation \nare saying: Look, we are protective of free speech. We are protective \nof religious expression.\n  If that is the case, I hope they will vote for the amendment I am \nputting forward.\n  I think it is important we be very clear on the protection of free \nspeech and religious protection as protected in the first amendment in \nthis bill as a way for it to be clear these things are to be protected. \nI want to read the amendment I am putting forward. It is a paragraph \nlong, and I think by reading it, it will help explain some of this to \nmy colleagues:\n\n       Nothing in this section or an amendment made by this \n     section shall be construed or applied in a manner that \n     infringes any rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution, or substantially burdens any exercise of \n     religion (regardless of whether compelled by, or central to, \n     a system of religious belief), speech, expression, \n     association, if such exercise of religion, speech, \n     expression, or association was not intended to--(1) plan or \n     prepare for an act of physical violence; or (2) incite an \n     imminent act of physical violence against another.\n\n  There is some lawyerese in that, but what it says is you have free \nspeech unless it is intended to plan or prepare for an act of physical \nviolence or incite an imminent act of physical violence against \nanother.\n  In other words, if you are saying this to try to incite people to \nphysical violence or an imminent act of physical violence, that is not \nprotected. But everything else is free speech and may be seen by some \nas religious expression.\n  What we are trying to do is narrow this, tying it into the actual act \nthat takes place and not be an act that intimidates people's expression \nof their ideas or expression of their religious convictions that they \nmay hold.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this and say, yes, that is what we \nmean to do, and not to sort of have a chilling effect on all free \nspeech, all free expression, on all free expression within a religious \norganization or group that may have some differing views.\n  Frankly, I don't think, if we have a bill that intimidates or chills \nfirst amendment free speech or religious expression, that it is going \nto stand constitutional challenge. That is why I am putting forward \nthis amendment.\n  The current language of this bill attempts to project the free \nexercise of religion solely to a first amendment constitutional \nframework. I think this is problematic because the Supreme Court has \nseverely limited those first amendment rights, particularly regarding \nfree religious expression as a result of a decision in an Employment \nDivision, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith. It was a \nNinth Circuit Court opinion.\n  The Congress, after that opinion was issued, was quick to recognize \nthe damage done to religious freedom in Smith and in response passed \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This act serves as a framework \ncreated by Congress to protect religious free speech in other contexts. \nThat is what this amendment is taking from, this bill that has already \npassed this Congress by a wide margin, the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act.\n  My amendment adopts language from that bill in contrast to the free \nexercise jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. Courts have noted that the \ncongressionally created Religious Freedom Restoration Act model \npossesses clarity and ease of construction. In fact, numerous claims \nthat were unsuccessful under the first exercise clause jurisprudence of \nthe Supreme Court have either prevailed or were entitled to remand for \nmore favorable review under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. My \namendment seeks to protect religious motivated speech but it protects \nspeech.\n  What it says is, if you are in a narrow category of where you are \nintending this speech to cause somebody bodily harm, then you are not \nprotected, and you should not be protected. But, if otherwise, you are \nexercising your right of free speech or religious association, you are \nentitled to the protection under the Constitution.\n  It would be my hope that my colleagues would look at this amendment \nand they would say that what we are putting forward is an amendment \nwhich has passed this body previously, passed this body in a strong \nbipartisan vote, is one that we want to stick with--that definition and \nnot this broader one that can be interpreted as limiting first \namendment freedom of expression or religious association.\n  That is a simple amendment I have put forward. I ask my colleagues to \nlook at the amendment itself. It is one paragraph long. I ask they \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I appreciate \neveryone's patience.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the Hatch \namendment, Leahy alternative to Brownback amendment and Brownback \namendments specified below, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Leahy amendment No. 1511; further, that when this \nagreement is entered, amendment No. 1539 be withdrawn, and that the \nfollowing list of amendments be the only amendments on the subject of \nhate crimes remaining in order during the pendency of S. 1390: Hatch \namendment regarding alternative; Leahy or designee alternative to \nBrownback amendment; Brownback amendment regarding first amendment \nprotections, Leahy or designee alternative to Sessions death penalty; \nSessions amendment regarding death penalty; Sessions amendment \nregarding servicemembers; Sessions amendment regarding attorney general \nregulations; that all of the above amendments be first-degree \namendments except the Hatch, Brownback and Leahy alternative to \nBrownback\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\namendment which are second-degree amendments to the Leahy amendment No. \n1511; and that debate on any of the amendments listed above be limited \nto 40 minutes each, prior to a vote in relation thereto, except the \nHatch, Leahy alternative and Brownback amendments; and the cloture vote \ndebate time be limited to up to 4 minutes each, equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that if there is a sequence of votes, \nthen any subsequent votes after the first would be limited to 10 \nminutes each; that upon disposition of the listed amendments, all \npostcloture time be yielded back; further, that the Hatch, Leahy \nalternative to Brownback and Brownback amendments be first debated and \nvoted tonight, that upon disposition of those amendments, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 1511; \nthat if cloture is invoked, then amendment No. 1511, as amended, if \namended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; further, that notwithstanding adoption of amendment No. 1511, as \namended, if amended, the remaining amendments relating to hate crimes \nstill be in order; further, that if cloture is not invoked on the Leahy \namendment, then the motion to reconsider be considered entered and the \npart of the agreement relating to the amendments with respect to hate \ncrimes be null and void; provided further that if upon reconsideration, \nand cloture is invoked, then the remaining amendments not disposed of \nprior to the cloture vote remain in order; further, that the next \nfirst-degree amendment in order to S. 1390 be a Republican amendment, \nwith no amendment in order to the amendment during today's session, \nwith the amendment being offered tonight and debate commencing on the \namendment when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill on Monday, \nfollowing disposition of the Leahy alternative and Sessions amendments \nlisted above; that upon disposition of the Republican amendment \nspecified above, Senator Levin be recognized to offer the Levin-McCain \namendment relating to the F-22, with debate on that amendment limited \nto 2 hours, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Levin and Chambliss or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that debate time, the Senate proceed to vote on the \namendment, with no amendment in order to the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nI ask my friend the majority leader, am I correct that after the four \nvotes tonight, the next vote will be on Monday at roughly what time?\n  Mr. REID. Probably around 3 o'clock. We are going to come in Monday \nat 1 and work through these amendments we have remaining on hate \ncrimes, and then we would go to the matter that will be offered by the \nRepublicans tonight. When we complete that, we will finish the work in \n2 hours on the F-22 amendment.\n  So next week, everybody, we will start early on Monday, as I have \nindicated, and we will have, perhaps, some long days. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We appreciate everyone's cooperation. It has been very \ndifficult to get this, but I think it will move to get the Defense bill \ndone at an earlier time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will these votes be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. REID. We have already indicated the first one will be 15. We hope \nto do some by voice. That is possible.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1610 to Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1610 and ask \nthat it be brought before the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1610 to amendment No. 1511.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify that the amendment shall not be construed or \n             applied to infringe on First Amendment rights)\n\n       Strike page 16, line 24 through page 17, line 7 and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATION.\n\n       Nothing in this division, or an amendment made by this \n     division, shall be construed or applied in a manner that \n     infringes on any rights under the first amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, or substantially burdens \n     any exercise of religion (regardless of whether compelled by, \n     or central to, a system of religious belief), speech, \n     expression, association, if such exercise of religion, \n     speech, expression, or association was not intended to--\n       (1) plan or prepare for an act of physical violence; or\n       (2) incite an imminent act of physical violence against \n     another.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is part of the agreement we had \nfor votes on side-by-sides.\n  What this amendment does is put forward and into this bill language \nthat this body has already passed by a vote of 97 to 3. It is language \nthat was in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It is to protect \nindividuals' religious freedom, their freedom of expression. It has \npassed this body overwhelmingly. It narrows the definition and it says \nthat if you intend to incite somebody to do physical harm to another \nindividual, that is not protected speech. If you plan to prepare for an \nact of physical violence or incite an imminent act of physical violence \nagainst another, it is not protected, that is not protected speech; \notherwise, you have free speech and the right to free speech expression \nand religious freedom expression.\n  It is important that we have a very clear definition--a narrow \ndefinition but a very clear definition--of what is protected and what \nis not protected speech in this very critical area of first amendment \nrights and limitations we are putting in here.\n  It is a very short amendment, a very important amendment on the hate \ncrimes legislation. I ask my colleagues for their support again, as \nmany of my colleagues have already voted for it in an overwhelming \nnumber.\n  I thank my colleagues for their review of this amendment. I hope they \ncan vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, once this amendment of the Senator from \nKansas is disposed of, I will then offer an amendment. My amendment \nwould preserve the first amendment protections in the hate crimes bill \nand add language to clarify that nothing in this act diminishes the \nprotections of the first amendment. Of course, we could not pass a \nbill, as I am sure the Senator from Kansas knows, Congress could not \npass legislation that would diminish the protections of the first \namendment, the first amendment being in the Constitution, the first \namendment protecting our right to practice whatever religion we want or \nnone if we want and protecting our right of free speech.\n  At the appropriate time, I will have an amendment which would \npreserve first amendment protections in the hate crimes bill and add \nlanguage to clarify that nothing in this act diminishes the protections \nof the first amendment. I would assume the Senator from Kansas would \nhave no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I certainly don't have an objection to an amendment \nbeing brought up. I would note that this is a very important area we \nare treading on, limitation of people's free speech and religious \nassociation they have. What I am offering is language that has passed \nthis body by a large margin before, 97 to 3. I hope to see the language \nthe Senator from Vermont is putting forward. If it is the language that \nis currently in the bill, this is quite untested language in a very \nlimited area. I read his language to be quite expansive. I think it \nwould be questionable, going into constitutional territory. But the \nbigger point on this being that I believe my colleagues who want to \npass the hate speech legislation have been saying all along this does \nnot limit somebody's right of free\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nspeech. It doesn't limit anybody's right of religious expression, if \nthey have different views. It is just about a violent act and \nassociation that would reflect hate. So what I have done in two \nsentences is say let's be specific about that rather than very general \nabout that in its interpretation or leaving that to the court.\n  If I have the language correct that he is putting forward in \nreinstating this, I really hope my colleagues would look at both of \nthese and say they do want a very narrow, specific definition put \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection to just accepting by \nvoice vote his amendment if the language was previously voted on in the \nlast Congress and has been pending for some time.\n  Mine is very short. I call on any Senator to tell me if there is \nanything they disagree with. It says:\n\n       Nothing in this division, or amendment made by this \n     division, shall be construed to diminish any rights under the \n     first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit any \n     constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct or \n     activities (regardless of whether compelled by, or central \n     to, a system of religious belief), including the exercise of \n     religion protected by the first amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States and peaceful picketing or demonstration. \n     The Constitution does not protect speech, conduct or \n     activities consisting of planning for, conspiring to commit, \n     or committing an act of violence.\n\n  Does any Member of this body, Republican or Democratic, disagree with \nthat language? Basically, it says the Constitution is the Constitution. \nWe follow the Constitution. Does anyone disagree with that language?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator from Vermont recall that when Attorney \nGeneral Holder appeared before the Judiciary Committee, he was asked \npointblank if, in the course of a religious ceremony or religious \nobservance, a person gave a sermon, made a speech that was negative \ntoward people of different sexual orientation and someone in the \ncongregation, after hearing the sermon, committed an act of violence, \nthe Attorney General was asked, would the person who gave the sermon, \ngave the speech, be held responsible under the hate crimes act and the \nAttorney General responded no because the hate crimes act requires a \nphysical act of violence in order for there to be a prosecution? Does \nthe Senator from Vermont recall that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I recall that very well. I also note that every single \nRepublican, every single Democratic member on the committee agreed with \nAttorney General Holder on that.\n  My amendment simply says that the Constitution of the United States \ncontrols. That is the ultimate law of the land. I can't imagine anybody \nin this body disagreeing with that, especially as every single Member \nof this body has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment of the Senator from Vermont makes it very \nclear that included in first amendment rights are the rights to \npeaceful picketing or demonstration. That is not included in the \nBrownback amendment. Would the Senator from Vermont agree, however, \nthat we don't need to choose between the two amendments? They both \nstate important truths and make very important contributions. Is it not \nthe Senator's understanding that both amendments can be adopted, that \nthey are not at all inconsistent with each other?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with that. And speaking as the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I am perfectly willing to accept both of \nthem. I would be surprised if my friend from Kansas feels otherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for his comment on this issue.\n  I guess the conferees will have to deal with a difficult issue \noutside the jurisdiction of the committee, particularly on something \nlike hate crimes, which I really have great question as to why on Earth \nwe would do this on a DOD authorization bill.\n  But I would like to point out that my colleague, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, has been in that committee for a long period of \ntime, and he knows these issues very well. What his amendment puts \nforward is something that will be interpreted then by the courts. It \nwill have to be interpreted by the courts, and it has broader language.\n  What I am putting forward is very specific language that puts a clear \nintent of the Congress not to limit certain types of speech but to \nlimit speech that is associated with physical harm or the incitement of \nphysical harm. That seems to me to be clearly appropriate for us to do, \nprobably a better thing to do on the hate crimes legislation--for us to \nbe very specific and narrow in this area where we are treading into \nfirst amendment religious expression areas.\n  I would like to read my language, if I could, to my colleague. It \nsays--and this is the operative part of this--``if such exercise of \nreligion, speech, expression, or association was not intended to''--so \nit protects every area except what is ``not intended to plan or prepare \nfor an act of physical violence; or incite an imminent act of physical \nviolence against another.''\n  So we are trying to get into the category and the area, and a lot of \npeople are very concerned about this, about being able to have their \nrights for religious expression and freedom. I think this is a much \ntighter focus. I believe my colleague would agree, as a lawyer----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBrownback amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand the \nfirst vote under the unanimous consent agreement will be on the Leahy \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hatch.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In terms of these two amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hatch. And then after Hatch, Leahy, then \nBrownback.\n  Mr. LEVIN. All right. So that after the disposition of the Hatch \namendment, the first amendment to be disposed of between these two \nwould be the Leahy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would hope that to expedite things the Senator from \nVermont would consider a voice vote because I think both of these \namendments will pass, and should pass, and we can save the body's time.\n  But I would like to suggest that even though the Senator from Kansas \nwants a rollcall, both amendments should be adopted, and if the Senator \nfrom Vermont can accept a voice vote when it comes his turn, I think \nthat will indicate the clear will of the body, and then we would \nproceed to another clear will of the body on the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to answer the Senator from Michigan, I am \nperfectly willing to voice vote both of them. I intend to vote for both \nof them. We are saying that you have a freedom of religion, and the \ncourts cannot undermine the first amendment.\n  This is hornbook law. This is your first week of law school. No court \nis going to disagree with that. I am perfectly willing to accept both \nby a voice vote.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1613 to Amendment No. 1511\n\n  So, Mr. President, I offer my amendment and send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1613 to amendment No. 1511.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\n       (b) First amendment.--Nothing in this division, or an \n     amendment made by this division, shall be construed to \n     diminish any rights under the first amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Constitutional protections.--Nothing in this division \n     shall be construed to prohibit any constitutionally protected \n     speech, expressive conduct or activities (regardless of \n     whether compelled by, or central to, a system of religious \n     belief), including the exercise of religion protected by the \n     first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \n     peaceful picketing or demonstration. The Constitution does \n     not protect speech, conduct or activities consisting of \n     planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of \n     violence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1611 to Amendment No. 1511\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1611 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1611 to amendment No. 1511.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To prevent duplication in the Federal government)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. COMPREHENSIVE STUDY AND SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL \n                   INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, division E of this Act (relating to hate crimes), \n     and the amendments made by that division, shall have no force \n     or effect.\n       (b) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of relevant offense.--In this paragraph, the \n     term ``relevant offense'' means a crime described in \n     subsection (b)(1) of the first section of Public Law 101-275 \n     (28 U.S.C. 534 note) and a crime that manifests evidence of \n     prejudice based on gender or age.\n       (B) Collection from cross section of states.--Not later \n     than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation \n     with the National Governors' Association, shall, if possible, \n     select 10 jurisdictions with laws classifying certain types \n     of offenses as relevant offenses and 10 jurisdictions without \n     such laws from which to collect the data described in \n     subparagraph (C) over a 12-month period.\n       (C) Data to be collected.--The data described in this \n     paragraph are--\n       (i) the number of relevant offenses that are reported and \n     investigated in the jurisdiction;\n       (ii) the percentage of relevant offenses that are \n     prosecuted and the percentage that result in conviction;\n       (iii) the duration of the sentences imposed for crimes \n     classified as relevant offenses in the jurisdiction, compared \n     with the length of sentences imposed for similar crimes \n     committed in jurisdictions with no laws relating to relevant \n     offenses;

and\n       (iii) the number and percentage of relevant offenses that \n     are prosecuted and the number for which convictions are \n     obtained.\n       (c) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--At the \n     request of a law enforcement official of a State or a \n     political subdivision of a State, the Attorney General, \n     acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation and in cases where the Attorney General \n     determines special circumstances exist, may provide \n     technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other assistance \n     in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime \n     that--\n       (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (2) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State;

Mr. President, the purpose behind this amendment is \nsimple. The proponents of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct have yet to answer what should have been the threshold question: Is \nit really necessary?\n  My amendment would mandate a study to determine whether the States \nare adequately addressing bias-motivated violence. To date, we have \nseen no evidence that they are not. In fact, we have asked the Attorney \nGeneral, for years now, to come up with any evidence they can. In the \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee recently, he specifically stated \nthe States are doing a good job at addressing hate crimes.\n  It would also authorize the Justice Department to provide limited aid \nand assistance in State prosecutions of bias-motivated crimes.\n  In almost every case raised by the proponents of a horrific act of \nviolence motivated by prejudice, the perpetrators have been dealt with \nadequately at the State level.\n  In the Matthew Shepard case, the two perpetrators are spending life \nin prison. In other cases, some have had the death penalty, and others \nhave spent life in prison.\n  Before we start overriding State efforts, I believe we should at \nleast make an effort to determine whether there is a legitimate Federal \nrole in the prosecution of hate crimes. That is what my amendment would \ndo, and I hope our colleagues will consider voting for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. The matter is very \nsimple. The Hatch amendment kills the hate crimes legislation. If you \nwant to kill the hate crimes legislation, vote for the Hatch amendment. \nIf you do not want to kill the hate crimes legislation, if you want a \nchance to vote on something the Senate has voted for time and time \nagain, then vote against the Hatch amendment.\n  The Attorney General testified at the request of the Republicans. He \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and endorsed the \nlegislation before us. The Hatch amendment--perhaps well-meaning; I \nassume it is--would, in effect, eviscerate the hate crimes legislation. \nIt would kill the hate crimes legislation.\n  The question is very simple: Vote for Hatch; you kill the hate crimes \nlegislation. Vote against it, we have a chance to vote for the hate \ncrimes legislation--something the Senate has voted for several times \nbefore and something the Attorney General supports based on a hearing \nwe had at the request of the Republicans within the past month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my amendment does not kill the hate crimes \nopportunity. It says, let's do a study. Let's know what we are talking \nabout. Let's see if there is a real need for this bill. With all of the \nconstitutional ramifications this bill has, it says: Let's be cautious. \nLet's just not go pell-mell into the maelstrom without knowing what we \nare talking about.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining for the \nopponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Hatch amendment is explicit. It is \nclear. On lines 6 and 7 on page 1, and lines 1 and 2 on page 2, it \nsays: ``division E of this Act (relating to hate crimes), and the \namendments made by that division, shall have no force or effect.'' It \nis explicit. It says: No hate crimes legislation; instead, a study.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all it says is, we would go a different \nroute. We would do the study first, so we do not go off half cocked and \ndo something that may be unconstitutional and unsound.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time has expired on the Hatch amendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The language we put in the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act passed this body 97 to 3. This language is much more \ntargeted, so it doesn't leave it all to the interpretation of the \ncourt. It expresses what this body has previously expressed. I think it \nis important that we put this forward. It says that if you are speaking \nand intending to incite physical violence or imminent threat, that is \nnot protected speech. But otherwise you have protected speech.

RECIPROCITY FOR THE CARRYING OF CERTAIN CONCEALED \n                   FIREARMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The second amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States protects the right of an individual to keep and bear \n     arms, including for purposes of individual self-defense.\n       (2) The right to bear arms includes the right to carry arms \n     for self-defense and the defense of others.\n       (3) Congress has previously enacted legislation for \n     national authorization of the carrying of concealed firearms \n     by qualified active and retired law enforcement officers.\n       (4) Forty-eight States provide by statute for the issuance \n     of permits to carry concealed firearms to individuals, or \n     allow the carrying of concealed firearms for lawful purposes \n     without need for a permit.\n       (5) The overwhelming majority of individuals who exercise \n     the right to carry firearms in their own States and other \n     States have proven to be law-abiding, and such carrying has \n     been demonstrated to provide crime prevention or crime \n     resistance benefits for the licensees and for others.\n       (6) Congress finds that the prevention of lawful carrying \n     by individuals who are traveling outside their home State \n     interferes with the constitutional right of interstate \n     travel, and harms interstate commerce.\n       (7) Among the purposes of this Act is the protection of the \n     rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to a citizen of \n     the United States by the fourteenth amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (8) Congress therefore should provide for the interstate \n     carrying of firearms by such individuals in all States that \n     do not prohibit the carrying of concealed firearms by their \n     own residents.\n       (b) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 926C the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 926D.

Mr. President, the amendment that I bring to the Senate \nthis evening is very simple. It ties into the debate that was just held \nabout hate crimes legislation. One of the ways you can obviously \nprevent crimes from happening is to make sure that people are able to \ndefend themselves against violent crimes. My amendment would do just \nthat.\n  My amendment is simple. It allows individuals the right to carry a \nlawfully concealed firearm across State lines, while at the same time \nrespecting the laws of the host State.\n  This amendment is similar to my bipartisan stand-alone bill S. 845, \nwhich currently has 22 cosponsors.\n  The second amendment provides, and the Supreme Court held in Heller \nlast summer, that law-abiding Americans have a fundamental right to \npossess firearms in order to defend themselves and their families.\n  Studies have shown that there is more defensive gun use by victims \nthan there are crimes committed with firearms.\n  As such, I believe that a State's border should not be a limit on \nthis fundamental right and that law-abiding individuals should be \nguaranteed their second amendment rights without complication as they \ntravel throughout the 48 States that currently permit some form of \nconceal and carry.\n  While some States with concealed carry laws grant reciprocity to \npermit-holders from other select States, my amendment would eliminate \nthe confusing patchwork of laws that currently exists.\n  This amendment would allow an individual to carry a concealed firearm \nacross State lines if they either have a valid permit or if, under \ntheir State of residence, they are legally entitled to do so.\n  After entering another State, an individual must respect the laws of \nthe host State as they apply to conceal and carry permit holders, \nincluding the specific types of locations in which firearms may not be \ncarried.\n  Reliable, empirical research shows that States with concealed carry \nlaws enjoy significantly lower violent crimes rates than those States \nthat do not.\n  For example, for every year a State has a concealed carry law, the \nmurder rate declines by 3 percent, rape by 2 percent, and robberies by \nover 2 percent.\n  Additionally, research shows that ``minorities and women tend to be \nthe ones with the most to gain from being allowed to protect \nthemselves.''\n  The benefits of conceal and carry extend to more than just the \nindividuals that actually carry the firearms.\n  Since criminals are unable to tell who is and who is not carrying a \nfirearm just by looking at a potential victim, they are less likely to \ncommit crimes when they fear that they may come in direct contact with \nan individual who is armed.\n  This deterrent is so strong that a Department of Justice study found \nthat 40 percent of felons had not committed crimes because they feared \nthe prospective victim was armed.\n  Additionally, research shows that when unrestrictive conceal and \ncarry laws are passed, it not only benefits those who are armed, but \nalso others like children.\n  My amendment, in comparison to others being debated in the Senate, \nwould actually empower individuals to protect themselves before they \nbecome victims of a crime, instead of just punishing the perpetrators \nafterwards.\n  A great example of this occurred earlier this month. Stephen \nFleischman is a 62-year-old jewelry salesman from Mobile, AL, who often \ntravels for business.\n  On his recent business trip to Memphis a group of four men, two of \nwhom were armed, confronted him in a parking lot and tried to take his \nmerchandise.\n  Instead of becoming a victim, Mr. Fleischman, who was legally \nconcealing his firearm, was able to pull his weapon and protect himself \nand his merchandise from the four attackers.\n  Who knows what would have happened to Mr. Fleischman or his jewelry \nif he was traveling in South Carolina or any of the other 27 States \nwith which Alabama does not have reciprocity agreements.\n  My amendment would alleviate this problem, and I hope when we return \nnext week and we have an opportunity to debate this amendment and to \nvote upon it, my colleagues will support it because I believe it is an \nimportant tool for safety, for self-defense, and it is consistent with \nour tradition in this country of respect of second amendment rights, \nallowing American citizens the opportunity and the right to defend and \nprotect themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7636-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, I would like to publicly thank the men \nand women of the U.S. Capitol Police for their bravery and heroic work \nduring a particularly challenging week. Last evening after attempting a \nroutine traffic stop, an armed man opened fire at our officers. Despite \nthe extreme danger, these officers reacted quickly and skillfully to \nensure that the situation did not escalate and present danger to those \nin and around the U.S. Capitol. The officers who responded willingly \nput their lives on the line and we owe them our deepest thanks. My \nthoughts and prayers are with them and their families today.\n  We see the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police every day as we \ngo about our business for the people of our home States. Tasked with \nprotecting the iconic symbol of our democracy, the officers of the U.S. \nCapitol Police have shown a steadfast commitment to protecting us, our \nstaff, our constituents, and visitors. The mission statement of the \nU.S. Capitol Police states their dedication to protecting ``the \nCongress, its legislative processes, Members, employees, visitors, and \nfacilities from crime so it can fulfill its\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\nconstitutional responsibilities in a safe and open environment.''\n  I have no doubt in my mind that the Capitol Police has done just that \nin a manner that is nothing short of heroic.\n  The U.S. Capitol Police has faced every danger undeterred, ensuring \nthat Congress and its mission can continue uninterrupted. Their \ncourage, efficiency, and commitment allowed Congress to continue with \nits constitutional responsibilities. We could not do this without them. \nFor this, and for our safety, all of us owe them a great debt of \ngratitude.\n  As we proceed today with the routine business of the Senate--floor \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2010 Defense authorization bill, \nJudiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \nfor the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings and other myriad \nlegislative tasks--all of us are able to breathe easily knowing that we \nare protected by such a dedicated and talented force.\n  Thank you again for all of your hard work and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7637-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONDEMNING ALL FORMS OF ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am gratified that the Senate is poised \nto approve S. Con. Res. 11, which condemns all forms of anti-Semitism \nand reaffirms the support of Congress for the U.S. Special Envoy to \nmonitor and combat anti-Semitism around the world.\n  I cosponsored this resolution with Senator Collins to affirm my \ncommitment to ending global anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hatred. In the \n21st century, there is no place for people or groups who would harm or \ndeny rights to others based on their religion, race, gender, or ethnic \nidentity. Yet anti-Semitism--spawned from centuries of hatred, \npersecution, and repeated attempts to destroy the Jewish people from \ntheir early days of slavery through the Inquisition, Holocaust, and \nbeyond--still pervades many cultures and societies.\n  In some places around the world, this deeply rooted hatred can \nquickly turn political rallies into hate crimes, with chants of ``death \nto Israel'' and expressions of support for suicide or terrorist attacks \nagainst Israeli or Jewish civilians all too frequent. These calls have \noften been followed by violence and vandalism against synagogues and \nJewish institutions. Hate crimes send a powerful message because they \naffect more than the individual victims; they are meant to intimidate \nand instill fear in entire groups of people. Hate crimes create a sense \nof vulnerability and insecurity in others who may share characteristics \nwith the victims. And this sense of fear is precisely the intent of \nthose who commit such crimes.\n  Even here in the United States, anti-Semitism frequently rears its \nugly head, most recently in the horrific shooting attack at the U.S. \nHolocaust Memorial Museum.\n  I am privileged to be chair of the Helsinki Commission and a member \nof the both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. In those capacities and as a Senator generally, I \nam afforded numerous opportunities to speak out against the scourge of \nanti-Semitism, racial bigotry, and ethnic hatred worldwide. Part of the \nbattle is to publicize intolerant and hateful activities. This \nresolution is meant to shed light upon anti-Semitism, and I am grateful \nthat so many of my colleagues have joined me in these efforts and on \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7637-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I commend the extraordinary career of \nNorm Coleman. Norm began his public service as a prosecutor for the \nMinnesota State Attorney General's Office, working his way up to chief \nprosecutor before eventually serving as solicitor general of Minnesota. \nIn 1993, he became mayor of St. Paul. During his tenure as mayor, Norm \nworked faithfully to revitalize the city, even securing a National \nHockey League franchise for St. Paul. In 2002, at the urging of \nPresident Bush, Norm ran for U.S. Senate. He was the challenger in a \nclose, hard-fought race, and his ultimate victory was an exciting one.\n  I am proud to have served alongside Norm in the Senate. He was an \nexcellent comrade in the fight against partial birth abortion and \nworked hard to prevent waste and fraud at the United Nations. Known for \nhis willingness to work with both parties, Norm fought for tax cuts, \nrenewable energy, and prescription drug benefits for seniors. He worked \nfor the passage of legislation improving rural health care, increasing \nfunding for Pell Grants and securing our ports.\n  He leaves an impressive record as testament to his service in the \nSenate, but his presence here will be missed. Though the outcome of \nlast fall's election ended differently than I had hoped, I know great \nthings are in store for Norm. He has much more to offer our great \ncountry. I wish Norm, his wife Laurie, and their two children, Jacob \nand Sarah, all the best as they embrace the new and exciting \nopportunities before them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7637-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7637-S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING REV. LEONARD ROBINSON\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the word ``hero'' is used often and \nlightly these days. Yet there are those special people that walk among \nus in our hometowns across America who genuinely rate that title. The \nterrible days of the Second World War produced an entire generation of \nsuch people. Today they are our friends and neighbors. They endured \ngreat trials and gave so much of themselves for so many of us in the \nmost difficult of circumstances. They served in our nation's darkest \nhour. And then they came home. They went back to work, to school, \nbought homes, and raised families. Many did not care to speak about \nwhat they had seen or suffered through. I come to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate today to honor one such individual.\n  Mr. President, on April 9, 1942, American and Filipino forces \ndefending the peninsula of Bataan from the invasion of Imperial Japan \nended a gallant holding action to prevent the Japanese conquest of the \nPhilippines. The soldiers lacked supplies and air support, and were \ncrippled by starvation and disease when they were finally overwhelmed \non that fateful day. What would follow the surrender would go down as \none of the most brutal and ghastly chapters written in human history.\n  More than 75,000 men, including nearly 12,000 Americans, were turned \nout onto a broken, dusty road and forced to march nearly 70 miles to \nthe dreadful prison camp, Camp O'Donnell, that would be their home \nuntil the war's end. The journey was barbarous. Over the next 5 days, \nthousands died from starvation, dehydration, disease, heat prostration, \nand sheer exhaustion. Survivors of the Death March of Bataan tell of \nthe horrific atrocities of their captors. Prisoners were beaten at \nrandom and denied food and water. Those who fell behind or stopped to \nhelp fallen comrades were executed. One survivor tells the story of \nJapanese soldiers driving alongside the column of weary men with \noutstretched bayonets, slicing throats and decapitating those poor \nsouls who happened to get in the way. The sides of the trail were \nlittered with the bodies of the dead. There are no words that can \ndescribe such horrendous barbarity and inhumanity. It is estimated that \n54,000 of the 75,000 who started the march made it to Camp O'Donnell--a \ndeath rate of about 1 in 4. Many more would meet their deaths at the \nCamp. But there were also those who made it.\n  A hero is someone who displays courage, bravery, and perseverance in \nthe face of great adversity. Those who survived the Bataan Death March \nexhibited a heroism that we rarely see today. One of those heroes is \nfrom my hometown of Casper, WY, the Reverend Leonard L. Robinson. \nLeonard is my friend and neighbor. In fact, I had the privilege as a \nsurgeon to replace both of his knees.\n  Leonard L. Robinson was born in Englewood, CO, and spent his youth \ngrowing up in the Englewood and Denver area. While attending college at \nthe University of Colorado, Leonard was drafted to the U.S. Army in \n1941. He was assigned to Battery E of the 200th Coast Artillery \nRegiment, Anti-Aircraft, at Fort Bliss, TX. In September 1941, he was \nshipped out to Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines. Leonard was in the \nfirst group of U.S. soldiers captured at Cabcaben and started the march \nout of Bataan towards Camp O'Donnell. He was then held as a Japanese \nprisoner of war for 3\\1/2\\ years; 2 of\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nthose years were spent as a forgotten slave on the docks of Niigata. At \nthe war's end, he returned to Fort Logan, CO, where he was discharged \nfrom the U.S. Army.\n  Upon his discharge in 1946, Leonard returned to school on the G.I. \nbill and earned his bachelor of science in architectural engineering \nfrom the University of Colorado. He then attended Northwestern Seminary \nin Minneapolis, where he earned his bachelor of theology. He later \nearned his master's and doctorate in theology from Pioneer Seminary in \nRockford, IL. Throughout his years as an ordained pastor, he served in \nWyoming, Washington, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Colorado before \nreturning back to Wyoming. He has served as Chaplain for military, law \nenforcement and veterans groups. Leonard and his wife Erma enjoyed 53 \nyears together and they were blessed with three children, Paula \nChelewski, Len Robinson, and Pamela Robinson, as well as two \ngrandchildren. His beloved Erma passed away in 2005. Mr. President, the \nlife example of Rev. Leonard Robinson has taught so many to appreciate \nand be thankful for the blessings of life.\n  This week, all the eyes of Wyoming will be on Cheyenne as we kick off \nthe annual Daddy of 'Em All, Cheyenne Frontier Days. And I am proud to \nannounce that Wyoming will honor Leonard as he leads the Cheyenne \nFrontier Days Parade on Tuesday, July 21, as its grand marshal. It is \nbut a small tribute to this brave man who sacrificed and suffered so \nmuch for our country, for you and for me.\n  My father was a veteran of World War II. He fought in the Battle of \nthe Bulge. My wife Bobbi's father was in both World War II and Korea. \nMy dad always told me that I should thank God every day that I was born \nin America and how fortunate I was. He was right. This is the greatest \ncountry on Earth. And it is because of the sacrifices made by men like \nRev. Leonard Robinson. I was so honored to greet him and his fellow \nveterans on the National Mall this spring when they made the Wyoming \nHonor Flight trip to Washington to visit the World War II Memorial. He \nis a hero in every sense of the word. Leonard, thank you my friend. All \nof Wyoming, and indeed America, is proud of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7638-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COMMENDING CECIL HARRIS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Cecil Harris. The \nfollowing statement was read at the dedication of a highway named in \nhis honor on May 25, 2009. I ask that the statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The statement follows.\n\n Cecil Harris Highway Dedication Ceremony, Cresbard, South Dakota, May \n                                25, 2009\n\n       Thank you for the invitation to attend the recognition \n     celebration for Captain Cecil E. Harris to honor his \n     achievement as a World War II fighter pilot. While I regret I \n     am unable to be with you to recognize Captain Harris at this \n     important event, I want to extend my greetings and best \n     wishes to all of you in attendance. I applaud those \n     individuals, many of whom are here today, whose hard work and \n     dedication have made this event possible.\n       It is especially fitting that you are celebrating this \n     event on Memorial Day. We should pause to remember what \n     Memorial Day is all about: honoring those who have defended \n     our freedom and especially those who have paid the ultimate \n     price. Captain Harris is certainly worthy of this \n     celebration. As an educator by profession, his willingness to \n     serve others was apparent at a young age. He answered the \n     call to service while enrolled at Northern State Teachers \n     College in March 1941. Twenty-seven years later, Captain \n     Harris retired as one of the most decorated heroes of the \n     United States Navy. During his World War II service, he was \n     the second highest scoring Navy ace in the Pacific Theater \n     with 24 victories.\n       Captain Harris serves as a shining example of South \n     Dakota's proud legacy of military service that extends from \n     our state's earliest days to our current conflicts around the \n     globe. South Dakotans of every background have always \n     answered the call to defend America from those who seek to \n     destroy the freedom that we cherish. I doubt there are many \n     South Dakotans who do not have a family member or friend who \n     has worn our nation's uniform. Upon reflection, we quickly \n     realize that without the liberty that these men and women \n     have defended through the years, our nation would not be what \n     it is today, nor would citizens enjoy the freedoms that we \n     sometimes take for granted.\n       My father, Harold Thune, served in the same squadron as \n     Cecil Harris in World War II, and was Cecil's assistant \n     flight officer. I recently had the opportunity to interview \n     my father about his World War II experience for the Veterans \n     History Project, an oral history archive held at the Library \n     of Congress, and my father spoke very highly of Cecil. In \n     fact, the advice Cecil gave my father helped him avoid being \n     shot down. Cecil Harris was responsible for training my \n     father's squadron, and my father describes Cecil as \n     unqualifiedly the best pilot he had ever seen, and that he \n     had never seen a pilot fly a plane like he did.\n       The tragic reality is that our nation loses hundreds of \n     veterans every day. Memorial Day gives us an opportunity to \n     reflect on the sacrifices of our veterans from every \n     conflict, and it is fitting that we do so. Our veterans \n     deserve to be remembered and celebrated, and these programs \n     help do just that.\n       Again, I wish you all the very best as you gather to \n     celebrate in Cresbard.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nnational emergency and related measures dealing with the former \nLiberian regime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect beyond July \n22, 2009.\n  The actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor \nand other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian \nresources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian \nfunds and property, continue to undermine Liberia's transition to \ndemocracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, \nand economic institutions and resources. These actions and policies \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign \npolicy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to the \nformer Liberian regime of Charles Taylor.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 16, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7638-6", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7638-S7639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:51 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\n\n       H.R. 762.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1458. A bill to encourage the development and implementation of a \ncomprehensive, global strategy for the preservation and reunification \nof families and the provision of permanent parental care for orphans; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill called the \nFamilies for Orphans Act that Senator Inhofe and I are sponsoring.\n  We are very fortunate, indeed, to have a Secretary of State who is \nquite knowledgeable about this subject. The office we seek to create \nwould be housed within the Department of State under the watchful eye \nof Secretary Hillary Clinton, who did so much work on this subject when \nshe was a Member of the Senate and even prior to her service in the \nSenate as First Lady of both Arkansas and the United States. So I am \nparticularly happy we would be recommending what is, I think, a very \nappropriate establishment of an office within the Office of the \nSecretary of State.\n  This bill has been discussed for several years here. We have had \nseveral opportunities for debate on the floor. But a great coalition \nhas come together, representing advocates for orphans around the world, \nto come together in a unified way to make a strong argument that this \nkind of office should indeed be established. There are some very \ncompelling reasons why this should be.\n  First of all, right now in our system, there is no coordination in \nthe Office of the Secretary of State or in the Department of State for \npolicies related to orphans. This is an alarming situation because the \nnumber of orphans is growing exponentially in the world due to an \nincrease in conflicts in many parts of the world; severe droughts and \nnatural disasters that are causing families to be separated, children \nfrom adults; and the AIDS epidemic. Some people have referred to it as \na factory that produces orphans. And you can understand the nature of \nthat disease.\n  So the actions we take relative to trying to get a more coordinated \npolicy are very important, and that is what this bill seeks to do.\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\n  It is, I think, understood among all Members of this body--I do not \neven hear one dissenting voice--that the most appropriate place for \nchildren to grow up is in a family.\n  We think there are over 130 million orphans in the world who have \nbeen deprived for whatever reason--death or war or famine or disease--\nof their right to belong to a family. It is our obligation as the \nleaders of the world to try to find the best possible substitute family \nfor these children.\n  Children don't do a very good job of raising themselves. That is a \nvirtual impossibility. Our efforts, unfortunately, dealing with \nchildren have been focused on their survival, on just getting medical \ncare and health care and food and nutrition. I don't think we are doing \nenough as a government to focus on reuniting children with whatever \nextended family might be possible for them to be raised by, and then \nlooking out somewhere beyond the extended family opportunity to \ndomestic families who would take in that child and their siblings. We \nmost certainly have not made the kind of effort I think is appropriate \nand is a ready source of loving arms in families in terms of the \ninternational community that would like to step up and adopt many \nchildren who are unable to find families in their own countries. That \nis basically what this office would do.\n  It would coordinate efforts by the aid and development community \nthat, as I said, are currently focused on nutrition, housing, \neducation, and medical care, and would refocus efforts on that, plus \nreunification of families and then adoption opportunities.\n  First, as I said, the U.S. programs are disconnected. Secondly, the \nUnited States, right now, in our opinion, does not engage in enough \nproactive diplomacy on this issue. Third, the United States should be \nable to advise and support other countries in the development of their \nown child welfare systems. We know we have made so many mistakes in the \nUnited States. We hate to see countries making similar mistakes. Some \nof those mistakes would be terminating parental rights, not being \naggressive enough in seeking placement within extended families, \nseparating siblings in placement, and then, the worst of all--if those \nthings aren't bad enough--the worst of all, leaving children who have \nhad their parental rights terminated basically stuck in limbo for 10 or \n12 or 14, and in some extreme cases, 18 years in foster care where they \nnever have a permanent parent or a permanent family to call their own.\n  I would remind my colleagues, because I continue to remind myself, \nthat a child is never too old to need a parent. We all think of \nadoption as adopting infants or toddlers or school-aged children, but I \nwould suggest to this body and to those listening that you are never \ntoo old to need a father or a mother. At the age of 54, I continue to \ntalk to my parents regularly. They continue to give me advice and \ncounsel. I have been blessed to have grandparents well into my adult \nlife. The thought of a child growing up at any age--18, 20, 5, 12--\nwithout any permanent attachment to a family is tragic. The fact is \nthere are methods and resources we can bring to bear to change that \noutcome for the millions of orphans who are in the world in our own \ncountry and around the world. That is what this office does.\n  The primary functions will be to act as a primary adviser to the \nSecretary of State and to the President to provide diplomatic \nrepresentation, to develop an evidence-based, comprehensive global \nstrategy, to support foreign governments through sound policy and \ntechnical assistance, to develop best practices with cultural \nsensitivity, and to support in-country family preservation, \nreunification, and permanency as primary solutions, using domestic \nadoption and international adoption as basically the last \npossibilities.\n  One of the most important things in the bill is to conduct a census \nbecause we don't know how many orphans there are in the world and in \nwhat countries. Until we get a handle on the numbers, it is very hard \nto find appropriate solutions and to mobilize the world community to \nact.\n  I contend there are millions and millions and millions of families \nwho are able and willing and ready to take in orphans, to build their \nfamily through adoption, to add to the blessing of biological children, \nchildren who have come to their families through adoption. I have had \npersonal experience myself with that issue. I am excited about the \npossibility of coordinating this effort and can think of no better \nperson than Secretary Hillary Clinton to provide the leadership to \nestablish this office as the Congress seeks to fund it and provide the \nresources to make it work.\n  So that is a description of the Families for Orphans Act. It is a \nbipartisan bill. We are getting extremely exciting feedback from our \ncolleagues in the House. Representative Diane Watson from California \nand Representative John Boozman from Arkansas have introduced an \nidentical bill, so we are very encouraged by the work the House has \ndone on this subject and look forward to a quick hearing and quick \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURRIS:\n  S. 1463. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nNational Organ and Tissue Registry Resource Center, to authorize grants \nfor State organ and tissue donor registries, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the subject of \norgan donation. Every day in this country, 17 people die while waiting \nfor a donated organ. Typically, people wait 3 to 5 years before an \norgan becomes available, and the organ waiting list grows at a rate \nfive times faster than donations.\n  What we need are improvements to the organ donor registry system, to \nincrease efficiency and share best practices between states. The \nEverson Walls and Ron Springs Gift for Life Act of 2009 is named in \nhonor of two close friends and former NFL teammates, one of whom may \nnot be here today were it not for the incredible generosity of ``living \norgan donation.'' Ron's struggle with diabetes led to the failure of \nboth kidneys. Everson's decision to give Ron one of his kidneys, led \nthem both to create the Gift for Life Foundation. The group spreads \nawareness of organ donation issues, particularly among minority \ncommunities, who suffer disproportionately from the organ shortage.\n  This act will establish a National Organ and Tissue Donor Registry \nResource Center to provide technical assistance to state donor \nregistries. The center will also serve as a State registry information \nclearinghouse for the evaluation and development of best practices for \ndonor registries nationwide. Further, the act will codify minimum \noperating standards for donor registries, and establish a grant program \nto develop, expand, and evaluate State donor registries. Finally, the \nact will create a study on the feasibility of establishing a living \ndonor database in order to track the short and long-term health effects \nfor such individuals.\n  I urge the Senate to take action on this important issue. We must \nimprove the functioning of our organ donation system. Thousands of \nlives hang in the balance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ISAKSON.

A bill to amend the Child Care land Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to require child care providers to provide to parents \ninformation regarding whether such providers carry liability insurance; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it was September 9, 2001, in Augusta, GA, \nwhen Jackie Boatwright, on her way home from church, got a horrific \ncall on her cell phone. The little boy, Anthony DeJuan Boatwright, then \n14 months of age that she had dropped off at day care in the morning \nhad been rushed to the hospital.\n  Upon her arrival at the hospital, a doctor gave her the grim news. He \nsaid, ``It appears your son has suffered a near drowning accident from \nfalling into a bucket of mop water containing bleach. He has been \nwithout a pulse for more than an hour but we have managed to get a \nheartbeat. It is not a strong one right now but we have one.''\n  Today, nearly 8 years later, Juan now resides with his wonderful \nmother Jackie. He is semi-comatose and dependent on a ventilator.\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\n  The child care center where Juan was injured was licensed, but not \ninsured. At the time, there was no way for Jackie or other parents to \nknow the insurance status of child care providers.\n  Today, Senators Dodd, Chambliss, Burris and I introduce straight-\nforward, bipartisan legislation that will require day care centers to \ndisclose whether or not they carry appropriate insurance for the \nfacility.\n  The House of Representatives has passed this legislation multiple \ntimes, but now we in this body take our turn to simultaneously both \nhonor young Juan and provide parents with much-needed information about \nchild care facilities.\n  It is time this body passed this legislation and sent it on to \nPresident Obama for his signature.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1468. A bill to increase access to adult education to provide for \neconomic growth; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I am introducing, with great pride, \nthe Adult Education and Economic Growth Act of 2009. I wish to point \nout that I and my staff have been working on this legislation for more \nthan a year. It is designed to address a problem that we quite frankly \ndo not spend enough attention on, I think, as we discuss the challenges \nof education in America. This is not the problem that is often \ndiscussed with respect to technical degrees or how we can compete with \nforeign countries in the number of engineers we are putting out, with \nthose sorts of issues. It is the question of how we can assure basic \ncompetencies at the working level of a lot of American companies. I \nhave started calling this the Second Chance Act for Education. There \nare a lot of people in this country who, for a variety of reasons, when \nthey are in their teens or their late teens, cease their educational \npursuits even before they finish high school. Perhaps someone might \nhave a child, or get in trouble with the law, or get an independent \nstreak and decide to leave school. Then when you get to the age of say \n30 or beyond, you realize the disadvantage you have in attempting to \ncompete in the marketplace.\n  There are very few provisions in our law and in our policies that \naddress this situation. This bill is designed to address it. We seek to \nreform and increase investment in what we call adult education, which \nis that span of education that will bring people beyond a high school \ndegree and hopefully into postsecondary education. We are looking at \njob training and other workforce programs that we need as a country to \nbuild a 21st century workforce. I am pleased to be joined in this \ninitiative as a principal cosponsor with Senator Sherrod Brown. By \nalmost any measure, our Nation faces a critical need to strengthen \nexisting programs of adult education. Our current adult education \nsystem falls far short in preparing our people to compete in the global \nmarketplace. In fact, it is estimated that only 2\\1/2\\ million of the \n93 million people who could benefit from these types of services are \nactually receiving them today.\n  The American labor market has changed dramatically with the advent of \nnew technology and with the loss of jobs in our manufacturing sector. \nThe need for well-trained and highly skilled workers is obvious. It has \nincreased. At the same time our adult education system, which should be \neffectively preparing low-skilled workers to meet the demands in this \nshifting economy, has not kept pace.\n  Since 2002, the Federal Government has consistently decreased \nspending on adult education. In addition, the Nation's primary Federal \nresource for adult education, job training and employment services, the \nWorkforce Investment Act, has not been reauthorized for more than 10 \nyears. One can imagine how the American economy and the American \nworkforce has changed over the last 10 years.\n  There are other signs pointing to the need for a better approach to \nadult education. If we look at adult education enrollment rates, in \n1998, there were more than 4 million individuals enrolled in these \ntypes of programs. By 2007, that number had dropped to only 2 million, \nbasically a 40-percent drop from when the Workforce Investment Act was \noriginally enacted.\n  One of the largest barriers to economic growth in many communities is \nthe lack of a skilled workforce, particularly those with entry-level \nskills. It is critical that we increase the number of individuals who \nobtain a high school diploma and encourage them to go forward into \npostsecondary education. I am sure we can all agree that the best \neconomic tool for any community is a well-educated, skilled workforce. \nA growing number of American skilled workers right now are facing \nretirement age, and the growth in skilled labor has actually stagnated. \nIf we continue along the current path, we will see only a 19-percent \nincrease in the number of postsecondary education equipped native-born \nworkers, which is about one-seventh the rate of growth during the past \ntwo decades. By comparison, countries such as China and India are \ndoubling and tripling the number of college graduates in their \ncountries.\n  According to the Workforce Alliance, 80 percent of the jobs in \ntoday's economy require some sort of education past a high school \ndegree, yet there are 8 million adults in the workforce today who have \nlow literacy, limited English proficiency, or lack educational \ncredentials beyond high school. With so many workers who are unemployed \nor underemployed, it is clear that we should be investing in the \ntraining or retraining of American workers to fill this growing gap. \nOur legislation begins that vital task by addressing these problems.\n  Today we are proposing a two-pronged approach to strengthen the \nNation's workforce. First, we want to build on ramps for American \nworkers who got off track, perhaps, in their teens and need new skills \nand a better education in order to improve their lives. Just as \nimportantly, we want to encourage employers to help them by offering \ntax credits to businesses that invest in these employees. Our \ngovernment has long provided employers with limited tax credits when \nthey help their employees go to college or to graduate school. It is \nbasic logic, and I believe to the national good, that we should provide \nsimilar incentives for this type of adult education.\n  This bill authorizes a rather modest $500 million increase in funding \nto invigorate State and local adult education programs nationwide in \norder to increase the number of adults with a high school diploma. As a \nresult, the bill will inevitably increase the number of high school \ngraduates who go on to college and update and expand the job skills of \nthe American workforce writ large. All of this is relevant to my \nlongstanding personal goal of promoting basic economic fairness in our \nsociety.\n  Other provisions in the bill will improve workers' readiness to meet \nthe demands of a global workforce by providing pathways to obtain basic \nskills, job training, and adult education. It will provide workers with \ngreater access to on-the-job training in adult education by encouraging \npublic-private partnerships between government, business, and labor. It \nwill increase the use of technology in workforce skills training. It \nwill improve access to correctional educational programs to channel \nformer offenders into productive endeavors and to reduce recidivism. It \nwill encourage investment in lower-skilled workers by providing \nemployers with a tax credit if they invest in their employees' \neducation. This tax credit is aimed at encouraging general and \ntransferable skills development that may be in the long-term interest \nof most of its employers but are not always so clearly rewarded by the \nmarketplace.\n  This act focuses on addressing the unique needs of adults with \nlimited basic skills, with no high school diploma, or with limited \nEnglish proficiency. Those individuals who may have taken a different \npath early in their lives and who now find themselves eager to go back \nto school and receive additional job training and skills should be \nprovided opportunities to get back on track.\n  My legislation also would bolster the President's just announced goal \nof ensuring that 5 million more Americans graduate from communities \ncollege by 2020 and updating curriculum to keep up with the skills \nneeded in today's workforce.\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important endeavor. I am \nvery proud of the work my staff has done on this for more than a year. \nOur Nation's workforce and local communities will be stronger for it. \nIt is my hope that this legislation could be passed in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Adult Education and Economic \n     Growth Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to remain competitive in today's global \n     economy, the United States must reverse the trend of \n     underinvestment in adult education and workforce development \n     and empower its workforce through adequate resources and \n     effective and innovative educational and workforce programs. \n     Since 1979, investments in adult education and workforce \n     development programs have declined in real terms by more than \n     70 percent.\n       (2) Current Federal adult basic education programs serve \n     less than 3,000,000 individuals a year. Some States have \n     experienced difficulties integrating adult education public \n     job training and career and technical education programs that \n     could help these individuals meet specific industry demand \n     while advancing along a career path.\n       (3) In 2007, more than 25,000,000 adults ages 18 through 64 \n     had no high school credential. Every year, 1 in 3 young \n     adults--more than 1,200,000 people--drop out of high school.\n       (4) Employers need highly-skilled workers to be able to \n     compete globally. Between 2004 and 2014, 24 of the 30 \n     fastest-growing occupations are projected to demand workers \n     with some form of postsecondary education or training. Yet \n     nearly half of the United States workforce has a high school \n     diploma or less.\n       (5) Technology and globalization, coupled with the \n     unfolding economic recession, are rendering low-wage and low-\n     skill workers particularly vulnerable. Unemployment is \n     highest among those without a college degree and has grown at \n     a faster rate among this group since the start of the \n     economic recession in December 2007.\n       (6) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \n     unemployment rate for individuals age 25 and older who have \n     less than a high school diploma has risen from 7.5 percent in \n     December 2007 to 14.8 percent in April 2009. The unemployment \n     rate for high school graduates with no college degree has \n     increased from 4.6 percent to 9.3 percent. The unemployment \n     rate for high school graduates with some college experience \n     or an associate degree has risen from 3.7 percent to 7.4 \n     percent.\n       (7) The United States ranks 11th among OECD countries in \n     percent of young adults with a high school diploma- the only \n     country in which younger adults are less educated than the \n     previous generation.\n       (8) In 2006, 18,400,000 adults spoke English ``less than \n     very well'', according to the United States Census Bureau \n     (2006 American Community Survey). Of these adults, 8,200,000 \n     held no high school credential and 5,000,000 had completed \n     high school but were not college or job ready.\n       (9) Although 88,000,000 adults ages 18 to 64 have a high \n     school diploma or less, or limited English proficiency, \n     funding for programs authorized under the Workforce \n     Investment Act of 1998 for adults, dislocated workers, and \n     youth declined by about 12 percent between 2000 and 2007.\n       (10) According to the National Commission on Adult \n     Literacy, 1 in every 100 adults in the United States 16 and \n     older is in prison or jail in the United States. About 43 \n     percent do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, \n     and 56 percent have very low literacy skills. Ninety-five \n     percent of incarcerated individuals return to our \n     communities.\n       (11) In order to meet the needs of the workforce, there \n     must be a strong connection between the adult education and \n     workforce development system, in order to better meet the \n     needs of limited English proficient job seekers and those \n     with basic skills deficiencies. For example, in program year \n     2006, less than 1 percent of individuals who exited the title \n     I adult program under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 \n     were co-enrolled in adult education.\n       (12) Workforce development programs, including adult \n     education, throughout the Federal Government and the States \n     are not aligned well, limiting their capacity to leverage \n     resources, to provide full and appropriate access to \n     services, and to provide reliable and comparable data related \n     to activities and outcomes across the programs.\n       (13) In the current economic climate, it is imperative that \n     the United States invest in the education, training, and \n     development of all workers in the United States who are \n     unemployed or underemployed, to help fill the labor demands \n     of the United States so that they do not look elsewhere to \n     find skilled workers.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To increase access substantially to adult education, \n     literacy, and workplace skills services for adults who have \n     limited basic skills, lack a high school diploma or its \n     equivalent, or are limited English proficient.\n       (2) To create seamless pathways from adult education and \n     occupational skills development to postsecondary education or \n     training and workforce development programs and services that \n     help adult learners persist throughout the pipeline from the \n     lowest levels of basic literacy or English language \n     proficiency to the achievement of a level of proficiency that \n     will enable the adult learner to successfully transition to \n     family-sustaining jobs in careers with the promise of \n     advancement.\n       (3) To develop an adult education, literacy, and work \n     skills system that coordinates and integrates adult \n     education, literacy, and workplace skills services with \n     workforce development and postsecondary education and \n     training opportunities across agencies and programs.\n       (4) To greatly improve outcomes for adults receiving adult \n     education, literacy, and workplace skills services in terms \n     of learning gains, acquisition of basic workforce skills, \n     accelerated learning, acquisition of a high school diploma or \n     its equivalent, or successful transition to postsecondary \n     education or training or to family-sustaining jobs in the \n     workplace.\n\n                 TITLE I--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT SYSTEMS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide for the administration of Port Chicago \nNaval Magazine National Memorial as a unit of the National Park System, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National \nMemorial Enhancement Act of 2009 would help increase visitor access to \nthe Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial on the former Concord \nNaval Weapons Station and ensure the long-term preservation of this \nimportant World War II site. The legislation is strongly supported by \nthe National Park Service, a coalition of more than 37 civil rights \norganizations in California, the National Parks Conservation \nAssociation, and the Friends of Port Chicago.\n  The Port Chicago Memorial marks the location of an explosion 65 years \nago this week that killed and wounded numerous African American sailors \nand eventually paved the way for racial desegregation of the Armed \nForces.\n  On the night of July 17, 1944, as sailors were loading ammunition at \nthe Port Chicago Naval Magazine, a terrible explosion occurred. More \nthan 5,000 tons of ammunition ignited, sending a blast more than 12,000 \nfeet into the sky. The explosion killed 320 sailors, wounded hundreds \nmore, and destroyed the surrounding town of Port Chicago. Less than a \nmonth after the explosion, survivors were ordered to resume work at a \nnew site. Most survivors refused, citing the need for improved \nsupervision, training, and working conditions to prevent another \ndisaster. In response, the Navy charged 50 men with conspiring to \nmutiny, and all were convicted. The majority of men killed in the \nexplosion and all those convicted of mutiny were African-American.\n  Following the conviction, future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, who at the time was a lawyer with the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People, took up the case. Roughly a year \nlater, the Navy began moving towards racial desegregation, and in 1948, \nPresident Truman issued an Executive Order desegregating all of the \nArmed Forces and guaranteeing ``equality of treatment and opportunity \nfor all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, \nreligion, or national origin.''\n  In 1992, Congress authorized the creation of a National Memorial at \nPort Chicago. However, under its current authorities, the National Park \nService still has limited ability to provide visitor access to the \nMemorial or to assist with the site's preservation. My bill authorizes \nthe Interior Department to work with the City of Concord and the East \nBay Regional Park District to operate a visitor's center for the \nMemorial, allowing veterans, students, and other visitors to learn more \nabout the events that transpired at Port Chicago. The bill also \ndesignates the Memorial as a unit of the National Park System, allowing \nthe Park Service to become more actively involved in its preservation.\n  The bill specifically states that as much public access as possible \nwill be provided ``without interfering with military needs,'' meaning \nthat the timing and extent of public visitation will be adapted to \naccommodate military activities when they occur near the Memorial.\n  Eventually, when the Secretary of Defense determines that the land is \nexcess to military needs, the bill authorizes the Secretaries of \nDefense and Interior to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding \nleading to the transfer of the Memorial to the National Park Service.\n  The Port Chicago National Memorial ensures that the stories of those \nwho served and died at Port Chicago will not be forgotten. By enabling \nvisitors to come to this site, future generations can continue to honor \nand learn from these brave sailors who selflessly served our Nation and \nwho fought to overcome the barriers of racial segregation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7651-S7652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 212--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ANY \n  SAVINGS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM SHOULD BE INVESTED BACK INTO THE \n    MEDICARE PROGRAM, RATHER THAN CREATING NEW ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 212\n\n       Whereas the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \n     established under section 1817 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395i) is projected to be insolvent by 2017; and\n       Whereas the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is the largest source \n     of general revenue spending on health care for both the \n     Federal government and the States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any savings under the Medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) \n     should be invested back into the Medicare program, rather \n     than creating new entitlement programs; and\n       (2) any savings under the Medicaid program under title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) should be \n     used to increase the Federal medical assistance percentage \n     (as defined in section 1905(b) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396d(b)).\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, the Medicare and Medicaid Programs are \nthe largest single purchaser of health care in the world. These \nprograms account for over 20 percent of all U.S. Federal Government \nspending. More than 1 in 5 taxpayer dollars we actually spend will go \nto the Medicare or Medicaid Program. By the time my children become \nsenior citizens, these two programs are projected to consume every \ndollar of tax revenue raised per year. Recently, the Medicare trustees \nreported that the Medicare Program is literally projected to be \nbankrupt by 2017, just 8 short years away. That is 2 years earlier than \nprojected last year.\n  Our ability to offer financial predictions provides little \nconsolation to senior citizens who depend on the Medicare Program to \nreceive their medical care. For the millions of baby boomers, my \ngeneration, expecting the Medicare Program to be there for them and \ntheir future health care needs, these projections basically say that on \nthe current course, we are out of luck.\n  Unfortunately, the Medicaid Program outlook is not much better, a \nprogram I am very familiar with as a prior Governor. Medicaid is the \nlargest source of general revenue spending on health care for both the \nFederal Government and State governments. In fact, Medicaid represents \n40 percent of Federal Government general revenue spending on health \ncare and 41 percent of such spending by the States. That is why, as \neconomic conditions have continued to worsen, State Medicaid budgets \nare increasingly in crisis. States are struggling to pay Medicaid \nobligations and still balance their budgets. It is a tough job--I know \nfrom personal experience--one that is not for the faint of heart.\n  The President is proposing, in my judgment, to exacerbate the problem \nby creating another government-run entitlement program. Of course, in \norder to pay for this new program, he has identified cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid. Let's be clear: We have one soon-to-be-bankrupt program \nthat consumes a huge chunk of health care spending today, and the \nrushed reform would take money from it to pay for a new health care \nprogram. Seriously, this is a vicious cycle and something we would only \nsee in Washington. The American people deserve a better effort.\n  I suggest that in the real world, when budgets get tight, leaders \nhave to make very tough decisions. Programs are scrutinized with a \nfine-toothed comb to find out where savings can be found. If savings \nare identified, that money is used to shore up the programming \nshortfalls and to try to keep the current program viable. Medicare \nrecipients are hoping we do that because the clock is ticking on their \nprogram. We don't see new programs created as existing programs fall \ndeeper and deeper into the red. People and programs, they have to work \ntogether, rolling up their sleeves, prioritizing, scrutinizing every \ndollar in every program in order to fulfill current obligations, in \norder to meet the promise to those who are receiving the benefits \ntoday.\n  I have laid down a resolution. That is why this resolution I am \nsubmitting today is necessary, to restore some semblance of sanity to \nthe process. Simply put, this resolution says that if we find savings \nwithin the Medicare\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nProgram, we should put those savings back into the Medicare Program to \nkeep the promise to our senior citizens that we will protect their \nprogram instead of creating yet another government entitlement program \nwith the savings we have pulled from their program. It also says that \nif we find savings with the Medicaid Program, we should increase the \nFederal medical assistance percentage to help out States, to reduce the \nburden on State budgets; again, to fulfill the promise to those \nMedicaid recipients that we are serious about keeping their program \ngoing.\n  These are very practical, commonsense views the vast majority of \nAmericans would agree with.

Res. 213\n\n       Whereas, before 1598, the Pueblos of the Rio Grande region \n     of New Mexico inhabited the area now officially known as \n     Santa Fe;\n       Whereas, from the first arrival of Spanish colonists in \n     August of 1598, the Pueblos of the Rio Grande and adjoining \n     regions of New Mexico provided support and sustenance to \n     those colonists, which allowed the colonists to persevere at \n     San Gabriel del Yunque, the first villa and capital of New \n     Mexico located in the Pueblo lands of Ohkay Owingeh;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1609, the viceroy of New Spain, Luis \n     de Velasco II, upon receiving a royal proclamation from the \n     King of Spain and the captain general of New Mexico, ordered \n     Governor Pedro de Peralta to arrive in New Mexico before the \n     end of 1609 and establish a villa at the site of what is now \n     known as Santa Fe;\n       Whereas some 70 years following the establishment of the \n     villa of Santa Fe, the Pueblos took up arms and forced the \n     inhabitants of the villa to retreat to El Paso de Guadalupe \n     in what was then Mexico;\n       Whereas, in 1692, the Spanish colonists began to return to \n     the villa, which, although initially peaceful, resulted in \n     several armed conflicts lasting through 1696;\n       Whereas, following the repopulation of Santa Fe and \n     reinstitution of the Spanish government in New Mexico, the \n     Pueblos and Spanish colonists found ways to engage in mutual \n     cultural interchange;\n       Whereas, over the following years, and despite intermittent \n     disputes, the colonists and the descendants of the colonists \n     formed alliances with the Pueblos and each accommodated the \n     culture of the other, allowing Santa Fe to flourish;\n       Whereas the peaceful acceptance of each other's cultures \n     continued through the conquest of New Mexico by the United \n     States during the war with Mexico, contributed to the \n     evolution of the cultural heritage of Santa Fe, and resulted \n     in the recognition by the State and Federal governments of \n     the sovereign rights of the Pueblos, including their right to \n     self-government;\n       Whereas, during 2009 and 2010, Santa Fe will proudly \n     observe the 400th anniversary of the settlement and \n     subsequent founding as a villa and the multicultural heritage \n     of the city with suitable events and observances to \n     commemorate the occasion and to pass on to future generation \n     the heritage of Santa Fe and the surrounding region; and\n       Whereas it is important that the commemoration provide a \n     foundation for peace, hope, and collaboration for Santa Fe \n     and its surrounding communities, and a foundation for moving \n     forward as a flagship community within the State of New \n     Mexico: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historical significance of the city of \n     Santa Fe, New Mexico;\n       (2) recognizes the 400th anniversary of the establishment \n     of Santa Fe; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of the City of \nSanta Fe, NM. This bill is cosponsored by Senator Tom Udall and a \ncompanion bill will be introduced in the House by Representatives Ben \nRay Lujan, Martin Heinrich, and Harry Teague.\n  Over the next year the City of Santa Fe will commemorate the arrival \nof Spanish settlers and the designation of the City as the capital city \nof the Spanish territory now known as New Mexico. On their arrival the \nSpaniards found a thriving Native American culture. These Native \nAmerican and Spanish cultures served to enrich each other and led the \ncreation of a vibrant social, cultural, and financial center that made \nthe settlement of the Western United States possible.\n  Despite the difficulties and periodic clashes the Spanish, Native \nAmerican, and Anglo cultures in Santa Fe fought and worked to create a \nunique and vibrant culture that enriched all in the area. It is this \nconfluence of cultures and the incomparable natural beauty of the area \nthat make Santa Fe, The City Different, an American treasure that \nshould be recognized and celebrated.\n  Santa Fe is celebrated worldwide for its thriving artistic community, \nincluding the Santa Fe Opera, museums, and working artists. Many of \nthese artists were drawn to its natural beauty, the light and air of \nthe place. It is this special something that led artists like D.H. \nLawrence and Georgia O'Keefe and countless others to visit and move to \nthe area.\n  We in New Mexico know how lucky we are to have Santa Fe and its \ntreasures the entire state stands with the City to commemorate its \n400th anniversary. That is why I am proud to introduce this resolution \nwith the entire New Mexico delegation calling on the Congress to \nrecognize the historical significance of Santa Fe and calling on the \nPeople of the United States to observe the anniversary with appropriate \nceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrise today and join my senior Senator in submitting a resolution \ncommemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nSanta Fe, NM.\n  The Villa de Santa Fe was founded in 1609 by Don Pedro de Peralta as \nthe capital of the Spanish province of New Mexico, making it the oldest \ncapital city in the U.S.\n  The city of Santa Fe is blessed with a diversity of cultures, rooted \nin its remarkable history. At the time Spanish colonists arrived in New \nMexico, they found many thriving Pueblo communities, including in the \narea around what was to become Santa Fe. Although there were conflicts \nbetween the two people, they learned from each other, shared knowledge, \ntraditions, and skills, while preserving their own unique cultures that \npersist to this day. Descendents of the original Spanish colonists can \nstill be found in Santa Fe, and the nearby Pueblos continue to enrich \nthe city and the region today. The city continued to evolve and grow \nthrough history with influences from the Mexican Revolution and \ncharacters from the western American frontier such as Billy the Kid.\n  With the breathtaking landscape of the high desert, snow-capped \nSangre de Cristo Mountains as a backdrop, and well-preserved historical \nlandmarks including the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and \nthe Palace of the Governors, Santa Fe has become a major tourist \ndestination and an inspiration to many artists, including Georgia \nO'Keeffe and D.H. Lawrence.\n  Today, Santa Fe is a modern American city, steeped in its rich \nhistory, arts, culture, and traditions. It is a treasure for the state \nof New Mexico and the Nation. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nhonoring its past and celebrating the future of the ``City Different.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/16/senate-section/article/S7652-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7652-S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 214--CONGRATULATING LUCAS GLOVER ON WINNING THE 2009 \n                   UNITED STATES OPEN GOLF TOURNAMENT\n\n  Mr. DeMINT (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REDESIGNATION OF NORTH \n                   KOREA AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On October 11, 2008, the Department of State removed \n     North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, on \n     which it had been placed in 1988.\n       (2) North Korea was removed from that list despite its \n     refusal to account fully for its abduction of foreign \n     citizens, proliferation of nuclear and other dangerous \n     technologies and weapon systems to terrorist groups and other \n     state sponsors of terrorism, or its commission of other past \n     acts of terrorism.\n       (3) On March 17, 2009, American journalists Euna Lee and \n     Laura Ling were seized near the Chinese-North Korean border \n     by agents of the North Korean government and were \n     subsequently sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in a prison \n     camp in North Korea.\n       (4) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested \n     a long-range ballistic missile in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1695 and 1718.\n       (5) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     announced it was expelling international inspectors from, and \n     recommissioning, its Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its \n     participation in disarmament talks.\n       (6) Those actions were in violation of the June 26, 2008, \n     announcement by the President of the United States that the \n     removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of \n     terrorism was dependent on the Government of North Korea \n     agreeing to a system to verify its declarations with respect \n     to its nuclear programs.\n       (7) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     conducted a second illegal nuclear test, in addition to \n     conducting tests of its ballistic missile systems launched in \n     the direction of the western United States.\n       (8) North Korea has failed to acknowledge or account for \n     its role in building and supplying the secret nuclear \n     facility at Al Kibar, Syria, has failed to account for all \n     remaining citizens of Japan abducted by North Korea, and, \n     according to recent reports, continues to engage in close \n     cooperation with the terrorist Iranian Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps on ballistic missile technology.\n       (9) There have been recent credible reports that North \n     Korea has provided support to the terrorist group Hezbollah, \n     including by providing ballistic missile components and \n     personnel to train members of Hezbollah with respect to the \n     development of extensive underground military facilities in \n     southern Lebanon, including tunnels and bunkers.\n       (10) The 2005 and 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism of the \n     Department of State state, with respect to Cuba, Iran, North \n     Korea, and Syria, ``Most worrisome is that some of these \n     countries also have the capability to manufacture WMD and \n     other destabilizing technologies that can get into the hands \n     of terrorists. The United States will continue to insist that \n     these countries end the support they give to terrorist \n     groups.''.\n       (11) President Barack Obama stated that actions of the \n     Government of North Korea ``are a matter of grave concern to \n     all nations. North Korea's attempts to develop nuclear \n     weapons, as well as its ballistic missile program, constitute \n     a threat to international peace and security. By acting in \n     blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, \n     North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the \n     international community. North Korea's behavior increases \n     tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such \n     provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's \n     isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless \n     it abandons it pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and \n     their means of delivery.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of State should designate North Korea as a \n     country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism for purposes of--\n       (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C.
