They want us to work together. Voters did \nnot elect only Republicans; they did not elect only Democrats; and they \ndid not want either party to govern, stubbornly demanding their way or \nthe highway. When the heat of the campaign season cools, our \nconstituents are more interested in us getting things done. They would \nrather we work with each other than talk past each other. Despite the \nchanges, our charge remains the same. Our No. 1 priority is still \ngetting people back to work, and the most important change we can make \nis in working more productively as a unified body to help our economy \nregain its strength.\n  I welcome back my counterpart, the esteemed Republican leader.

Mr. President, I have seen a lot of elections in my \nlife, but I have never seen an election like the one we had earlier \nthis month. The 2010 midterm election was a ``change'' election, the \nlikes of which I have never seen, and the change that people want, \nabove all, is right here in Washington.\n  Most Americans are deeply unhappy with their government, more so than \nat any other time in decades. And after the way lawmakers have done \nbusiness up here over the last couple of years, it is easy to see why. \nBut it is not enough to point out the faults of the party in power. \nAmericans want change, not mere criticism. And that means that all of \nus in Washington need to get serious about changing the way we do \nbusiness, even on things we have defended in the past, perhaps for good \nreason.\n  If the voters express themselves clearly and unequivocally on an \nissue, it is not enough to persist in doing the opposite on the grounds \nthat ``that's the way we've always done it.'' That is what elections \nare all about, after all. And if this election has shown us anything, \nit is that Americans know the difference between talking about change, \nand actually delivering on it.\n  Bringing about real change is hard work. It requires elected \nofficials, whether they are in their first week or their 50th year in \noffice, to challenge others and, above all, to challenge themselves to \ndo things differently from time to time, to question, and then to \nactually shake up the status quo in pursuit of a goal or a vision that \nthe voters have set for the good of our country.\n  I have thought about these things long and hard over the past few \nweeks. I have talked with my Members. I have listened to them. Above \nall, I have listened to my constituents. And what I have concluded is \nthat on the issue of congressional earmarks, as the leader of my party \nin the Senate, I have to lead first by example. Nearly every day that \nthe Senate's been in session for the past 2 years, I have come down to \nthis spot and said that Democrats are ignoring the wishes of the \nAmerican people. When it comes to earmarks, I will not be guilty of the \nsame thing.\n  Make no mistake. I know the good that has come from the projects I \nhave helped support throughout my State. I don't apologize for them. \nBut there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused \nAmericans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control \nspending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight. \nAnd unless people like me show the American people that we are willing \nto follow through on small or even symbolic things, we risk losing them \non our broader efforts to cut spending and rein in government.\n  That is why today I am announcing that I will join the Republican \nleadership in the House in support of a moratorium on earmarks in the \n112th Congress.\n  Over the years, I have seen Presidents of both parties seek to \nacquire total discretion over appropriations. And I have seen \nPresidents of both parties waste more taxpayer dollars on meritless \nprojects, commissions, and programs than every congressional earmark \nput together. Look no further than the stimulus, which Congress passed \nwithout any earmarks, only to have the current administration load it \nup with earmarks for everything from turtle tunnels to tennis courts.\n  Contrast this with truly vital projects I have supported back home in \nKentucky, such as the work we have done in relation to the Paducah \nGaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky.\n  Here was a facility at which workers, for years, were unaware of the \ndangers that the uranium at the plant posed to their health or how to \nsafely dispose of the hazardous materials that were used there. Thanks \nto an expose about the plant in the nineties by the Washington Post, \nthe danger was made known and I set about forcing the government to put \na cleanup plan in place and to treat the people who had worked there. \nThrough the earmark process, we were able to force reluctant \nadministrations of both parties to do what was needed to clean up this \nsite and to screen the people who had worked there for cancer. These \nscreenings saved lives, and they would not have happened if Congress \nhad not directed the funds to pay for them.\n  Another success story is the Bluegrass Army Depot, which houses some \nof the deadliest materials and chemical weapons on Earth. As a Nation \nwe had decided that we would not use the kind of weapons that were \nstored at this site; and yet the Federal Government was slow to follow \nthrough on safely dismantling and removing them, even after we had \nsigned an international treaty that required it. But thanks to \ncongressional appropriations we are on the way to destroying the \nchemical weapons at this site safely and thus protect the community \nthat surrounds it.\n  Administrations of both parties have failed to see the full merit in \neither of these projects, which is one of the reasons I have been \nreluctant to cede responsibility for continuing the good work that is \nbeing done on them and on others to the executive branch.\n  So I am not wild about turning over more spending authority to the \nexecutive branch, but I have come to share the view of most Americans \nthat our Nation is at a crossroads; that we will not be able to secure \nthe kind of future we want for our children and grandchildren unless we \nact, and act quickly; and that the only way we will be able to turn the \ncorner and save our future is if elected leaders like me make the kinds \nof difficult decisions voters are clearly asking us to make.\n  Republicans in and out of Washington have argued strenuously for 2 \nyears that spending and debt are at crisis levels. And we have \ndemonstrated our seriousness about cutting spending and reining in \ngovernment. Every Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nfor instance, voted against every appropriations bill in committee this \nyear because they simply cost too much. Most included funding for \nprojects in our home States. We voted against them anyway.\n  Banning earmarks is another small but important symbolic step we can \ntake to show that we are serious, another step on the way to serious \nand sustained cuts in spending and to the debt.\n  Earlier this month voters across the country said they are counting \non Republicans to make tough decisions. They gave us a second chance. \nWith this decision, I am telling them that they were right to put their \ntrust in us. And it is my fervent hope that it will help demonstrate to \nthe American people in some way just how serious Republicans are about \nnot letting them down.\n  Republican leaders in the House and Senate are now united on this \nissue, united in hearing what the voters have\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nbeen telling us for 2 years, and acting on it.\n  This is no small thing. Old habits are not easy to break, but \nsometimes they must be. And now is such a time. With a $14 trillion \ndebt and an administration that talks about cost-cutting but then sends \nover a budget that triples the national debt in 10 years and creates a \nmassive new entitlement program, it is time for some of us in \nWashington to show in every way possible that we mean what we say about \nspending.\n  With Republican leaders in Congress united, the attention now turns \nto the President. We have said we are willing to give up discretion; \nnow we will see how he handles spending decisions.\n  And if the President ends up with total discretion over spending, we \nwill see even more clearly where his priorities lie. We already saw the \nadministration's priorities in a stimulus bill that has become \nsynonymous with wasteful spending, that borrowed nearly $1 trillion for \nadministration earmarks like turtle tunnels, a sidewalk that lead to a \nditch, and research on voter perceptions of the bill.\n  Congressional Republicans uncovered much of this waste. Through \ncongressional oversight, we will continue to monitor how the money \ntaxpayers send to the administration is actually spent. It is now up to \nthe President and his party leaders in Congress to show their own \nseriousness on this issue, to say whether they will join Republican \nleaders in this effort and then, after that, in significantly reducing \nthe size and cost and reach of government. The people have spoken. They \nhave said as clearly as they can that this is what they want us to do.\n  They will be watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7873-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \nactivities of the so-called lameduck session we are about to enter. I \nbegin by suggesting that our session does not necessarily have to be a \nlameduck. We have the capacity to respond to the many pressing problems \nof the country as we choose. We can spread our wings and we can fly. \nOne could say at many points during the course of the 111th Congress, \nthe session could be called a turkey. It has not been very active in \nmany respects. This body, not atypical, has been expert at avoiding \ntough votes. Well, if there is any time where it is easiest to avoid \ntough votes, it is a long distance from the next election, and we can't \nget any further from the next election than today, since the last \nelection was only 13 days ago.\n  It is my suggestion that this would be a good time to undertake some \nsignificant action. The country is in a tremendous state of turmoil \npolitically, I think more so than at any time in the country's history, \ncertainly more than at any time during my tenure in the Senate; I think \nbeyond that, at any time in the history of the country with the \nexception of the Civil War period. We have seen candidates run on a \nplatform of ``I won't compromise.''\n  This is a political body. The art of politics is compromise and \naccommodation. I suggest there are some real lessons we all learned 13 \ndays ago from the election which we ought to put into effect now and \ntake some action and some decisive action. I suggest a good place to \nstart would be the enactment of the so-called DISCLOSE Act. That is the \nlegislation which would, at a minimum, require the identity of \ncontributors be known to the public so their motivations can be \nevaluated.\n  Campaign finance reform followed the massive cash contributions going \nback to the 1972 elections, and the Congress passed reform legislation \nin 1974. Then, in a landmark decision, Buckley v. Valeo, in 1976, key \nparts of that legislation were declared unconstitutional. Freedom of \nspeech under the first amendment was equated with money. I agree with \nJustice Stevens that that was a classic mistake; that the principle of \none person one vote is vitiated by allowing the powerful, the rich to \nhave such a large megaphone that it drowns out virtually everybody \nelse.\n  There have been a series of legislative enactments to try to overcome \nthe restrictions of Buckley v. Valeo and a corresponding series of \nSupreme Court decisions broadening the field of freedom of speech, \nuntil we got to the case of Citizens United. Then, upsetting 100 years \nof precedent, the Supreme Court decided corporations and unions could \nadvertise in political campaigns and, in conjunction with other \nloopholes in the campaign law, it was possible those contributions \ncould be made secretly. When the bill was called for a motion to \nproceed, as we all know, it fell short of the 60 votes necessary to cut \noff debate or to impose cloture. Fifty-nine Senators voted aye that we \nwanted to proceed, 57 Democrats and 2 Independents and all 41 \nRepublicans voted no.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks an article by Richard Polman in the \nPhiladelphia Enquirer and an editorial from the New York Times on the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Polman article recites a number of Senators who \nvoted no against proceeding with the DISCLOSE Act, having made in the \npast very forceful affirmative statements in favor of disclosure. It \nmay be that by reminding those 4 Senators, perhaps 1 of them or 2 of \nthem--we only need 1, if the 59 votes hold--they could be persuaded to \nvote aye and proceed to consider the bill. Then we have the advocates \nof McCain-Feingold. If we compare the rollcall vote on McCain-Feingold, \nwe find there are a number of Senators who voted no against taking up \nthe DISCLOSE Act, Senators who previously had spoken out forcefully in \nfavor of finance limitations and in favor of transparency. Perhaps at \nleast one of those or perhaps even more could be persuaded to vote to \nproceed with the so-called DISCLOSE Act.\n  There has been a plethora of political commentary about the dangers \nto our political system by having anonymous campaign contributions. The \nlast election was inundated with money, and the forecasts are that the \nnext election will be even more decisively controlled by these large \ncontributions and by these anonymous contributions. So to preserve our \ndemocracy and to preserve the power of the individual contrasted with \nthe power of the wealthy, I believe that ought to be very high on our \nagenda.\n  There is a corollary to the need for some change, some reform as a \nresult of what happened in Citizens United. In that case, we had two \nvotes, and they were decisive. To make the five-person majority, two \nvotes totally reversed the positions which those Justices had taken not \ntoo long ago during their confirmation proceedings. Chief Justice \nRoberts was emphatic in his confirmation proceeding that he was not \ngoing to jolt the system, that he would have respect for stare decisis, \nand that he would have respect for congressional findings. So was \nJustice Alito on both those accounts. In their confirmation hearings, \nthe testimony of both was explicit in the statement that it was a \nlegislative function to find the facts, and it was not a judicial \nfunction to find the facts. When Citizens United came down, as the \ndissenting opinion by Justice Stevens pointed out, a voluminous factual \nrecord showing the dangers and the potential dangers of excessive \ncontributions was on the record.\n  All that was ignored in the decision in Citizens United and was \nignored by\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\nthe commitment which those two Justices made in their confirmation \nhearings not too many years before.\n  The best approach in dealing with this issue is to have the public \nunderstand what is going on in the Court. It is my view and the view of \nmany other Senators that we are long past the time when the Court ought \nto be televised so the public would understand what has been going on. \nOn repeated occasions, the Judiciary Committee has voted out \nlegislation requiring the Supreme Court to be televised. It is an \nappropriate legislative function to impose that requirement. It is up \nto the Congress to decide administrative matters. For example, the \nCongress decides when the Supreme Court will convene. It is on the \nfirst Monday of October in each year. The Congress decides how many \nJustices it takes to have a quorum--six--to transact the business of \nthe Court. It is the Congress which decides how many Justices there \nwill be on the Court, and the Congress has set the number at nine. It \nis recalled that an effort was made during the Roosevelt administration \nto so-called pack the Court by raising the number to 15. The Congress \ncould have done that. It would have been unwise, but the Congress has \nthe power. The Congress decides what cases the Court will hear. For \nexample, mandating that McCain-Feingold be reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt so the Court's customary discretionary decision on granting \ncertiorari or not can be overcome by the Congress. I suggest it is time \nthat transparency and understanding by the public should come into \noperation. Justice Brandeis was an eloquent spokesman for sunlight \nbeing the best disinfectant. It has been said repeatedly that the \nSupreme Court follows the election returns. The Supreme Court follows \nthe values of our society in a changing country, which has eliminated \nsegregation, changed the rules with respect to sexual preferences, \nchanged the rules many times.\n  The best way to accomplish that would be to take up this issue, which \nwe could take up in this session--this session before the end of the \nyear--something I have discussed with the majority leader, something I \nhave discussed with the leadership of the House, and we could handle \nthis in relatively short order.\n  There is another matter which I suggest we ought to take up and \nconclude, and that is the issue of the START Treaty. President Reagan \nset the standard of ``trust but verify,'' but since the end of 2009, \nwhen the last treaty expired, we have been unable to verify what the \nRussians are doing.\n  The START Treaty also provides for beyond verification, provides for \narms reduction, which is something which ought to be done. There is no \nreason to have these vast arsenals. They can be reduced and it would be \nmuch less expensive in an era when we are very much concerned about \ngovernmental costs.\n  The 1992 START Treaty, negotiated by President Reagan and by \nPresident George H. W. Bush, passed the Senate 93 to 6. The 2003 Moscow \nTreaty on arms control, negotiated by President George W. Bush, passed \n95 to 0. So that is a subject which ought to be taken up and ought to \nbe acted upon, notwithstanding the objection of a small number of \nindividuals. We ought to take that up on the merits and vote it up or \ndown. I am sure it would be ratified.\n  The issue of don't ask, don't tell is another matter which ought to \nbe concluded before the end of the year. We know what has resulted from \nthe study ordered by the Department of Defense. Some say we ought to \nknow more than we know at the present time. Well, we have considered \ndon't ask, don't tell for more than a decade, and I think it is \npalpably plain that the time for the current standards has long since \nrun and it ought to come to a vote. To tie up the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill on that subject--a bill which has been passed year \nafter year after year, going back decades--it is something which ought \nto be enacted by this Congress.\n  I suggest further that we ought to take up unemployment compensation \nvery promptly. We have millions who are unemployed and an unemployment \nrate of 9.5 percent nationally. There are people who are actively \nseeking jobs who cannot find them. That ought to be a priority item, \ncertainly to be accomplished during this session.\n  There is one other item which I think we ought to act on; that is, to \nauthorize Federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells. That \nlegislation has twice been passed, first under the name Specter-Harkin \nand later, when the majority changed, to Harkin-Specter. We should have \nenacted it earlier. We have relied upon an Executive order promulgated \nby President Obama to authorize Federal funding, and then in a surprise \ndecision the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nruled that the Executive order violated the existing statute.\n  Well, it is not a constitutional issue. The Congress can change that. \nThe order has been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit, and the order has been stayed, which means at the \npresent time research can proceed with Federal funding. But it is a \nvery uncertain matter. As testified to by Dr. Collins, the Director of \nthe National Institutes of Health, the scientists who are working under \nNIH grants are very much in doubt as to what is going to happen. There \nis some $200 million and more than 200 projects which hang in the \nbalance. On embryonic stem cell research we are dealing with a life-\nand-death situation, and there ought not to be hesitancy or doubt in \nthe minds of those scientists.\n  The objection has been raised that these embryos could produce life. \nWell, if there were any chance that would happen I think no one would \nbe in favor of using them for scientific research. But the fact is, \nthere are some 400,000 of these embryos frozen, and they are not being \nused to produce life.\n  Back in 2002, when I chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHealth, I took the lead in Federal funding to assist individuals who \nwanted to adopt these embryos to have them produce life. Some $9 \nmillion has been appropriated in the intervening years, but only 242 of \nthese embryos have been adopted to produce life. Meanwhile, in 2008, \nthe most recent year for which statistics are available, more than a \nmillion people died from heart disease and cancer.\n  We have the capacity, the opportunity, through these embryos, which \nreplace diseased cells, to deal with stroke, to deal with heart \ndisease, perhaps to deal with cancer. We do not know. But there is much \nthat can be done, and Congress has the authority to clarify the \nsituation. It could take years pending in the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, with the time for briefing and argument and \ndecision, and possible appeal to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. But it is a matter that Congress can act on, and twice we have \nalready acted, and both times vetoes were successfully handed down by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  So there is much we can do during this session of Congress if we make \nup our minds to do it.\n  One other lesson which we have seen from the current election is the \ntremendous power which has been exercised by the extremities of both \npolitical parties, and we have seen this in recent years. We have seen \nan excellent Senator such as Senator Joseph Lieberman who cannot win a \nDemocratic primary, and we have seen an excellent Senator such as Bob \nBennett, with a 93-percent conservative rating, who cannot survive the \nnomination process in Utah. Those are only a couple of cases. Many more \ncould be cited.\n  But we have also seen that when the voters are informed and the \nvoters are aroused that we are still a country which has a constituency \nwhich desires to be governed from the center, not on either extreme, \nand the primary elections bring out those on one side or the other.\n  But we have the situation with Senator Lisa Murkowski which \ndemonstrates the point that there is still a dominant voice in the \ncenter. Senator Murkowski lost her primary election, illustrative of \nthe principle I mentioned a few moments ago about the primaries being \ndominated by the extremes. But then, in a spectacular write-in \ncampaign, it now appears Senator Murkowski will be reelected--the first \ntime that has happened since Senator Thurmond won on a write-in \ncampaign in the 1950s, and that is a pretty tough proposition. You have \nto have the spelling right. ``Murkowski'' is not the easiest name in \nthe world to spell, notwithstanding the fact that it has\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nbeen popularized not only in Alaska by her distinguished father--\nelected at the same time I and others were elected to this body--and it \nis not certain but it looks pretty likely that Senator Murkowski will \nbe remaining in the U.S. Senate.\n  So when the electorate understands what the issue is--and there was \nso much publicity that the electorate did--and when they are aroused \nand motivated to action, I think it is very strong evidence that \nAmerica, illustrated by Alaska, wants to be governed from the center. \nSo I think that is something that ought to be noted by this Congress in \nthe last 45 days of this year as we look over a tremendous number of \nvery important issues.\n  I have not covered the entire range of issues which we ought to \nconsider, but I think I have covered some which ought to be handled by \nthis session of the Congress and that the duck ought to spread its \nwings, show it is not lame, and get something done to operate in the \ninterests of the American people.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 31, 2010]\n\n            The American Debate: Secret Donors vs. Democracy\n\n                            (By Dick Polman)\n\n       Can we all agree that secret money in politics is a bad \n     thing?\n       OK, you're with me. So far, so good.\n       And can we all agree that the Republicans have been \n     hypocrites on this issue--having long declared that they were \n     against secret money, only to flip-flop in 2010 and declare \n     that they were for it?\n       OK, now I've probably lost half of you. But bear with me.\n       Thanks to a number of factors--a historic Supreme Court \n     decision that has inspired wealthy donors to pony up, a tax \n     code riddled with loopholes, and toothless federal \n     watchdogs--a record amount of secret money, topping $250 \n     million, is flooding the Senate and House races. We have no \n     idea who these donors are, yet we've all seen their handiwork \n     in TV ads. From the shadows, they create front groups with \n     vacuously pleasing names--something like Concerned Citizens \n     for the Betterment of Mankind, or Americans for Puppies, \n     Apple Pie, and the Fourth of July.\n       By the way, even though it's true that the Republicans have \n     trumped the Democrats in the secret-money race by more than \n     2-1, I don't mean to imply that the GOP is poised to win big \n     Tuesday night simply because its anonymous donors wrote big \n     checks. Nancy Pelosi may think so--the House speaker recently \n     said, ``Everything was going great, and all of a sudden \n     secret money from God knows where, because they won't \n     disclose it, is pouring in''--but she is wrong. Long before \n     the GOP's richest fans ever got involved, hardly anything was \n     ``going great'' for the Democrats.\n       But the secrecy, in itself, is an affront to democracy and \n     the principle of transparency. People give big money for a \n     reason; we may never know what they got in return. We have \n     essentially legalized the practice of backstage bribery, and \n     2010 is a mere tune-up for the presidential race in 2012.\n       Last winter, after the U.S. Supreme Court freed up \n     corporations, unions, and other special interests to spend \n     campaign money more easily, rich people felt more emboldened \n     to finance the GOP's efforts. But they didn't want the public \n     to know who they were. So, a few intrepid Republican \n     strategists, including Karl Rove, came up with a clever fix. \n     They created nonprofit groups under a section of the tax code \n     reserved for ``social welfare organizations'' that allows \n     donors to fork over unlimited money without being publicly \n     named. And the secret money has flowed unabated ever since.\n       So you might be wondering, ``Doesn't the public have a \n     right to know who these donors are? How come Congress hasn't \n     done something about this?'' Well, guess what? Congress has \n     tried. In the spring and summer, the ruling Democrats sought \n     to pass the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on \n     Spending in Elections Act (which proves that Democrats will \n     never work on Madison Avenue). Known commonly by its acronym, \n     the DISCLOSE Act, it would essentially force these donors \n     into the open. It passed in the House--with virtually all \n     Republicans voting no. It went to the Senate, where it \n     lingers today because Republicans won't let it come up for a \n     vote.\n       I warned you that I would bring up the Republicans' \n     hypocrisy, defined here as the chasm between what they once \n     professed to believe and what they now practice.\n       Back in the days when Republicans were strongly opposed to \n     campaign-finance reform (this was a decade ago, when John \n     McCain was mavericky in his efforts to curb big money in \n     politics), they insisted that full disclosure was the best \n     solution, that as long as the voters could see who's giving \n     the big money, voting decisions could be made on that basis \n     and democracy would be alive and well.\n       So said George W. Bush, for instance, when he first ran for \n     president in 2000. But let's go down the list.\n       Here was Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chamber's current GOP \n     leader, during a 2000 appearance on Meet the Press: \n     ``Republicans are in favor of disclosure.'' That year, he \n     also said that ``the major political players in America'' \n     should be subject to disclosure; in his words, ``Why would a \n     little disclosure be better than a lot of disclosure?'\n       Here was Lamar Alexander, now a Tennessee senator but \n     speaking as a presidential candidate in 1999: ``I support . . \n     . free speech and full disclosure. In other words, any \n     individual can give whatever they want as long as it is \n     disclosed every day on the Internet.''\n       Here was Texas Sen. John Cornyn's philosophical stance just \n     six months ago: ``I think the system needs more transparency, \n     so people can reach their own conclusions.''\n       Here was Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, just six months ago: \n     ``I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is unaccountable . . . I tend to favor \n     disclosure.''\n       Al four have been blocking the DISCLOSE Act. Meanwhile, on \n     the House side, GOP leader John Boehner said in 2007, ``We \n     ought to have full disclosure, full disclosure of all of the \n     money that we raise and how it is spent. And I think that \n     sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' But when the DISCLOSE \n     Act came up in the House this year, Boehner voted for \n     darkness.\n       Actually, Rove's group, American Crossroads, has engineered \n     the best flip-flop. It was launched this year as a full-\n     disclosure enterprise; one of its board members, ex-GOP \n     national chairman Mike Duncan, said in May, ``I'm a proponent \n     of lots of money in politics and full disclosure in \n     politics''--the traditional GOP position. He voiced his \n     support for ``full accountability.'' But when the potential \n     big donors voiced their distaste for sunlight, the Crossroads \n     gang deep-sixed its disclosure talk and created an offshoot \n     in the aforementioned secrecy section of the tax code. That \n     got the bucks flowing.\n       And don't expect the feds to police this behavior. Under \n     the tax code, these social-welfare organizations are \n     supposedly barred from spending more than half their money on \n     politics. But the Federal Elections Commission has a well-\n     deserved reputation for allowing political operatives to play \n     fast and loose with the rules. Indeed, the FEC is set up for \n     stalemate; even if its three Democratic commissioners wanted \n     to move against secret money, its three Republican \n     counterparts would likely block the move.\n       All told, if sunlight is indeed the best disinfectant (as \n     Boehner once believed, when he borrowed the phrase from \n     Justice Louis Brandeis), then I suppose we must now gird \n     ourselves indefinitely for the toxins that flourish in the \n     dark.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 4, 2010]\n\n                         Campaign Money To Burn\n\n       After Tuesday's vote, there is no limit to the ambitions of \n     stealth political groups bankrolled by anonymous check \n     writers. Two of the flushest pro-Republican operations, \n     American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, plan to extend their \n     campaigning into the lame-duck session of Congress with waves \n     of misinformation about tax and immigration issues.\n       The moment could not be more pressing far lame-duck \n     senators to revisit--and pass--the ``Disclose Act.'' It has \n     been approved by the House and would mandate that the public \n     at least be told which deep-pocketed corporate and union \n     donors are politicking from the underbrush. The measure \n     failed by one vote in a September filibuster by Republicans.\n       The Democratic majority needs just a few Republicans to \n     break party lock step and stand up for politicking in the \n     sunshine. Republicans who once made disclosure their mantra \n     (as an alternative to robust limits on contributions) are \n     predictably backing away.\n       One Republican newcomer, Senator-elect Mark Kirk of \n     Illinois, did offer a ringing endorsement of disclosure in \n     the campaign. Asked in a debate about the $1.1 million in \n     advertising support that he received from Karl Rove's \n     Crossroads GPS, Mr. Kirk firmly insisted special-interest \n     groups writing campaign checks ``should reveal their donors \n     and be fully transparent.''\n       And after winning a special election for President Obama's \n     former Senate seat, he will be eligible in the lame-duck \n     session. He can deliver for his voters, and make his mark \n     early, by supporting the Disclose Act.\n       The so-called Republican moderates--Olympia Snowe and Susan \n     Collins of Maine and Scott Brown of Massachusetts--have been \n     critical of what seem to be peripheral details. If it takes a \n     stripped-down version to win enactment of true disclosure, \n     that is worth pursuing.\n       The Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, back from the \n     brink of defeat in an election rife with murky check writers, \n     needs to push hard and be ready to deal. The lame-duck \n     session offers the last realistic chance for a donor \n     disclosure law before secretive organizations up the ante and \n     mayhem for the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning I read a little piece in the \nnewspaper that a man named Jacob Carroll had died in Afghanistan, a \nU.S. soldier. He died in Afghanistan on the battlefield. I did not know \nJacob Carroll, but he is one of 438 American soldiers who have died \nfighting in Afghanistan. He has not only joined in the 438 who have \ndied in Afghanistan but also the over 4,400 who have died fighting in \nIraq.\n  I think most Americans perhaps hear the news, see the news, and move \non to what else is covered that day in the newspaper. I was thinking \nabout that when I read something that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had \nsaid about the shared sacrifice and shared responsibilities of our \ncountry. We have been at war for 9 years in the Middle East, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan. If you look around our country, and especially look around \nthis Chamber, and evaluate what we have done and what we are \npreoccupied with, it is very hard to see that our country is at war.\n  Oh, there are some young men and women who are sent halfway around \nthe world to strap on ceramic body armor in the morning, get shot at in \nthe afternoon, and perhaps get killed. They are at war. They understand \nsacrifice. But I wonder if it is not too much business as usual in our \ncountry and has not been for some long while. I ask that in the context \nof the discussion I heard this weekend on the interview shows. I was \nnot in town here this weekend, but I heard some of the discussion, and \nit was about: Well, how about the tax cuts? Who can get additional tax \ncuts at this moment? And who supports maximum tax cuts versus other tax \ncuts?\n  Well, we are at war. We have people dying who serve this country on \nthe battlefield. We have a $13.6 trillion Federal debt. We have a $1.3 \ntrillion budget deficit this year. And the issue is, who should get \nmore tax cuts? That is almost unbelievable to me.\n  Let me read what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said so many decades ago.\n  He said:\n\n       Not all of us have the privilege of fighting our enemies in \n     distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have the \n     privilege of working in a munitions factory or a ship yard, \n     or on the farms or in the oil fields or mines, producing the \n     weapons or raw materials that are needed by our armed forces. \n     But there is one front and one battle where everyone in the \n     United States--every man, woman and child--is in action . . . \n     That front is right here at home, in our daily lives, and in \n     our daily tasks. Here at home everyone will have the \n     privilege of making whatever self-denial is necessary, not \n     only to supply our fighting men, but to keep the economic \n     structure of our country fortified and secure . . .\n\n  I find it a little disheartening that we have so many people now who \nhave decided that the biggest issue is additional tax cuts.\n  I travel a lot through Minneapolis to get to North Dakota on \nweekends, and occasionally at the Minneapolis Airport it will be cold. \nYes, it will be 40 below, and the wind will be howling at 35, 40 miles \nan hour, and you will see a group of people huddled outside the door at \nthe Minneapolis Airport smoking cigarettes because there is no smoking \ninside the terminal. I figure somebody who goes out to smoke when it is \n40 below zero and the wind is blowing 45 miles per hour has pretty much \ngiven up their claim forever that they can quit anytime they want to \nquit. They have pretty much given up that claim.\n  I would say similarly that those of us in this Chamber who have \ntalked to us about the danger of Federal debt and Federal budget \ndeficits have pretty much given up their claim forever to say that they \ncare about the economic policy and deficits and debt that overhang this \ncountry if they bring a satchel to the floor with them that says: My \npriority is to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans when we are at \nwar and have a $13 trillion in debt. Don't tell me you have a claim \nabout caring about Federal budget deficits if that is the agenda you \nare pushing.\n  Let me give just a little bit of history on this question of tax \ncuts. The first time in 30 years that this country had a Federal budget \nsurplus was in the last year of President Clinton's 8 years. At that \npoint, we had a Federal budget surplus. All of the economists and \nothers estimated that we would have budget surpluses from that point \nthroughout the following 10 years.\n  So the new President, President George W. Bush, said: If we are going \nto have surpluses, an estimated $5.6 trillion of Federal budget \nsurpluses over the next 10 years, let's take aggressive and quick steps \nto give back the surpluses in the form of tax cuts.\n  I stood here on the floor of the Senate and said: Wait a second. \nDon't be quite so hasty. We don't have those surpluses yet. We have \njust had 1 year of surpluses, and the rest of them are just \nprojections. Why don't we wait and be a little conservative.\n  The answer was: You know what, you don't understand economics. We are \ngoing to do this because we are going to have all of these surpluses.\n  So very large tax cuts were put in place--the largest for the \nwealthiest Americans--and at that point, we stopped seeing any \nsurpluses at all. The tax cuts were for the purpose of giving back \nsurpluses that were to exist when, in fact, none existed. Almost \nimmediately, in 2001, we found out that we were in a recession. Very \nquickly, we found that there was an attack against our country on 9/11. \nThen we were at war in Afghanistan, then at war in Iraq, then a 9-year \nwar against terrorists and all the security costs that attend to that. \nSo there haven't been any budget surpluses.\n  The most unbelievable thing to me is that this country has asked men \nand women to go off to war and risk their lives, and some have given \ntheir lives, and this government has not paid for the cost of that war. \nWe have paid for that war in blood and death--blood and death--no, not \nthe blood of those who serve in this Chamber but blood and death for \nsure.\n  Now the question is, with a $13 trillion debt and a deep recession, \nthe deepest since the Great Depression--having gone through and now \nstarting to come out of that recession, the question is the extension \nof the tax cuts that were provided in 2001. In 2001, those tax cuts had \na termination date, and that termination date was this December 31st. \nSo the question, then, is, If tax cuts are to be extended, for whom \nshall they be extended? It will cost about $3 trillion to extend them \nfor middle-income taxpayers and another $1 trillion in 10 years to \nextend them for upper income Americans. Let me tell my colleagues what \nI mean by that. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities has said \nthat if you extend them for those over $250,000 a year, it costs about \nnearly $1 trillion with interest over the 10 years, and in addition, \nthose who make $1 million a year will get a tax cut of $104,000 a \nyear--$104,000 a year.\n  So here is the question: A country that is deep, deep, deep in debt \nand projected to go deeper into debt, should this country borrow $1 \ntrillion in order to give a tax cut of $104,000 a year to someone who \nmakes $1 million a year or should we perhaps mind the words of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, who says that perhaps that front in which every man, \nwoman, and child can contribute at a time when a country is at war, \nthat front is here at home in our daily lives. Here at home, everyone \nwill have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is necessary, \nnot only to supply our fighting men but to keep the economic structure \nof our country fortified and secure.\n  So a young man named Jacob Carroll dies today. He is from Clemmons, \nNC. I didn't know him, nor do I suspect anyone in this Chamber knows \nhim, but he\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\ndied fighting for his country. Are we to do less when we see people \nmaking the ultimate sacrifice? Are we to do less than at least ask for \nsacrifice by all Americans or are we going to continue to say: We will \nborrow money to continue to prosecute a war. We will send young men and \nwomen to risk their lives, but we will not pay for it. We will just add \nit to the debt. And when it comes time to answer the question--perhaps \nin a lameduck session at the end of this year--of who shall get the \nbenefit of the extended tax cuts, we will also say--some would insist--\nthat those who are fortunate enough to make $1 million a year in net \nincome in this country--quite a blessing, I would say--those who are \nfortunate enough to make $1 million a year, we will say to them: You \nare fortunate enough to get another $104,000 tax reduction, another tax \ncut. Why? Because a lot of people here believe that is the way you \npromote economic progress. Not to me. You promote economic progress by \ndemonstrating to the American people that you understand the kind of \nchoking nature this debt and deficit have on future opportunities and \nfuture economic growth in this country.\n  We all grew up at a time when we almost always understood just \nviscerally--we didn't have to be told--that our children would have it \nbetter than we have it. We grew up in a time when it was almost \ninevitable and we didn't need to be told that we were the biggest, the \nstrongest, the best; we could beat anybody in the world at almost \nanything with one hand tied behind our back. But it has changed. It has \nchanged. Now this country needs some good decisions, some tough \ndecisions, some decisions to do the right thing.\n  The question on these talk shows this weekend was, Will you \ncompromise? The better question is, Will you do the right thing for a \nchange? We all know--this country knows--you can't fight a war for 9 \nyears and not pay for any of the costs of it and add it to the Federal \ndebt, and deficit every single year. We know better than that. That is \nnot the way you run a country, it is not the way you share sacrifice, \nand it is not the way you honor soldiers. You go to war, and we will \ncharge the cost for blood and death. That is not the way to honor those \nwho fight for our country.\n  Let me mention one final point. It is interesting to me that unless \nyou believe all tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 should now \nbe extended in this circumstance, you are a ``liberal.'' So apparently \nthe conservative approach is to borrow money and extend the tax cuts, \nadd $1 trillion to the Federal debt in order to extend tax cuts for \nthose earning over $250,000 a year or more. It doesn't seem to me as \nthough that is a conservative approach; it seems to me that is a \nliberal approach if you want to add $1 trillion to the Federal debt in \norder to accomplish that.\n  I wish no one had to pay any taxes. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Sign \nme up to say that I wish no one had to pay taxes. But the cost of this \ncountry's governance, the building of roads, the schools, yes, the \nDefense Department, the payment for soldiers and weapons and so on to \nprotect this country--all of that needs to be paid for.\n\n  I hope those who decide to affix labels to various positions might \nwell understand that to borrow a substantial portion of money to \nprovide tax cuts when the country is up to its neck in debt is not a \nconservative position. It just is not. And to suggest we have fewer \nextensions of tax cuts for the upper income people so that we don't \nborrow money to add to the Federal debt, that is not a liberal \nposition. It just is not.\n\n\n                               Fair Trade\n\n  Let me also mention one final point. It is the case this weekend, \nagain, with the chattering class, that they describe President Obama's \ntrip to South Korea as something less than a success because there was \nnot a trade agreement negotiated and completed with South Korea. Well, \nthat wasn't the President's fault. The fact is, the South Koreans were \nnot willing to budge on the significant issue that divides our country \nand South Korea on international trade, and that is the bilateral trade \non automobiles. I won't give a lot of statistics except to say this: 99 \npercent of the cars driven on the streets of South Korea are made in \nthat country. Is that an accident? It is not an accident. That is \nexactly what they want in South Korea. Ninety-nine percent of the cars \nthey drive on their roads are made there because they want South Korean \njobs to make cars driving on their highways. South Korea ships us, \ndepending on the year, anywhere between 600,000 and 800,000 cars a year \nthat they make in their country to sell in our country. We are only \nallowed to sell about 6,000 cars a year in South Korea. Let me say that \nagain: 600,000 to 800,000 cars being shipped this way and 6,000 cars \nfrom the United States being shipped to South Korea. That is exactly \nwhat the South Korean Government wants--jobs there, not here.\n  Well, you know what, the President should not have--and I applaud him \nfor being unwilling to negotiate a trade agreement that is so \nfundamentally at odds with the issue of having jobs in this country. \nThis country needs jobs. We are terribly short of jobs. We shouldn't be \nnegotiating trade agreements that would fritter away those jobs. We at \nleast ought to require fair trade agreements with countries such as \nSouth Korea--at least fair trade--and that has not been the case. So \nthe President ought not be criticized for not bringing home a bad trade \nagreement. He was not willing to negotiate a bad trade agreement. Good \nfor him. Everyone in this country who needs a job ought to stand up and \nsay: Good for him. Good for standing up for this country's interests. \nNo, it is not being protectionist to insist that if your products are \nopen to our market, then you open your market to our products. That is \ncalled fair and reciprocal trade. If other countries don't want to do \nthat, then they have to understand that there are consequences to that.\n  The President has not failed at all on this issue. When and if the \nSouth Korean Government decides it wants fair trade and reciprocal \ntrade opportunities on bilateral automobile trade, I expect we will \nhave a trade agreement. Until that time, I applaud the President for \ndeciding not to sign a bad trade agreement. I want the President to \nnegotiate trade agreements that lift this country up and say to people \nwho are now jobless--and there are millions of them--that, I am \nfighting for your jobs. It is not protectionist to fight for and demand \nfair trade and reciprocal trading procedures with our trading partners.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7877-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7877-S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UPCOMING CLOTURE VOTES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the day after tomorrow, on Wednesday, we \nare going to have three cloture votes. These cloture motions were filed \nbefore we broke in October. Those will be the first three votes of our \nreturning this fall. Those three cloture votes are, of course, motions \nto proceed--a motion to proceed on an energy bill, a motion to proceed \non the paycheck fairness bill, and a motion to proceed on the food \nsafety bill.\n  Mr. President, the food safety bill came out of my committee, the \nHELP Committee, on November 18 of last year. We have been working for a \nyear to get this up. It has strong bipartisan support. We tried to get \nit up before we broke in October, but there were objections on the \nRepublican side, and we were not able to move forward even though we \nhad been working--Senator Enzi and I--on this along with Senators Gregg \nand Burr on the Republican side, and Senator Durbin, I, and others on \nthe Democratic side to work it out. I believe we are there.\n  This bill has strong support from the consumer groups, from the \nbusiness and industry groups, and it has strong bipartisan support. I \nhope we will be able to get a successful vote on the motion to proceed \nto that bill. I will have more to say about that later in the week, on \nWednesday specifically.\n  Today I wish to confine my remarks to the other two cloture votes, \nthe Energy bill and the one on the Paycheck\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nFairness Act. On November 9, a bipartisan group of us from the Senate--\nfour of us--sent a letter to the majority leader, Senator Reid, about \nthis bill, the Energy bill. We are going to be voting on the motion to \nproceed to this bill on Wednesday.\n  Basically, what this letter--which is bipartisan--said to Leader Reid \nwas that we need to move forward on energy legislation. We all \nrecognize that. But there is a major omission in this bill. What is \nmissing from the bill is any mention of biofuels and what biofuels can \ncontribute to our energy independence in this country.\n  At the outset, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nbe printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. SENATE,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 2010.\n     Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: Achieving a transition to \n     cleaner, more secure, and more sustainable energy systems is \n     one of the public policy imperatives of our generation. We \n     cannot afford to continue to send billions of dollars every \n     year to unstable oil producing countries, nor to spend \n     additional billions protecting those investments. We also \n     cannot continue to ignore the rising global temperatures, \n     changing climates, and health effects that are direct results \n     of the annual emissions of billions of tons of greenhouse \n     gases and air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion.\n       There is also broad recognition that promotion of energy \n     efficiency and alternative fuels and energy systems offer one \n     of our clearest and most promising avenues for significant \n     job creation and economic development. Indeed, we arc seeing \n     increasing calls for domestic development of renewable fuels \n     and technologies, both for their export potential and to \n     avoid our eventual import of those same technologies if we \n     fall behind in their development.\n       We are heartened that you have filed cloture on energy \n     legislation because it provides an opportunity for a full \n     debate about our nation's energy future, and we would like to \n     work with you to craft legislation that can obtain broad \n     bipartisan support. To that end, we urge you to include in \n     that legislation a number of broadly supported programs and \n     policies addressing some of our most immediate and obvious \n     energy challenges.\n       One of our most pressing energy issues is our continued \n     dependence on imported petroleum for fueling our \n     transportation systems. On this issue, we are encouraged by \n     the progress that is being made by vehicle efficiency gains \n     and by the increasing contributions from domestic biofuels. \n     However, we are also deeply concerned that continued \n     expansion of biofuels is being constrained by marketplace \n     limitations. Quite simply, we need more vehicles that can \n     utilize high percentages of ethanol and other biofuels, we \n     need to develop pipelines to transport these fuels from their \n     production sites to the largest markets, and we need to \n     ensure that these high renewable content fuels are available \n     at filling stations across the country. We therefore urge you \n     to include biofuels market expansion provisions addressing \n     these barriers in energy legislation considered by the \n     Senate.\n       We also urge consideration of legislation to extend the \n     Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) beyond its \n     current expiration date of December 31, 2010. Letting this \n     key support policy lapse in the coming year could cause a \n     precipitous drop in biofuels production, threatening \n     thousands of good-paying green jobs as well as putting \n     pressure on gasoline prices and supplies. While we believe \n     that the VEETC program deserves review in the context of \n     broader discussions about how best to address the most \n     important limitations facing biofuels, it is very important \n     to not let this support program lapse while those discussions \n     take place.\n       The enactment of these policies will enable as much as a 5-\n     fold increase in biofuels' displacement of oil-based fuel use \n     in transportation within the next 2 decades--generating \n     energy resource production and refining jobs all across \n     America, improving our international balance of payments, and \n     lessening our dependence on imports from unstable regions of \n     the World.\n     Tom Harkin.\n     Christopher Bond.\n     Tim Johnson.\n     Amy Klobuchar.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, what is missing is biofuels. While I will \ncertainly vote for the motion to proceed because I think we should \nproceed to it, major changes need to be made in this bill before it can \nearn my support on final passage. Let me talk about what those changes \nare.\n  First of all, I think it is very clear that we have to wean ourselves \noff of spending more and more of our taxpayers' dollars, consumer \ndollars, on imported oil. I think President Bush said that, and \nPresident Obama has said that, and it is not a partisan issue. It is a \nnational security issue dealing very much with our economic security in \nthis country. What is missing from the bill is a focus--any focus at \nall--on the one thing that over the last, say, 20 years has decreased \nour dependence on foreign oil; that is, the use of biofuels for \ntransportation.\n  Again, there have been a lot of alternatives proposed: natural gas, \nhydrogen, electric vehicles--all of which will be pursued in the \nfuture. But, quite frankly, the only thing right now and in the \nforeseeable future, the next 10, 15 years that will do anything to \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil is biofuels.\n  There has been a remarkable success story with biofuels in this \ncountry. This chart shows what we have done--it shows production \nincreasing from 1998 up until about 2010. We had a huge increase in the \nuse of biofuels, so we are up to about 11 billion or 12 billion gallons \na year. Under the renewable fuels standard 2--the mandate we passed in \n2007--that is projected to go up to 36 billion gallons of biofuels by \n2022. That is in the law--36 billion gallons by 2022. So, again, this \nis what is going to replace imported oil. We are well on our way to \ndoing that. However, right now biofuels are facing significant market \nlimitations. Well, first of all, about the only thing that can be used \nis 10 percent ethanol blends with gasoline--E10--although the EPA just \nrecently came out with a new standard where we will be able to use \nE15--or 15 percent ethanol--in model cars 2007 and higher. It is \nthought that maybe sometime next year EPA will come out with another \nstandard that will allow as much as 20 percent ethanol.\n\n  These are all well and good, but, again, there are a couple of things \nthat need to be done. First of all, let's keep in mind that converting \nto use of biofuels is much quicker and much easier, much more cost \neffective than using natural gas. For example, to use E85 or any other \nblend of biofuels at a pump just takes a different kind of pump. But \nyou, as the driver of the car, would simply drive up, pick up the \nhandle, put the fuel in your gas tank, just as you put in gasoline \ntoday. But for natural gas, there would have to be a big pressurized \nstorage tank. That natural gas would have to then be transferred to \nyour vehicle tank, a very strong tank in your car, and there would have \nto be some kind of nozzle to transfer that pressurized fuel. It \nwouldn't just be putting gasoline in a vehicle. So a whole new \ninfrastructure would have to be built to accomplish this. But no new \ninfrastructure needs to be built to put biofuels in your car. So it is \nmuch easier and much more rapid.\n  Now, a couple of things I have already said about the infrastructure, \nbut let me talk a little about two things. The first is the ethanol tax \ncredit. Right now it is at 45 cents a gallon. There is a lot of talk \nthat when it expires this year it shouldn't be renewed because it costs \n$5.9 billion a year for this tax credit for ethanol. You might say: \nMaybe we shouldn't be spending that. Well, studies by McKinsey and \nothers show that ethanol reduces gasoline prices--estimates vary, but \nconservative estimate is 17 cents a gallon. So that savings of 17 cents \na gallon saves consumers in America $24 billion a year--$24 billion a \nyear. So it is not a net cost to taxpayers but a real savings of four \nto five times as much as the cost in the tax credit.\n  Secondly, on jobs. Everyone is talking about jobs. We have to have \nmore jobs in this country. Well, each 1 billion gallons of biofuels \ngenerates anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 jobs--a broad range. So if we \ngo from 13 billion gallons today to 36 billion gallons in 2022, that \nwould generate over 400,000 permanent jobs--400,000 permanent jobs. \nThat is not to mention the number of construction jobs that would be \nneeded during the building of the facilities.\n  Now, two other things about market problems. Right now, we have a \nproblem in terms of the number of cars that can be flex-fuel. Every car \nthat General Motors makes in Brazil is flexible fuel. Every car Ford \nmakes in Brazil is flexible fuel. Every car Honda makes in Brazil is \nflexible fuel. They can burn anything from gasoline to 85 percent \nethanol--E85. So why aren't they doing it here? The cost is minimal.\n  The second thing is to get blender pumps--pumps at gas stations--that\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\ncan take ethanol and blend with gasoline at any mixture you want and \nthen can be put in that flex-fuel car. So we need two things: We need \nmore flex-fuel cars, and we need more blender pumps. Very low cost, \nvery easy to install.\n  Senator Lugar and I have repeatedly introduced legislation to \naccomplish this, and that ought to be a real part of this Energy bill \nwe are bringing up a motion to proceed to on Wednesday.\n  Lastly, let me get to the issue of net energy. This is a red herring \nthat comes up all the time. People say it takes more energy to produce \nethanol than we get out of it. We have been hearing this for about 30 \nyears, and it is simply not true. It is like the old Will Rogers \nsaying: It is not what we don't know that hurts us, it is what we know \nthat ain't so. And what we seem to know that isn't so is that it takes \nmore energy to produce ethanol than we get out of it. That is factually \nincorrect.\n  Take gasoline for example. Think about gasoline in terms of net \nenergy payback. For every unit of energy going in, how much do we get \nout? For gasoline, it is .813. In other words, we get less energy out \nof the gasoline than we have used to drill for the oil, pump the oil, \ntransport the oil, refine the oil, get the gasoline, and pipe the \ngasoline. All that takes energy. That plus the energy in the resource \nmeans the net energy payback for gasoline is at about .813. For ethanol \nit is 1.42.\n  Now why is that? Why would we get almost half, again, as much as \nenergy from a unit of ethanol than we put into it? Very simple. The \nenergy that is in the biofuels comes from the Sun when it is growing, \nand that is free. That doesn't cost anything.\n  This figure also takes into account the energy used to make the \nfertilizer, the energy in the diesel fuel for the equipment, the energy \nused in harvesting, and the energy in conversion and transportation. \nThat is all figured into this, and we still get 1.42 units of energy \nfor every unit of energy going into ethanol.\n  Now, that is just the ethanol. We know when we take the ethanol out \nof certain biofuels--say corn--there is something called distillers \ndried grain left over which we can feed to the livestock. If we take \nthat into account, and allocate some of the input energy to those \nbyproducts, then we get over two times the energy output for every unit \nof energy we put into ethanol. But I will not go there. I am just \ntalking about using the ethanol that we would put into a car where we \nwould get a net payback. So, again, we have heard for the last 30 years \nabout how ethanol takes more energy than we get out of it, and that \njust isn't so.\n  So, as I say, Mr. President, on Wednesday, the motion to proceed to \nthe Energy bill, that is fine. I am going to support that. But I want \nto make it clear there have to be major changes in the bill before I \ncan support it, and one of the major changes is that we need to make \nsure we have a strong biofuels section in that bill.\n  The second issue that is coming up on Wednesday that I want to \ndiscuss is the Paycheck Fairness Act. Again, this is something I and a \nlot of others have been working on for a long time. I say the real \nleaders on this have been Senator Mikulski and Senator Dodd. They have \nled the charge on this for a long time.\n  In 1963 we passed the Equal Pay Act, which said a woman had to be \npaid the same as a man for the same job. In other words, if you had the \nsame job, same job description, you couldn't have any pay differential. \nThat went into effect in 1963. However, all of these years later, right \nnow, a woman earns 77 cents on the dollar compared to what the man \nmakes. There is a differential even if we talk about different jobs. \nAnd why is that? Well, it is because, quite frankly, this wage gap \nbetween men and women basically has been ignored lately, and we have \nbuilt in a kind of infrastructure that lends itself to women being sort \nof shortchanged. Studies done by the Academy of Management Perspectives \nin 2007 tried to explain the difference as to why women are making only \n77 cents on the dollar compared to what a man makes.\n  Race accounts for 2.4 percent--that is interesting--whether they were \na member of a union--organized labor--experience, and then the industry \ncategory or what industry you were in might explain the difference. For \nexample, the construction industry would be more heavily dominated by \nmen than women. Then the occupational category--the occupational \ncategory itself. I have always said truckdrivers tend to be men not \nwomen. So the occupational category, that explains a lot of the \ndifferential.\n  The point is that 41.1 percent was unexplained. It could not explain \nwhy there was a difference between what a woman makes and what a man \nmakes. What is the difference? Well, quite frankly, the difference is \nthe gender. The gender gap is what it is. No other thing, nothing else \nexplains it other than that.\n  The other thing we have to understand is that today two-thirds of \nmothers are major contributors to the family income. Almost 40 percent \nare the primary breadwinners. Think about that: 4 out of 10 mothers are \nthe primary breadwinners for their families, and 24 percent are \ncobreadwinners. In other words, the husband and wife are both working \ntogether. About 36 or 37 percent are other factors. In other words, \nthey may be a third or something like that because of maybe part-time \nwork or other things.\n  The fact is, that is not what Congress intended when we passed the \nFair Pay Act back in 1963. We wanted to close that gap. Yet 47 years \nlater we still have this gap. So the Paycheck Fairness Act would \nstrengthen the penalties for discrimination. It would give women the \ntools they need to identify and confront unfair treatment. It would \nfund education programs designed for women and girls to support and \nempower them. It would increase training, research, and education to \nhelp the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission respond to wage \ndiscrimination claims more effectively.\n  Again, these are steps that are meant to make the Equal Pay Act of \n1963 more meaningful. We had a lot of bills in the past on civil \nrights, but it wasn't until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that we \nactually put teeth in it and made those previous laws something that \nmeant something. So, Mr. President, we can't afford to kick the can \ndown the road any longer on the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  On the heels of the Paycheck Fairness Act is what I call the Fair Pay \nAct. I have been introducing this bill every year since 1996. In every \nsession of Congress since 1996 I have introduced the bill. It is \nbasically to understand the gap that occurs--this gap here--in this \noccupational category. You see, there are a lot of women who work at \njobs that require as much education and training as a man's job, but it \nis in a different category.\n  For example, millions of female-dominated jobs--such as social \nworkers, Head Start teachers, childcare workers, nurses, nurse \nassistants, long-term care assistants in our long-term care \nfacilities--are equivalent in skills, effort, responsibility, and \nworking conditions to similar jobs dominated by men, but they pay a lot \nless. Again, this is inexcusable, and that is why I have introduced \nthis Fair Pay Act in every session of Congress since 1996.\n  The Fair Pay Act would require companies to publish their job \ncategories and their pay scales. It wouldn't require a company to say \nwhat each person is getting paid, it would just say they have to \npublish their pay scales and their job categories. That way people \nwould know what their contemporaries are making, or at least a range of \nwhat they are making.\n  I asked Lilly Ledbetter when she appeared before our committee a \ncouple of years ago if the Fair Pay Act had been in existence when she \nwas discriminated against would she have been in a better position. She \nsaid yes; she would have known then that she was being unfairly paid \nless than what her contemporaries were. So, again, that is why we have \nto move ahead on the Fair Pay Act. We can't forget that there are \nmillions of women who work very hard--they care for our elderly, they \ncare for our kids, they teach our kids, in many cases they are daycare \nworkers, nurse assistants, and they do extremely important work. What \nwould we do without them? But because they are categorized as women's \njobs, they are paid a lot less. For example, take the difference \nbetween a truckdriver and a nurse. They both require about the same \namount of skills, education and training and physical\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\nability--about the same amount. Yet a truck driver is making much more \nthan a nurse makes. Why is that?\n\n  We tend to think of truckdrivers as big burly men but, you know, with \npower steering and power brakes and some other machinery, it does not \nrequire a lot of muscular effort anymore. But a nurse, who has to turn \npatients over--that requires physical effort also. That is one example \nof the disparity we have in our society.\n  We have to end this categorization that certain jobs are women's jobs \nand therefore we can pay them less. I daresay a truckdriver is an \nimportant part of our society. You make no bones about it. But so is a \nlong-term care assistant taking care of our grandparents, or someone on \nan Alzheimer's unit, or a person who is taking care of our kids in the \ndawn of their life when they are in daycare centers. They do important \nwork, vitally important work. They should not be discriminated against \nany longer.\n  I hope we will move forward on these two bills. As I said, the third \nbill is the food safety bill. I am hoping we will move forward on that \nalso and that we can finish that bill by the end of the week. We \nreported this bill unanimously out of our HELP Committee November 18 of \nlast year. There was not one ``no'' vote against it. Frankly, I daresay \nif we can bring the bill out on the floor--I am just wagering--I bet we \nget 90 votes. But there is a small group on the Republican side that is \nbasically filibustering the bill. I am hopeful in good faith, working \nwith Senator Enzi, Senator Burr, Senator Gregg, and others on our side, \nwe can break this logjam and we can get the food safety bill through \nthis week. It is so vitally important. As I said, it has broad \nbipartisan support. We worked hard to keep it that way. We have \nindustry support and consumer groups support. Certainly it is vitally \nimportant to the health and safety of our country.\n  Our food safety laws have not been upgraded in 30 years. Think about \nthe changes that have taken place in the way we grow food and ship food \nand prepare it compared to what it was 30 years ago.\n  Again, I am hopeful we will be able to bring that up and pass it, not \nonly the motion to proceed but the bill itself, sometime this week.

MARGARET BURROUGHS AND BISHOP ARTHUR BRAZIER\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, every day we walk the hallowed Halls of \nthe U.S. Capitol, a building filled with statues, busts, and paintings \nhonoring great Americans--Lincoln, Washington, Dr. Martin Luther King \nJr., names we will never forget because they are the individuals who \nbuilt and altered the foundation of this country.\n  But we must also never forget to recognize those Americans who may \nnot appear in our history books but whose contributions have helped \nwrite our American story, great Americans like Dr. Margaret Burroughs \nwho became a legend in her own time.\n  Dr. Margaret Burroughs is a true American treasure--an artist, \nadvocate, poet, and progressive. She celebrated her 93rd birthday this \nmonth and today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring her.\n  Born in Louisiana before women could vote, Dr. Burroughs moved to the \nsouth side of Chicago when she was five, eventually studying at both \nEnglewood High School and Chicago State University.\n  Politically active from an early age, Dr. Burroughs and classmate \nGwendolyn Brooks joined the NAACP Youth Council, and her ambitions only \ngrew from there.\n  She taught art at DuSable High School for 23 years, and taught \nhumanities at Kennedy King College for over a decade.\n  For most, a 30-year career teaching thousands of students would be \nenough. But for Dr. Burroughs, her life in education was just one part \nof her story. This extraordinary woman always opened her doors to \nfriends and colleagues. Her coach-house flat became a social center, \nwhich many called ``little Bohemia.''\n  She worked tirelessly to establish the South Side Community Art \nCenter, opening in 1940. And she nursed her growing interest in the \narts by studying at the Art Institute of Chicago where she earned her \nmaster's of fine arts in 1948.\n  An established painter and printmaker in her own right, Dr. Burroughs \nbegan exhibitions in 1949, showing her work all over the United States \nand abroad.\n  She was generous enough to gift several of her works to my daughter, \nand several more adorn the walls of my Home and Senate offices in \nChicago.\n  When she founded the DuSable Museum of African-American History in \n1961, Dr. Burroughs established herself as one of the outstanding \ninstitution builders of her generation.\n  Once again, Dr. Burroughs created a place for people to come \ntogether. The museum that began on the ground floor of her Chicago home \nis now located in Washington Park and has become an internationally \nrecognized resource for African-American art.\n  Dr. Burroughs served as a director of the museum she founded until \nher appointment as a commissioner of the Chicago Park District in 1985.\n  She has always been committed to the progressive cause, and she has \nbeen a prolific writer over the long course of her rich lifetime.\n  Dr. Burroughs contributed to ``Freedomways,'' a publication founded \nby W.E.B. Du Bois and Paul Robeson, both heroes of hers. She served as \nart director for the Negro Hall of Fame. She has illustrated a number \nof children's books. She is an accomplished poet, with poems that \ntriumph African and African-American culture. And she served as an \nearly and often lonely pioneer of black awareness, her writings \nprovided a beacon of hope for a younger generation.\n  Her paintings, poems and prints alone make Dr. Margaret Burroughs an \nimportant part of American history.\n  But her desire to pass knowledge, hope, and inspiration to future \ngenerations means Dr. Burroughs will also be a significant part of the \nfabric of our nation.\n  Tens of thousands of African Americans have been touched by her art, \ntaught in her classrooms, motivated by her words, and inspired by the \ninstitutions she helped create.\n  In her 1968 poem, ``What Shall I Tell My Children Who Are Black?,'' \nshe writes about how we can encourage future generations of African \nAmericans.\n  And as she celebrates 93 years on this Earth, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in thanking her for her service. We know that her life's work \nwill long be remembered by future generations: an extraordinary life of \nan educator, an artist, a poet, and an inspiration.\n  Likewise, I would like to present a eulogy for a second great \nAmerican.\n  Many towering figures of American history have walked these halls, \nleaving their legacy written across our shared history. And one \nAmerican whose life and work have made a deep and indelible mark on \nthis Nation is Bishop Arthur Brazier, who passed just last month after \na lifetime of leadership.\n  Those who knew the Bishop personally called him ``one of our nations \ngreat moral lights,'' ``a stalwart of the city of Chicago,'' ``father, \nleader, and friend.''\n  Bishop Brazier was born and raised on the South Side. After just 1 \nyear at Phillips High School, he dropped out to find work and was \npromptly drafted into the army where he served as a staff sergeant in \nIndia and Myanmar, then known as Burma. Discharged in 1945, he returned \nto Chicago where he met his future wife.\n  At the age of 26, Brazier was baptized. He took a job as a mail \ncarrier but felt a deep urge to preach. So he began studying at night \nat the Moody Bible Institute, a place at which my wife served as a \nprofessor, and in 1952 became pastor of the Universal Church of Christ.\n  Eight years later, he merged his congregation with that of the \nApostolic Church of God in Woodlawn where he was the pastor for more \nthan 48 years--building a congregation of over 20,000 members.\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\n  For decades, Bishop Brazier fought gangs and crime and pushed for \nmore affordable homes and better schools.\n  As founding president of The Woodlawn Organization--a group aimed at \nshepherding his South Side community through racial unrest and \nneighborhood upheaval--he opposed plans by the nearby University of \nChicago to expand, which would have displaced residents and use land he \nanticipated developing into low-income housing.\n  Bishop Brazier taught the people of Chicago and perhaps the people of \nthe United States to always look forward instead of looking back, \nsaying: ``I do not think it behooves us well to keep talking about the \npast. The American theme is not the America of history.''\n  All Americans can benefit from such a profound legacy. The life of \nBishop Brazier is a story of expanding equality and opportunity, of \npeople and institutions grappling with social change and striving to \nlive up to the promises of equality they innately know belong to them.\n  Because of Bishop Brazier we are reminded to care for the poor, to \nfocus on spiritual strength rather than material wealth, and that we \ntoo can make a difference in our communities.\n  Bishop Brazier's passing has no doubt left a void in the American \nlandscape. But because of his life, his sacrifice, and his great \nservice, we have the foundations for a better tomorrow.\n  My prayers are with his wife Isabelle Brazier; his son Bryon Brazier; \nhis three daughters, Lola Hillman, Janice Dortch and Rosalyn Shepherd; \nand the countless family members and friends who loved and followed \nthis great man.\n  Mr. President, it is a great honor and privilege that I stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and speak on behalf of these two great Americans, \nthese great Chicagoans and Illinoisans who have done so much for our \ncity, our State, and our Nation. It is my hope and prayer, as my \nparting words to this U.S. Senate, that these individuals will be \nmemorialized in the archives of this great body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, The Senate has come back to a full-throated \ndebate about the comparative benefits of the tax policies of George W. \nBush and Barack Obama. We turn on our cable TV these days and hour \nafter hour there is a great deal of analysis of which approach is \nbetter on one factor or another. I want to take a few minutes today to \npoint out that I think that debate misses the point because either of \nthose tax approaches--of George W. Bush or President Obama--in my view \nwould anchor our country to an insanely complicated, job-killing, \nthoroughly discredited tax system. I think what is important is that \nthe Senate begin work moving toward a tax system that can create, as I \nput up here and will walk the Senate through, at least 2 million new \njobs per year.\n  The fact is, in this discussion comparing the George W. Bush policies \nand\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nthe policies of President Obama, one side may end up winning, the other \nside goes away unhappy, but under either approach the taxpayers of this \ncountry will lose, will continue to lose as a consequence of this \nflawed and discredited tax system. For example, under either approach--\nunder policy advanced by President Obama or the ideas George W. Bush \nsaw enacted into law--we would still have 3.8 million people working \nthe equivalent of full time, trying to comply with our tax law. Under \neither of those approaches, that of President Bush or President Obama, \nwe would still have Americans spending 7.6 billion hours complying with \ntax law at the cost of $200 billion a year. That is why I say the \ntaxpayer loses under either of those approaches.\n  How can you make the case to the American people, whether they are in \nIllinois or Oregon or anywhere else, that you want to anchor them to a \nsystem that is not doing enough to create jobs, certainly will not give \nus the opportunity to create 2 million new jobs, and on top of it will \nforce 3.8 million people to work the equivalent of full time to comply, \nracking up 7.6 billion hours and the expense of $200 billion annually, \nsimply to comply?\n  The question is, is there a better choice? I submit this afternoon \nthat there is a far better choice and it has bipartisan roots. The \nbetter choice is to pick up on the work that Democrats and the late \nPresident Reagan did in the 1980s when they came together. A Chicagoan, \nyou will recall, was very involved, the late Dan Rostenkowski, and he \nsaid the enemy is not the other party. The challenge is to go after the \nscores and scores of special interest tax breaks that are tax \nexpenditures, really tax earmarks as I would call them, that consume \nhundreds of billions of dollars and keep us lowering the rates for the \nmiddle class and small businesses and those who manufacture in the \nUnited States.\n  I think the relevant comparison is not George W. Bush against Barack \nObama. The more relevant measure is what happened when Democrats and \nRonald Reagan worked together in the 1980s, as opposed to what happened \nbetween 2001 and 2008 when tax policy was partisan. Let me lay out for \nthe Senate those specific numbers.\n  When Democrats and Ronald Reagan worked together to reform the Tax \nCode in the 1980s, payrolls expanded by 17.6 percent and the economy \ngrew by 16 million jobs. By contrast, when tax policy was partisan, \nbetween 2001 and 2008, there was 2.3 percent payroll expansion, 3 \nmillion new jobs, and real median income fell by 5 percent. So why in \nthe world would it make sense to go back to the tax policies where, \nwhen you look at the numbers in terms of payroll expansion, new jobs \nand real median income, growth was not what the people of Illinois and \nthe people of Oregon and the people across our land ought to expect.\n  I am of the view, now that the people of this country have spoken \nthat they want to see this Senate create more real good-paying jobs and \nfix problems, the first thing we ought to do is look at what worked. We \nespecially ought to look at it when it has bipartisan roots, as we saw \nin the 1980s with Democrats and Ronald Reagan. I believe that Congress \ncan now, picking up on what they did during that time--clean the \nclutter from the Code, broaden the tax base and lower tax rates to give \nthe people of this country a simpler and fairer tax.\n  Also, in the 1980s, by cutting marginal income tax rates--and again \nthis was Democrats, some of the most stalwart Democrats in the history \nof our party: Dan Rostenkowski, Dick Gephardt--stalwarts of the \nDemocratic Party worked with Ronald Reagan to cut marginal income tax \nrates to create more jobs and more investment, rather than handing out \ntax preferences to special interest groups. A quarter century later we \nfind ourselves, today, with a tax system that you can only describe as \na mess, a dysfunctional mess where even specialists in business in and \nIRS regional offices have trouble sorting out the implications of what \none provision or another would mean.\n  Given the fact that since the last time Congress moved in to drain \nthe tax swamp--given the fact it has been a quarter century, Senator \nGregg and I--he, of course, is the ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee--spent more than 2 years, and our staffs week after week, \nseeing if we could come together and put forth a bipartisan tax reform \nbill. We have done that. I am very pleased to be able to report this \nafternoon that the two chairs of the Deficit Reduction Commission, \nErskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, said that a version of what we \nproposed--certainly not all the things we would agree with but a \nversion of our proposal--should be one of the options considered by the \ncommission and considered for the country to debate.\n  Given that, I want to take a few minutes and outline some of the key \nprovisions we pursued in our bill. It is S. 3018. We all know that \nanybody having any trouble sleeping at night can wade into a tax bill \nand you can conk pretty quickly, but S. 3018 is an attempt to pick up \non some of the most important policy work done, in my view, by the \nSenate led by Democrats and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. What Senator \nGregg and I do is end scores of preferences so as to be able to give \ntax breaks to the vast majority of working families instead of handing \nthem out to a small number of narrow special interests who have \nincredibly talented lobbyists who can spend their day outside the \nSenate Finance Committee room. We take away those breaks and use that \nmoney to give real tax relief to millions of working class families.\n  We take a special initiative to focus on job creation that will make \nus more competitive in tough global markets. I want to take a minute to \ndescribe exactly how this works. I am sure that when the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate goes to a supermarket in Illinois, as I have in \nOregon, one of the first things somebody will say, when you start \nvisiting about the work of Congress, is take away those tax breaks for \nthe businesses that are going offshore. Go get rid of those. They will \nsay that to the distinguished Senator from Illinois and myself and \neverybody else. You hear it every single day in any coffee shop, any \ngrocery store, where people are talking about government and politics.\n  Then of course we go out and visit with our companies and the \ncompanies say: We have to have those tax breaks because America has the \nsecond highest rate in the world. If we do not have those tax breaks \nfor doing business overseas, we are going to lose out on jobs here in \nthe United States because some of that work our firm does overseas \nhelps create jobs here in America.\n  We know from those conversations we have had in Illinois and Oregon \nthat our blue collar people don't buy that; they don't buy that for a \nsecond. They want to have the tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas \nwiped out. What Senator Gregg and I did--and this lasted many months--\nis we said to the companies: How can we work with you to take away the \ntax breaks for doing business overseas so you can use those very same \ndollars to lower the tax rates for small businesses and manufacturers \nthat operate in the United States and have dollars for tax relief for \nthe middle class.\n  As a result of that, we arrived at a policy that takes away the tax \nbreaks for doing business overseas but we lower the tax rate \ndramatically for manufacturers and small businesses that operate in the \nUnited States.\n  Our big businesses are called C corporations. Most businesses of \ncourse pay taxes as individuals or partnerships or limited liability \nfirms, but for our biggest companies when they manufacture in Illinois \nor Oregon or anywhere else in the country, in the United States, we \nlower their taxes from 35 percent to 24 percent, creating a dramatic \nnew incentive for manufacturing and business in the United States that \ncan let our companies be more competitive in these tough global \nmarkets.\n  We all understand that a firm in Illinois or Oregon is not just \ncompeting against another State a few hundred miles away, we are \ncompeting against China and India. I think this provision that Senator \nGregg and I have laid out in our proposal--a modified version of that \nhas been recommended by Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson--is one that can \nbring our country together, bring our parties together. Senator Gregg, \na Republican; myself, a Democrat, worked for several years on this with \nbusiness folks, with labor folks.\n  When I talk to labor folks--and I have at length--about taking away \nthe tax breaks for doing business overseas\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nand using that so we can have a rebirth of American manufacturing, they \nsay that is the kind of tax cut for business I can be for. We have to \nbring back manufacturing. Manufacturing is not just a basic industry, \nit is a national security priority. I think the approach Senator Gregg \nand I have proposed, a version of which the deficit commission has \npicked up on, is the path to use.\n  The Heritage Foundation--and I will confess that I do not quote the \nHeritage Foundation every single day here on the floor of the Senate, \nalthough I have a great deal of respect for their professionalism--said \nthe approach that Senator Gregg and I have produced will create 2 \nmillion new jobs per year. In fact, they said it would create 2.3 \nmillion new jobs per year, increase disposable income for a family of \nfour by $4,000 per year, and boost the real gross domestic product by \nan average of $298 billion per year.\n  So the point is, at a time when we have been through a heated and \ncertainly contentious election, I think there is an opportunity to move \nforward, and particularly on what has been a central concern of the \nAmerican people, which is creating more jobs, having an economic system \nthat lets us compete in these tough global markets, and helping our \npeople to get ahead, helping all of our people to get ahead.\n  If there is one theme in what Democrats and Ronald Reagan did in the \n1980s and what Senator Gregg and I seek to do now, it is let us have a \ntax policy that gives everybody a chance to get ahead. If you are \nsomebody in Illinois and Oregon, and you did not have much in the \nbeginning of your life, we want policies that will give you a chance to \nget ahead. If you have been fortunate enough through your hard work to \nbe successful, we want policies that will make that possible as well.\n  That was done when Democrats and Ronald Reagan cooperated in the \n1980s. And, boy, what an unlikely group of people, President Reagan, a \nrancher, a star in the movies, working with Senator Bill Bradley of New \nJersey. He has a lot better jump shot than me, but I also know the \nvalue of teamwork. So there is another tall Democrat on the Senate \nFinance Committee who would like to work on bipartisan tax reform.\n  We have an excellent chairman, Chairman Baucus, and Senator Grassley. \nThey have already had one hearing on this issue. There is a lot to work \nwith on this tax reform issue. By the way, there is another group in \naddition to Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson who have weighed in \nessentially behind the ideas Senator Gregg and I are talking about.\n  President Obama had a tax reform commission that recently came in--it \nwas chaired by the distinguished Paul Volcker--that made a very \nsubstantial case for simplifying the Tax Code to ease the burden on \nworkers and families and businesses.\n  Senator Gregg and I looked at the Volcker Commission proposals, \nending the alternative minimum tax, increasing the standard deduction, \nconsolidating incentives for savings and retirement, allowing taxpayers \nto ask the IRS to fill out their tax forms for them. Those were all \nrecommendations by President Obama's commission, the Volcker \nCommission, that are part of the proposal that Senator Gregg and I have \nput together, now 318: get rid of loopholes, get rid of the giveaways \nto special interests, and you can keep down rates and provide tax \nrelief to the vast majority of workers and families and businesses.\n  In closing, there is a recipe for economic growth that is available \nto the Senate, a recipe for economic growth that has already been shown \nto work. What Democrats and Ronald Reagan did in the eighties proved \nthat bipartisanship can create economic growth, help stimulate the \ncreation of badly needed jobs, and rein in the deficit.\n  So why in the world would we want to pass up the opportunity on a \nbipartisan basis to drain the tax swamp? Why would we pass up the \nopportunity to clean the tax house? Do we want to say this--and this is \ntrue. This is key to the discussion we are going to have all through \nthis session if we go with either the approach of George W. Bush or \nBarack Obama. We will continue to see the full-time work of 3.8 million \npeople doing 7.6 billion hours to comply with the tax law at a cost of \n$200 billion a year.\n  Would not the people of Illinois--I know they certainly feel this way \nin Oregon--rather see $200 billion devoted to real progress in this \ncountry, improving our roads and bridges and our transportation system, \nand creating a public education system that is going to let us get \nthose high-value, high-wage jobs and compete in these tough global \nmarkets? And you will have money left over to reduce the deficit which, \nof course, is why all of this was attractive to Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson because they head up something called the Deficit Commission. \nObviously, there is another big cost to all of this, this tax mess; \nthat is, to the morale of our citizens and their sense of fairness.\n  Because this tax system is so insanely complicated, ordinary \ntaxpayers make mistakes, they overpay their taxes, they underpay their \ntaxes, they get audited. But they are very much aware that the \nsophisticated taxpayer can go out and employ a legion of lawyers and \naccountants, and if that does not work, they will get lobbyists to kind \nof play around with their loophole and avoid taxes. That is not fair, \nand the ordinary taxpayer knows it.\n  Even with their savings and home equity tapped out, we know hard-\nworking middle-income folks will pay their fair share. But they sure \nresent the tax system that rewards elaborate tricks. I am of the view \nthe message from this election is for Democrats and Republicans to get \ndown to work, and the Tax Code is a good place to start.\n  I said to folks in Oregon during the campaign, I do not believe \neither party has a monopoly on good ideas. I am prepared to work with \nanybody in the Senate with a good idea for moving us forward, \nespecially when we can create 2 million new jobs per year.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to begin this special postelection \nsession this way is that I think on this tax issue, what is especially \nstriking when we are having this intensely partisan debate about how to \ngo about keeping a discredited tax system, there is something out there \nthat will produce more good-paying jobs and could be bipartisan. So the \nreal work on taxes for this special session seems to me to create a \nbridge to real tax reform, a bridge to tax reform that works. The Tax \nCode is so complicated today that the typical person cannot even use \nthe relief that is given to them.\n  Each Spring the Internal Revenue Service publishes something called \nthe annual ``oops list.'' This is the list of the 10 most common \nmistakes that taxpayers make when they are filing. That ``oops list'' \nreleased in March included President Obama's Making Work Pay tax credit \nwhich was created to boost the economy and give working Americans a \ncredit worth up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples. Yet this \nyear's ``oops list'' reported that many of the people who worked in \n2009 could not figure out how to claim the Making Work Pay credit on \ntheir 1040 EZ form. That is not easy enough. In fact, if you and I \nwalked the streets of Illinois and Oregon and asked anybody about the \nstimulus legislation, virtually no one would think that there were \nhundreds of billions of dollars' worth of tax relief in that bill.\n  They would say to the distinguished President of the Senate, as they \nhave said to me, that was a spending deal. It is called the stimulus. \nThere was not any tax relief in it. The system was so complicated that \neven with hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of tax relief in it, \npeople could not sign up for it, people could not figure it out, and it \nmakes the ``oops list'' for the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The Chair has been patient, this afternoon. I close simply by saying, \nI believe it is time to clean house as the Congress did in the 1980s \nworking with President Reagan, purge this spider's web of tax breaks, \nkill the special interest goodies, and hold down the rates so that \neverybody can get ahead.\n  Let the small businesses, as Senator Gregg and I advocated, expense \nall of their equipment and inventory costs in a single year, freeing up \ncapital so they can expand and create jobs. Let's limit the dead weight \ncost of taxes as the Heritage Foundation said in their report, \nindicating our bill would create 2 million new jobs.\n  Our 1040 form is 27 lines long--27 lines long. Back when we started \nthis push, one of the financial magazines, one of the best known \nmagazines, had some of their people, for a typical taxpayer, fill out \ntheir taxes with a form\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nthat was like ours. It took them 40 minutes.\n  Think what that is going to do to change Americans' springtime when \neverybody is filing their returns in April. Talk about family values. \nWe could actually get people a little more time with their families \nrather than filling out all of these forms and Turbo Tax and everything \nelse.\n  This is going to be an important session that begins today, and \nnobody is sure exactly how long it is going to last. But what we know \nis that there is going to be an extensive discussion about taxes, and I \njust hope our colleagues will zero in on the fact that under either of \nthese approaches that are being discussed, that of George W. Bush or \nthat of Barack Obama, either of them will anchor this country to a \ngrotesquely complicated, job-killing, discredited tax system.\n  We can do better. We know we can do better because in the 1980s, with \nleadership from a Republican President and Democrats in Congress, we \ndid better. It created millions of new jobs. We can do it again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7884-S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the late \nSenator Stevens as we prepare to travel to Arlington Cemetery to lay \nSenator Stevens to rest. Today, Janet's and my thoughts and prayers are \nwith the Stevens family and the others who died, were injured, or had \nloved ones on that tragic plane trip.\n  Senator Stevens was the first senator Alaska knew. His tenure lasted \n40 years in this Chamber. I am proud to have served with him for 10 of \nthose years, most closely on the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee. During his time in the Senate, he was chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nchairman of the Ethics, Rules and Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nchairman of a number of subcommittees and President pro tempore of the \nSenate. He was the embodiment of an effective Senator and leader as he \nfought every day for Alaska.\n  It was an honor to serve with Ted and amazing to think that his \nservice in the Senate was only part of a life of service. He was \ninstrumental in Alaska achieving statehood. He was a Harvard Law School \ngraduate. He was an U.S. attorney in Fairbanks. He flew cargo over the \nHump and into China during the Second World War. He was a decorated war \nveteran, part of America's Greatest Generation. He was a prostate \ncancer survivor and an advocate for research and funding to find a \ncure. He was an inspiration to all and an example of what one \nindividual can do if he puts his nose to the grindstone and gets to \nwork.\n  I was able to get to know Senator Stevens on the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee where I got to see his great love of \nAlaska and the Senate, which you saw everytime he would speak about his \nfellow Alaskans, as he worked to assist all Americans, whether \nAlaskans, Louisianans, Ohioans, or others, respond to natural \ndisasters. I will never forget Ted standing up at our Police and \nSteering Committing lunches and telling it like it is and showing his \nknowledge, experience, and common sense. When he talked, everyone \nlistened. I regret that his voice is absent from the Senate at this \ncritical time in our Nation's history. I also saw his strength as he \nworked to prepare all of us against the threat of terrorism.\n  Senator Stevens always strove to do what was best for his home State \nof Alaska and the United States. You could be sure that if legislation \nwas good for Alaska, Ted Stevens would support it regardless of the \npolitics. We need more politicians today who are willing to do what is \nright regardless of party. His friendship and work with Senator Inouye \nshould be a model for us all.\n  He was a lion of the Senate. While Ted is gone, his legacy will live \non. You see it here with his former colleagues and his former staffers. \nYou see it in the legislation he championed, such as title 9, \nlegislation on the Olympics, aid to rural Alaska, telecommunications, \nand, of course, his unwavering support for our military.\n  May God bless Senator Stevens, his family and all who held, and still \nhold, him dear.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we remember the life of our friend, Ted \nStevens, and celebrate his remarkable service to our country, each of \nus must surely remember a number of personal experiences which have \nhelped us appreciate how much his friendship meant to us.\n  I first met Senator Stevens during the Senate election campaign of \n1976. He was serving as chairman of the National Republican senatorial \ncommittee, and I had just won the Republican nomination to be a \ncandidate for the U.S. Senate in Indiana. The senatorial committee was \nnot as affluent in 1976 as presently, but Ted Stevens was able to steer \na contribution into my campaign and to offer words of encouragement \nwhich included my first knowledge that he had been born in my hometown \nof Indianapolis, IN, on November 18, 1923.\n  In the days to come, I discovered, additionally, that he had attended \nSchool No. 84 and Shortridge High School. I began my elementary school \neducation at School No. 84 and graduated from Shortridge High School in \n1950. Later, I learned of the early struggles that Ted Stevens had in \nsupporting relatives in Indianapolis and the challenging family \ncircumstances that caused him to leave Indiana prior to graduation from \nShortridge, but I always pointed out to Hoosiers that Ted Stevens was \ntruly one of us.\n  The 1976 Senatorial Republican Campaign brought eight new Republican \nSenators to the U.S. Senate. Although we were only a total of 38 in \nthat session, Ted Stevens became the Republican whip in January of 1977 \nand continued to serve in that capacity through 4 years of a distinct \nRepublican minority and 4 more years of a glorious Republican majority \nduring the first term of President Ronald Reagan.\n  Following the Presidential and congressional elections of 1984, a \nsuccessor to Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee was elected by the \nRepublican caucus. Senator Baker had elected to retire after a most \nsuccessful tenure as majority leader of the Senate, and five candidates \nappeared to seek the Republican majority leader position.\n  The Republican caucus rules did not encompass such a large field, and \nI remember a meeting of the five candidates--Senator Robert Dole, \nSenator Ted Stevens, Senator James McClure, Senator Pete Domenici, and \nmyself--to agree upon how the balloting would progress. At an informal \nafternoon session, we agreed that after the first ballot the candidate \nwith the lowest vote would drop out and such a procedure would follow \nafter each of the ballots until a majority occurred with the deciding \nballot between the final two candidates. The voting was held in the Old \nSenate Chamber, and after the first two ballots, Senator McClure and \nSenator Domenici had left the field. I lost out on the third ballot, \nand Bob Dole defeated Ted Stevens in a close vote for majority leader.\n  Ted was undaunted and preceded to chair the Appropriations Committee \nwith essential vigor and comprehensive activity. His chairmanship \nlasted from 1997 to 2005 with a short break of 18 months during which \nDemocrats controlled the U.S. Senate. His efforts on behalf of Alaska \nare legendary, and it was not surprising that Alaskans named Ted \nStevens the Alaskan of the Century in the year 2000.\n  At Republican Tuesday luncheons, Ted Stevens often gave comprehensive \nreports about legislation before the Appropriations Committee, which he \nfelt vital to Alaska and the United States, and we all became much \nbetter acquainted with Alaska through his comprehensive tutorials. I \nadmired the vision which he had for Alaska and for the position of \nAlaska as a part of vital foreign policy consideration with Russia, \nChina, Japan, and the entirety of the Pacific Ocean Basin. He \nunderstood the important role which the Arctic Circle area would play \nin world history and the importance of giving proper and timely \nattention to a part of the world that was not normally the subject of \nour Senate debate.\n  As President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate from January 2003 to \nJanuary 2007, Ted Stevens was extraordinarily conscientious not only in \nthe opening ceremonies of the Senate each day but\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\nin managing the appearance of that office with attention to detail and \ncommendable diplomacy.\n  Although he sometimes displayed a choice of sharp words and even some \nshort public displays of temper, I appreciated that each conversation I \nenjoyed with him was businesslike, friendly, and educational.\n  I did not have the privilege of serving on the major committees which \nTed chaired, but I did enjoy, especially, our work on the Arms Control \nObserver Group. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan, anticipating \nintensive negotiations with the Soviet Union over potential reductions \nof nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, appointed a \nbipartisan Arms Control Observer Group to proceed to Geneva, \nSwitzerland, and monitor what were anticipated to be spirited and \nproductive negotiations. The Arms Control Observer Group would then be \nin a position to lead the debate on the Senate floor to obtain the two-\nthirds majority needed for a historical arms control agreement with the \nSoviet Union.\n  Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Robert Dole were appointed to the \ngroup along with other Senators such as Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and Sam \nNunn, who made substantial contributions to consideration of the \nnegotiations with the Soviets over many years.\n  Ted and his wife Catherine took the assignment so seriously that they \nrented an apartment in Geneva anticipating that they would stay and \ncontinue to monitor the negotiations even after the Senators had \nreturned to their normal debates on the Senate floor.\n  Unfortunately, negotiations did not proceed rapidly and, as a matter \nof fact, took several years to reach maturity. But Ted Stevens remained \na thoughtful and vigilant observer in Geneva, in Washington, and in \nother places on Earth where his acute observations and comments were \nespecially important.\n  As former Senator Sam Nunn and I formulated the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program which was adopted by the Congress \nin 1991, Ted Stevens was a strong supporter of our efforts, and many of \nmy conversations with him centered upon the methods of verifying all \naspects of the treaty and further steps we could take with the Soviet \nUnion, and then later, Russia, to provide increasing safety for all \nAmerican cities and military installations.\n  I was visiting South Bend, IN, on the day that news of the tragic \ndeath of Ted Stevens flashed around the world. That night, I told all \nof the local correspondents that were following my activities that Ted \nStevens was a son of Indiana, a student in two of the public schools in \nIndianapolis that had meant so much to both of us, and a remarkable \nchampion both for his adopted state of Alaska and for our country. I \nwill always be grateful for the friendship we enjoyed and the wonderful \nmemories of that friendship that remain so vivid at this moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7885-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Kenneth K.

McAninch of the U.S. Army and Logansport, IN.\n  Staff Sergeant McAninch was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 506th \nInfantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY. He was \n28 years old when he lost his life on October 21, 2010, while serving \nbravely in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Paktika Province, \nAfghanistan. He was serving his third tour of duty.\n  A native Hoosier, Kenny attended Lewis Cass Junior-Senior High School \nin Walton, IN. His principal described Kenny as ``one of those kids who \nalways worked hard to get things done.''\n  Staff Sergeant McAninch enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2005. A \ndecorated soldier, his awards include the Joint Service Commendation \nMedal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, \nArmy Good Conduct Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Staff Sergeant McAninch was a devoted husband, father, and son. I \njoin his family and friends in mourning his death. He is survived by \nhis wife, Shawnna McAninch; his children, Jeremiah, Braxton, Brayden, \nColby, and Shyanne; his father, Marvin McAninch of Logansport, IN; and \nhis mother, Cheryl Nance of Peru, IN.\n  We take pride in the example of this American hero, even as we \nstruggle to express our sorrow over this loss. We cherish the legacy of \nhis service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SSG Kenneth K. McAninch in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and \nfor his commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7885-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7885-S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the coming months, the Supreme Court of \nthe United States will consider Federal Communications Commission v. \nAT monumental Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, case that could \nvastly expand the rights of corporations to shield their activities \nfrom public view. Like many Americans who deeply value openness, \ntransparency and accountability in our government, I urge the Court to \nreject efforts to broaden the personal privacy exemption to FOIA to \ninclude corporate information.\n  A decade after Congress first enacted the Freedom of Information Act, \nCongress created an exemption to this law for law enforcement records \nthat contain sensitive personal information. The so-called ``personal \nprivacy exemption'' for law enforcement records--FOIA exemption 7(C)--\nallows the government to withhold information contained in its \ninvestigatory files that ``could reasonably be expected to constitute \nan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''\n  By creating this exemption, Congress intended to shield from public \ndisclosure sensitive personal information about individuals who may be \nmentioned in government files. However, Congress never intended for \nthis exemption to apply to corporations.\n  The legislative history for the personal privacy exemption makes \nclear that Congress intended for this exemption to protect an \nindividual's right to privacy. Indeed, when the Senate debated this \nexemption in May of 1974, Senator Philip Hart, who drafted the personal \nprivacy exemption, remarked that ``the protection for personal privacy \nincluded in [the exemption] . . . is part of the sixth exemption [to \nFOIA] in the present law. By adding the protective language here, we \nsimply make clear that the protections in the sixth exemption for \npersonal privacy also apply to disclosure under the seventh exemption. \nI wish to also make it clear, in case there is any doubt, that this \nclause is intended to protect the privacy of any person mentioned in \nthe requested files, and not only the person who is the object of the \ninvestigation.''\n  Former Senator Roman Hruska also confirmed that Congress intended for \nthe exemption to address individual privacy rights. Regarding the \npersonal privacy exemption, he said ``we are dealing in this matter \nwith what I believe to be the most important rights, and in some \nrespect the most important rights, an individual may possess, his right \nto privacy, and his right to personal safety.'' The universal \nunderstanding that the personal privacy exemption pertains only to the \nprivacy rights of individuals is further confirmed by the remarks of \nformer Senator Strom Thurmond, who noted during the Senate debate that \n``[a]ll of us are aware of the general feeling permeating the country, \nthat our citizens want to know what their Government is doing . . . \nHowever, by the same token, we are also concerned about a mutual \nproblem of invasion of an individual's privacy.''\n  During the more than four decades since the Congress enacted the \npersonal privacy exemption to FOIA, our Federal courts and Federal \nagencies have consistently interpreted this exemption to apply only to \nindividuals.\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\nOver the years, the Congress--with the full knowledge of how the courts \nhave interpreted this exemption--has never amended this exemption, nor \ncalled into question the universally held view that the exemption \nprotects the personal privacy rights of individuals.\n  Given the clear legislative history and the longstanding case \nprecedent in this area, I am deeply troubled by recent efforts to \nvastly--and I believe improperly--expand the scope of this exemption to \nreach corporations. While I do not quibble with the notion that certain \ncorporate information should be exempt from public disclosure, I firmly \nbelieve that Congress has provided meaningful and adequate protections \nfor sensitive corporate information in other parts of FOIA. Indeed, \nCongress specifically enacted FOIA exemption 4 to protect trade secrets \nand other sensitive corporate information from public disclosure. \nTellingly, American corporations have successfully relied upon \nexemption 4 for decades, to safeguard their sensitive business \ninformation when it is shared with the government.\n  I fear that vastly expanding the personal privacy exemption for law \nenforcement records would close a vital window into how our government \nworks. I also fear that extending this exemption to corporations would \npermit corporations to shield from public view critical information \nabout public health and safety, environmental dangers, and financial \nmisconduct, among other things--to the great detriment of the people's \nright to know and to our democracy.\n  As Senator Hart wisely noted during the debate of the 1974 FOIA \namendments, ``survival for a society such as ours hinges very \nimportantly on the access that a citizen can have to the performance of \nthose he has hired.'' I sincerely hope that our Nation's highest Court \nwill carefully consider these words and that the Court will narrowly \nconstrue the personal privacy exemption, consistent with congressional \nintent. Should the Court decide to do otherwise, I will work with \nothers in the Congress to ensure that FOIA, and specifically the \npersonal privacy exemption for law enforcement records, remains a \nmeaningful safeguard for the American people's right to know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7886-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, women are the backbone of the American \nfamily and a driving force of our economy. They are our mothers, \nsisters, wives, and daughters. Women are the heart of American families \nand local communities.\n  October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and this October \nwe have many reasons to reflect and celebrate. Thanks to the concerted \nefforts of the public and private sectors, we have come a long way to \nensuring that women have long, healthy lives.\n  Twenty years ago, Congress created the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program. Today, the program provides screening \nservices for breast and cervical cancer in all 50 States, the District \nof Columbia, five U.S. territories, and 12 American Indian or Alaska \nNative tribes and tribal organizations. Since the program got started, \nalmost 4 million women have been served--giving them access to breast \nand cervical cancer screenings that they otherwise could not afford.\n  We have recently expanded opportunities for women across the country \nto be screened by including free preventive care, like mammograms and \ncervical cancer screenings, in the new health care reform law. The \nAffordable Care Act eliminates all insurance copays for these \nscreenings, which means more women will have access to early detection \nand more women's lives will be saved.\n  This October, we are also celebrating the 30th anniversary of the \nbeginnings of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, an organization founded on \nSusan's sister's promise to end breast cancer forever. Today, Susan G. \nKomen for the Cure is the largest source of nonprofit funds dedicated \nto the fight against breast cancer, investing nearly $1.5 billion in \ngrassroots advocacy for quality care and research.\n  These efforts have made a big difference. In the last 30 years, we \nhave improved the rate of cancer screenings--increasing the percentage \nof women over 40 who receive regular mammograms from less than 30 to \nnearly 75 percent. We have improved the treatment outcomes for women \nwith cancer--increasing the 5-year survival rate from 74 percent to 98 \npercent. We have also increased the amount of Federal funding going \ntoward breast cancer research, prevention, and treatment--ensuring that \nAmerican women benefit from the best that science has to offer.\n  Despite these advances, it is estimated that nearly 40,000 women will \ndie of breast cancer this year. That means that 40,000 American \nfamilies will lose their mother or grandmother, sister or daughter. We \ncannot let up in this fight. We made a commitment to improving women's \nhealth in health reform--ending insurance industry abuses that have \ndisproportionately affected women for decades, providing preventive \nbenefits tailored to meet women's unique health needs, and ensuring \nwomen of all ages have access to comprehensive, high-quality coverage.\n  Improving women's health has a positive effect on the whole family. \nAccording to the Department of Labor, women make four out of five \nhealth care decisions for their families and are more likely to be the \ncaregivers when family members are ill.\n  Improving women's health also has a positive effect on the economy. A \nhealthy pregnancy, for example, begins with a healthy woman and leads \nto long, productive lives for mother and child.\n  We have come a long way, but we are not there yet. I am confident \nthat with the consistent efforts of Congress and private sector groups \nsuch as Susan G. Komen for the Cure, we will continue to make progress \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7886-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7886-S7887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN DIABETES MONTH.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of November \nas American Diabetes Month. National studies estimate 23.6 million \nAmericans have diabetes and a quarter of people with diabetes do not \nknow they have this disease. The State of South Dakota is home to \nnearly 40,000 diabetic adults, a figure which does not take into \naccount the number of people who are undiagnosed, who are living with \nprediabetes, or those under age 18 who have child-onset diabetes, which \nis a growing problem linked to the increase of childhood obesity.\n  American Diabetes Month focuses on increased awareness of the disease \nand its risks. The disease carries with it an increased rate of heart \ndisease and stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, and \namputation of the lower extremities, among other associated health \nproblems. As the prevalence of diabetes increases, we are beginning to \nunderstand the costs to both our citizens' health and to our economy. \nThe high costs to our government in direct medical and indirect costs, \ncoupled with the personal costs of rising health care coverage and \ntreatment, make diabetes control and prevention a national priority.\n  Throughout my career in the U.S. House and Senate, I have strongly \nsupported initiatives that would advance research, funding and \neducation about diabetes, such as those conducted at the National \nInstitutes of Health, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive \nand Kidney Diseases, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  Two special funding programs hold great promise in our efforts to \nprevent and cure diabetes among South Dakotans and our Nation at large. \nThe Special Funding Program for Type One Diabetes Research provides \nadditional funding for the National Institutes of Health to expand its \njuvenile diabetes research efforts. The program has funded clinical \ntrials to test various drugs and therapies, increased understanding \nabout reversing complications from the disease, improving our ability \nto predict risk of development, and helped develop new technologies for \ntreatment.\n  I also am a proud supporter of the Special Diabetes Program for \nIndians, SDPI, which has addressed the high incidence of diabetes among \nNative Americans for the past 13 years by providing grants to tribal \nand urban Indian programs to create or enhance diabetes prevention and \ntreatment efforts. Through SDPI, the Indian Health\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nService has helped reduce diabetes-related complications, improve \nglucose and blood pressure levels and increase participation in \ntreatment programs throughout the Native American population. Despite \nthese advances, SDPI has found the incidence of type 2 diabetes among \nIndian children is steadily rising; as a result, they have developed \nplans to increase early education and prevention efforts in schools.\n  This year, Congress achieved comprehensive reform of our Nation's \nhealth care system. This historic legislation will improve access to \nquality, affordable health care for all Americans and help our country \nbetter manage the treatment and cost of chronic diseases. Given the \ncost of diabetes to American's personal finances and our economy, it is \nclear that increased awareness and funding for diabetes education and \nprevention should be a priority. I am pleased health care reform \nrecognizes the significant impact of diabetes to our nation and \nincludes efforts to specifically target the disease, including the \ncreation of a National Diabetes Prevention Program.\n  American Diabetes Month provides us an opportunity to learn more \nabout this disease, raise awareness about effective prevention \nstrategies, encourage additional funding for research, and address the \noverall impact of diabetes on our Nation and our families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7887-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7887-S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I \nbelieve the new Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, is the \nright leader at the right time, and this timely bill will provide him \nthe authorities he needs to do this job well.\n  The bill provides the DNI streamlined personnel management \nauthorities throughout the intelligence community, including the \nauthority to convert contractor positions to government jobs, move \npersonnel from one agency to another, provide annual assessments of \npersonnel levels for each agency, harmonize language training in \ndifferent agencies, and conduct performance evaluations of personnel \nthroughout the intelligence community.\n  It provides the DNI streamlined oversight for major acquisitions--\nperhaps most critically, to provide for interoperable information \ntechnology systems in different intelligence agencies--and strengthened \nbudget authorities for his management of the intelligence community.\n  Beyond these improved DNI authorities, which I believe will \nsignificantly improve intelligence integration among the 16 agencies of \nthe intelligence community, this bill also makes three substantial \nimprovements in the independent oversight of intelligence. This \nconstructive oversight is necessary to ensure that secret intelligence \nactivities are legal, effective, and serve the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  First, the bill establishes a Senate-confirmed inspector general for \nthe intelligence community who will have the authority to inspect any \nelement or activity in any intelligence agency. Inspectors general play \nan important troubleshooting role in all agencies of our government, \nbut nowhere is this role more important than in the intelligence \ncommunity, where--unlike in government agencies whose activities are \npublic--problems can often escape scrutiny.\n  For instance, in 2004 the CIA inspector general's report on the CIA \ndetention and interrogation program played a significant role in \nalerting the executive branch and the congressional Intelligence \nCommittees to significant problems with the program.\n  The new intelligence community inspector general that this bill \nestablishes will complement and supplement the important work of the \ninspectors general of individual intelligence agencies.\n  Second, the bill provides for access by the Comptroller General and \nthe Government Accountability Office to information regarding \nintelligence activities. This access will be similar to the GAO's \naccess to the Department of Defense's Special Access Programs. I \nbelieve that this agreement between Congress and the administration on \nthis GAO provision bodes well for future cooperation on intelligence \nissues.\n  On that note, the third--and, I believe, most important--improvement \nthis bill makes to the independent oversight of intelligence activities \npertains to congressional oversight.\n  Constructive congressional oversight of intelligence activities is \ncrucially important--both for our national security and our national \nidentity. We are a transparent democracy, and there is a natural \ntension between transparent democracy and secret intelligence \nactivities.\n  The Congressional Select Intelligence Committees--which consist of \nrepresentatives of the American people, selected from other specific \ncongressional committees with jurisdiction over foreign policy, defense \nand judiciary issues--are vital to resolving that tension between \ndemocracy and secrecy.\n  Simply put, these committees act as a board of directors who verify \nthat secret executive actions serve the interests of the shareholders--\nthe American people.\n  That is why title V of the National Security Act of 1947 requires the \nPresident to keep the congressional Intelligence Committees ``fully and \ncurrently informed'' on all intelligence activities.\n  However, during the time that I was chairman and vice chairman of the \ncommittee from 2003 through 2009, I became very concerned about the way \nin which the executive branch interpreted this obligation. Rather than \nbriefing the full committee, the executive branch restricted briefings \nabout certain classified programs to the chairman and vice chairman \nonly.\n  These restrictions impeded our oversight of these programs. This is \nnot an academic issue; it is crucial to how our democracy makes secret \nnational security decisions. Without the intelligence committees' \nmeaningful independent review and oversight--the very reason for the \ncommittees' existence--intelligence programs are more susceptible to \nboth mistakes and illegitimacy. This is the case regardless of which \nparty is in the White House or which party has a majority in Congress.\n  With this in mind, last year I offered an amendment to this \nauthorization bill that will establish in statute new requirements \nregarding congressional notification. My intent was to strengthen the \ncommittees' constructive oversight relationship with the executive \nbranch and the intelligence community.\n  A bipartisan majority of the committee approved my amendment. While \nthis provision has undergone some changes in the process of Congress's \nconsideration of this bill over the past year, the key elements of \nthese new notification requirements remain. The bill that the President \nwill soon sign into law requires that:\n  (1) the congressional Intelligence Committees and the President must \nestablish written procedures regarding the details of notification \nprocesses and expectations;\n  (2) the President must provide the committees written notice about \nintelligence activities and covert actions, including changes in covert \naction findings and the legal authority under which an intelligence \nactivity or a covert action is or will be conducted;\n  (3) the President must provide written reasons for limiting access to \nnotifications to less than the full committee, and in such cases, \nprovide the full committee a general description of the covert action \nin question; and\n  (4) the President must maintain records of all notifications, \nincluding names of Members briefed and dates of the briefings.\n  I strongly believe that congressional oversight of the executive \nbranch's intelligence activities should not be adversarial; it should \nbe a true, trusted and confidential partnership aimed exclusively at \nimproving our Nation's collection and analysis capabilities, and \nensuring the effectiveness and legitimacy of our covert action \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\n  I think these new requirements for congressional notification are an \nimportant step toward such a partnership.\n  These new requirements--and this authorization bill as a whole--are \nthe result of hard work and difficult negotiations after years of \npartisan divisions on intelligence issues.\n  The President has not signed an authorization bill into law since \nDecember 2004, and the last time Congress passed an intelligence \nauthorization bill was February 2008, when I was chairman of the \ncommittee. Unfortunately, President George W. Bush vetoed that bill \nbecause it banned the use of coercive interrogation methods by any \nagency of our government, and the bipartisan majorities that passed the \nbill were not large enough to overcome the President's veto.\n  After all these difficult years, the bill that we are sending to the \nPresident today is exemplary of the bipartisan cooperation that is \nabsolutely necessary for our intelligence community to perform as well \nas we need it to perform.\n  I want to commend my Intelligence Committee colleagues, particularly \nChairwoman Dianne Feinstein and Vice Chairman Kit Bond and their staff, \nfor sticking to it and completing the difficult negotiations with the \nadministration and the House that brought this bill across the finish \nline.\n  This law will make our country more secure. Let us continue to build \non this effort in the months and years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7888-S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the granddaughter of a teacher and \nas a parent, education is one of my passions and priorities. So I rise \ntoday to commemorate the start of American Education Week, which seeks \nto shine a light on the importance of providing every child in America \nwith a quality education so that they are prepared to contribute to our \nNation's future as adults. Further, American Education Week gives each \nof us an opportunity to celebrate the good things that are happening in \nour schools, rededicate ourselves to help schools improve where \nimprovement is needed, and to honor the parents, educators, students, \nand education support professionals who strive to do their best to \nensure that every child receives a quality education each and every \nday. Each of the next 4 days will celebrate a different partner in the \neducation of our children.\n  Tomorrow, American Education Week will focus our attention on our \nchildren's first and most important teachers--their parents. In my own \nState of Alaska, parents' contributions to their children's education \nis so important that we have been called to observe the entire month of \nNovember as Parental Involvement Month. This observance is intended to \nencourage all Alaskans to recognize the importance of and encourage \nparental involvement in school improvement and student achievement. \nOther States have proclaimed other months to be Parental Involvement \nMonth. Why? We know instinctively, the day our children are born, that \nwe are responsible for shaping their future. Everything we do \ninfluences our children and whether or not they grow up to love \nlearning. When we read to our children before bedtime, as we teach them \ncolors, shapes, right, and wrong, and the value of hard work and \nhonesty and as we help them with homework, book reports, and college \napplications, our voices and examples are the strongest influences in \ntheir lives. If our children see us checking out books for ourselves at \nthe library, if we volunteer at their school and participate in making \ntheir school better, they learn from our example that their education \nis important. If we have high expectations for our children and \nconsistently communicate that, our children can fulfill their \npotential. Our children want to rise to our expectations. So I call on \nall of my fellow parents to fulfill your children's expectations of \nyou.\n  On Wednesday, the focus of American Education Week will shift to \nthose too often overlooked individuals who play such important roles in \nour schools--the education support professionals. These are folks who, \nday after day and for little pay and less recognition, keep the cogs \nrunning smoothly in our schools. They keep our children safe, guide \nthem in their behavior, give out hugs, and provide help when things get \ntough during the day. Take a moment, Mr. President, to look back on \nyour own school days. Think of the schoolbus driver who made sure \neveryone was seated and reasonably quiet on the way to school or who \nwould wait as you ran to catch the bus. Think of the nurse who took \ncare of you and called your mom that day you had a fever or the lunch \nlady who made sure you took a helping of vegetables and didn't forget \nyour milk. Sometimes, if you forgot your lunch money, she would give \nyou lunch anyway if you promised to pay tomorrow. One stern look from \nany of these good people would set your feet back on the right path, \nand you loved them for it, just as many children love their teacher's \naide who can explain that thorny math problem better than the teacher \nor the specialist who helps them overcome a physical or learning \nchallenge. Remember, on Wednesday, to think of these good folks who \nshaped your life, and think good thoughts for those who do so now \nacross our great Nation.\n  On Thursday, community leaders are invited to come into our Nation's \nclassrooms and serve as educators to get a glimpse of what the job is \nreally like. We have all been to school, and we have all known many \nteachers. Being a teacher looks easy, but it isn't. Teachers need to \nknow how to reach every child, excite every child about learning, and \nhelp every child fulfill his or her potential. The best way to do those \nthings is different for every child. Mr. President, we all remember our \nfavorite teachers, and if we traded stories they would go like this: I \nhad this teacher once who was so hard and expected so much, but he \ncared about me, and he was the best teacher I ever had, or, I had a \nteacher who really knew what I was about and she really helped me learn \nthat year. Boy, was her class hard, but I loved that teacher. Teaching \nis both a skill and an art. It is hard work, and it is often thankless \nwork. Too often a classroom will include children who come to school \nunprepared to learn or who are dealing with serious problems at home. \nBut every single teacher across this Nation wants just one thing--to \nhelp every single one of their students to learn. On Thursday, think of \nyour favorite teachers and thank them and make a wish that every \nstudent across America has a teacher who is inspiring, skilled, caring, \nand kind.\n  On Friday, American Education Week calls on us to honor a different \nkind of educator. They are too often overlooked, forgotten, or, \nfrankly, given a really hard time. I am referring to the substitute \nteacher. Those hardy, brave souls who go into a different classroom \nevery day to help educate our children deserve our thanks and \nrecognition. Often called before dawn to cover for a teacher who is \nunexpectedly ill, they can teach kindergarten one day and high school \nmath the next. The best of them have one common characteristic--they \ncan settle a classroom full of strangers down with a glance and inspire \ntheir temporary students with a word. Their stories are the stuff of \nlegend. There was the sub who learned in the nick of time that one of \nher students brought a stink bomb to class because he knew there would \nbe a substitute that day. There was the substitute who learned her \nstudents' goal of the day was to make her cry, and she did, but she was \nback in class with the students after lunch. Then there was the sub \nwhose first day on the job was taking 28 7-year-olds on a field trip to \nthe zoo. Substitute teachers must be disciplined but caring. They must \nbe flexible but adhere to routine. They need thick skin and a great \nsense of humor. I admire them tremendously.\n  While American Education Week does not specifically highlight the \nschool principal, I am pleased and proud to honor our Nation's \nprincipals here today as well. Whatever role the principal plays, from \ninstructional leader, head of maintenance, chief disciplinarian, \nfinancial guru, and even part-time recess monitor, the school \nprincipal's ability to impact the success of the school cannot be \nunderestimated. The most important of those roles, however, must always \nbe that of instructional leader. Everyone in the school community, from \nstudents to the superintendent, from parents to future employers, \nrelies on the principal to run an effective school in which students \nlearn. The skill set for being a\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nprincipal is not the same as for a teacher. A principal must be able to \nset the agenda for learning for not only the students but for teachers \nand other staff as well. He or she is in charge of not only the safety, \nwell-being, and future of the children in the school but must also \nguide and inspire the staff. The principal must be a diplomat, bring \nthe community into the school, satisfy the taxpayer, and meet the needs \nof the school. The principal must mediate, command, and inspire any \nnumber of groups on any given day. The best of them are often taken for \ngranted because everything just works. So I encourage my colleagues and \nthe Nation to include in their appreciative thoughts this week our \nschools' hard-working, multitasking educational leaders--our Nation's \nprincipals.\n  In closing, as my colleagues here in the Senate consider, applaud, \nand recognize the hard work of the many Americans who work every day to \nmake our schools the best, I would also encourage them to do their \npart. As you know, the Senate HELP Committee continues to work toward \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I look \nforward to continuing and completing that work next year. We know that \nthis law's goal is to help ensure that every single child in every \ncommunity across the country has the opportunity and the tools to \nsucceed, that is, that every child will fulfill his or her potential \nregardless of wealth, ethnicity, disability, or location. We all want \nthat. Regardless of our views on the role or the degree of the role the \nFederal Government should play in our Nation's schools--whether we \nthink Federal funding should come with the strings of accountability or \nnot and to what degree--I hope we can all agree on one thing, and that \nis the proud tradition of bipartisanship we and our predecessors have \nachieved when it comes to education issues. We may disagree about our \npoints of view, but in the end the final product is one most of us have \nbeen able to support.\n  I hope that as we observe American Education Week and in the days and \nmonths to come our Nation's children as well as the adults can look \nback at us with pride and say we got something good done for the \ncountry through civility, cooperation, bipartisanship, and a genuine \nlove for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7889-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COL MICHAEL J.

Jensen is set to \nretire. His dedication and tireless devotion to the service of our \ngreat country is without question. I extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to COL Mike Jensen.\n  Colonel Jensen was born in Estherville, IA. He attended and graduated \nfrom Estherville Community High School in 1975, received an associate \nof science degree in computer science from Iowa Lakes Community \nCollege, a bachelor of arts degree in business management from Buena \nVista University, and a master's degree in public administration from \nDrake University. Colonel Jensen also attended General Staff College, \nwhere he was the distinguished honor graduate.\n  Mike Jensen enlisted in C Battery 1st Battalion 194th Field Artillery \non June 14th, 1979. He was commissioned a second lieutenant, Field \nArtillery, in June 1982 and graduated from the Iowa Military Academy \nOfficer Candidate School at Camp Dodge in Johnston, IA. Duty \nassignments over his career include a number of positions in the 1-\n194th Field Artillery, 34th Infantry Division; Recruiting and \nRetention; the Secretary of General Staff; and Director of Military \nSupport. In 2006, Colonel Jensen assumed his current position as the \nCommander of the Counterdrug Task Force, Iowa National Guard.\n  Over his admirable military career, Mike Jensen received a number of \nawards and decorations, including seven awards of the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, \nthe Army Achievement Medal, and the Army Reserve Components Achievement \nMedal. Colonel Jensen is also an accomplished outdoorsman and avid \nfisherman.\n  Congratulations again to COL Michael Jensen. The Iowa National Guard \nwill no doubt miss his daily contributions; however he continues as a \nmodel of honorable and distinguished service to his country. I thank \nhim for his unwavering commitment to Iowa and to the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7889-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE VOICES OF UNITY YOUTH CHOIR\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I honor the Voices of Unity \nYouth Choir of Fort Wayne, IN, for outstanding achievement this past \nyear at the sixth World Choir Games in Shaoxing, China.\n  The Voices of Unity Youth Choir was the first Indiana choir invited \nto participate in the World Choir Games, the world's largest choir \ncompetition. Known as the Choir Olympics, this year's contest featured \nmore than 400 choirs comprised of 27,000 singers from 80 countries \naround the world.\n  One of only six American youth choirs invited to China, Voices of \nUnity won gold medals in two musical categories: popular choral music \nand gospel and spiritual. In addition, these Hoosiers won the title of \nWorld Grand Champion in the gospel and spiritual category.\n  Voices of Unity benefitted tremendously from the support of the Fort \nWayne community who gave time and money to ensure these students had \nthe opportunity to travel to China and share their talent with the \nworld. In just 5 short months, Voices of Unity raised enough money to \nsend 101 students and volunteers to China for the competition.\n  I particularly want to recognize Marshall White, founder of Unity \nPerforming Arts Foundation, the home of Voices of Unity, for his \ntireless leadership.\n  I am honored to congratulate the World Champion Voices of Unity Youth \nChoir of Fort Wayne for this extraordinary achievement and for the \nteamwork, discipline, and hard work it takes to become \nchampions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7889-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7889-S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HELEN McKINNEY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Helen \nMcKinney. I join with her family and many friends in mourning her \npassing. Helen has been a great source of support and encouragement to \nme and many others. The peace of mind that Helen provided me and others \nis immeasurable. Helen took on challenges with good humor and cheer. \nHelen had passion and strength that far exceeded her physical presence. \nHer energy and enthusiasm were inspiring. She was a steadfast, giving, \ndriven, kindhearted, and focused leader. She was very firm but tactful.\n  Throughout her life, Helen was a hard worker. She has rightly been \ndescribed as being able to do everything. When you look at the variety \nof jobs and tasks she took on, this could not be more accurate. In the \n1940s, she worked in the newspaper business. Helen also taught junior \nhigh. In the 1970s, she directed the Caldwell Chamber of Commerce. \nHelen served in the Idaho House of Representatives. She also was a \nmember of the Idaho Judicial Council. Additionally, Helen is widely \nknown for her efforts with the Canyon County Republican Party. Helen \nserved as regional chair. She also served as a national convention \ndelegate and State and precinct committeewoman. Her great service and \nhard work have been recognized through her induction into the Idaho \nRepublican Party's Hall of Fame.\n  No matter the task, Helen did her work very well. She was \nstraightforward, diligent, and determined. Helen had an abundance of \nlight and intelligence of hope in her eyes. She was serious and paid \nattention to details. However, she never lost her sense of humor, and \nher positive outlook dominated her personality. When Helen spoke, \npeople listened. She also did not hide her talents. She openly shared \nand mentored others. She was bold in defending her principles, but she \nwas also gracious. Helen truly reflected Idaho values and the \nconstitutional values of a land she loved so much.\n  I will greatly miss Helen, and I will never forget her thoughtful \nsupport and genuine example.\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7890-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON SHELBY\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of \nour Nation's finest local newsmen and a Minnesota legend, Don Shelby, \nwho is retiring after 32 years of service as a pioneering anchor, \nbroadcaster, and reporter for WCCO in the Twin Cities.\n  A native of Royerton, IN, Don first arrived in Minnesota in 1978. But \nfor those of us who tuned into him every night for our news, it is as \nif he has always been one of us.\n  When he first assumed lead anchor duties for the 10 p.m. newscast, \nDon had the tall task of replacing another Minnesota institution, Dave \nMoore, who had anchored the WCCO news desk for nearly 50 years. But \nDon's passion for bringing Minnesotans the stories that traditionally \nwent unreported quickly made him a fixture on our television sets and \nin our hearts.\n  Don never forgot his roots as an investigative journalist. And he has \nnever been one to just sit at the anchor desk and read the news.\n  Don is an intrepid reporter who will go to the ends of the Earth to \nbring his story home. Whether it was trekking to the Arctic with Will \nSteger, walking the beaches of Prince William Sound to expose the \nlasting damages caused by the Exxon Valdez oilspill, or traveling to \nIraq to document the unprecedented service of our Minnesota National \nGuard troops, Don has brought the world home to living rooms across \nMinnesota.\n  Don's professional compass has guided him to what is important and \naway from the temptations of tabloid journalism and the ``if it bleeds, \nit leads'' sensationalism that too often dominate our news cycles \ntoday.\n  Minnesotans have benefited from Don Shelby's spirit of public service \nand commitment to journalistic values. For Don, it is never just about \nreading the headlines--it is about helping inform his viewers about the \nworld around them.\n  Just one example of this was his trailblazing ``Project Energy'' \nseries--with accessible, informative news reports on our energy future, \nincluding renewable energy, climate change, conservation, \ntransportation alternatives, and much more. In short, Don represents \npublic service journalism at its best.\n  Of course, it isn't just reporting that drives Don. There is also his \never-expanding list of hobbies, from mountain climbing, to bass \nfishing, to organic gardening, to playing guitar, and on and on. Don's \nintellectual curiosity knows no bounds.\n  For more than three decades, Minnesotans have turned to Don Shelby \nbecause they have trusted his experience and honesty.\n  While he has never been elected to public office, it is fair to say \nthat he has become one of Minnesota's senior statesmen. And he became \none by simply asking the important questions and telling the truth--\nwith compassion, decency, and dignity.\n  So when Don signs off from his final broadcast this month, we will \nmiss him dearly, but we can take comfort in knowing that our State is a \nbetter place because of his work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7890-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MARCUS CORPORATION\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I recognize the 75th \nanniversary of the Marcus Corporation. Not only does this month mark a \nmonumental anniversary, it also gives us a time to look back at the \naccomplishments of the Marcus family.\n  Founded by Ben Marcus, the company opened a theater with just one \nscreen in Ripon, WI. This small business became the basis of the Marcus \nCorporation, a leading name in hotels and movie theaters in the \nMidwest. Your hotels, like the Pfister in particular, serve as \nbeautifully preserved landmarks, well-known meeting places, and home \naway from home for guests and employees alike. The Marcus family has \nconsistently recognized and credited the work of their employees for \nthe company's success, providing a rewarding environment for staff. The \ncompany has shown its integrity not only through its business \noperations but also in its contribution to the communities that house \nits theaters and hotels.\n  The Marcus Corporation has shared its success with the communities \nsurrounding its businesses through both financial contributions and \nextensive volunteer programs. Employees of the businesses are \nencouraged to give back to their patrons through volunteer hours at a \nlocal program or cause of their choice. In fact, to mark this special \nanniversary, the Marcus Corporation will collectively volunteer 75,000 \nhours of community service. Milwaukee organizations such as the United \nWay of Greater Milwaukee and the United Performing Arts Fund have \nbenefited from the company's generosity.

CLINE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, I recognize of retired MSG \nMichael P. Cline for his years of distinguished service with the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, \nEANGUS. His efforts as one of the longest serving executive directors \nin the military association community are to be commended, and I thank \nhim for his 38-plus years of military service to this country.\n  Mike has held the position of EANGUS executive director since 1990 \nand was selected as an honorary chief master Sergeant for the Air \nNational Guard in 1999. For the previous 11 years, he has also served \non the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Education. \nOver the years, he has also remained very active in the Military \nCoalition, TMC, a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services \nand veterans associations representing over 5.5 million members. In \naddition to being a founder of the TMC Guard and Reserve Committee, he \nserved as president of TMC for 5 years and codirector for 8 years.\n  Throughout his career of advocacy, Mike has worked tirelessly on \nbehalf of the U.S. military, as well as our servicemembers, veterans, \nand their families. In particular, he has frequently led the fight to \nensure that the men and women of our National Guard and Reserves \nreceive enhanced care and benefits that are more commensurate with \ntheir increased service to our Nation.\n  In recent years, Mike and EANGUS have been at the forefront of \nefforts to provide larger military pay increases, health care that is \nmore affordable for servicemembers and military retirees, enhanced \neducational benefits for servicemembers and veterans, and expanded \naccess to retirement benefits for the men and women of the National \nGuard. He also played an active role in securing legislation providing \nburial and retirement flags for reservists, drill pay for funeral \nhonors duty, increased health care benefits for reservists and \nretirees, and special compensation for severely disabled retirees.\n  Over the years, it has been a pleasure for me and my staff to work \nclosely with Mike on a number of issues of great importance to our \nNational Guard. In particular, we have worked to improve the readiness \nof our National Guard by providing greater access to medical, dental, \nand mental care for Selected Reservists. We have also called for an \nincrease in the Montgomery GI Bill rate for members of the Reserve \ncomponents and in the travel reimbursement for those traveling to drill \nduty. Additionally, we have championed legislation that would justly \ngrant full veteran status to members of the Reserve components who have \n20 years or more of service and do not otherwise qualify under law. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  Due in large part to the dedication, counsel, and passion of \nadvocates such as Mike Cline, the courageous men and women of our Armed \nForces and their families have seen a number of significant \nimprovements to their way of life in recent years. These efforts have \nalso strengthened our ability to recruit and retain more quality men \nand women to serve in uniform and have increased\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\ntheir readiness as an operational force in the continued defense of our \nNation.\n  I am extremely proud of Mike's long record of distinction and will \nalways be grateful for his service to our Nation and our military. \nAlong with my colleagues, I wish him all the very best in his \nretirement, and to EANGUS for its continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7891-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7891-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/15/senate-section/article/S7891-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7891-S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, the \nfollowing enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed on September 30, 2010, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the ActingPresident pro tempore (Mr. Reid):\n\n       S. 3304.

A bill to reform earmarking and increase transparency and \naccountability for all expenditures authorized by Congress and all \nexecutive agencies of the Federal Government, to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I need to tell Molly I have reduced the \nlength of my speech from 1 hour to 30 minutes because of something I \ntotally did not expect. However, I think it is going to have a happy \nending.\n  I think the bottom line in all this discussion of earmarks--or \nhowever you want to word it--is that we have to do something about \nexcessive spending. It is something we cannot continue. It is not \nsustainable. I think everyone agrees with that.\n  It is interesting for me when I see the President and the passage of \nsuch things as the $787 billion stimulus and all that to say we are \ngoing to form a commission to see how we can keep from spending so much \nmoney. Well, that is how you do it: You do not do things like that.\n  Let me say, first of all, after this election, the Tea Party did play \na big part in this thing. I have to say I was very excited about it \nearly on. I think I might have been the first Republican anyway to go \nto Marco Rubio and support him in his efforts down in Florida and \nseveral of the others. I think it is clearly a good thing, a change, \nand I think the American people have clearly spoken.\n  In spite of what you might have heard in the media, let me clear up \none thing. Never have I once had any indication of trying to influence \nanyone from voting for or against a ban on earmarks. You will find out \nin just a minute how I can come to this conclusion and why it would not \nbe necessary, and it does not make all that much difference.\n  But before I do, to make sure people understand, you are hearing \nthese comments not from any Member of the Senate but from someone who \nprobably, I would have to say, has been declared as the most \nconservative Member of the body more times than anybody else has, most \nrecently by the National Journal, and so you are hearing this from \nsomeone who is a conservative and someone who is also lonely.\n  I go back quite a ways, but I can remember my two favorite Senators. \nMy mentors, I guess I should say, were Jesse Helms and the Senator from \nNebraska, Carl Curtis. Both of them are deceased. It has been quite \nsome time since Carl Curtis was serving, but, nevertheless, I remember \nI was in the State senate--this was many years ago--and I was \nrecognized as a conservative at that time. Carl Curtis was\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\nserving here from Nebraska, and he is the guy, you might remember, who \nconsistently, year after year after year, introduced the budget \nbalancing amendment to the Constitution.\n  Well, he called me one day--this is back in the 1970s--and he said: \nInhofe, I know you and I share the same philosophy. But I can never get \nthis up for a vote. The excuse the liberals use is that you will never \nbe able to get three-fourths of the States to pass a resolution \nratifying a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  So his idea was kind of ingenious. What he said was: I will go ahead \nand get started and stand behind you, and we will find you and enough \nother States to make up three-fourths of the States, and we will \npreratify a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I did not understand how it would work, but we talked about it for a \nwhile. So I said: Well, let me try it. So I did. In the State senate we \npreratified a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It was \nkind of fun because after that I started going around to other States \nand getting them to do the same thing. We got up to within, I think, \nfour States of being able to do it before it started to unravel.\n  But a guy named Anthony Harrigan--he was a syndicated columnist from \ndown South someplace--wrote an editorial or an op-ed piece that got \npublished, and it was called ``A Voice in the Wilderness.'' He said: \nWay out in the State of Oklahoma there is one State legislator who is \ngoing to balance the Federal budget. So that was kind of the beginning \nof the kind of lonely ride I have had.\n  Since that time, I remember serving in the House of Representatives. \nJohn Nance Garner--this is 80 years ago--was the Speaker of the House. \nJohn Nance Garner devised a system. Here is the problem he had. People \nwere getting more and more informed on how people were voting in \nAmerica. So he had all his west Texas Members, and they did not want to \nvote for the liberal agenda of the Democratic Party. Can you see anyone \nfrom west Texas voting for gun control? It is not going to happen. So \nhe devised a system--it was kind of ingenious, corrupt but ingenious--\nand that was a discharge petition so that in the House of \nRepresentatives if you want to take up a bill, you have to have it \neither come out of a committee or, if it is in a committee, you have to \nhave a discharge petition, sign a discharge petition to force it to \ncome out. He wanted his Members to be able to say that they signed the \ndischarge petitions, yet they wouldn't sign them, so the bills would \nnever come out.\n\n  They kept the discharge petitions in a locked drawer, just like the \nPresiding Officer has, right up there in front of the whole House of \nRepresentatives, and you couldn't open the drawer unless you were \nsigning a discharge petition. You couldn't copy down the names of \nanyone else. What I did was set up a system where I had people go up \nand memorize names, and then I went ahead and just disclosed all of \nthis. Anyway, it is a much longer story than that, but the bottom line \nis that the punishment for doing what I did was to be expelled from the \nHouse of Representatives. I said: OK. That is fine. I will go ahead and \ndo it anyway. They can expel me. I will run. Who is not going to vote \nfor someone who was expelled because they shed light on the system? And \nit worked. It was declared by several publications as the greatest \nsingle reform in the House. Again, it was lonely, but it is something \nthat worked.\n  Then along came global warming. We all remember the Kyoto Treaty back \nthen. In fact, back during the Clinton-Gore years when it first came \nup, everybody thought it was something that would be ratified until \nthey looked at it to see what it would cost to do it, and the cost was \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion. So I looked at that. \nWe all looked at it and we thought, do we really want to ratify this? \nWell, as it turned out, we didn't. One reason we didn't was Senator \nByrd was the primary mover of a motion to stop it from happening unless \nthe developing countries had to pay the same price as the developed \nnations. Of course, they didn't do it, so it didn't happen. Then \nseveral people said: Well, let's just do it unilaterally.\n  We had the McCain-Lieberman bill of 2003 and 2005. At that time, I \nwas enjoying being in the majority. The occupier of the Presiding \nOfficer's chair today has never been in the minority, so he may not \nknow what I am talking about. But in the majority, you can do a lot \nmore things than you can as a minority. So I chaired the committee \ncalled the Environment and Public Works Committee. That committee had \njurisdiction over all the energy issues and a lot of other things but \nalso over this global warming issue.\n  I have to confess that I assumed back then--and this is back in about \n2002--that catastrophic global warming was a result of anthropogenic \ngases, manmade gases, CO2, methane and such, and I assumed \nthat was the case until the Wharton School came out with a study that \nconcluded that if we were to pass--at that time it was the McCain-\nLieberman bill--it would end up costing between $300 billion and $400 \nbillion.\n  So my effort then as chairman of that committee was, to look to see \nwhere the science was. That is when we got to the realization that it \nall started with the United Nations. They developed the IPCC--the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--and consequently they were \ngoing to do all this, and that was the science behind it. But we kept \ngetting complaints because I would make statements on the floor \nquestioning the science. Then scientists starting coming out, and the \nbottom line is this: After a period of time, up until a year ago right \nnow, it looked as if people recognized that it wouldn't do any good if \nwe did unilaterally pass it. Why is that? Even Lisa Jackson, the head \nof the Environmental Protection Agency, said that they would be--that \nif the United States alone passed something to stop the different \nemissions, CO2 emissions, it wouldn't have any effect \nglobally because that is just the United States doing it. In fact, one \ncould argue it would have just the opposite effect because companies \nseeking power would have to go to countries where they didn't have \nthese restrictions and it could actually increase CO2.\n  Anyway, the bottom line was that I made the comment--this has been \nnow 8 years ago--that the idea that catastrophic global warming is a \nresult of manmade gases is probably the greatest single hoax ever \nperpetrated on the American people. Back then, everybody hated me, and \nnow it looks as if we have pretty much won that argument.\n  I mention this because I am very much concerned--I understand the \nargument on both sides of the whole thing about the earmarks. I have--\nKay and I have 20 kids and grandkids. This little guy right here came \nup to me, and he said: PopI--``I'' is for Inhofe--he said: PopI, why is \nit you do things nobody else does? And I said: That is the reason--\nnobody else does. So that is kind of a little bit of the background as \nto why I got into this very difficult issue.\n  I have to say that it is something that needs to be talked about \ntoday because something is going to happen this week, and I think we \ncan turn this thing into something that is very good. The tea party \npeople came in. My concern has been over the last 2 years and longer \nthan that, that all we have heard about is people quite frankly \ndemagoguing this whole thing on earmarks, saying ``Earmarks, earmarks, \nearmarks,'' and all the time that happened, what happened? We ended up \nwith the President and the majority increasing the debt to $13.4 \ntrillion in America--and that is a larger increase than all Presidents \nfrom George Washington to George W. Bush combined--and at the same time \ngiving my 20 kids and grandkids a $3 trillion deficit. So we were \ntrying to look at this thing and say: How can we take care of this \nsituation? The increase in the debt is something that is not \nsustainable. I think we all understand that. I was going to try to \naccomplish two things--to stop the demagoguing and to solve the \nproblem.\n  Today, for that purpose, I have introduced--and it is at the desk \nright now--S. 3939. Now, I grant you that Senator McConnell's \nannouncement changed the way in which I was going to present this, but \nthe bottom line is this: It would be nothing short of criminal to go to \nall the trouble of electing great new antiestablishment conservatives \nonly to have them cede\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nto President Obama their constitutional power of the purse, which is \nexactly what would happen, as has been pointed out, with the moratorium \non earmarks.\n  I wish to read one statement out of Senator McConnell's remarks that \nI think is worth repeating.\n\n       With Republican leaders in Congress united, the attention \n     now turns to the President. We have said we are willing to \n     give up discretion. Now we will see how he handles spending \n     decisions. If the President ends up with total discretion \n     over spending--\n\n  That is what he would have--\n\n     we will see even more clearly where his priorities lie. We \n     already saw the administration's priorities in the stimulus \n     bill, and that has become synonymous with wasteful spending. \n     True. That borrowed nearly $1 trillion for administration \n     earmarks such as the turtle tunnels and the sidewalk that led \n     to the ditch and all this stuff about which we have been \n     hearing, which I will elaborate on in just a minute. But \n     nonetheless, I think that is important, and we have to look \n     at that.\n\n  Now, why I thought that was wrong--let's put up chart No. 1--was I \nthink that anytime you want to eliminate something, you have to define \nit first. The problem was that there was no definition until the House \ncame along--and this was about a year ago. The House Republicans--not \nthe whole House but the Republicans--and resolved that:\n\n       It is the policy of the Republican conference that no \n     Member shall request a congressional earmark, limited tax \n     benefit, or limited tariff benefit, as such terms are used in \n     clause 9 of Rule XXI of the House rules.\n\n  Well, if you look up that rule, that applies to appropriations. So \nwhat they were saying at that time is that they were not going to \nappropriate anything. But there is one problem with that.\n  Chart 2 is article I, section 9 of the Constitution. That is what we \nare supposed to be doing here. I will elaborate on that a little bit \nbecause I think it fits in this debate pretty well. Chart 2. Article I, \nsection 9 of the Constitution makes it very clear that we in the U.S. \nSenate and the House of Representatives are the ones who are supposed \nto be spending money: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but \nin consequence of appropriations made by law.''\n  All three of these people who were driving this thing--the Senators, \nby the way, who were involved in the earmark thing, giving proper \ncredit or blame depending on how you look at it--the first one who went \nback the furthest was Senator McCain, then Senator Coburn, and then \nmore recently Senator DeMint. They all embrace the House definition of \nearmarks. I have a chart that shows that, but it is not necessary to do \nit. I think everyone realizes that.\n\n  Let's go back to the Constitution. We have it right here. The \nConstitution restricts spending to only the legislative branches and \nspecifically denies that honor to the President.\n  We take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution. That means we \ntake an oath of office to uphold article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution. It is important that we elaborate on that Constitution \nbecause a lot of people--if you get this in your mind, if there is any \ndoubt that we are supposed to be doing it and not President Obama or \nthe executive branch, then listen to this. Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsaid:\n\n       It is the duty of the President to propose and the \n     privilege of Congress to dispose.\n\n  James Madison said:\n\n       The power over the purse in fact may be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress in every grievance . . .\n\n  Now, why is this? He went on to explain in the Federalist Papers and \nelsewhere that the reason--they called them the direct representatives. \nAt that time, I guess they didn't have Senators, but the direct \nrepresentatives should do the spending for two reasons. No. 1 is that \nthey are the ones who know their own State or province or area better \nthan the President does--particularly back in those days but it is also \ntrue today. The second reason is that if they don't like the way they \nare doing it, they can immediately go ahead and vote them out of \noffice. Look what happened November 2. That is exactly what did happen. \nSo that was Madison.\n  Alexander Hamilton said:\n\n       The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes \n     the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are \n     to be regulated . . .\n\n  Now, there is no wiggle room in that. It is supposed to be us. The \nSupreme Court Justice--I was talking with someone with the Investor's \nBusiness Daily, and I said: You probably never heard of this guy Joseph \nStory, the Supreme Court Justice, and he said to me--I wish I could \nremember his name because this is kind of interesting--he said: Oh, no, \nI live out here now, but when I lived in Washington, I went to a weekly \nmeeting, It was the Joseph Story Fan Club or something like that.\n  Anyway, in his commentaries on the U.S. Constitution in 1833, he \nstates--this is Justice Joseph Story:\n\n       It is highly proper that Congress should possess the power \n     to decide how and when any money should be applied . . . if \n     it were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded \n     power . . . Congress is made the guardian of the Treasury . . \n     .\n\n  I say all this to make sure to impress upon any impartial patriot \nthat the legislative branch--that is us--only the legislative branch \nhas the power to spend money, according to the Constitution.\n  How does a ban on earmarks cede authority to the President? This is \nsignificant. Although Senator McConnell didn't mention it this morning, \nlet me say what he would have said had he had time, I believe. I will \nalso show how this can be impacted by S. 3939. It couldn't be a more \nappropriate time to introduce this.\n  President Obama--this is the way it is for any President--submits a \nbudget to Congress which Congress either accepts all or part of or \nrejects all or part of. If it is rejected, we substitute what the Obama \nrequests are with what we think is better for America. The cost is the \nsame.\n  I have often said that stopping an earmark doesn't save any money. \nNot many people understand this, but it doesn't because all we are \ndoing is taking what the President would have spent on an item and \nchanging it to something else. For example, in his military budget--and \nI know President Obama doesn't feel the same way I feel about the \npriorities of defending America. That should be our No. 1 priority. I \ndon't think he believes that. Nonetheless, in his budget he asked for \n$300 million and something, plus or minus, for a launching system that \nis a good launching system. It was called a bucket of rockets, and it \nis one that I would like to have.\n  When we went to the Armed Services Committee--keep in mind, these \ncommittees, such as the Senate Armed Services Committee, are staffed \nwith professionals. A lot of them are former military people, \nscientists, people who really understand how we can best, with limited \nresources, defend this country. So we took the $300 million for that \nsystem and put that same $300 million--canceled the launching system \nand put in 6 new F-18 fighters. They are actually FA-18EF model \nfighters. This is what we all decided would be best. Now, if we \nsubstitute our appropriation for his budget item, it would be an \nearmark by any definition. If we place a moratorium on earmarks, we \nwould have to accept Obama's original request. This is a concern I \nhave, but it doesn't lead to a happy ending, as you will find out in a \nsecond.\n  Therefore, we would not have any additional F-18s. Still there is no \nmoney saved. In other words, we would be doing what James Madison \nwanted us to do. So the Senate is taken out of the process and cedes \nits power to President Obama. Speaking of systems we would not have if \nwe had ceded that authority previously, we would not have unmanned \naerial vehicles. The Air Force, right now, is currently operating at \nleast 36 continual combat air patrols in Southeast Asia. That was a \ncongressional earmark. We would not have that. We would not have \nimproved armored vehicles and add-on armor. That was a congressional \nearmark. We would not have Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. We \nwould not have them. They have saved lives. We would not have had $14.2 \nmillion for detection of landmines and detection of suspected bomb \nmakers and IED makers in Iraq and Afghanistan. That was a congressional \nearmark. Actually, it was mine. We would not have had that.\n  We can see that a moratorium would not allow us to change anything in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nObama budget. It would allow the President to perform our \nconstitutional duties. In a minute, I will give you a solution. \nMeanwhile, we cannot continue to do the big spending. I think a ban on \nearmarks has at least focused on this problem for right now.\n  Here is another chart. I mentioned before that there are two problems \nI had with a ban on earmarks. One of the problems with a ban is that it \ncedes to the President our constitutional duties. The other is that it \ngives some protection to people who are big spenders.\n  Put up chart 4. I was going to say--technically, by the definition, \nthis would be true. I was going to say these are the four biggest, \nlargest earmarks in 2008. They can argue they are not earmarks, that \nthis wasn't the intent, nonetheless. By the definition I showed you in \nthe House and Senate, these are earmarks. First is the TARP. I was one \nwho opposed that $700 billion we gave to an unelected bureaucrat with \nno oversight whatsoever. There was the mortgage bailout of $300 \nbillion, the Pelosi-Bush stimulus check of $150 billion; PEPFAR, a \nprogram that does some good but not expanded to the point it is right \nnow in sending money to foreign countries to fight AIDS. If we total \nthat up, that is $1.2 trillion.\n  I am not as smart as a lot of the guys in this Chamber. So when I see \nthe millions and billions and trillions, my head starts to spin. I am \nnot sure how this affects us.\n  Put up chart 5. What I have developed in Oklahoma--and nobody here is \naware of this, but they are in Oklahoma--is known as the Inhofe factor. \nI will use 2009. In 2009, $2 trillion in taxes was paid by individuals \nacross the country, and $18 billion came from Oklahomans, which is \nabout 1 percent of the Federal budget. The average Oklahoma individual \ntax return for that year, 2009, was $11,100. Therefore, the average \nOklahoma taxpayer is responsible for providing--I have the percentage \nof total Federal revenue. For every $10 million in spending in \nWashington, Oklahomans pay a nickel in terms of how much each family--I \nam taking every family in Oklahoma that files a tax return. That is \nwhat it amounts to.\n  Let's see the next one. By the way, I say to some of my friends from \nother States, other Senators: You are not going to deviate too much \nfrom that because Oklahoma is not that much different from other \nStates. What did it cost you for the four largest earmarks? If you \napply that to Oklahoma--each family in Oklahoma who filed a tax \nreturn--it would cost each family $5,683. That is each family who files \na tax return.\n  In earmarks, the total of all projects requested by me in 2008 was \n$80 million. Most of them were military projects, some of which I just \ntalked about. If you apply the same factor to $80 million, it would \ncost each family in Oklahoma 40 cents. I hope you look at this--each \nfamily, 40 cents as opposed to the four largest things, $5,683.\n  I said that because I think it is important that we look at these \nthings and see how much--quit talking in terms of billions and \ntrillions and know what it is for each family. Even though I am ranked \nas the most conservative member by many organizations, I am a big \nspender in three areas: national defense, infrastructure--roads, \nhighways, and bridges. We have a crumbling infrastructure throughout \nAmerica. I think we all understand that. The Governor of Pennsylvania \nand I have talked about that. He is a far leftwing liberal, and I am a \nconservative. Yet we agree that infrastructure is very important. The \nthird area where I could be considered a big spender is unfunded \nmandates. I was a mayor at one time. As I often tell my friends in the \nSenate: If you want a hard job, become a mayor because there is no \nhiding things when you are a mayor. So if there is a problem and they \ndon't like the trash system, it ends up in your front yard. It did. I \nwas there.\n  If we go back to chart 4, we have to follow this carefully. OMB \nstated that our earmarks for 2010 were $11 billion. They have their \ndefinition of an earmark, and people are saying that is a good \ndefinition. These four obligations--say they are not earmarks, but they \ncould be defined as that. That would be $1.2 trillion. If we take the \n$11 billion and do the math, we would find that earmarks are one one-\nhundredth of just these four spending bills. In other words, the total \namount of the 2010 earmarks were only 1 percent of these huge spending \nbills. Of the three drivers of the earmark wagon, Senator McCain voted \nfor all four of these, or supported them. Senator Coburn, my junior \nSenator, voted for half of them, $750 billion. Senator DeMint and I \nopposed all four of them.\n  My point is, the public has been focusing so intently on earmarks, \nthat 1 percent figure, they overlook the huge bills that spend 100 \ntimes more than all the earmarks, and we ended up with the $13.4 \ntrillion increase in the debt. My 20 kids and grandkids have to pay for \n$3 trillion of the deficit increase.\n  That left out Senator DeMint. I say this in love, but I think it is \nvery important to understand there is a commitment on behalf of every \nSenator, all 100 Senators, to help people in the States. I have that as \nwell as he does. Let's talk for a minute about Senator DeMint.\n  In 2004, Republicans were in the majority. I was chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. That takes care of all the \ntransportation, roads, highways, infrastructure, and that type of \nthing. At Senator DeMint's request, I flew to South Carolina to support \nhis commitment to highway earmarks. He said: I am not only supportive \nof I-73 and other projects, but I have a good working relationship with \npeople who can get it done.\n  I guess that was me. He got 13 earmarks in places such as Myrtle \nBeach, Beaufort County; engineering design and construction of a port \naccess road, $15 million; and $10 million for improvements in Beaufort \nand Colleton County to improve safety, and the list goes on.\n  I tell you what. It actually gets better as we look into it because \non September 30, 2009, there was a vote on a $2.5 billion amendment to \nadd 10 additional Charleston, SC, based C-17s for $2.5 billion. The \nCitizens Against Government Waste listed this as the single largest \ndefense earmark of 2009. Senator DeMint voted for it, and South \nCarolina was very appreciative. It was the single largest defense \nearmark then.\n  Last week, Senator DeMint told the Greenville News that he wants to \nreform the harbor maintenance trust fund to ``get back the money South \nCarolina contributes.'' He is going after specific funding of $400,000. \nWhether the money comes from the Corps of Engineers or the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund, it is still an earmark under anyone's \ndefinition. He wants to put that money into a fund to study and deepen \nthe channel, rather an O He should do that. He is doing what the \nConstitution tells him to do. He is looking after the needs of the \npeople of South Carolina. I look after the needs of the people of \nOklahoma. I am not sure that if we left this up to President Obama he \nwould be very generous to South Carolina and Oklahoma. So he is \nentitled to do this. That is why Madison gave the power to spend to the \nlegislature.\n  All those earmarks--and you might say that Senator DeMint is \nadaptable. It reminds me of the guy who had been out of town for 2 \nyears and called up his dearest friend, and he said to his friend: \nWell, Mary, how are you doing? This is Tom.\n  She said: Tom, it is so good to hear from you. It has been 2 years.\n\n  Tom said: How is old Jim getting along?\n  She said: Didn't you know? Jim is dead.\n  He said: No, what happened?\n  She said: He went down to the garden to pick some peas for dinner and \nleaned over and had a heart attack and fell on his face dead.\n  He said: You poor thing, Mary. Whatever did you do?\n  She said: There is only one thing we could do. We had to open a can \nof peas.\n  You see, there is nothing wrong with being adaptable. I think Senator \nDeMint is. I think we are talking about not a can of peas but a can of \nworms.\n  The government has a function to provide infrastructure, roads, \nhighways, and all of this. I will bring this out because--I will \nmention a couple of others, but people are concerned about their \nStates. There is one significant fact that needs to be elaborated on \nnow. One of the arguments that was\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nnot sound was that they said earmarks are a gateway drug that needs to \nbe eliminated in order to demonstrate that we are serious about fiscal \nrestraint. There is one problem with that; it is not true.\n  According to the OMB and Citizens Against Government Waste, the \nearmarks have dramatically decreased over the past several years. OMB \nsaid in 2005 total earmarks were $18.9 billion. In 2008, they were \n$16.6 billion. In 2009, they were $15.3 billion. In 2010, they were \n$11.1 billion. Why do you suppose they are reducing every year? It is \nbecause we are demanding more light so that people can know what they \nare spending money on.\n  I say that earmarks are hardly a gateway drug, a symptom of Federal \nfunding run amok, or even an underlying cause to our fiscal problems. \nWhy? Because we have shed light on earmarks. Let's add why a shining \nlight can be a first step.\n  In 2009, the Senate performed the rare action of considering many \nappropriations bills individually rather than irresponsibly lumping \nthem into one like we are doing today, lumping them into one vote at \nthe end of the year. The value of that--considering them individually--\nis it gives Senators the opportunity to exercise oversight of \ngovernment programs and to monitor how Federal departments spend money. \nSo in 2009 Senators could offer amendments to cut spending and strike \nparticular earmarks if they desired.\n  From July until November of that year, 2009, there were 18 votes \nspecifically targeting earmarks. All the amendments failed. Had they \nsucceeded, it would not have reduced the overall amount of money the \nFederal Government is spending by a dime.\n  Instead of putting money back into the pockets of the American people \nby reducing spending or shrinking the deficit, these efforts would have \nput the money into the hands of President Obama, by allowing his \nadministration to spend the money as he saw fit. At the end of the day, \nno one would have saved money. President Obama is the winner and the \nAmerican people are the loser.\n  In another case Members offered amendments to strike funding from the \nprogram called Save America's Treasures for specific art centers \nthroughout the United States. They offered amendments to strike it. Did \nit save any money? No. That went back to the unelected bureaucrats at \nthe National Park Service to spend. That is the Obama administration. \nHe calls the shots there. It didn't save a cent.\n  In another case, a Member offered an amendment to strike a variety of \ntransportation projects in quite a few States only to redirect spending \nto the Obama administration and the unelected bureaucrats in the \nFederal Highway Administration. Not one of these actions saved a dime \nbut made President Obama happy because it all went back to his coffers.\n\n  Now I point this out because there is a solution. We have clearly \ndemonstrated, and we have made a point here, and the point is: No. 1--\nand no one can deny this--that spending is an exclusive constitutional \nright of the Senate and the House, and killing earmarks doesn't save a \ndime but can be the first stop in a real solution.\n  That gets back to S. 3939. I am very proud of that, and I wish to say \nthere is a happy ending to this story mostly because of that Senate \nbill. I would like to take credit for that but I am not going to do it \nbecause I can't. I wasn't that smart. But there are eight great \nAmericans--and let's put that chart up, if you would, Luke--eight great \nAmericans and the conservative groups they represent--Tom Schatz, \npresident of Citizens Against Government Waste; Melanie Sloan, director \nof Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington; Steve Ellis, \nTaxpayers for Common Sense; Craig Holman, Public Citizens; Jim Walsh, \nRich Gold, Manny Rouvelas, and Dave Wenhold--and thanks to them we can \nput the earmarks issue to rest. They authored the ``5 Principles of \nEarmark Reform,'' and I will list these. The chart shows what they are, \nstarting at the top.\n  I have to say that S. 3939 will address all of these specifically. \nThere are people in Washington who go through a lot of work making a \nlot of studies, and they assume we never read these things or care \nabout them. But if you believe that, you are wrong because I listened, \nand this is the result--the five principles of earmark reform.\n  What we are saying here is that we know--and it doesn't matter what \nyou do in having a ban on earmarks, because Members are going to be \nvoting and supporting things in their States; everyone is. I can assure \nyou that is going to happen, by the Senator from Oregon and everyone \nhere. This is going to happen. But principle No. 1 says to cut the cord \nbetween campaign contributions, Congress should limit earmarks directed \nto campaign contributors. Limiting total contributions from the earmark \nbeneficiary and its affiliates to no more than $5,000 would help \nrestore public confidence. This came from those eight great groups that \nevaluated as to what we could do to clean up this system. Well, S. \n3939, just introduced, does exactly that. Section 2 says:\n\n       No earmark beneficiary shall make contributions aggregating \n     more than $5,000 to any requesting candidate with respect to \n     such earmark beneficiary.\n\n  So that first one is met. The second principle is to eliminate any \nconnection between legislation and campaign contributions, legislative \nstaff should be barred from participating in fundraising activities. \nThe attendance of legislative staff at fundraisers suggests a \nconnection between campaign donations and earmarks.\n\n  So we handled that with S. 3939. It does just that under section 3. \nSubsections (a) and (b) state:\n\n       Limits on staff attendance of Member fundraisers. Except as \n     provided in subsection B, an employee of the personal staff \n     of a Member of Congress should not attend a political \n     fundraiser on behalf of the Member of Congress for whom they \n     are employed. A Member of Congress may designate one employee \n     who shall not be subject to the provisions of Subsection A.\n\n  I think people know there may be a situation where someone would need \nto drive a Member or there could be threats and they may need to have \nsome security.\n  The third thing they came up with to increase transparency is, \nCongress should create a new database of all congressional earmarks. \nThey went on to say:\n\n       Information about lawmakers' earmark requests is scattered \n     across hundreds of web sites in a variety of formats with \n     differing levels of details. The funding levels for each \n     earmark award are listed in a chart at the end of each \n     spending bill. While the data is technically available, it is \n     virtually impossible to collect, understand and analyze all \n     of the earmark information. Congress should create a unified, \n     searchable, sortable and downloadable database on the public \n     website.\n\n  S. 3939, which I introduced an hour ago, does exactly that. Section 4 \nreads:\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives shall post on a public website of their \n     respective houses, a link to the earmark database maintained \n     by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n  Done.\n  No. 4. The fourth concern is to ensure taxpayer money has been spent \nappropriately, the Government Accountability Office should randomly \naudit earmarks. Because oversight is essential to maintain integrity in \nthe earmarking process, the Government Accountability Office should \ndevelop and implement a system to audit and report to Congress \nregularly on programs and projects funded through earmarks.\n  This does that, and I am going to read our section 7. This is a more \ndifficult one, but it is air tight.\n\n       Not later than December 31, 2011, and each year thereafter, \n     the Comptroller General shall submit a report to Congress \n     that uses the OMB database--(1) to randomly select a \n     percentage of each of the programs and projects funded \n     through earmarks in a preceding fiscal year; (2) to conduct \n     an audit on each selected program or project reporting on the \n     amount, purpose, term, requesting Member and the present \n     state of completion of the program or project; and (3) if the \n     earmark contributes to an already existing program or \n     project, to provide a detailed accounting of how the earmark \n     contributed to each program or project.\n\n  That was the request, and we came up with the section that, as I say, \nis air tight in solving the problem.\n  No. 5, to promote congressional responsibility without stifling \ninnovation, Members should certify earmark recipients are qualified to \nhandle the project. The last language we had on that was section 6:\n\n       And a certification that the recipient is qualified to \n     handle the project, if applicable.\n\n  You might say that is great, we have resolved all of the problems \nthat are\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nout there. This was a combination of the intellects of all the people I \nhave mentioned a while back. They looked at all the problems that are \nthere and how we could resolve those problems. But one thing was \noverlooked, so we have a section in S. 3939 where we go one step \nfurther. It demands--listen to this, Mr. President--the same \ntransparency to Obama bureaucratic earmarks as it does to Senatorial \nearmarks.\n  Well, that is kind of neat, if we do that. I will read section 5:\n\n       Not later than July 1, 2011, the head of each department \n     and agency of the Federal Government shall post on the public \n     website of that department or agency a link to a searchable \n     database that lists each contract, grant, cooperative \n     agreement, and other expenditure made by the department or \n     agency listing with respect to the expenditure, the amount, \n     purpose, term and office making such expenditure.\n\n  Why is that necessary? I can remember Sean Hannity, about 6 months \nago, came out with a series one night where he talked about the 102 \nmost egregious earmarks that were brought up. Here is something that is \ninteresting about that. I was so excited when I saw these that I read \nthem all. I came down and stood right here on the Senate floor and I \nwent over them all and described all 102 earmarks. We have a chart that \nshows some of those. Look at some of the things we are talking about \nhere: $3.4 million to construct an echo passage for turtles--that is \nnice; $450,000 to build 22 concrete toilets in the Mark Twain National \nForest; $300,000 for helicopter equipment to detect radioactive rabbit \ndroppings; $500,000 for a grant to a researcher named in the Climate-\nGate scandal--I wish we had another hour, I would like to talk about \nthat--and $325,000 to study the mating decisions of female cactus bugs.\n  After reading all 102--and this is five of them--I asked the \nquestions: What do all these have in common? What they have in common \nis that not one of them was a congressional earmark. They were all \nearmarks that were put in there by the Obama administration.\n  So here is the problem you have. If you ban congressional earmarks, \nyou are going to have more of this. Because as you restrict what \nCongress can do, that same amount of money goes back into the \nadministration, whether it is the Department of the Interior, the Corps \nof Engineers, the EPA, or any of the rest of them. So is there any \nquestion why President Obama embraced the ban on the earmarks? No, \nbecause he wants the money to go to him.\n\n  But S. 3939 is going to curb that. I think this actually could have a \nvery happy ending, because the five principles of earmark reform \nassembled by the eight individuals I mentioned is an ingenious \ndocument. Even the Tea Party people recognized that we have an \nobligation to our States.\n  Let me congratulate Senator Rand Paul for his statement on Sunday, \nNovember 7, wherein he stated that he told the people of Kentucky that \nhe will work through the committee process to get things done for \nKentucky, but it has to be under a particular overall budget. I agree. \nI am with him. I have had the same conversation with Marco Rubio. I am \nwith him. They recognize the President does not have the knowledge of \neach State's needs.\n  With the passage of S. 3939, it resolves the whole earmark dilemma \nand puts it to rest. The one good thing about the ban is that we have \nto tackle the deficit. As long as we continue, as we did in the last 2 \nyears, to stand on the floor of this Senate and go hour after hour \nafter hour talking about the earmark problem, which is 1 percent of the \ntotal discretionary spending, we are not going to be able to address \nthe real problem, and that is the increase of the debt to $13.4 \ntrillion--the largest increase in the history of America. It is larger \nthan any of the other increases, all the way from George Washington to \nGeorge W. Bush, and saddling my 20 kids and grandkids with $3 trillion \nof extra spending.\n  That is the problem we have. I would have to say, as I learned in my \nsuccessful battle against cap and trade, the truth eventually triumphs. \nWinston Churchill said:\n\n       Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent it, ignorance \n     may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n\n  I believe that is what we are getting closer and closer to. The end \nresult will be that a Senator will be able to continue to work for the \nneeds of the States, as Senator DeMint is doing, and I am doing right \nnow. But first, all of the reforms necessary to clean up the process \nwill occur; and, secondly, we can limit President Obama or any future \nPresident from claiming or from taking our constitutional rights by \nsubjecting him to the same transparency.\n  I think this is very significant. I believe after all this talk, over \nall these years, particularly in the last 2 years, we are now at the \npoint to satisfy everyone. If they want to ban earmarks, fine, ban \nearmarks. But at the same time, put the clarity and the transparency in \nthe system that will clean it up, and I believe that is what is going \nto happen. I guess you can say we can have it both ways, and it looks \nas if we are going to be able to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself Mr. Begich, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Brown of Massachusets):\n  S. 3946. blll to repeal the expansion of information reporting \nrequirements for payments of $600 or more to corporations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to help \nsmall businesses across America. The Small Business Paperwork Relief \nAct repeals recently enacted information reporting rules.\n  Known as ``the 1099 provision,'' these rules would have required \nbusinesses to file Form 1099 with the IRS to report payments made to \ncorporations for goods and certain services with the hope that that \nbetter information would help the IRS collect more of the taxes that \nare legally owed, and in turn, keep taxes lower for all taxpayers.\n  Forms 1099 have been used by the IRS for decades to better track \nincome. And in fact, this type of information reporting was proposed by \nthe Bush administration to help better keep track of what businesses \nspend and earn, which helps better keep track of what they owe in \ntaxes.\n  But it has become clear the new rules went too far.\n  As I traveled my home state of Montana, I listened to small business \nowners like Darrell Keck, owner of the Dixie Inn in Shelby. Darrell and \nhis wife Jeanne run a tight ship, they are hard-working, and they pay \ntheir taxes. This is just one of many mom-and-pop businesses in Montana \nand throughout the country that told me they do not have the manpower \nor the software to make the new Form 1099 reporting rules work.\n  I have listened to small businesses, I have heard small businesses, \nand I am responding to small businesses by offering this bill for full \nrepeal of the new information reporting requirements.\n  The time and expense for small businesses to comply with the new \nrules far exceed any benefit. Especially in these tough economic times, \nnow is not the time to put additional stress on small businesses to \nmeet complicated government rules. Small business is the backbone of \nthe American economy--especially in Montana where more workers are \nemployed by small businesses than anywhere else in the country. \nBusiness owners need to focus their efforts on growing their business \nand creating jobs--not filing paperwork.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I remain committed to \nimproving tax administration and enhancing voluntary tax compliance. \nWhen each person pays what he owes, our nation's system of voluntary \ntax compliance is fairer for everyone--without raising taxes on anyone. \nI look forward to working collaboratively with the small business \ncommunity to improve the ability of small businesses to understand and \nmeet their tax obligations.\n  Small businesses in Montana and all across America want to comply \nwith the tax laws. But these new rules stretched their ability to do \nthat. I urge my Colleagues to support their full repeal.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

I also transmit for the \ninformation of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which \nincludes an Overview of the proposed Convention and related agreement.\n  The proposed Convention and related agreement were negotiated to \nbring U.S.-Hungary tax treaty relations into closer conformity with \ncurrent U.S. tax treaty policies. For example, the proposed Convention \ncontains comprehensive provisions designed to address ``treaty \nshopping,'' which is the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by residents \nof a third country. The existing Convention with Hungary, signed in \n1979, does not contain treaty shopping protections and, as a result, \nhas been abused by third-country investors in recent years.
