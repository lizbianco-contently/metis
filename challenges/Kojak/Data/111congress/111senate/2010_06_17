Madam President, following leader remarks, if any, there \nwill be a period of morning business until 10 a.m., with Senators \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The majority will control \nthe first half, the Republicans will control the final half.\n  Upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the House message which accompanies H.R. 4213. There \nwill be up to 2 hours for debate on the Thune amendment, which is \nnumbered 4376, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Thune and Baucus or their designees. If all time is used, at \napproximately noon today, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Thune amendment.\n  As a reminder, last night I filed cloture on the Baucus substitute \namendment. The managers of the bill will work with Senators on \nagreements to consider amendments so that we can move toward completion \nof the bill as quickly as possible. Senators should expect additional \nvotes today in relation to amendments to the bill. Senators will be \nnotified when additional votes are scheduled.\n  I have spoken to the manager of the bill, Senator Baucus, and he has \nspoken to a number of his Republican colleagues, and we are going to \ntry to arrange a number of votes as soon as we finish the Thune matter. \nThere are at least three that I know the Republicans want to offer, and \nthere are a number on our side, but we will try to get that done as \nquickly as possible. This is not a time for never-ending amendments. \nThis is the seventh week we have been on this legislation. They have \nnot been contiguous, but they have certainly been spent on this \nlegislation. So we hope we can work out a reasonable agreement on the \namendments that need to be debated and voted on. If we can't work \nsomething out tonight, this afternoon, we will have to have a cloture \nvote in the morning. I would hope that can be avoided. I don't know if \nit can be.\n  The problem we have is that we have asked the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Kathleen Sebelius, to work to extend the time \nadministratively so that the 21-percent cut to Medicare doesn't go into \neffect. We think we have been able to do that, until tomorrow. But we \nare in very perilous times here. Unemployment compensation benefits \nhave already expired. These tax extenders, which are so important to \nbusinesses, have expired. Therefore, it is essential that we get \nsomething done. Remember, Medicare reimbursement is not just for \nMedicare patients. Even though some doctors have already said they are \ngoing to drop Medicare patients, it is for more than Medicare patients \nbecause most reimbursement in our country is based upon Medicare \nlevels--insurance companies, HMOs, and veterans programs. So everyone \non both sides of the aisle should understand that the time to sit back \nand say: We will work something out later isn't going to be here. We \nhave to do something today, or tomorrow at the latest, because of this \n21 percent cut. We have cried wolf for the last time. It will go into \neffect over the weekend.\n  We also have an important element in this legislation that deals with\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nFMAP. The poorest of the poor in our country are able to get Medicaid \nthrough the State programs, and we assist at the Federal level. Those \nprograms, in most States, are in a perilous state. They have cut a lot \nof the programs. A lot of people who are eligible for certain Medicaid \nprocedures and office visits and things of that nature have been \nterminated already. I have received calls from at least 20 Governors--\nand it is not just Democratic Governors--who are desperate for this \nmoney.\n  So everything in this bill is paid for except FMAP and the situation \nI related to regarding unemployment compensation extension. Everything \nelse is paid for. The doctor fix is paid for in the amendment that is \nnow before us where cloture has been filed. So I hope we can work \nthrough these amendments the Republicans have to have and we have to \nhave on our side and, if possible, we can go ahead and set up a vote to \nget rid of this piece of legislation today; otherwise, we will have a \ncloture tomorrow, and 30 hours runs after that, and by that time the \ndoctors and patients will be harmed significantly, notwithstanding the \nfact that the unemployed have already been hurt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5052-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, Democrats continue to argue among \nthemselves about how much they want to add to the deficit. Yesterday, \nthey unveiled their latest proposal, which would add another $50 \nbillion. And they are calling this an accomplishment--an accomplishment \nthey reached not by making any tough choices but by shortening the \nlength of time they would pay for programs they know they will end up \nextending anyway. Only in Washington would people boast about saving \nmoney they fully intend to spend down the road. And only in Washington \nwould people raid a trust fund intended to pay for oilspill cleanup to \ncover completely unrelated spending in the middle of an oilspill. Let \nme say that again: Only in Washington would people raid a trust fund \nintended to pay for oilspill cleanup to cover completely unrelated \nspending in the middle of an oilspill.\n  So Democrats can continue to play these games or they can join \nRepublicans in voting for the Thune amendment later today. The Thune \namendment would actually do the thing Americans want us to do right \nnow; that is, lower the deficit and create real opportunities for job \ngrowth.\n  Senators will have a simple choice today: They can either vote to \nreduce the deficit or they can lock arms with the Democratic leadership \nand dig an even deeper hole of debt, when most Americans think $13 \ntrillion is far too much already. If you are even remotely attuned to \nwhat Americans are asking us, this would be an easy choice. Our \ncolleagues across the aisle have come down to the Senate floor over and \nover to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. Well, today they can \nprove it. Americans want us to show we are serious about lowering the \ndebt. Senators will have that opportunity later today.\n  So I ask my colleagues on both sides to join with me today and vote \nin favor of the Thune amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5052-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to ask that my \nlegislation, S. 3462, which would grant subpoena power to the \nPresidential commission tasked with investigating the BP oilspill, be \npassed by unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I think I \nwill object at this time. The bill was just introduced 7 business days \nago. It has been referred to the Judiciary Committee, where I assume \nChairman Leahy will take a thoughtful look at it. Senator Reid has \nasked his committee chairmen to report out oilspill legislation by the \n4th of July for consideration next month, so I think we should give \nthat process an opportunity to work. So I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I don't understand. We are 58 days \ninto this oilspill. Eleven lives have been lost. We have seen up to 97 \nmillion gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico that is already on the \nshores of the gulf. We have thousands of wildlife covered in oil, many \nof them dead. We have fishermen who have lost their livelihoods, some, \nwe guess, maybe for generations. We have countless hotels and \nrestaurants that are empty during what should be their prime tourist \nseason. I don't understand why, given all of this--the full devastation \nof this catastrophic spill is far from being known, although we know it \nis going to be one of the worst economic and environmental disasters in \nAmerican history, and we need to make absolutely certain this never \nhappens again--why people are still objecting to giving the bipartisan \ncommission charged with investigating this disaster the subpoena power \nto do what they need to do to make sure this never happens again.\n  In order to have a full and fruitful investigation, this commission \nmust have subpoena power to get to the bottom of what safety \nprecautions BP did and did not take leading up to the Deepwater Horizon \nexplosion. Subpoena power is essential to their task of making \nmeaningful recommendations on how to prevent future disasters. That is \nwhy I, along with 18 other Senators, have introduced this legislation \nto grant subpoena power to this commission. It is unacceptable for BP \nand the other companies responsible for this oilspill to continue to \nstonewall the American people.\n  I don't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare objecting to this. I would assume they are as interested in getting \nto the bottom of this disaster as the rest of us are, and this \nstonewalling is something I just don't understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator does not have control \nof the time at this moment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was just reassuring her. I think I agree with \neverything she said. Mine was the process we are talking about, and I \nthink that is the process the majority leader was recommending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Could the Presiding Officer tell me how much time \nremains for the majority side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 6 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Would the Presiding Officer let me know when I have \nexhausted 2 of my 3 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise once again to ask unanimous \nconsent--and I will do so shortly--to hold oil companies accountable \nfor their spills. This is really a sense of who is on your side. Are we \ngoing to take the side of big oil or are we going to take\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nthe side of commercial fishermen? Are we going to take the side of big \noil or are we going to take the side of shrimp fishermen? Are we going \nto take the side of big oil or are we going to take the side of \npreserving the estuaries that are so critical yet that we see \nincreasingly devastated, the wildlife, with consequences to those \necosystems that may very well affect a generation? Are we going to take \na side with big oil or are we going to stand up for the tourism \nindustry that is affected? Are we going to stand up for big oil or are \nwe going to stand with the boater who ultimately sees his boat \nlanguishing in the waters because he cannot go out because there is no \none to take out on a commercial venture? Are we going to stand up for \nthe communities and the coasts along the gulf shore or are we going to \nstand with big oil?\n\n  That is what this effort is all about. It is about setting \nresponsibility where responsibility should lie. I applaud that the \nPresident got BP to sign up to $20 billion over the next 4 years or so. \nBut that does not mean we should not be lifting the liability cap, a \nliability cap that is ridiculously low at $75 million total when BP, \nfor example, makes over $90 million a day. So their liability under the \nlaw, regardless of what they say, is less than 1 day's profit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. This is about making sure at the end of the day we \nstand up to big oil. I know there are those who suggest--my colleague \nfrom Louisiana has suggested he has a better way. The problem is his \nbetter way is constitutionally infirm. That has been reviewed by the \nCongressional Research Service which says that trying to enact \nlegislation that effectively declares the guilt or imposes punishment \non an identifiable individual or entity is in essence a bill of \nattainder under the Constitution; therefore, it cannot work. I have \nheard him say I don't want to come here and make a speech, I want to \nsolve something. That is exactly the problem. That does not solve \nanything because it is constitutionally infirm, therefore it would not \napply, therefore we would not have a success. Besides, if it is good \nenough for this incident, it is good enough for any other.\n  Understanding that, I want to ensure we stand on the side with all of \nthose commercial interests, so I ask unanimous consent--I take a final \n30 seconds--I ask unanimous consent that the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee be discharged of S. 3472, the Big Oil Bailout \nPrevention Unlimited Liability Act of 2010, and that the Senate proceed \nto its consideration; that the bill be read three times, passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening action \nor debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, this S. 3472, this is one \nwith no caps?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. This is unlimited liability.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Unlimited liability. Madam President, we have talked \nabout this before. It sounds good to talk about big oil. This would be \nthe greatest thing for big oil. Only the big five might----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from New \nJersey has expired. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  Now I wish to be recognized to explain my objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 2 minutes remaining on \nthe majority's time that the Senator from Florida intends to use.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the oil is relentlessly \nmoving east in the Gulf of Mexico. A week and a half ago it hit Perdido \nPass. That is in Perdido Bay. A week ago it hit Pensacola Pass. It is \nin Pensacola Bay. You ought to see what it looks like. There are tar \nballs. We know what tar balls look like. You ought to see what the \nreddish brown gunk looks like that I saw on Monday as the wind was \nblowing it right toward downtown Pensacola.\n  Today, Destin Pass, further to the east, is being closed. But when it \nis closed by a boom it will not stop the oil if the oil is not already \nskimmed off out in the gulf because the tar balls will go right \nunderneath the boom and the tides come rushing into the pass at 6 to 8 \nknots, and a boom will not stop the oil.\n  This is what we are facing. We are facing the economic devastation as \na result of the despoiling of the coast that relies, so much of its \neconomy, on that coast being pristine--whether it is tourism, whether \nit is fishing, whether it is oyster, shrimp, et cetera.\n  Why shouldn't the company--now that precedent has been set yesterday \nby them setting up a $20 billion trust fund, but that is not a limit. \nWhy should we not--has my time expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If I may finish the sentence--why should we \nnot allow any kind of future devastation by a company to have the same \nliability?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I do not disagree with anything that was said by \nmy very good friend from Florida. It is a devastating thing. I have no \nlove for BP. I assure you they are not any friends of this side over \nhere. I only have to say this. If you want to shut out everyone from \ntheir exploration, it doesn't make any difference whether it is deep \nwater or otherwise, you go ahead and do something like this. This would \nonly help the big five or the national oil companies--that is China and \nVenezuela. Without a cap they would be the only ones who could explore \nout there. Frankly, they don't have the capacity to do the amount of \nexploration that is going to be necessary to run this machine called \nAmerica.\n  Right now there is a commission that is taking place. I believe they \nare going to be discussing all these things, including what types of \ncaps, if any, should go on. They are the ones who are approaching this \nthing, considering everything. I think they should have time to do \ntheir own work. That is the reason. But I do not disagree with anything \neither one of the Senators said.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If I could be forewarned when there is a minute \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue I \nbelieve is of significant importance to our Nation's economy. There has \nbeen a lot of talk lately about the whole idea of increasing exports. \nI--like, I guess, every other Member of this body--support the goal of \nexpanding exports. Increasing exports means companies will sell more of \ntheir goods and services into more markets around the world. A number \nof those companies, I might add, are found in rural communities, found \nin States such as Nebraska. I was sitting there when President Obama, \nin his State of the Union Address, set a goal. He said: I want to \ndouble exports in the next 5 years.\n  Since then, the administration has pushed its National Export \nInitiative, which appears to be about increasing spending and the size \nof government. But a more sensible course of action would truly be to \nincrease exports--sell more. I am talking about free trade agreements. \nThe previous administration negotiated a number of trade agreements, \nbut there are three pending from the previous administration: Colombia, \nSouth Korea, and Panama. Unfortunately, these agreements have been \nlanguishing since they were first agreed to--now around 3 years ago.\n  The current administration briefly seemed to be on the right track \nwhen the President stated his goal of strengthening trade with \nColombia, South Korea, and Panama, again in the State of the Union \nAddress. I was pleased to hear that. The President hit the right tone \nthere. I must admit, though, up to that point, the administration's \ntrade policy was enormously unclear to me, and I guarantee it was to \neverybody else.\n  I thought that finally we had a trade policy. But, unfortunately, \nsince that speech there has been no action. So I\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nhave to ask, What is the holdup? I do not know how you can claim your \ngoal is to double exports and then not take the action on pending trade \nagreements which provide the very direct, ready-made way to move us \nforward. Each one of these agreements lowers tariffs on America's goods \nand services. I will tell you from a lot of experience, that is the \nquickest way to increase exports. With U.S. unemployment now hovering \naround 10 percent, we should be focused like a laser beam on helping \nbusinesses grow and create jobs. Enacting the pending trade agreements \nwill help us get there.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that these agreements could \nbolster our economy by $40 billion. Conversely, if the United States \nfails to implement the agreements with Colombia and Korea, the chamber \nestimates that more than 380,000 U.S. jobs will be lost or displaced.\n  The trade agreements were negotiated nearly 3 years ago. Yet they \nhave not come to the Congress. While we fail to act, our global \ncompetitors are locking up these marketplaces. Several nations are \nnegotiating or finalizing negotiations with the same three countries. \nYet our agreements with those same countries are signed and sealed and \nready for a vote. Our competitors are, very simply, gaining an \nadvantage over our producers, our exporters, our employees, and they \nare laughing all the way to the bank. Now we even have representatives \nfrom those countries saying they are ready to move forward without us.\n  Earlier this week a respected publication, the Des Moines Register, \nquoted the Minister of Economic Affairs at the South Korean Embassy as \nsaying this:\n\n       The U.S. runs the risk of losing the Korean market within a \n     decade if you can't get a free trade agreement ratified.\n\n  Furthermore, the article reported that South Korea is likely to \ncomplete a free trade agreement with the European Union by January. So \nwe are not just at risk of losing the opportunity to increase exports. \nIf other countries keep negotiating trade agreements while this great \nNation sits on its hands, we are going to lose the market share we have \ntoday.\n  I suspect this is just the beginning. These countries are not going \nto wait around forever while we twiddle our thumbs and hope that \nthrowing money at a few government agencies and hiring more government \nemployees will somehow increase exports.\n  Each nation we have sat down with, we have negotiated, we have found \ncommon ground and reached agreement. Now it is time for the final step. \nThe step is to vote on the agreements.\n  Think of the big picture. Roughly 95 percent of the world's consumers \nlive outside the United States. The global marketplace is asking for us \nto go and do business there. It is important to agriculture, but it is \nalso important to our entire economy. You see, in agriculture, exports \naccount for over 25 percent of total ag sales. We like to say that \nevery third row of crops is sold into the international marketplace. In \nfact, agriculture is one of the few areas where the United States has \nhad a net trade surplus in recent years.\n  These agreements are necessary for agriculture, for farmers and \nranchers. They are good for small businesses in my State and across the \ncountry. As Secretary of Agriculture, I traveled the world helping to \nnegotiate trade deals. I have seen the positive results for exporters. \nI have seen firsthand the importance of these pending agreements. Each \none would level the playing field for America's farmers and ranchers \nand companies, creating jobs, helping to reinvigorate our economy. If \nwe are going to meet this goal of doubling exports, we have to do more \nthan give a speech. We have to take these agreements and put them into \nthe equation and get a vote on that.\n  Consider this: American producers are currently forced to pay \nsubstantial tariffs on their exports to Colombia, to South Korea, to \nPanama. These agreements would wipe out most if not all of those \ntariffs. Roughly $2.8 billion in tariffs on American exports has been \npaid to Colombia alone since the Colombian agreement was signed in \nNovember of 2006.\n  That is $2.8 billion that could have stayed in the United States to \nhire new workers. Most Americans probably assume Colombian exporters \npay the identical U.S. tariffs, but that is not the reality.\n  Colombian producers do not pay a nickel on 90 percent of the products \nthey sell in the United States. The Colombian Free Trade Agreement \nwould allow American producers to compete on a level playing field.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. In South Korea, it is the same story. And I could go on \nand on through each agreement and show that what they are about is \nbringing tariffs down for our products that we are paying today.\n  Well, I have given this speech now I think twice on the floor of the \nSenate and a number of times as I have been out and talked to people \nacross this country. I hope this is the last time I need to come here \nto advocate just to give us a vote. My hope is the administration will \nsend these agreements to the Congress for action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5054-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. \n4213, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \n     amendment with an amendment to H.R. 4213, an act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to extend certain expiring \n     provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Baucus motion to concur in the amendment of the House to \n     the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with Baucus \n     Amendment No. 4369 (to the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill), in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, once again, we are here today to try to \nhelp create jobs. That is what the underlying bill and substitute \namendment are all about.\n  But the Thune amendment would move in the wrong direction. Instead of \nhelping to create jobs, the Thune amendment would probably cost jobs.\n  The Thune amendment would reduce aggregate demand in the economy by \nmore than $50 billion. Instead of continuing the good that the Recovery \nAct has done, the Thune amendment would stop it in its tracks.\n  The Thune amendment would, among other things, cancel unspent and \nunallocated mandatory spending in the Recovery Act.\n  The Recovery Act is working.\n  This is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in its \nmost recent report:\n\n       CBO estimates that in the first quarter of calendar year \n     2010, [the Recovery Act's] policies:\n       Raised the level of real . . . gross domestic product . . . \n     by between 1.7 percent and 4.2 percent;\n       Lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.7 percentage \n     points and 1.5 percentage points;\n       Increased the number of people employed by between 1.2 \n     million and 2.8 million; and\n       Increased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by 1.8 \n     million to 4.1 million compared with what those amounts would \n     have been otherwise.\n\n  And the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Recovery Act \nwill continue to create jobs. CBO projects that the Recovery Act will \ncreate the most jobs in the third quarter of this year. And then it \nwill begin to taper off.\n  We should not cut that job creation off. In this fragile economy, the \nlast thing that we should want to do is to cut back this proven job \ncreator.\n  We passed the Recovery Act to give a needed boost to our economy. We \ndesigned the bill to work over 2 years. If we were to withdraw these \ncritical funds, we would risk causing further damage to a fragile \neconomy.\n  The Thune amendment would also cut other important spending programs.\n  The Thune substitute amendment would cut discretionary spending by 5 \npercent across the board for all agencies, except for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\n  This 5 percent cut would apply to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It would apply to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \nApparently, it would apply to the intelligence agencies.\n  The Thune substitute amendment would freeze the salaries of all \nFederal employees, except for members of the Armed Forces.\n  It would freeze the salaries of civilian defense workers. It would \nfreeze the salaries of law enforcement. It would freeze the salaries of \nborder protection agents.\n  Another provision would cap the total number of federal employees at \ncurrent levels. If an agency needed to hire a new employee, it would \nfirst need to fire an existing employee. That is not how to create \njobs. This would dramatically reduce the flexibility of agencies to \nmake hiring decisions.\n  I support finding ways to make our government more efficient. But \nthese cuts are arbitrary. They are mindless meat-ax cuts.\n  The Thune amendment would also make changes to the new health care \nlaw. These changes would leave more Americans without health insurance. \nThe Thune amendment would do this by expanding the affordability \nexception to the responsibility for individuals to buy health \ninsurance.\n  This expansion would eliminate coverage for millions of Americans. \nAnd CBO tells us that this would raise health care premiums.\n  The irony of this proposal is that it raises money for the government \nbecause the government would not provide as much in tax credits to \nAmericans to help them buy insurance.\n  But Congress has just enacted health care reform. Congress just \nexpressed our Nation's commitment to helping all Americans to buy \nhealth insurance. We should let the new health care law take effect.\n  The Thune amendment would also propose changes to our medical \nmalpractice system that the Senate has rejected many times.\n  The Thune amendment would cap damages and make other changes to State \nlaws. This is the not the solution to medical malpractice.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that these kinds of ideas \nwould generate savings. But we need to ask: At what cost?\n  What would be the cost to patients? What would be the cost to the \nStates?\n  CBO relied on outside studies in calculating its cost estimate. And \nthose same studies point out that certain tort reform policies may also \nincrease the number of risky procedures performed. And these policies \nmay lead to more patient injuries and more patient deaths.\n  One study upon which CBO relied said that these policies would lead \nto a 0.2-percent increase in mortality. These policies in the Thune \namendment could lead to more patient deaths.\n  That is an awfully high price to pay.\n  Our Nation's civil liability system has always been forged at the \nState level. Nationalizing that system with damage caps would put \npatients at risk.\n  The Thune amendment employs some of the offsets that it does because \nit drops the oil spill liability tax. And the Thune amendment employs \nsome of the offsets that it does because it drops the tax loophole \nclosers in the underlying substitute amendment.\n  The Thune amendment thus would allow big oil companies to pay less \ninto the oil spill liability trust fund, to pay for oil spills.\n  The Thune amendment thus would allow investment managers to continue \nto pay lower capital gains tax rates on their service income than other \nAmericans do on their wages.\n  The Thune amendment thus would allow some professionals who organize \nas S corporations to avoid paying their fair share of Social Security \nand Medicare payroll taxes.\n  And the Thune amendment thus would allow multinational corporations \nto continue accounting dodges to avoid paying their fair share of taxes \nhere in America.\n  These decisions reflected in the Thune amendment are bad tax policy. \nThese decisions preserve unfairness and inequity in the tax law.\n  And so, the Thune amendment would put the recovery at risk by \ncurtailing the Recovery Act. It would cut the number of Americans with \nhealth insurance and raise premiums. It would nationalize medical \nmalpractice law, putting patients at risk. And it would protect big oil \nand multinational corporations that ship their jobs overseas.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thune amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4376 to Amendment No. 4369\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as provided for in the order, I now call \nup my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4376 to amendment No. 4369.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, this amendment is, in my view, probably \nthe most important thing that we can do for the economy right now. The \nSenator from Montana talked about job creation. Everybody in this \nChamber cares about that. I think Democrats and Republicans alike \nbelieve we have to create jobs in our economy. We need to get economic \ngrowth going again.\n  I think we have a fundamental difference about how best to do that, \nand what my amendment would do is address what I think are the two \nbiggest problems we face--the sort of clouds, if you will, hanging over \nthe economy in this country. One is debt. We have this spiraling \nFederal debt which is set to double in 5 years and triple in 10 years \non the current path under the budget that has been proposed by the \nPresident.\n  If we include the debt that government agencies owe each other--in \nother words, intergovernmental debt--add that to the public debt, right \nnow we are in debt $13 trillion. That is the total amount of debt we \nhave today. That is going to balloon in the next 5 years and the next \n10 years. The budget window we use to do our budgeting around here \nsuggests it is going to be much higher than that.\n  So I think what the American people are saying, at least what I \nbelieve the American people are saying--and I think we have probably \ndifferent interpretations of that, but what I believe the American \npeople are saying and what I see in poll after poll after poll is \npeople are concerned about the cloud this growing public debt imposes \non our economy and the burden it places on future generations. They are \nalso profoundly concerned about their jobs and about their economy. \nThey want Congress to take steps that will help grow the economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  The best way to do that is for the government to get out of the way, \nso to speak, and incentivize small businesses to do what they do best; \nthat is, create jobs. It is the small businesses in our economy that \nare the economic engine. They are job creators. We should not be \nimposing more burdens on them. We should try and keep taxes low. We \nshould try and keep regulations and keep from imposing new governmental \nburdens on our small business sector and our economy.\n  So we have a piece of legislation before us today in which I think \nboth sides, Republicans and Democrats, agree we need to do something to \naddress unemployment insurance and extending the benefits of those who \nhave lost their jobs in the recession.\n  We need to address the issue of physician reimbursement cuts which \nwill occur if Congress does not take steps to address that. Of course, \nwe need to extend the expiring tax provisions that many of us support--\nfor example, the tax credit for investment in research and development, \nwhich is one of the things companies use to keep us more competitive. \nThose are all things that have expired, are expiring. Those are issues \nthat need to be addressed. I think both of us agree on that.\n  The question becomes, What is the best remedy, how best do we do \nthat? What the Democratic majority has proposed is a solution which, at \nthe end--and I think this is even under the best-case scenario, which I \ndo not believe we have a CBO score on yet--but the more\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nrecent version of their piece of legislation would still add about $50 \nbillion to the debt. So it would increase the amount of debt I just \nmentioned earlier. It does raise taxes. It raises taxes on small \nbusiness. It raises taxes on investment.\n  It puts more taxes on oil companies by raising taxes that would go \ninto the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. And, of course, because my \namendment does not include that tax increase, somehow we are painted as \nbeing in defense of big oil. Well, let me point out one thing about \nthat--this was true in health care; it has been true with many things \nthat have happened here on the floor--and that is, it would be one \nthing if the revenues raised by increasing the tax from 8 cents to 49 \ncents per barrel of oil were actually going to be used to clean up \noilspills. It is stated to go into the trust fund, the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund, but it will be used to fund other things. So, \nagain, you get this double-counting. You get this practice we have seen \nemployed here by the majority on a number of occasions where you are \nraising revenue that is supposedly for a specific purpose, the proceeds \nof which are going to be used for something entirely different. That, \nof course, is coupled with the fact that the tax, as we all know, is \ngoing to be passed on to the American consumers. So the American \nconsumers are going to be burdened with higher taxes. At the same time, \nthe other side can say: We are being tough on big oil. We are going to \nstick them with this big new tax. Ironically, it is not going to go to \nclean up oilspills; it is going to go to fund these things we are \ntalking about funding here.\n  We have a better way. We can reduce government spending and do this. \nWe can actually extend these expiring tax provisions by reducing taxes \nby about $26 billion under my amendment. We can cut spending by over \n$100 billion under my amendment. And we can actually make some progress \ntoward reducing the Federal debt. We have about $68 billion, under my \namendment, that can be used to pay down the Federal debt. So we reduce \nthe debt, we cut taxes, we extend unemployment benefits, we address the \nphysician reimbursement issue--and by the way, my amendment addresses \nthat through the end of the year 2012. The amendment now offered by the \nDemocratic majority extends it to the end of this year. So if you are a \nphysician out there who is looking for some certainty and looking for \nsomething that is a long-term solution to this issue of cuts in \nreimbursement, then you get, under my amendment, an extension to the \nend of the year 2012. Under the Democratic majority option here today, \nyou get something that extends it only until the end of this year. So \nyou can do all those things and still cut the debt, cut taxes, and \nreduce Federal spending. So what we are offering is a different way.\n  It seems to me, when you are sitting on a $13 trillion debt and you \nare growing your debt at $1.5 trillion every year, which is what is \nhappening--the deficit this year is going to be about $1.5 trillion. \nThat is what it was last year. We are looking at trillion-dollar \ndeficits as far as the eye can see, to the point where the interest on \nthe debt at the end of the 10-year period we use for budgeting purposes \nin the Senate will exceed the amount we spend on defense. We will spend \nmore on interest on the debt than we spend on national security in this \ncountry if we continue down this path. In fact, we will spend, at the \nend of the 10 years, 4.1 percent of our entire economy--our entire \ngross domestic product--on interest on the debt.\n  Madam President, $13 trillion in debt--the other day, I tried to put \nthat in perspective so people can appreciate and understand it because \nI think sometimes it is hard for most of us, myself included, to wrap \nour heads around $1 trillion. It sounds like a lot in the abstract. But \nto try to put it into a perspective that perhaps we can understand, I \nused the analogy of, what is 1 trillion seconds? If you took 1 trillion \nseconds, what would that mean in terms of total number of years? Well, \n1 trillion seconds represents 31,746 years. If you took 13 trillion \nseconds--which is what the debt now represents, the total debt our \ncountry owes--you are looking at over 412,000 years, if a dollar equals \na second. So 1 trillion seconds: 31,746. Madam President, $13 trillion \nis what our total debt consists of today. Again, you are looking at \nover 412,000 years. I think that speaks to why we need to get the debt \nand the spending here under control.\n  Interestingly enough, a while back here in the Senate, to much \nfanfare, the majority passed pay-go rules. The assumption would be that \nsomehow going forward new spending would be paid for and reductions in \ntax revenues would be offset somehow by increases in tax revenues and \nall that.\n  Well, since that time, since the passage of pay-go, the Senate has \nalready approved well over $100 billion in new spending, not paid for \nthat is added to the debt. If this legislation is enacted, that number \nwill approach $200 billion since we passed pay-go--the much-touted, \nwith much fanfare, as I said, solution that was going to solve the \nfiscal woes of our country and suggest a different way of doing things \nin the Congress.\n  Well, anything but that has happened. On the contrary, every time we \nhave had a major piece of legislation, pay-go has been waived. We waive \nit. We declare everything an emergency. Now everything is an emergency \nand nothing gets paid for, and the debt continues to grow, and the \ndebt-o-meter, the spend-o-meter around here continues to spin faster \nand faster and faster, and the credit card is handed to future \ngenerations who are going to have to deal with our inability to live \nwithin our means.\n  So the alternative we offer to the legislation before the Senate \ntoday that is being put forward by the Democratic majority is, as I \nsaid, very simple and very straightforward. It does a number of things. \nIt does all the things we need to do in terms of extension of \nunemployment insurance, of the physician fee--making sure that cut does \nnot occur, that the physician reimbursement issue is addressed, as I \nsaid, through the end of the year 2012--as well as extending these \nexpiring tax provisions that are very important to our economy and to \nour economic growth.\n  But we do that in a different way. We take $37.5 billion of the $50 \nbillion in unobligated stimulus funds and use those funds to extend \nexisting tax and benefit provisions. We cut money from the government \nby reducing congressional budgets. I think it is fair that when the \nAmerican family, the American business community, and people across \nthis country are making hard decisions about their own personal \nbudgets--their family budgets, their business budgets--having to figure \nout where they are going to cut back, the least we in Congress can do \nis to scrub our budgets and figure out what we can do to reduce \nspending.\n  So we cut money from the government by reducing congressional \nbudgets. We rescind unspent Federal funds. There are lots of \nappropriated moneys out there that do not get spent that revert back or \nget spent later. What this amendment simply says is, if moneys that \nhave been appropriated have not been spent, then let's use that money \nto pay down the Federal debt. Let's do these things we need to do here, \nand then let's make sure we are not continuing to spend and spend and \nspend, particularly dollars that are not needed. It requires the \ngovernment to sell unused lands and to auction off unused equipment.\n  It also imposes a 1-year freeze on the salaries of Federal employees \nand eliminates their bonuses and caps the total number of Federal \nemployees at current levels. I have a modification that would amend \nthis legislation because there has been a concern raised that it would \nmean nobody could get a raise, even those who deserve it. What the \nmodification would do is allow Federal agencies and managers \nflexibility to determine how they are going to work within their \npersonnel budgets to provide, perhaps, raises for those who have been \ndeserving. But, overall, their top-line number would be frozen. So it \nis not as if no Federal employee ever would have to go without any kind \nof a raise. But we think it is important that the Federal Government go \non a diet, just as the family budget is having to do right now as well. \nWe also collect $3 billion in unpaid taxes from Federal employees.\n\n  We encourage responsibility and prioritizing within the Federal \nbudget by requiring a 5-percent across-the-board discretionary spending \ncut for all agencies, except at the VA and the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\n  Again, there has been a lot of suggestion that somehow this is going \nto wreck the economy and force--as I saw some things out yesterday--\nthat this is going to force a government shutdown. What this amounts to \nis a 2-percent reduction through the end of this fiscal year, which is \nSeptember 30. I do not think, out of a $652 billion budget, that if you \nare a good manager at these Federal agencies, you could not find 2 \npercent to shave in order to achieve the savings we need to pay for \nthis legislation. It encourages responsibility and prioritizing as well \nby saving $5 billion in eliminating what is nonessential government \ntravel. And it eliminates bonuses for poor-performing government \ncontractors.\n  Finally, it does create a new deficit reduction trust fund where \nrescinded balances and moneys saved through this amendment will be \ndeposited for the purposes of paying down the Federal debt.\n  Now, I said this the other day, and I will say this again: I think \nthis ought to be a no-brainer for us here. Irrespective of which side \nof the political aisle you are on, you undoubtedly are hearing from \nconstituents across this country who are very concerned about the \namounts of spending, the amounts of debt, who are concerned about \nincreasing taxes, particularly businesses. We hear a lot about \ninvestment frozen on the sidelines because investors are concerned \nabout the uncertainty that exists out there with regard to taxes and \nwhat they are going to do in the future.\n  Clearly, this bill, as I said earlier, raises taxes. It raises taxes \nby about $50 billion in the current version of it. What we would do is \nreduce the tax burden by extending these expiring tax provisions but do \nit in a way that does not require new taxes on investment, new taxes on \nsmall businesses, new taxes on our economy at a time when we can least \nafford it, when we ought to be looking at ways to keep taxes low and to \nmake sure we are doing everything possible to lessen the burden on our \nsmall businesses, those job creators in our economy.\n  One of the things that was mentioned, and we do in our legislation, \nis we do address one of the issues with regard to health care. I think \nthe Senator from Montana characterized that lowering the affordability \nthreshold for the individual mandate will strike at the heart of health \ncare reform.\n  Well, first off, let me just point out that this amendment was taken \ndirectly from an amendment that was filed by Senator Schumer during the \nFinance Committee markup of the health care reform bill. I do not think \nhis intention was to strike at the heart of health care reform. I \nthought the heart of health care reform was to make sure people have \naccess to affordable coverage. I do not think that was Senator \nSchumer's intent. I think he was thinking we ought to make sure low-\nincome people were not forced to buy unaffordable coverage simply \nbecause of health care reform and because they needed a way to finance \nhealth care reform.\n  This amendment would make sure individuals and families are not \nsubject to an intrusive and burdensome new Federal mandate if they \ncannot afford health insurance. So it is a fairly straightforward \nmodification to the health care legislation which takes away some of \nthe burden that is imposed on people at lower income levels. In fact, \nit makes a lot of sense to me. If you look at the current health care \nbill, under that bill low-income individuals--those under 300 percent \nof the Federal poverty level--are slated to pay about $1 billion in \nmandate penalties.\n  Now, the suggestion was that somehow, if we make this change, \ninsurance premiums are going to go up. Well, I am telling you \nsomething. We tried to make this point many times during the course of \nthe debate on health care reform. Insurance premiums are going up. In \nfact, PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted this week that health care costs \nare going to continue to rise at an unsustainable rate--next year by \nabout 9 percent. So it is already clear that health care reform is not \ngoing to live up to many of its promises. It is going to continue to \nraise premiums for most Americans. And that has a lot more to do with \nthe health care reform, the substance of that, than anything else. It \ndoes not have anything to do with what we are trying to accomplish here \nby, as I said, reducing the impact of the individual mandate on low-\nincome individuals in this country.\n  So these are all fairly straightforward reforms. We do touch medical \nmalpractice reform. We think that is something that should have been a \npart of health care reform and was not that would help reduce health \ncare costs for people in this country and achieve some savings we can \nuse to, again, help pay down the Federal debt, help address the \nconcerns we need to address with this legislation.\n  But bottom line, as I said earlier, what we are looking at here is a \nvery clear choice for U.S. Senators. U.S. Senators can choose to solve \nthe problem before us in one of two ways. The first way is through $50 \nbillion in tax increases, $50 billion in additional debt, and over $100 \nbillion in additional spending--or about $100 billion in additional \nspending. The alternative I offer cuts taxes by $26 billion, reduces \nspending by $100 billion, and cuts the Federal debt, reduces the \nFederal debt by $68 billion, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  In my view, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, there is \nnothing more important to our economy than dealing with this cloud of \ndebt, this huge burden that hangs over our economy of out-of-control \nFederal spending, out-of-control Federal debt, deficits that are over \n$1 trillion or at $1 trillion as far as the eye can see, the concern \nabout tax increases on our economy and how those would impact our small \nbusinesses and their ability to create jobs. So this legislation, \nagain, deals with the issue of the debt, deals with the issue of taxes, \ndeals with the issue of spending, and accomplishes all of the \nunderlying objectives we all have of extending unemployment benefits, \nof dealing with these expiring tax provisions, and dealing with the \nimpending reduction in physician reimbursements.\n\n  So with that introduction, I reserve the remainder of my time. I \nthink we have other speakers who want to come down, and I look forward \nto hearing from them as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might ask if the Senator from New \nHampshire wishes to speak.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman's request. I \nwish to speak for 5 minutes in support of the Thune amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to congratulate the Senator from \nSouth Dakota for his amendment. This is a responsible way to approach \nthis issue.\n  The amendment to the bill that is before us, offered by the \nDemocratic leadership, adds $50 billion to the deficit; that is $50 \nbillion to the debt. That is $50 billion our kids have to pay so we can \nspend money today on politically attractive things. On top of that, the \nbill, as proposed, has some onerous tax policy in it which will \nsignificantly contract economic activity in this country by taxing \npeople at ordinary income for activity which has historically been \ntaxed at a capital gains rate, thus forcing people to be less \nincentivized to go out there and be productive and create jobs. It is \npoor tax policy.\n  So the Senator from South Dakota has come up with a proposal, which \nis the way we should be governing now, which is to pay today for the \nthings we want to spend on today. We are facing a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit--$1.4 trillion--this year. Next year, we are facing an equally \nlarge deficit. Under the President's budget and the budget of the \nDemocratic leadership, we are talking a $1 trillion deficit for as far \nas the eye can see. The debt of this country is going to double in 5 \nyears under the President's and the Democratic budget--double. It is \ngoing to triple in 10 years. A child born at the beginning of the Obama \nadministration arrived in our Nation with an $89,000 debt--$89,000. By \nthe time my colleagues on the other side of the aisle get finished, \nshould the President be reelected, under the terms of his budget that \nchild is going to have a $200,000 debt to pay. Why? Because we keep \ngetting bills like this: $50 billion here, $100 billion here, $25 \nbillion here; money being spent without being paid for and, therefore, \nbeing added to the deficit\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\nand to the debt. It is totally wrong. It is unfair. It is unfair that \none generation should do this to another generation, and it is \ncertainly not responsible government.\n  We had a big debate in this Chamber about 2 months ago now about how \nresponsible the other side of the aisle was going to be on spending. \nThey called it pay-go. It should have been called fraud-go because as a \nvery practical matter, that is what it has become. This bill games the \npay-go rules of the Democratic leadership to the tune of $50 billion by \ndeclaring it an emergency on items that are not emergencies, that we \nknow exist and that have been spent on now for quite a while. Since \nthat bill was passed, that pay-go bill, which allegedly was going to \nrequire this Congress to pay for all the money it was going to spend, \nthe other side of the aisle has brought forward, or is in the process \nof bringing forward, $200 billion of spending which is not paid for--\n$200 billion in spending which will be added to the deficit and to the \ndebt. That is totally irresponsible.\n  So the Senator from South Dakota has it right, as he so often does. \nHe has said: Let's do this responsibly. If we are going to spend this \nmoney, if we are going to put forward these extenders, if we are going \nto spend this money on these different social initiatives, let's pay \nfor them because they benefit us today and we shouldn't pass the bill \nfor them on to our children tomorrow, next year, and 10 years from now. \nThis is responsible budgeting.\n  I congratulate the Senator from South Dakota, and I look forward with \nenthusiasm to finally voting for a bill around here that is paid for, \nwhich is what we should be doing every day instead of spending money we \ndon't have and passing those bills on to our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, could I inquire how much time we have on \nour side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 35\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors of this \namendment Senators McConnell, McCain, Isakson, Bond, Enzi, Cornyn, \nBarrasso, Roberts, Coburn, Chambliss, Scott Brown, and Judd Gregg.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to be here to cosponsor and \nsupport my friend from South Dakota, Senator Thune, on this amendment. \nAs the Senator from New Hampshire just stated, isn't it time we stopped \nburdening our children and our grandchildren with massive debt?\n  Our office is being flooded with calls concerning the extension of \nunemployment benefits. We want to extend the unemployment benefits \nunder this amendment until November, but we want to pay for it. We want \nto do something groundbreaking around here that hasn't happened in a \nlong time: We want to pay for it. We want to pay for the expiring \nunemployment provisions until November. We want to extend the expired \ntax provisions, including a tax credit for research and \nexperimentation, and the State and local sales tax deduction through \nthe end of the year. We want to drop the tax increases, drop the $4 \nbillion extension of Build America bonds, and drop the $24 billion in \nState Medicaid bailouts. We want to fully pay for this with spending \ncuts. The amendment does provide relief for the doctors by adding an \nadditional 2 years to the doc fix and reforming our broken and onerous \nmedical malpractice system.\n  Let me point out that day after day during the ObamaCare debate we \ncame to the floor and said: You are using phony assumptions as to \nassessments of the entire cost of ObamaCare, and part of that was the \n``doc fix'' which wasn't going to happen, which was going to cut \nMedicare payments to physicians by some 21 percent. We said every time: \nYou are not going to do this. You are not going to cut physician \npayments by some 21 percent for doctors who provide care for Medicare \nenrollees. Over on the other side, they even admitted it. So now we \nhave to do the doc fix. We have to make sure doctors who treat Medicare \npatients are adequately reimbursed; otherwise, they will stop treating \nMedicare patients.\n  So it is kind of hypocritical for us to be blamed for the delay in \nthe ``doc fix'' when that was the assumption--that was the assumption, \nthat there would be a 21-percent cut in the selling of ObamaCare to the \nAmerican people.\n  This amendment saves the taxpayers $113 billion in unnecessary \nspending. It rescinds $38 billion in the unobligated spending of \nstimulus funds. It cuts wasteful and unnecessary government spending. \nIt collects the unpaid taxes of Federal employees. It freezes their \nsalaries and caps their numbers. It imposes a 5-percent, across-the-\nboard cut in government spending for all agencies except the VA and the \nDOD, and it creates a new deficit reduction trust fund where rescinded \nbalances and monies saved through this amendment will be deposited for \nthe purposes of paying down the Federal debt.\n\n  Now, regarding the 5-percent across-the-board cut in government \nspending for all agencies except Veterans and Department of Defense, do \nAmericans know the size of government has doubled since 1999; that the \ncost of government has spiraled out of control? A 5-percent cut would \nbe minuscule as compared to the dramatic increases we have imposed--\nyes, during the previous administration, as well as this \nadministration--including a $1 trillion unpaid-for Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program.\n  So this amendment cuts taxes, it cuts spending, and it reduces the \ndeficit. The deficit has now spiraled so far out of control that there \nis no rational economist who believes this is sustainable without some \nkind of profound financial crisis. Now we are up to a projection of a \n$16 trillion deficit by the end of the next decade. We are amassing as \nfar as the eye can see--I think now it is up to $1.6 trillion--debt \njust for this year alone that we are laying on our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  As I have said several times on this floor, there is a revolution \ngoing on out there. It is a peaceful revolution. It has been derided by \nthe liberal left and many in the media. But the fact is, they are angry \nand they have every right to be angry. They have every right. The \ngreatness of America is that every generation has passed on to the \nfollowing generation a better Nation than the one we inherited. With \nthis overwhelming burden of debt and deficit in the name of economic \nstimulus, in the name of job creation--which, obviously, has not met \nthe predictions at the time of the passage of the stimulus package--\nhave turned out to be totally false.\n  So here we are. We are in a situation where we have an opportunity to \nextend the expiring unemployment provisions, extend the expired tax \nprovisions, including an important tax credit for research and \ndevelopment. It drops things such as Build America bonds. Build America \nbonds. Please. Right now, that is just an additional $4 billion. We are \ngoing to cut spending, and we will provide relief for doctors by adding \nan additional 2 years for the doc fix.\n  Obviously, that fix needs to be enacted. I am in support of that. But \nisn't it a little bit of a hypocrisy to come to the floor and say we \nhave to get this done, we have to have the doc fix, when all during the \ndebate on so-called health care reform, the 21-percent cut for Medicare \npatients was part of our selling the American people that the cost of \nObamaCare would be less than $1 trillion? Isn't that a little \nhypocritical?\n  I wish to quote from the New York Times recently:\n\n       If the economists are divided about what just happened, the \n     rest of the world is not divided about what should come next. \n     Voters, business leaders and political leaders do not seem to \n     think that the stimulus was such a smashing success that we \n     should do it again, even with today's high unemployment.\n\n  There is no better example than last May's unemployment numbers that \nshow a drop from 9.9 to 9.7, until you get into the not-so-fine print: \n41,000 jobs created in the private sector, and 440 new jobs, \napproximately, to hire census takers. That is what the stimulus is all \nabout? Give me a break.\n  So this is our chance. This is our chance to show the American people \nthat we are going to cut their taxes, we\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nare going to take care of the unemployed, we are going to make the doc \nfix, and we are going to at the same time cut spending and start at \nleast a beginning attempt to get this burgeoning deficit under control. \nIt reduces the deficit by some $68 billion.\n  Are there tough things in this measure? Of course. Of course there \nare tough things in this measure. But it is about time we started \nmaking some tough decisions because we do have an obligation to our \nchildren and our grandchildren which we have, up until now, clearly \nabrogated.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider voting for this amendment and get \nus on the path toward reducing this debt burden we are placing on \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to take over for Senator Thune, \nif I may. I want to cover for a moment what Senator Gregg talked about, \nbecause we are looking for the pea under the pinochle shell.\n  We passed, on February 12, pay-go. On February 24, we borrowed $46 \nbillion outside of pay-go. We said it didn't apply. On March 3, we \nborrowed $99 billion and said it didn't apply. On March 2, it was $10 \nbillion and we said it didn't apply. In April, it was $18 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. After passage of legislation that was trumpeted \neverywhere that from now on we were going to pay for additional \nspending, how could that happen?\n  Mr. COBURN. It happened because we waived the pay-go rules and we \nwere outvoted. The pay-go rules are a farce.\n  On May 27, $59 billion. With the new bill, another $50 billion. So 46 \nand 18 is 64, 74, 173, 193, 262, and now 50--that is $312 billion added \nto the deficit this year above the $1.5 trillion we are already going \nto run.\n  We get criticized all the time--and I specifically do--as the party \nof no. Here is what we have offered: Reduce the national debt; this \nbody said no. Sell unused property; this body said no. Reduce the \nprinting costs, which is $4 billion, and we can save printing this, \nwhich nobody reads, and it is all on line; this body said no. Freeze \ntotal Federal pay for right now until we get out of the mess we are in; \nthis body said no. Living within our means--an amendment that said we \nhave to live within the revenues that come in--this body said no. \nComplying with pay-go; this body said no. Cut agency overhead costs; \nthis body voted no. Cut Congress's own budget; this body said no. These \nare all recorded votes. Eliminate corporate welfare; this body said no. \nStop the bridge to nowhere, that happened 4, 5 years ago but this body \nsaid no. Make Federal employees pay taxes; they owe $3 billion in \nunpaid taxes and we have no enforcement, but this body said no. \nConsolidate duplicative government programs that do the same thing. \nThere are 70 programs to feed the hungry, 105 programs for math, \neducation, science, and technology incentives--6 different agencies--\nthis body said no. Eliminate bonuses for failed contractors in the \nprivate sector who don't perform, which is $8 billion a year; this body \nsaid no. Decrease nonessential government travel, which saves $5 \nbillion a year; this body said no. Require the Department of Energy to \nsave energy; ironically, they are the worst offender in the Federal \nGovernment in terms of wasting energy, and this body said no.\n  Isn't it interesting that, with 41 votes, we offer these things and \nevery time they are rejected? They are commonsense things that \neverybody else in America expects us to be doing, but this body says \nno.\n  Why should we do the Thune amendment? I heard the chairman of the \nFinance Committee say a minute ago that having a 5-percent cut across \nthe board in all of the agencies, except the VA and the Defense \nDepartment, would wreck the Federal Government. He obviously isn't \naware that President Obama has asked his own agencies to do exactly \nthat. All Senator Thune is doing in this amendment is what the \nPresident is asking the agencies to do. But do you know what. This body \nis going to say no. We bring forward a bill that only spends $50 \nbillion of our children's money instead of $78 billion or $88 billion, \nwhich was defeated yesterday, as if that is some big deal.\n  This body is going to pass it. They are not going to say no to \ngrowing the government, to spending money that we don't have, to giving \nadvantage to those who are well heeled and connected. They are not \ngoing to do that. We have lost control of what is important in America. \nIf we were to pass the Thune amendment today, do you know what would \nhappen? The international financial community would get the first \nsignal from the American Congress that we are starting to make some \nsteps toward austerity--the first signal. We don't have any out there \nnow.\n  Yesterday, it was reported that the M3 money supply in this country \nis at the lowest level of GDP since 1932. Do you know what that \npredicts? It predicts that the economy is going to slow rather than \nincrease. That predicts a double dip recession. We have tried \neverything Japan tried for 10 years, and it didn't work. It is a lost \ndecade in Japan. It is stimulus money and not failing to cut the \nspending of the government. We are going to do that again. We are going \nto continue to increase the government.\n  People may say, why would you want to freeze total Federal wages? \nWell, it is easy. The average Federal employee in the United States \ntoday makes $78,000 a year. They have benefits of $40,000 a year. The \naverage private sector employee makes $42,000 a year and has $20,000 \nworth of benefits. Shouldn't we, when we are running a $1.6 trillion--\nit is not $1.4 trillion because we have added $200 billion, and we are \ngoing to add another $50 billion with this. When we are running that \nkind of deficit, shouldn't we say, time out, no increases, except for \nstellar performance, in the Federal Government, until we get our house \nin order? But this body is going to say no again. They are going to say \nno.\n  The question is, what can we do to fix our economy? Borrowing money \nthat we don't have to spend on things that we don't absolutely need is \nnot the answer to solving the problems with our economy. The answer is \nfor us to live within our means, create a stable environment where \nbusiness will invest and can plan on what is coming next from Congress. \nWe have them so skittish that they won't spend. That is the reason we \nare going to have a double dip recession. That is the reason the money \nsupply has shrunk in spite of zero percent interest rates at the \nFederal Reserve--because people will not take a risk, because we are \nnot leading with something that gives them confidence about the future. \nWe have to change that.\n  I will end with this. That is the party of yes. Increase the national \ndebt, yes. Violate pay-go, yes. More corporate welfare, yes. Increase \nthe debt limit, yes. Fund the bridge to nowhere and every other earmark \nlike it, yes. Increase Congress's own budget at a time when we should \nbe austere, yes. Tax breaks for special interests, yes. Borrow \nbillions--not billions, but trillions--from our grandchildren, yes. \nCreate duplicative government programs, yes. Finally, create a lower \nstandard of living for us, our children, and our grandchildren.\n  That is not what we are about, except that is what the Baucus bill \ndoes. It thinks in the short term and ignores the long term. It ignores \nthe reality that this government has to get smaller for us to not \nbecome Greece. It plays the games that are typical of Washington, which \nthe American people are rejecting.\n  One final word about doctors, having been one and practiced for over \n25 years. What is happening out there right now? What is happening out \nthere now is the same kind of confusion that is happening in the \nbusiness community. Doctors are saying: I can no longer take a Medicare \npatient. You are going to give me an extension for 6 months, but there \nis no guarantee that in 5 or 6 months I am going to have the revenue I \nneed to keep an office open to care for Medicare patients. So what is \nhappening? Medicare patients all across this country are going and \nfinding out their doctors no longer take Medicare.\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n  We saw, earlier this week, when HHS released the first of the \nthousands of regulations that between 87 million and 127 million \nAmericans aren't going to get to keep the insurance they have. They are \nnot going to under the grandfather clause. So what we are doing is \nsending every mixed signal possible to not create stable planning, \npositive input, and positive attitudes about what can happen positively \nin this country. We have to send a signal to the doctors. The Thune \namendment pays for a doctor fix until 2012. It gives them a chance to \nsay, yes, I will stay in Medicare; I can afford to stay in Medicare. If \nwe don't do that, we are going to have hundreds of thousands of \nMedicare patients who no longer have the doctor they have had for \nyears. It is not because the doctor wants to turn away the patient, but \nbecause the doctor has to turn away the patient because they can no \nlonger afford to care for Medicare patients.\n\n  So we play this game and bring to the floor a bill with $50 billion \nthat we are going to charge to our grandchildren, and we have bought \nthe votes off so we can pass it, and we are still doing the same thing. \nWe are still expanding the Federal Government, we are borrowing against \nour future, we are lowering the standards of living of our children, \nand we are creating a mockery of the American dream.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I may need 3 or 4 or 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield as much time as the Senator wishes to consume.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, when I was appointed to the Senate, I made a promise \nto myself not to let this opportunity pass without helping to recognize \nthe contribution made to this Nation by its government workers. This is \nwhy I began my weekly ``great Federal employee'' series last May.\n  In all my years working as a Federal employee, I have met so many \nwonderful individuals who have dedicated their careers to working for \nthe American people. So many are deserving but will not make it onto \nthe poster I bring to the Senate floor each week commemorating great \nFederal employees simply because there are so many of them.\n  Over the years, as I have witnessed countless acts of personal \ncourage, devotion to country, and real sacrifice, I have also seen and \nheard such disheartening and baseless attacks against those who choose \nto serve.\n  The pending amendment is just the latest assault. It comes on the \nheels of a new myth being peddled on television, on talk radio, in \nprint, and on this very floor--the allegation that somehow Federal \nemployees are overpaid; that their salaries have been rising unfairly \ncompared to those with similar jobs in the private sector; that we \nshould freeze or cut their pay or lay them off; that we should make it \nnearly impossible to hire any new government worker at all.\n  Before I rebut these arguments piecemeal, I remind my colleagues and \nthe American people what we are talking about. This is not an exercise \nin the abstract. There are concrete facts. There are names, faces, and \nreal life stories of achievement and hard work.\n  Nearly 2 million wake up every day and go to work for the American \npeople, for their neighbors, their friends and family, for folks they \nhave never met or will never meet.\n  They do it for substantially less pay than the same job in the \nprivate sector and with considerably more at stake. As I have said \nbefore, there are no Wall Street bonuses, and there is rarely ever \nrecognition for their hard work. For many, working as a Federal \nemployee is a tough choice.\n  In his keynote address at the annual dinner on Monday honoring the \nwinners of this year's Arthur S. Flemming Awards for public service, \nNIST physicist Dr. William Phillips--whom I honored as a great Federal \nemployee this past December--told his audience about a colleague who \ndecided to work for the Federal Government. This scientist had been \nworking most of his early career in the private sector. At a certain \npoint, he realized it was more important for him to make a difference \nand serve his country, so he went to work in a government lab.\n  He told Dr. Phillips that, to do so, he took a pay cut that was a \nfactor of 10.\n  That is 10 times less pay. I am sure it was a difficult decision, but \nultimately he made the choice to work for his country.\n  I met an appointee the other day who is taking a 95 percent pay cut. \nI have constantly been amazed by the number of highly skilled and \nhighly experienced individuals willing to take 20, 40, 60 percent \nsalary cuts to work in the Obama Administration. These political \nappointees join the career personnel, so many of who would also be \nmaking much more in the private sector.\n  Just look at some of those I have honored as great Federal employees \nthis past year.\n  By the way, I do not pick the people at the top of the spectrum. When \nI honor a great Federal employee, it is at any level in the government. \nAnybody who does their job well should be honored. We have so many \ngreat Federal employees who operate at all levels of government that I \ntry to honor them all.\n  I am hard pressed to think of any who would not be making a lot more \nin the private sector. Not only do we have brilliant physicists such as \nDr. William Phillips who won a Nobel Prize. We also have those such as \nBrian Persons, the executive director of NAVSEA who has spent his \ncareer designing and maintaining our Navy's ships and who holds an \nengineering degree from Michigan State. Or Erica Williams, an \nenforcement attorney with the SEC with a degree from the University of \nVirginia Law School, who I am sure could be making a lot more if she \nworked for a Wall Street firm. Or Judge Timothy Rice, a Temple Law \nSchool graduate who could have chosen to work as an attorney in private \npractice but, instead, went to work for the Justice Department and on \nthe Federal bench.\n  I am not saying that all Federal employees earn 10 times less than \ntheir private sector counterparts. I am not even saying all Federal \nemployees earn less.\n  Still, those who claim that Federal employees are making more on \naverage than private sector counterparts simply don't have all their \nfacts straight. We know how these things happen. In this case, much of \nthe data used to make these claims are from a USA Today study a few \nmonths ago, which analyzed findings from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics.\n  The big problem with that study is that it is both highly selective \nof the job categories compared and it fails to take into account the \ndemographics of our Federal workforce.\n  The number of employees in various private sector job categories \ndwarfs that of the Federal Government, skewing salary data lower for \nthe private sector, where there are more minimum wage jobs. Also, a \nlarge number of Federal jobs require highly specialized skills and, as \na result, employees are often older and more educated than the average \nworker in comparable private sector roles.\n  Many Americans do not realize that about 20 percent of Federal \nemployees hold a master's or professional degree, compared to 13 \npercent in the private sector. Fifty-one percent of Federal employees \nhave at least a bachelor's degree, while this is true for only 35 \npercent of the private sector workforce.\n  In the words of Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for \nPublic Service which, by the way, is a nonpartisan organization this is \n``not an apples-to-apples comparison.''\n  You cannot simply ask what the average salaries for budget analysts \nare in the private sector and for budget analysts in government. The \nsame goes for librarians or statisticians or paralegals.\n  The occupational categories might be called by the same name, but the \nwork is very different. There are different skill sets required, \ndifferent types of experience necessary.\n  When actual job tasks are compared, few government jobs have exact \nequivalents in the private sector.\n  Contrary to what many have said, Federal workers' salaries are \nactually\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\nlower, not higher, than those in the private sector.\n  Indeed, the Federal Salary Council reported last October that Federal \nemployees were making an average of over 26 percent--less--than those \nin the private sector doing comparable work. Moreover, this represents \na widening of the private-public pay gap from the previous year, \ncontinuing a recent trend.\n  However, this line of attack continues from those who routinely \ndisparage the role of government. Unfortunately, it has become all too \ncommon to criticize Washington by defaming the civilian employees who \nwork across our government.\n  Federal employees continue to serve as a convenient scapegoat. That, \nessentially, is what this amendment does. It assigns blame and does not \nreally address the budgetary problems we face.\n  It reminds me of an amendment proposed by one of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle when we were considering the health insurance \nreform bill. It would have mandated that ``for each new bureaucrat \nadded to any department or agency for the purpose of implementing the \nprovisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the head \nof such department or agency shall ensure that the addition of such new \nbureaucrat is offset by a reduction of one existing bureaucrat at such \ndepartment or agency.''\n  In effect, we would have to fire a Federal worker to hire one. This \nso-called ``bureaucrat offset'' amendment--using a word that has \nbecome, unfortunately, pejorative in our political discourse--was bad \nenough.\n  The Thune amendment, with its blanket pay freeze and hiring caps, \ntakes this a step further, prohibiting any Federal agency from hiring a \nnew employee until one retires.\n  At a moment when we are faced with a difficult choice about how to \nreduce our deficit and get our economy moving again, this amendment \nrepresents an easy cop-out.\n  All those who blame Federal employees for our Nation's problems or \nbelieve that cutting their salaries or capping their number will in any \nway solve those problems remain averse to making difficult decisions.\n  The cuts to the Federal workforce in the Thune amendment would only \nsave the taxpayers a meager amount compared to what we need to save. \nIts provisions on the Federal workforce and the ongoing, gratuitous \ndisparagement of America's public employees from many directions \nconstitute a dangerous distraction from the very tough steps we as a \nnation must take.\n  The greatest challenges we face today--the gulf spill, two wars, \ncarbon pollution, illegal immigration, market volatility--all of these \nwill be tackled by hardworking Federal employees.\n  All of these challenges require a readiness on our part to make \ndifficult choices. Scapegoating and playing the blame game won't get us \nanywhere.\n  Federal employees know firsthand about making tough choices. They do \nso every day. Many of the great Federal employees I have honored from \nthis desk came to my attention because they faced difficult tasks, took \nrisks, and achieved great accomplishments. Some of those I honored have \nserved overseas in dangerous regions; one gave his life while working \nfor USAID. One left a lucrative private sector job after September 11th \nto join the Justice Department as an anti-terror prosecutor. Others \nimmigrated to this country from places like Afghanistan and Vietnam and \nbecame Federal employees because they wanted to give back to the \ncountry that took them in as refugees.\n  These stories go on and on. They are as diverse and numerous as this \ngreat country of ours.\n  Additionally, all of my honorees share with every other government \nemployee the experience of making that initial decision to pursue \ngovernment work hardly an easy one to make considering the sacrifices \ninvolved.\n  Ultimately, those who support Federal salary cuts and hiring caps \nmistakenly view our civil service as a cost. Rather, it is an important \nnational resource with real benefits for all of us.\n  At the end of the day, I must remind my colleagues that it is our \noutstanding Federal employees who will carry out the programs we pass \neveryday in this Chamber. We will continue to count on the Federal \nworkforce to keep our skies safe for travel, our troops provisioned and \nveterans cared for, our schools held to high standards, and our \nhomeland secure.\n  Woodrow Wilson, as a young political scientist during the civil \nservice reform debates of the 1880s, advocated for a system of public \nadministration because he believed that the conditions of modernity \nrequire it in order for a democratic state to function at its best.\n  Indeed, our civil service has developed into one uniquely suited to \nour needs and incorporating America's best constitutional traditions. \nWe have a Federal workforce of which we can be proud.\n  Federal employees play a critical role in our national life and, \nthrough their work, exemplify so many of our Nation's great values. \nThese include exemplary citizenship; industriousness; a willingness to \ntake risks; perseverance; modesty; and intellect.\n  Contrary to popular myth, most Federal employees work outside of \nWashington. In fact, no State--and I include the District of Columbia--\nno State is home to more than 8.5 percent of the total Federal \nworkforce. Our government employees work in communities large and \nsmall, spread out from coast to coast and overseas.\n  One of the challenges we face is a Federal retirement boom. As the \nbaby boomers get older, the Office of Personnel Management has \nestimated that one-fifth of the Federal workforce will retire by 2014. \nThis comes at the same time that more new hires are needed in mission-\ncritical jobs dealing with public health, national security, \ntransportation safety, financial regulation, and many other important \nareas.\n  Now is not the time to talk about laying off Federal workers or \nfreezing their pay. We should be talking about how to invest in \nrecruiting the next generation of Federal employees.\n  The scapegoating and baseless attacks against Federal workers only \nserve to demoralize those who are on the front lines of confronting our \nnational challenges. It also discourages talented young Americans from \nmaking that difficult choice whether to start a career in service to \ntheir country.\n  Let me reiterate. Federal employees make less than those in the \nprivate sector, not more. They represent some of our very best and \nbrightest, a dedicated and hard-working group of Americans across this \ncountry. We need to recruit a new generation of government workers to \nhelp us tackle great challenges, and unfairly labeling Federal \nemployees as a problem fails to realize their important role in finding \nso many solutions to the very difficult problems we face. The pending \namendment's pay freeze and hiring restrictions will do almost nothing \nto reduce our deficit; rather, its effect on our government's ability \nto address serious issues will be disastrous.\n  For those looking to shift the blame for our troubles and who have \ntheir sights on America's Federal employees, I suggest look elsewhere.\n  For those who want easy, let's-deal-with-this-later answers and are \nlooking for a convenient distraction, I say look elsewhere.\n  For those who support this amendment, for those who habitually shy \naway from making the tough choices we in this Chamber need to make, I \nsay, though, look no further than the public employees you so casually \nfault.\n  They know how to make tough choices.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that it be charged against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in response to the comments of my \ncolleague from Delaware, I do not think anybody is denigrating the \nquality of Federal employees. To the contrary. We are all Federal \nemployees. We all know Federal employees. We are all friends of Federal \nemployees. And we\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\nhave a lot of Federal employees who do a great job.\n  All we are simply saying is when you are in a tough economy, \neverybody ought to look at what they can do to live more within their \nmeans. When we are running a $1.5 trillion deficit this year and \ntrillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, Lord knows we ought \nto be looking within to figure out what we can do to try and find some \nsavings that we can use to either pay for the things we need to do or \nperhaps pay down the Federal debt which, as I said, my amendment does.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4376, as Modified\n\n  Also, because I think there is a concern that somehow every Federal \nemployee is going to be frozen, I have a modification to my amendment \nthat addresses that concern.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the changes at the desk \nbe incorporated into my amendment. For the information of my \ncolleagues, these are changes to section 403, and they address the \ncriticisms.\n  The amendment would prohibit increases in salaries or bonuses for \nFederal civilian employees. The changes that are at the desk will allow \nsuch increases and bonuses to occur so long as agencies do not exceed \ntheir fiscal year 2009 budget for salaries.\n  This is a unanimous-consent request. This would address the concerns \nraised by some of my colleagues on the other side about making sure \nFederal agencies have adequate flexibility with salaries and bonuses to \naddress those employees they think are deserving of pay raises. All \nthey have to do is live under that top-line number that gives them \nflexibility as a Federal manager and to work within it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I may say to my friend \nfrom South Dakota that this sounds a lot like wage price controls, \nwhere the Congress is trying to decide the wages of all kinds of \ndifferent sectors based on, I don't know what. A lot of trap lines have \nto be run before this request can be granted. So at this point, Madam \nPresident, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I simply offer that modification to my \namendment to address the concern that every single Federal employee is \ngoing to be capped at some level for some foreseeable period of time. \nThat is not the intention.\n  In fact, what the modification would do is ensure that within the \noverall budget--within the top line--a manager could make adjustments \nto individual employee salaries or bonuses if that is something they \ndesire to do. It just means the Federal Government--the agency--is \ngoing to have to live within a certain number at the top line. They can \nwork within that salary number beneath that top line. That is all it \ndoes.\n  Again, what I have said before, and I will reiterate for the benefit \nof my colleagues, is that I think we have a responsibility to be \nfiscally responsible in Washington, DC. As I said before, we have \npeople all over the country making hard decisions with regard to their \npersonal and family budgets, with regard to their small businesses, and \nthey are having to reduce employee salaries, for example, and they are \nhaving to make reductions in force and let people go. Those are hard \ndecisions to make. Surely in Washington, DC, where we have seen year-\nover-year increases in Federal spending, in discretionary domestic \nspending, that exceeds inflation by six times--look at the fiscal year \n2010 and fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills and the increases that \nwere allowed--21\\1/2\\ percent in those two appropriations bills, at a \ntime when inflation was 3\\1/2\\ percent. How can we justify increasing \nspending over 20 percent in Washington, DC, when the rate of inflation \nin our economy is 3\\1/2\\ percent and people all over the country are \nhaving to make cuts? It is high time Washington, DC, and the Federal \nGovernment went on a diet.\n  That is not to say anything to denigrate or impugn the quality of \nFederal employees. As I said before, there are a lot of Federal \nemployees who do a great job. All this is simply saying we in \nWashington, DC, ought to lead by example. There is great power in \nexample, and we have not been providing the example for the American \npeople. We are asking them to make these hard choices, but we are not \nwilling to make those choices ourselves.\n  So I think this amendment gives Members of the Senate an opportunity \nto say yes to fiscal responsibility, yes to living within our means, \nyes to paying for what we spend money on, and yes to not handing the \ncredit card to our children and grandchildren. These are not Draconian \nideas; these are fairly straightforward savings that we would achieve \nsimply by shaving a little bit from these Federal budgets--making sure \nwe rescind those stimulus funds that haven't been spent or haven't been \nallocated to pay for this new spending. We use those funds that have \nbeen appropriated but not spent to finance some of what we are doing \nand then apply that to pay down the Federal debt and freeze some of the \nFederal agencies in terms of their budgets and ask for a 5-percent \nreduction in some of these agencies over the course of the next \nforeseeable years.\n  Those are all fairly straightforward steps I think anybody would take \nif they were trying to get back within a reasonable budget to address \nwhat are very serious concerns about the amount of spending and the \namount of debt we are piling on future generations. So I am sorry the \nmajority is resistant to accepting the amendment. It would address the \nconcern that was raised by a couple of our colleagues on the other \nside.\n  It wasn't my intention to impose a very restrictive straitjacket-type \napproach on Federal managers. On the contrary, we think there should be \na top line budget, that we ought to be able to live within it, and \ncertainly managers can make decisions within that about how best to \nallocate those resources. Congress has actually blocked its own pay \nraise in the past 2 years, so it seems to me that is at least something \nwe could apply to other areas of our Federal Government as well.\n  So, again, I think the whole purpose behind this amendment is simply \nto create an opportunity for Senators to vote for fiscal \nresponsibility, to vote for paying for the things we spend money on in \nWashington, to vote for living within our means, and to vote for not \nadding billions and billions of dollars to the Federal debt, which is \nalready at $13 trillion and growing by the day.\n  It seems, at least to me, this is an opportunity for us to \ndemonstrate to the American people that we are serious about getting \nWashington's spending and debt under control. This amendment addresses \nthe issue of unemployment insurance and extending that, addresses the \nissue of expiring tax provisions, reduces taxes by $26 billion, \naddresses the impending cut in physician reimbursements that would \noccur if Congress doesn't take action, but it does it for 2 years \nlonger than what the legislation of the majority would do. We address \nthat up to the end of the year 2012.\n  So it takes care of all those things, and it does it in a fiscally \nresponsible way by reducing spending by over $100 billion, as I said \nbefore, by reducing taxes, by keeping taxes low on small businesses, \nwhich are the job creators in our economy. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it reduces the Federal debt by $68 \nbillion. That is a win-win for the American people--the American \ntaxpayer--and it should be a win-win for the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, and with that, \nMadam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, may I inquire as to how much time remains \non each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota has 6 \nminutes, and the majority has 34 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might ask the Senator from South \nDakota, through the Chair, whether he wishes to renew his request to \nmodify his amendment because I might tell him, through the Chair, that \nthe amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I will renew my request to so modify my \namendment, and I appreciate the manager accepting that change.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification to amendment No. 4376 is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 403. TEMPORARY ONE-YEAR FREEZE ON COST OF FEDERAL \n                   EMPLOYEES SALARIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total \n     amount of funds expended on salaries for civilian employees \n     of the Federal Government in fiscal year 2011 shall not \n     exceed the total costs for such salaries in Fiscal Year 2009: \n     Provided the amounts spent on salaries on members of the \n     armed forces are exempt from the provisions of this section; \n     Provided further, nothing in this section prohibits an \n     employee from receiving an increase in salary or other \n     compensation so long as such an increase does not increase \n     any agency's net expenditures for employee salaries.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first let me thank Senator Baucus for \nyielding time that he has for me to speak. I appreciate that very much.\n  I want to support the Thune amendment. The Thune amendment is a \nresponsible approach both to the things we need to do but also that \nneed to be offset in ways that do not add to our deficit or raise \ntaxes. It includes all of the major priorities that have been accepted \nby both sides here--by the Democratic Party's version of the extender \nbill as well as the things Republicans wish to do--but it is fully paid \nfor. It cuts wasteful spending and doesn't raise a dime in taxes.\n  The underlying proposal that the chairman of the committee has \npresented to us would increase spending by $126 billion. It includes \nover $70 billion in new taxes. That, by the way, is a net tax increase \nof $48 billion. It increases the deficit by $79 billion over the next \n10 years.\n  That is the approach that we think is wrong. That is why Senator \nThune has proposed an alternative that we will be voting on here in \nabout 25 minutes, that I think takes the correct approach. It cuts \ntaxes by $26 billion by extending current law. It cuts spending by over \n$100 billion. It actually reduces the deficit by $55 billion, all \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, which of course is \nnonpartisan.\n  I want to add a point about the notion of offsetting spending \nincreases or so-called paying for those increases. There are a couple \nof things that are done in the Baucus substitute that I think need to \nbe pointed out because they are not an appropriate way to offset the \ncosts of spending under the bill.\n  In one of them, we take the oilspill trust fund that is supposed to \ncontain money in it to take care of oilspills when the company's \nmoney--for example, British Petroleum's money--runs out and have the \nGovernment assist in cleaning up an oilspill when that fund is supposed \nto exist for that purpose, to clean up the oilspill. Today this is a \ntax--it is 8 cents per barrel--for the companies to pay into that fund. \nUnder the Baucus substitute that would be raised to 49 cents per \nbarrel. It may well be that we need to raise the tax on the oil \ncompanies for the trust fund to pay for oilspills but that is what it \nshould be raised for, to pay for the oilspills, not to pay for \nsomething totally unrelated in this legislation. Because if we do that \nthen when it comes time to tap the trust fund to pay for the oilspill, \nthe money has already been spent on things other than what we raised \nthe money for in the first place. So that is not an appropriate way to \npay for part of this legislation.\n  The second thing is, this is putting off the problem to the future in \norder to take care of a more immediate need. It has to do with the fact \nthat we have to pay for physicians who take care of Medicare patients. \nThis was a problem that should have been addressed in the health care \nlegislation. It was not. As a result, all of the payment for physicians \nin Medicare was put off to be dealt with at a later time. Now is the \nlater time except we do not want to do it now either, apparently.\n  The payment for Medicare has already expired. There is not enough \nmoney and has not been enough money for the last couple of weeks to pay \ndoctors to take care of Medicare patients. We are simply holding their \nbills. But within the next few days we are going to have to pass \nsomething that allows payment of those doctor fees to take care of \nMedicare patients. The idea here was to try to get that to at least a \n2- or 3-year period. The last version coming from the Democratic side \nwas, I think, 18 months or so. The idea is to try to deal with that \nproblem so we do not have to come back and keep dealing with it every \ncouple of months or so.\n  As I understand the latest proposal, we are now only going to deal \nwith that to November of this year. Clearly right after the election we \nare going to have to come back in a lame duck session. That will make \ncertain we will have a lame duck session because we will have to act on \nthis yet again. Why would we do it that way? It is not the responsible \nway to do it, obviously. It is to reduce the cost of the legislation \nhere so we do not have to have as much in the way of offsets.\n  I appreciate the fact we are trying to reduce the size of the bill, \nbut we are only fooling ourselves by reducing this particular element \nof the bill. We ought to be reducing other elements of this legislation \nrather than the physician payments because we know those bills are \ngoing to come due and we are simply putting off the inevitable.\n  The final point of criticism of the chairman's bill is the way it \ndeals with something called S corps. These are generally small \nbusinesses run by an individual--a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant who \nhas a couple of employees. We are trying to raise--not we, not we, the \nmajority is trying to raise money by changing the tax treatment for \nthese particular legal entities. In order to do what? To raise $11 \nbillion.\n  I submit that rather than trying to find a way to raise $11 billion, \nand in this particular case it does not work, we ought to be reducing \nthe cost of the legislation by $11 billion or finding offsets, such as \nSenator Thune has found in his legislation, that do not result in bad \ntax policy.\n  The net result is that, with all due respect to the chairman--again I \nthank him for yielding his time so that I could speak against his \nlegislation--I do not think it is the right approach. I think we are \ngoing to have to go back and get this right or we are not going to be \nable to move forward or to proceed to the consideration of his \nproposal. I think a better approach is the Thune proposal.\n  As I said, we will have a chance to vote on that here in a minute and \nI hope my colleagues will support the Thune proposal as more fiscally \nprudent, as not adding to the deficit, not increasing taxes, and not \nmaking bad tax policy.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for yielding his time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time is remaining to each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 20 minutes 40 seconds.\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is 20 minutes 40 seconds on our side; zero seconds \non the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, my understanding is that we are headed \ntoward a noon vote, perhaps a little bit ahead of that. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have about 3 minutes to close debate on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, actually I think we are \ngoing to probably vote earlier than that. I just wonder how much time \nis remaining on the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Zero minutes remain.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No time remaining on the other side. There is no time on \nthe side of those who wish to speak in favor of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 15 minutes on the \nSenator's side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And no time remaining on the side of those who wish to \nspeak in favor of the Thune amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is about 15 minutes remaining on this side. I \nwonder if my friend from South Dakota, who wishes to speak in favor of \nthe amendment, even though his time has expired, may want to speak \nfavorably about the Baucus substitute, or, if he wishes to speak on his \nown amendment, he can point out some of the good points of the Baucus \nsubstitute at the same time; otherwise, I have no objection.\n  But to be fair to my side, too, and given the time constraints that \nwe might have, I can only give 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will proceed accordingly and try to conclude this in \n2\\1/2\\ minutes. That, unfortunately, does not give me enough time to \nsay favorable things about the substitute of the Senator from Montana.\n  But I do want to close the debate on this amendment by saying that I \ndo think this presents to us a very clear choice about how to \naccomplish what this legislation strives to accomplish; that is, as we \nhave all talked about--something I think both sides agree on, Democrats \nand Republicans--extending unemployment benefits to those who have lost \njobs; extending expiring tax provisions that are currently in law, such \nas the research and development tax credit, that are important to our \neconomy and to our competitiveness; and, finally, making sure the \nreduction or the cut in physician reimbursements under Medicare does \nnot go into effect.\n  So those are basically the elements we are talking about today in \nterms of the things we are trying to get done. The difference occurs as \nto how we would propose paying for that. The Democratic majority has \nput forward their proposal which does include tax increases, about $50 \nbillion now in the current version of it in tax increases. It does \nraise the debt by about $50 billion, adds more onto the Federal debt, \nnotwithstanding the commitment to pay for things under the pay-go rules \nthat were enacted in the Senate, and it does increase spending \nsubstantially.\n  What I am offering as an alternative for Senators to vote on is an \napproach that is very different. It reduces taxes. There are no tax \nincreases in it. The tax reductions occur because of extending existing \ntax law, actually reducing taxes by $26 billion.\n  It reduces the Federal debt, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, by $68 billion, and it reduces spending by $100 billion. As I \nsaid earlier, I think it is important the Federal Government go on a \ndiet. We have all kinds of issues, and Americans across this country \nhave lost jobs, unemployment is at a high rate, people are having to \nmake decisions. There has been a loss of income. They are reducing \ntheir personal budgets, their family budgets, their business budgets.\n  Here in Washington, DC, we continue to spend and spend and spend like \nthere is no tomorrow and hand the bill to future generations. So this \nis the debate. It is a clear difference in approach, and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of fiscal responsibility, vote in favor \nof paying our way, vote in favor of living within our means, and vote \nin favor of reducing the debt on future generations.\n  So I would ask my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment. \nI yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think it is good to again remind my \ncolleagues what is in the Thune amendment and why it is not good policy \nand why it should not be adopted. First of all, it would call for a 5-\npercent cut in most of government. The Defense Department is exempt; \nthe Veterans Department is exempt but not other sections. Homeland \nSecurity comes to mind. Law enforcement comes to mind. Border Patrol \ncomes to mind. There are various areas that would be cut 5 percent \nacross the board arbitrarily.\n  Second, it would impose harsh caps on medical malpractice damages, \nthe so-called tort reform. The Thune amendment includes tort reform in \na way that is unthought through, very harsh caps that would, frankly, \nresult, according to the CBO, in more deaths in America.\n  The Thune amendment would also cut the number of people insured under \nhealth care reform. It would reduce the number of people insured under \nhealth care reform. I do not think many people would like that part of \nthe Thune amendment to stand alone and of itself.\n  Moreover, the Thune amendment cuts back Recovery Act funds. That \nendangers jobs. The Congressional Budget Office made it very clear that \nthe Recovery Act does create jobs; it lowers unemployment. The Thune \namendment would go in the opposite direction of preventing job \ncreation, of encouraging high unemployment. That would be the effect of \nit.\n  The Thune amendment also shields the oil companies and multinational \ncorporations from paying their fair share of taxes. I do not think, \nespecially with the gulf oilspill, many Americans want to shield the \noil companies from paying their fair share of taxes, from paying funds \ninto an oil liability trust fund to pay for future oilspills. I think \nAmericans also do not want to shield multinational corporations from \npaying their fair share of taxes.\n  There are loopholes in current law that multinationals take advantage \nof. I think most Americans would not like these loopholes to continue. \nThe Thune amendment continues those loopholes.\n  So for all of those reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to not \nsupport the Thune amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I raise a point of order \nagainst section 701 of the Thune amendment pursuant to section 403 of \nS. Con. Res 13, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2010.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I come to the floor again today to talk \nabout the situation in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Yesterday, I came to report on my meeting with the President of the \nUnited States, as well as Jeff Miller, our Governor, and ADM Thad \nAllen, that we had on Tuesday in Pensacola. I am pleased to report what \nthe President has done with this fund. It is a good idea to get the $20 \nbillion in claims that can be made and can be paid.\n  However, there is another issue. The most pressing issue right now is \nkeeping the oil off the coast of the gulf. We do not have a handle on \nthis situation with the skimmers. We just met with Admiral Allen, and \nthe information isn't any better than it was 2 days ago. In fact, for \nFlorida, the information appears to be worse.\n  On Tuesday, there were 32 skimmers, according to the Florida \nDepartment of Environmental Protection and the Florida incident command \noff the coast of Florida--32. There is a plume of oil 2 miles wide and \n40 miles long off the coast of Pensacola. There is another plume that \nranges from Pensacola, FL, all the way over to Fort Walton, and we had \n32 skimmers. Today, the report is we have 20 skimmers--20 skimmers. \nThat is like me and my buddies getting in our boats out there and \ntrying to clean this up. That is not the Federal Government doing its \nbest effort to clean up this oilspill.\n  The incident command from the Coast Guard's report says there are \n100-some skimmers off the coast. It is unclear whether those are off \nthe coast of Florida or completely off the coast. It could be the coast \nof all of the States. I asked Admiral Allen to clarify that. He said he \nwould.\n  Admiral Allen tells us there are 2,000 skimmers in the United States \nof America. Why aren't those skimmers, where available, steaming toward \nthe Gulf of Mexico? He said he is going to put a process in place where \nwe can request them. It has been 60 days since the oil started \nspilling. Why are we waiting until now to request skimmers? Why are we \ncontacting Governors now to request skimmers? Why are there only 20 \nskimmers off of my home State when we have this huge mass of oil?\n  The State Department reported Tuesday morning that 21 requests have \ncome in from 17 countries--rather, 21 offers of support from 17 \ncountries to give us skimming equipment. The State Department says they \nhave been declined. I talked about it to the President on Tuesday and \nAdmiral Allen, and they say: No, it is not true; we have gotten things \nin from other countries. What is the truth? What is the answer? Are we \nrefusing foreign country assistance or not?\n  Now there is this thing about, we are going to have a process to let \npeople request waivers of the Jones Act. We are 60 days into this. On \nMonday, I sent a letter to the President, along with Congressman Jeff \nMiller, asking for the Jones Act to be waived. Why aren't we doing \neverything possible to bring skimmers to the Gulf of Mexico? What is \nthe problem?\n  I am going to come to the floor of the Senate every day we are in \nsession until this oilspill stops, until every drop of oil is cleaned \nup, and make a point about this skimmer issue. It is not acceptable. \nWho is in charge of this? Is it the President? Is it Admiral Allen? Is \nit BP? Who is in charge? There are only 20 skimmers off the coast of \nFlorida. It doesn't make any sense. Somebody has to do something about \nit. In my position, what I can do is complain, and that is what I am \ndoing today and will continue to do. I am going to press Admiral Allen \nand this administration to get as many skimmers there as possible. We \nneed engagement from this administration on this issue, and no other \nquestion should be answered until we find out where all those skimmers \nare.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to thank Senator LeMieux for \nraising this matter.\n  I was at the Alabama gulf coast on Friday. We were told there was a \nbatch of oil 30 feet wide, 2 miles long that they could see coming onto \nthe shores of the beaches that had not yet been hit in any significant \nway. In my mind, a good skimmer, even at 1 or 2 miles per hour, could \nget every bit of that, virtually. I first thought skimmers wouldn't be \nthat effective. I assumed the oil would be very thin and it would come \nin and be hard to skim, but apparently it is coming in patches and \nbunches, which makes it more skimmable than I had originally thought.\n  The admiral, whom we spoke to less than an hour ago, indicated that \nhe was requesting of the Navy, as I heard what he said, a certain \nnumber of skimmers, and they had 400, and we haven't gotten them yet. \nPerhaps some plan somewhere calls for them to have skimmers in this bay \nor this harbor in case something happens, but when we have a national \ncatastrophe as we have going on, every one that could possibly be \nspared should have already been moved to the gulf coast. I really feel \nas though this is a frustrating event. It is more serious than I had \nrealized.\n  Also, I think there are several thousand worldwide that have not been \nasked for that could be asked for. So I think we can do better. I am \ngoing to find out if the decisionmaking process is so bureaucratic that \nfor no good reason, we have been delayed in receiving help that could \nmake a big difference on the gulf coast.\n  I asked him about President Obama's speech last night. As a result, \nhe made comments----\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, would my friend yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5065-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5065-S5066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Our Governor has called up 300 National Guardsmen, and \nI think it needs to be done under title 32, which is Federal status \nunder State control.\n  The President on Tuesday evening said:\n\n       I have authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National \n     Guard members along the coast. These service men and women \n     are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, clean \n     beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing \n     claims, and I urge the governors in the affected states to \n     activate these troops as soon as possible.\n\n  Well, the Federal status under State control is the procedure by \nwhich the Guard people operate under State control, which eliminates \nsome of the prohibitions on military people being used, Federal \nmilitary people being used for nonmilitary matters, and it allows \npayment by the Federal Government.\n  I guess I would just say that this is not worked out yet. As a matter \nof fact, Governor Riley has personally been engaged in this, and I have \nbeen so proud of his leadership. He has called these guardsmen for some \ntime and has been requesting that they be approved under title 32.\n  The Admiral told me today that there are still bureaucratic \nproblems--the Department of Defense says this and some law says this. I \nwould just say that the Commander in Chief, the President of the United \nStates, said: Call them up and let's get busy about it. And I hope \nsomehow this can be taken care of promptly, as it is impacting the \nbudget of the State of Alabama in a significant way.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair. And I thank Senator LeMieux for \ndriving home the problem that, to me, is most inexplicable; that is, \nour failure to maximize our ability to have skimmers available to \nprotect our beaches.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I just wanted to speak for another \nmoment, if I may, and compliment my colleague from Alabama, who has \nbeen very vigorous on this issue. I appreciate his voice to make sure \nwe find out what is going on with these resources, especially as he \nspoke about the National Guard, which is an important topic.\n  To follow up on my comments before, I have two documents that I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS17JN10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS17JN10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, these are two documents from yesterday. \nI spoke a moment ago of 20 skimmers. That is a Thursday document; this \nis the Wednesday document.\n  This is the Snapshot Report No. 22, Deepwater Horizon Response, \nWednesday, June 16, from the State of Florida's Governor Crist to Dave \nHalstead, State coordinating officer. This says, as of yesterday, 32 \nskimmers off the coast of Florida. The report we have from today has \n20, so that is a drop of 12.\n  This is the National Incident Command Daily Situation Update, Shore \nOperations--Florida panhandle, Department of Homeland Security \ndocument.\n  It says there are 110 skimmers. We just found out that is for the \nentire gulf coast. What is being reported to us is that there are 110 \nskimmers for the entire gulf coast. Thirteen of those skimmers are off \nof Florida. We are told that those 13 are encapsulated within this \nnumber of 32. As of yesterday, 32; as of today, 20. Only 110 skimmers \nare off the entire gulf coast to fight this problem.\n  We are calling upon this administration to get its act together. We \ncommend them for this fund yesterday. That is good work. We give credit \nwhere credit is due. But we have to stop this oil from coming to shore. \nThese skimmers can do the job.\n  If there are 2,000 skimmers in this country, why aren't they headed \nto the gulf? If there are thousands of them around the world, why \naren't they headed to the gulf? This question must be answered as \nquickly as possible.\n  My colleague from Alabama and I and others will continue to come to \nthe Senate floor and urge this administration to get on top of this \nproblem and get these skimmers where they need to be.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Before the Senator leaves, I will ask a question to my \ncolleague, because he has come to this lately. He might share with us--\nthe Senator has had personal conversations with Admiral Allen, the \npoint person, about this for some time, has he not? We still have \ndifficulty getting firm numbers, as the Senator pointed out, about how \nmany might be available and what prospects we have for the arrival of \nmore skimmers, is that correct?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. That is correct. We have been talking to the Coast Guard \nfor weeks about trying to muster every skimmer available to the gulf \nfor not just Florida but for Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. I met \nwith the President, Admiral Allen, Governor Crist, Congressman Jeff \nMiller, and other State officials in Pensacola. We met for an hour. I \nasked about the skimmers and about the report from the State \nDepartment, and I asked: Did we decline foreign assistance? I asked \nabout the skimmers. He said that, of course, Admiral Allen wants to get \nas many skimmers as possible, and he is working on it. That sounds \ngood, but we need results. It is not just about effort; we need \nresults. These reports are showing that we are not getting the results.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Does the Senator understand that Admiral Allen has the \npower--or the President does--to enter into Jones Act waivers that need \nto be entered into, and that presumably could be done in a matter of \nminutes or hours? What is holding this up? Has the Senator been able to \nascertain that?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I don't know what is holding it up. The Jones Act is not \na barrier. That can be waived. The Jones Act was waived, as I \nunderstand it, after Katrina. There is power under the U.S. Code--I \nbelieve it is 46 U.S. Code, section 500, but I will check that--that \ngives the ability of agency heads of the Federal Government to waive \nthe Jones Act.\n  The President and Admiral Allen tell us there are ships that have \ncome from foreign countries. I hope that is true. I assume it is if \nthey told us that. Why is the State Department on the one hand \nreporting that they are declining offers of assistance from 17 \ncountries, and then we hear some ships are being used?\n  It comes back to the point my colleague, Senator Nelson from Florida, \nmade about having a command and control unit. I am believing that \nAdmiral Allen is running this operation, and I like him and commend him \nfor his service. But we obviously need to have a better top-down \ncontrol situation here so that we get some results.\n  Every person in America has to be scratching their head as to why \nthese skimmers aren't there. Why aren't there hundreds of them off the \ncoasts of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi? We just \ncelebrated the anniversary of Dunkirk a couple days ago, where the \nBritish civilians took their boats out and rescued the British soldiers \nwho were retreating, and saved the day. Why aren't there boats there to \nsave the day for the gulf coast?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, has the Senator ascertained that anybody in our \ngovernment is scouring the world and the United States to try to move \nevery single skimmer that could possibly be brought to the gulf coast? \nIf not, we are awfully late, wouldn't the Senator think? Shouldn't that \nhave been done weeks ago?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. That is a great point. There doesn't seem to be a sense \nof urgency. Job 1 is stopping the oil from leaking, and job 2 is \nstopping the oil from coming ashore. They are doing some good work. The \nPresident tells us that by the end of the month 90 percent will be \ncontained. Let's hope that happens. Let's stop the oil from getting on \nour beaches, in our estuaries, our coastal waterways. The best way to \ndo that with booming is skimming. As the Senator mentioned, skimming is \nworking and the oil is able to be skimmed. Why are we waiting to ask \nGovernors? As Admiral Allen told the Senator and me a moment ago, they \nare going to put in a request to Governors to free up skimmers. There \nare skimmers around the country that have to be on duty because there \ncould be a spill someplace else. They have to request waivers. One, why \nare we waiting until now? Two, that is like saying your house is \nburning down, but the fire truck is covering another area in case a \nfire breaks out. Well, the fire is happening now. The skimmers need to \ngo to the gulf now. Why there isn't that sense of urgency and followup, \nI cannot explain.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5069-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5069-S5071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have filed an amendment to the \nunderlying legislation. I know there is discussion about who might get \nan amendment. A lot have been filed. There is negotiation about which \namendments might be made pending and debated. I hope this amendment \nwill be. It has had a long and tortured history. It is an amendment I \noffered when the now-President, Barack Obama, was a Senator, and he \nstrongly supported it. In fact, during his campaign, he talked a lot \nabout this subject. It is the issue of shutting down a perverse tax \nincentive that exists in this country for shipping jobs overseas.\n  We provide tax incentives if you are willing to shut down your \nfactory, fire your workers, and move your product elsewhere; we say we \nwill give you a tax break. That is unbelievable. We have had four \nrecorded votes in the Senate. I have lost all of them.\n  As it seems, many people believe we ought to continue this tax \nincentive. I think we ought to continue to try to get a majority in the \nSenate to agree with the proposition that, at long last, we have to \nstop subsidizing shipping American jobs overseas.\n  On this chart is a description of the ``cool, refreshing taste of \nmint dipped in dark chocolate.'' The ad, by Hershey's, is for their \nYork Peppermint Patty, and it says, ``the cool, refreshing taste of \nmint dipped in dark chocolate will take you miles away.'' Little did we \nknow that it will actually take you to Mexico, because that is where \nthey began to make these mint patties. They used to be American made, \nall-American mint patties. But now they have gone to Mexico. In fact, \n260 jobs were moved to Monterrey, Mexico, as part of a long-term \nHershey's strategy. So that is mint patties. I suppose they\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\nare not as important as, perhaps, automobiles, or jobs that are making \nsophisticated high-tech equipment. But still and all it is mint \npatties.\n  Hallmark Cards, an American company, privately held in Kansas City, \nMO, with a 100-year history in our country. It was founded by a high \nschool dropout who started this company in 1910 with shoe box \npostcards. He sold a shoe box full of postcards, while living at the \nYMCA in Kansas City. This became a fabulously successful card company. \nIn fact, all of us have used Hallmark cards to send a message to \nsomeone. When they say ``if you care enough to send the very best,'' \nthey don't exactly now say where to send it. If you are going to send \nit where they are made, they have gone to China. What kind of a card do \nyou send to a Hallmark employee whose job is now in China, where they \nare making Hallmark cards? So that is mints and cards--probably, as I \nsay, not as important as making automobiles. But those jobs have also \nleft.\n  Making refrigerators. Whirlpool has been involved, as well, in moving \njobs. I have talked about this previously. Whirlpool refrigerators \nmoved jobs all over the world from Evansville, IN. They moved work to a \nfactory in Mexico, even though the company accepted a $19.3 million \ngrant by the U.S. Department of Energy to develop smart appliances. \nThose smart appliances left to go south. So Whirlpool appliances have \ngone to Mexico, and 1,100 U.S. jobs moved to Mexico.\n  This is a picture of a woman named Natalie Ford, 42 years old, who \nworked at a Whirlpool appliance plant in Evansville for 19 years. She \nlearned that her job was moving to Mexico in November of 2009. That is \na photograph of Natalie when she discovered that her 19-year investment \nin this company was over.\n  It was like a punch in the gut, she said.\n  I notice every month we focus on this issue: How many jobs have we \ncreated in this country? How many have we lost? How many people are \nfiling for unemployment insurance?\n  I consider the job thing like a bathtub. You have a faucet that puts \njobs in, creating jobs in this economy, and then you have a drain, and \nit is wide open. We are talking about how many jobs we create next \nmonth, and the drain is wide open. They are going to China.\n  For example, I will show a couple of photographs of where some of \nthese jobs go.\n  This is the home of a Salvadoran worker who makes NFL jerseys. They \nsell for $80 apiece in the United States of America--NFL football \njerseys. Here is the home of the worker. I have held hearing after \nhearing about these issues.\n  This is a Reebok NFL jersey made by a Chinese-owned sweatshop in El \nSalvador. Again, that merges all the best of what we know is wrong with \nthe issue of the migration of jobs--a Chinese-owned sweatshop in El \nSalvador making NFL jerseys for Reebok.\n  I have held hearings, and I have had people who work in El Salvador \ntestify at hearings. I will not spend much time on this because I have \nshown it on the Senate floor so many times. This is Radio Flyer, a \nlittle red wagon made in Chicago. This a 110-year-old company, made by \na wonderful immigrant who loved radios and loved airplanes, built a \nlittle red wagon that every kid in this country has ridden in. What did \nthey name the little red wagon? Radio Flyer, because he liked airplanes \nand radios. We all understand what Radio Flyer means. It means a little \nred wagon that pulls kids. But they are gone. They are not made in \nIllinois any longer. They are all gone to China. Maybe that is OK if \none doesn't care where these things are made and where the jobs are.\n  Finally, Huffy bicycles. I know I have described this company \nforever. But those who worked there were paid $11 an hour, and they all \nlost their jobs--all of them. There is still a Huffy bicycle. All the \njobs went to China. They then declared bankruptcy, and all the pension \nplans of all the people fired in the United States making Huffy \nbicycles, made for decades, were taken over by the Federal Government \nbecause the company declared bankruptcy. Now the Chinese own the brand \nand they make these bikes in China.\n  I know who makes them. They are made by Chinese workers who make 30, \n40, 50, 60 cents an hour tops. They work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours \na day. That is what is happening.\n  I have not described the automobiles and what is happening, or the \nairplanes parts for that matter. The list is very substantial. I have \nspoken about it at great length.\n  I described that Fruit of the Loom underwear left America. Maybe \nunderwear is more important or less important than chocolate mints or \nHallmark Cards. I don't know. Fruit of the Loom is the company that \nused to have the dancing grapes, the red grapes and green grapes people \nwould dress up as. I don't know what kind of people dress up in grape \noutfits. They seem to have fun. They advertised Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear.\n  All of a sudden, there is not any underwear made in the United States \nby Fruit of the Loom. Do you know there is not one pair of Levis made \nin the United States? Not one. Talk about the all-American company, \nbuying your first pair of Levis, buying a pair of Levis for school, \nthere is not one pair of Levis made in the United States. It has all \nmigrated, all gone.\n  Here is the proposition. We stand idly by while month after month \nthese jobs are leaving. I described previously on the floor about an \nairplane trip I took about 4 or 5 months ago. I sat next to a man who \nwas wearing a gym outfit, sweat pants, and so on. He was pretty \ncomfortable on that airplane.\n  I said: Where are you headed?\n  He said: I am heading to Asia. I am going to be on a long trip, 25, \n30 hours, so I decided to dress down.\n  He was wearing one of those sweat outfits.\n  I said: Why are you going to Asia?\n  He said: My company wants to move the jobs and have the products that \nwe buy from the suppliers made in Singapore, Thailand, and China. So I \nam going on a trip to Singapore, Thailand, and China to take a look at \nwhere we can move these jobs to these countries.\n  I thought, here is a guy sitting on a plane, wearing a sweat suit, \nand he is going someplace and there are perhaps thousands of workers \nwhose job is going to be traded away because somebody decided: We can \nmake those kinds of products less expensively if we can find people who \nwill work for 30 cents an hour.\n  Perversely, it is not just that. We have also decided, if they will \ndo that--just shut the door, fire the workers, chain the factory gate--\nwe will give them a big, fat tax break.\n  If you have two companies across the street from each other--both \nmaking the same product, both doing the same thing, both employing the \nsame number of people--and one says they are moving to China, fires the \nworkers, locks the gate, and the other says they are staying here, \nguess what the difference is the next year. If they make the same \namount of money, then the company that stays here pays higher taxes and \nthe company that leaves pays lower taxes. That is the perverse, insane \ntax incentive that exists in our Tax Code.\n  The amendment I have filed deals with the issue of what is called \ndeferral--deferring the obligation to have to pay taxes to a later date \nwhen you repatriate the income. I do not eliminate deferral altogether. \nI eliminate deferral when a company leaves our country to go abroad and \nproduce a product to sell back into our marketplace. If that is your \nmotive, then you ought not get a tax break from this government or this \ncountry. It makes no sense for us to continue this behavior.\n  As I have indicated, I have required votes on this issue. We have had \ndebates and I required votes. There are people in this Chamber who cast \na vote against an amendment such as this and then rush off the floor \nand they will even be the ones who talk about how they support American \njobs.\n  Don't tell me you support an American job if you support a tax \nincentive that moves our jobs overseas. Just don't tell me because it \nis not true.\n  We will again next month, right on the edge of a knife, be wondering \nwhat is happening to this economy by the evidence of unemployment \nnumbers or the evidence of new jobs created. As I said, it is fine, and \nI work with all the people here. In fact, the bill that is on the floor \nis the so-called extender bill, a jobs bill, an attempt to invest in \nnew jobs in this country, incentivize new\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\njobs in this country. To the extent we create new jobs in this country \nand at the same time incentivize jobs running out of the country, that \nis just boneheaded. We cannot keep doing that.\n  At some point, the Congress has to decide, based on some reservoir of \ncommon sense, that we are not going to provide incentives for people \nwho move American jobs elsewhere. We have trouble enough competing with \nlabor conditions that exist, as I have described in those charts, with \na number of circumstances that exist in the hiring of workers in China \nwho you can work 7 days a week, 12, 14 hours a day and, by the way, you \ncan house them and sleep them in a cinder-block room that holds 12 \npeople. That is what is happening. We have trouble enough competing \nwith that, let alone giving a big tax incentive to somebody who says: \nThat is where I want to do my business.\n  I am just saying, I filed an amendment. I know there is a dance going \non here to decide who gets votes and who doesn't. If we are worried \nabout this economy and worried about trying to incentivize American \njobs, we have to vote on this amendment and we ought to pass it with a \nresounding vote.\n  Does anybody here care about whether ``Made in America'' once again \nis something we can put as a sticker on a product? Do we care at all? \nOr is it just that we do not need to make anything? It seems to me \nAmerica's future is to understand and learn from our past that we are a \nstrong, world-class economy only when we have a world-class \nmanufacturing base. We will not long remain a world-class economy if we \ndecide it does not matter what our manufacturing base is.\n  In the previous 9 years ending in 2009, we lost more than 5 million \njobs in the manufacturing base of people who make things. I am talking \nabout people who go to work and take a shower after work. They are on a \nfactory floor and making real products, ``Made in America.'' That has \nbeen the reservoir and source of a lot of good jobs that pay well with \ngood benefits. It always has been. That is what largely expanded the \nmiddle class in this country.\n  Now there is some notion that it does not matter somehow; this is \njust a world economy and it does not matter. Get on your airplane, \nsearch around the planet. Where can you land that plane, open a plant, \nand hire somebody for 30 cents an hour? I tell you what, the question \nof who is going to clear the products that are for sale from the \nshelves in this country is a very interesting question.\n  Mr. Ford, when he opened his Ford plant to begin building \nautomobiles, believed that you ought to pay a wage to the workers that \ngave the workers a chance to buy the product they make. In the larger \naggregate sense, the question is, Who will buy the products on the \nshelves if people do not have jobs? You fire your workers and you make \nHershey's mint patties in Mexico, or you make Hallmark Cards in China, \nor you decide to make bicycles, little red wagons, automobiles, trucks, \nand airplanes elsewhere. Who is going to be on the factory floor \nproducing products in this country? Who is going to earn the wage by \nwhich they become consumers?\n  We are short about 20 million jobs right now in this country, and 20 \nmillion jobs is what we need to put people to work.\n  We have just gone through commencement exercises in this country. \nThere are a lot of kids who put on a cap and a gown with enormous \npride, finally graduated from college, and a whole lot of them cannot \nfind a thing to do. They cannot find work.\n  This President, when he walked across the threshold of the door of \nthe White House, inherited a $1.3 trillion Federal budget deficit left \nby the previous administration. Had he done nothing, had he been Rip \nVan Winkle and slept for 10 months or a year, we were going to have a \n$1.3 trillion deficit. That is what he inherited, and an economy that \nwas in desperate condition.\n  He has done everything he can to try to put this back on track. It is \nhard, and it requires both parties and the best ideas of both. This \nought not be difficult. This idea of stopping this insidious subsidy \nfrom moving American jobs overseas ought to be an idea that takes root \nhere and garners 90 votes, 95 votes. Instead, we have lost the vote on \nthis amendment over recent years four times.\n  I started by saying that President Barack Obama, when serving in the \nSenate, was a supporter of this amendment. He voted for this amendment \nand believed in this approach. He still does. He has talked about it. I \nhope very much we will get a vote in the Senate on this today or \ntomorrow and put the Senate on record as having taken the first step in \ndoing something meaningful to shut the drain and begin the process of \nsaying to people: If you stay here, if you manufacture here, if you run \na plant here and produce a product here, God bless you. We are on your \nside. We are not going to give your competitors who leave and move jobs \nto China a tax break. We are on your side if you stay here.\n  That is what we ought to be doing, investing in American jobs, \ninvesting in products made in our country, investing once again in a \nstrong manufacturing base in order to remain a world-class economic \npower.\n  Madam President, at that point, I have exhausted all of the arguments \nonce again for this amendment, hoping that enough will have listened or \nperhaps be given information that this is a worthy vote if you want to \nstand up for American jobs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5071-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5071-S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMERICAN JOBS AND CLOSING TAX LOOPHOLES ACT OF 2010--Continued\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \nlegislation, which is called the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act of 2010. Sometimes it is spoken of as the tax extenders \nbill. But in reality it is a deficit-extending bill. The reason I say \nthat is because the substitute amendment still adds a reported $55 \nbillion in red ink to the deficit.\n  More deficit spending is simply irresponsible. Our national debt, as \nwe know, is over $13 trillion, and $2.3 trillion of that $13 trillion \nof debt has been added just since the time President Obama has been \nsworn into office. Congress is spending money in a way that would give \ndrunken sailors a bad name--more than $30,000 per household, more than \n$12,000 per household from our children.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the public debt under \nthe President's budget will be at 90 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct by the year 2020--90 percent of our gross domestic product. \nGreece had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 115 percent, and we are getting far \ntoo close for my comfort.\n  Our debt represents a national security vulnerability. I am glad the \nsubstitute amendment retains my amendment, which we voted on earlier, \nto create greater transparency on exactly who owns our debt when we run \nup deficits and add to the debt, and it requires us to then \nperiodically assess the strategic and economic risks associated with \nthat debt. For example, the Treasury Department recently reported that \nChina holds about $900 billion of U.S. debt. So when we spend money \nhere, somebody has to buy the debt. What happens is that China and \nother countries buy that debt, and that creates a potential national \nand economic security issue.\n  The best way to reduce our strategic and economic risks associated \nwith our debt is to stop spending money we do not have. Stop. Every \nfamily, every business in America, when they run out of money, they do \nnot just continue to try to max out their credit card. The problem is \nthat the credit card of the Federal Government knows no limits. Only \nthe Federal Government can continue to print money and rack up debt and \nhope and pray that countries such as China will buy that debt in the \nfuture. It has to stop.\n  America's fiscal mess is not just a math problem. Government debt \ncrowds out private sector investment that instead could help create \njobs for the 15 million Americans who are unemployed. Our unemployment \nrate is\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\nclose to 10 percent. For Hispanics, it is 12.4 percent. For teenagers, \nit is 26.4 percent--the toughest job market for young people in 41 \nyears even though it is summertime and many of them are out of school \nand looking for work. Nearly 9 out of 10 net jobs created in May were \ntemporary jobs created by the Federal Government in hiring temporary \ncensus workers. Only 41,000 net private sector jobs were created in \nMay--an anemic figure, to be sure. According to economist Larry \nLindsey, as much as 20 percent of the net private sector job creation \nin May was due to the oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico--temporary workers \nhired to skim oil off the gulf and to protect our beaches and \nestuaries.\n  We know the administration will, unfortunately, further exacerbate \nthe unemployment situation, particularly along the gulf coast where I \nlive in Texas, by its 6-month ban on offshore deepwater drilling. We \nall understand we have to stop this spewing well. That is job No. 1. \nNo. 2 is we need to make sure we understand what happened and make \nabsolutely sure, as much as humanly possible, that it never, ever \nhappens again. But we also need to be mature enough and aware enough to \nassess what this means if we impose a lengthy ban on deepwater \ndrilling. It means more dependence on imported oil from abroad, from \ndangerous parts of the world, even countries that wish us ill. It also \nmeans jobs here at home will be destroyed because these deepwater rigs \nwill move to other parts of the world, Brazil and other places. \nAccording to the energy industry, more than 46,000 jobs could be lost \nas a result of the moratorium in the short term and 120,000 jobs in the \nlong term.\n  Unfortunately, the policies that are promulgated by the Congress and \nby this Senate have an impact on jobs. They can either be a positive \nimpact and facilitate private sector investment in job creation or they \ncan be job killers. I, for one, worry far too often that what is \nemanating from Washington, DC, these days amounts to job-killing \npolicies, and this underlying bill we are debating has a couple of good \nexamples.\n  We know job creation should be our No. 1 priority when unemployment \nis at historic highs, when people are losing their homes due to \nforeclosure because they simply do not have jobs to be able to pay \ntheir mortgage. But this so-called tax extenders bill actually raises \ntaxes on capital creation and on investment in a way that will hurt job \ncreation. There are two taxes I am referring to specifically, and while \nboth are somewhat technical, it is very important to understand them.\n  The first tax relates to so-called carried interest. Partners in \nprivate equity firms are often paid based on their performance in \naddition to their salary. Under current law, this so-called carried \ninterest is taxed like a capital gain at the 15-percent rate, if we are \ntalking about right now, 15 percent, as opposed to ordinary income, \nwhich is taxed at a much higher rate.\n  The substitute amendment would change the way this carried interest \nis taxed and take it from the capital gains, which is a much more \nattractive rate, which encourages capital formation, encourages \ninvestment, and raise that rate to the highest individual income tax \nrate for ordinary income of 39 percent. What do you think is going to \nhappen when entrepreneurs and investors look at this change in the tax \nlaw from 15 percent to 39 percent? Do you think it will expand or will \nit contract the amount of money invested in job-creating ventures? \nWell, common sense should tell us it will contract it. It will reduce \nthe number of jobs. It will reduce the capital available for \ninvestment. And it is exactly the opposite policy we ought to be \npursuing with high unemployment and people losing their homes.\n  Higher taxes on this type of business activity is bad enough, but \neven worse is another tax that is embedded in this bill called \nenterprise value. These are arcane subjects and, indeed, I felt a \nlittle better yesterday after talking to some of my colleagues on the \nfloor. I said: Do you understand what enterprise value tax is? And \nthank goodness I saw some blank looks on their faces, and they did not \nunderstand it. So I did not feel alone. So we have all had to get a \nlittle bit smart and a little bit better educated. But let me tell you \nwhat I have discovered in the process of my own education. Enterprise \nvalue is known as brand value or good will. It is the value of the \nsweat equity, the hard work owners put into businesses over time.\n  Under current law, when a partner sells his or her interest in a \nbusiness, the enterprise value is taxed as a capital gain. This \nlegislation would change the tax treatment on the sale of that business \nbut only for certain types of businesses. In other words, this bill \ntargets certain types of businesses. But as one writer commented \nrecently--they said they worry that this is a stalking horse or an \nattempt to take all capital gains treatment for the sale of businesses \nand to raise it to ordinary income levels--in other words, to double, \nor more, the taxes on the sale of certain types of businesses.\n  Owners of investment firms and real estate partnerships would be \nsingled out for higher taxes when these businesses are sold. They would \npay much higher taxes than what are paid under current law. Again, why \nshould people care? Why should anyone within the sound of my voice care \nabout what this handful of private equity firms and real estate \npartnerships pay? Well, it is because what this, in effect, does is it \ntakes the seed corn that is used to grow the economy and it destroys \nit. It dries up the money that creates the investment, that then allows \nthe creation of businesses and expansion of businesses to create jobs. \nThat is why all of us should care even if we individually don't have to \npay it.\n  In fact, under this narrowly tailored and targeted and discriminatory \nbill, investment partnerships would be the only businesses in America \nwhere the value inherent in the enterprise would be ineligible for \ncapital gains treatment and instead be hit with the higher tax bill \nwhen the overall enterprise part of it is sold.\n  This legislation would break new ground in taxing enterprise value as \nordinary income and would unfairly tax value accumulated perhaps over \ndecades by small businesses all across America.\n  Supporters of this bill will tell you this proposal is all about \ntargeting the hedge fund managers on Wall Street, suggesting that this \nis payback or due retribution for the havoc a handful of people have \nwrought on the American financial system. But this proposal would not \ntarget the people who caused the financial meltdown. This targeted \nprovision would have a devastating effect on Main Street in Illinois, \nin Montana, in Texas, in Pennsylvania--everywhere around this country.\n  Let me give you an example. Private equity-backed companies based in \nmy State employ about half a million workers. What happens to those \njobs if this legislation becomes law? Well, not surprisingly, a lot of \nthe investors in these private equity firms where the private equity-\nbacked companies get their money are retirement systems such as the \nEmployees Retirement System in Texas and the Teacher Retirement System \nin Texas, both of which have a portion of their assets invested in \nprivate equity.\n  So I ask again: What happens if this legislation becomes law? What \nhappens to small businesses that depend on private equity to grow their \nbusinesses and create jobs? Well, I received an answer to that question \nfrom Donald Brown, the chief executive officer of a medical device \ncompany that has an office in Fort Worth, TX. The name of that company \nis Arteriocyte Medical Systems, otherwise known as AMS. AMS is a fast-\ngrowing company--again, something we ought to want to encourage, not \ndiscourage, by the policies emanating from Washington. Fast-growing \ncompanies create jobs which allow people to provide for their families. \nIn a high unemployment economy, it ought to be exactly the sort of \ngrowth we ought to encourage.\n  This company has an interesting story to tell because it is partnered \nwith the Institute for Surgical Research at Fort Sam Houston in San \nAntonio. Their goal is to improve surgical outcomes for U.S. troops \ninjured by blast burns and to reduce the necessity of amputations. AMS \nhas also grown because private capital equity was invested in this \nbusiness in 2007 and helped them grow from 6 employees to 70 employees, \nwith an average employee salary that exceeds $72,000 a year.\n  Here is what Mr. Brown told me in a letter he sent:\n\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\n\n       By changing the tax treatment of carried interest to \n     ordinary income, [this bill] would penalize entrepreneurial \n     risk-taking and discourage investment in companies like ours \n     that need capital the most.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Brown's letter to me printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is telling and it is also disappointing \nthat the Senate earlier today rejected the Thune alternative, which I \ncosponsored. The reason I say it is telling and disappointing is \nbecause the Senator from South Dakota offered us an option to extend \nmany of these expiring tax provisions, but it would not have enacted \npunitive, economically destructive tax increases--things such as the \nenterprise value tax and the tax on carried interest.\n\n  The option offered to us by Mr. Thune, the Senator from South Dakota, \nwould have continued important expiring tax provisions, including the \nState and local tax deduction, which I must add provides Texans with \nover $1 billion in Federal tax relief annually. That is because we do \nnot have a State income tax, and we are proud of it. That is one reason \nwhy we continue to grow and create jobs while many other parts of the \ncountry do not fare as well. But this at least provides equity to us by \nallowing people in Texas who pay sales tax to write that off of their \nFederal income tax, as other States do when they pay a State income \ntax, to write it off their Federal income tax.\n  But instead of increasing the budget deficit by $55 billion--which \nthis bill does, as it currently has been offered--the option offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota would have reduced the deficit--reduced \nthe deficit--by $68 billion and extended the expired tax provisions.\n  It is baffling to me why we would reject, why the Senate would \nreject, an opportunity to do what on a bipartisan basis we want to do: \nextend these tax benefits for the benefit of the American people, but \nto do so in a way that is fiscally responsible. I just do not get it. \nHence, further evidence of the growing disconnect between what is \nhappening here in Washington in the Congress and what we are hearing \nfrom the American people, who are tired of reckless spending, and they \nare tired of endless debt, and they know a day of reckoning will come.\n  If the Senate adopts the legislation before us, it will send another \nclear message. It will send the message to investment firms and real \nestate partnerships: You have been punished for taking risks, you have \nbeen punished for creating jobs, and you have been punished for \nsuccess.\n  To all other American entrepreneurs--the people we ought to be \nencouraging because these are the people who make the investments that \nallow companies to be started and companies to grow and jobs to be \ncreated, but to all other American entrepreneurs, it will send the \nmessage that it may not have been you this time, but you are next. The \nnext time the big spenders want more money to grow the size of the \nFederal Government, your company, your business, could be the next on \nthe chopping block.\n  To global investors--and we know in a globalized economy there are \npeople all around the world who have a lot of different choices as to \nwhere they want to start their business--unfortunately, to these global \ninvestors, it will send the message, if we pass this bill as written: \nAmerica does not want your business. America does not want your \nbusiness.\n  I cannot think of a more damaging, more destructive message to be \nsent by what we do here in the Congress than sending the message to \nglobal investors: We do not want your business here in America. That is \nbecause our economic rivals, other countries such as China and India, \nand others, offer a much lower tax and offer a much more welcoming \nenvironment when it comes to entrepreneurs and investors from a tax \nperspective.\n  To the 15 million Americans who are unemployed--15 million Americans, \nincluding the 472,000 who filed for unemployment claims for the first \ntime last week--this legislation will send the message that \nWashington's priority is not in creating jobs. Washington's priority is \nto grow the government.\n  I do not think these are the messages we should be sending. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this substitute amendment. We will have a chance \nto show the American people on which side we stand when we have the \ncloture vote on this bill tomorrow morning. Make no mistake about it, a \nvote for this bill will be a vote for killing jobs, for chasing away \ninvestment, for saying America is not interested in your business--at a \ntime when Americans are suffering high unemployment and people are \nlosing their homes because they cannot pay their mortgage payments \nbecause they have lost their jobs, with no end in sight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                          AMS,\n\n                                                    June 15, 2010.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to you regarding an issue \n     in H.R. 4213, now pending in the Senate, which proposes tax \n     increases on Investment Managers that will interfere with job \n     creation and our nascent economic recovery. Arteriocyte is a \n     company that has dramatically benefited from private equity \n     capital, and that investment has enabled us to rapidly grow \n     our company. H.R. 4213 presents a significant risk of harming \n     small companies like Arteriocyte and will reduce our future \n     ability to finance our company's growth especially in today's \n     economy where access to capital has otherwise dried up due to \n     the fallout from the banking crisis that unfolded over the \n     last two years. I strongly support the position that \n     government policy should encourage the investment in \n     formation and growth of small companies, which are \n     responsible for the greatest contribution to new job growth. \n     H.R. 4213, if passed in its current form, will destroy the \n     ability of startups to raise capital and will harm companies \n     like Arteriocyte, by starving investment and reducing job \n     creation.\n       Arteriocyte was started in 2004 to develop commercial stem \n     cell based therapies created for patients ``At Bedside''. As \n     a fast growing medical device company we are committed to \n     providing innovative solutions to patients and medical \n     professionals to address serious unmet medical needs \n     particularly in cardiac, orthopedic and vascular surgeries. \n     We have worked with DARPA on Advanced Theater Blood Pharming \n     initiatives for forward military operations and currently we \n     are active partners with the Department of Defense's \n     Institute for Surgical Research at Fort Sam Houston to \n     improve the surgical outcomes for blast-burn wounded soldiers \n     including amputation prevention. Arteriocyte has benefited \n     from private equity capital, and this investment has enabled \n     us to make our company stronger. In late 2007 we were \n     fortunate enough to receive a private equity investment from \n     DW Healthcare Partners. Over the last two years, as a direct \n     result of that investment, we have increased annual revenues \n     to $16 Million for 2010 (up 45% and 38% annually the last two \n     years). We have grown from 6 employees to 70 across fifteen \n     states. Our 2010 payroll for U.S. employees will exceed $5.1 \n     Million, and our average employee income exceeds $72,000. We \n     are one of the few U.S. based companies that have brought a \n     multimillion dollar business, its technology its and its \n     manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from Mexico. If not for \n     our private equity investment, we would not have grown and we \n     would not have hired 64 people. In fact, without that \n     investment we likely would not be in business today.\n       H.R. 4213, now pending in the Senate, proposes tax \n     increases on Investment Managers that will interfere with job \n     creation and our nascent economic recovery.\n       Our company and our employees urge you and your colleagues \n     to modify this bill to maintain private equity and growth \n     capital incentives in this country. By changing the tax \n     treatment of ``carried interest'' to ordinary income, H.R. \n     4213 would penalize entrepreneurial risk-taking and \n     discourage investment in companies like ours that need \n     capital the most. The pending legislation should characterize \n     carried interest as a capital gain.\n       The House bill will make the United States less competitive \n     globally. Virtually every other nation with which the United \n     States competes treats carried interest as a capital gain and \n     taxes it at rates ranging from 0% in India to 10% in China \n     and 18% in the United Kingdom. The new tax rate contained in \n     the House legislation will create a flight of capital from \n     the U.S. that our nation cannot afford to lose as we seek to \n     grow out of the recession.\n       Finally, the House bill would make investment partnerships \n     the only businesses in America where the value inherent in \n     the enterprise would be ineligible for long term capital \n     gains rates if the overall enterprise or part of it is sold. \n     If our team builds a successful business over decades, then \n     we receive a capital gain on the value we create. It would be \n     unfair and punitive to treat our private equity, real estate, \n     and venture capital partners more harshly. These partners \n     work just as hard as us to create value, and bring the best \n     resource to create that value: capital.\n       Our company encourages you to do everything possible to \n     ensure that the final\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n     version of H.R. 4213 addresses these concerns and preserves \n     strong incentives for investing risk capital in businesses \n     like ours, by treating carried interest as a capital gain.\n       My executive team and I are available to provide you and \n     your staff with more information about how Arteriocyte has \n     benefitted from private capital.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Donald Brown,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Government Oversight\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we have watched with horror the \nunfolding disaster in the gulf. We have seen precious lives lost, hard-\nearned livelihoods hammered, treasured ways of life imperiled. We have \nseen the largest deployment of resources ever against an environmental \ndisaster. We have seen astonishing corporate negligence.\n  But we have seen something else too--something that ought to be a \nlasting lesson from this catastrophe. We have seen the revolting \nspecter of an agency of government subservient to--captive to--the \nindustry it is supposed to regulate.\n  From the Minerals Management Service, which is supposed to regulate \ndeep sea oil drilling, here is what we have seen.\n  From the 2008 inspector general's report on MMS's Royalty in Kind \nProgram, based in Colorado: senior executives steering lucrative \ncontracts to an outside company created by the executives; staff \nfailing to collect millions of dollars in royalties owed to the \nAmerican people and allowing oil and gas companies to revise their own \nmultimillion-dollar bids; staff accepting gifts and money from oil and \ngas companies with whom the office was conducting official business; \nand staff participating in social events with industry representatives \nthat included illegal drug use and sex.\n  From the IG report, the inspector general's report, released last \nmonth on the MMS office in Lake Charles, LA: the district manager \ntelling investigators: ``obviously we're all oil industry,'' employees \naccepting numerous gifts from companies doing business with MMS, \nincluding a trip to the 2005 Peach Bowl on a private airplane, skeet \nshooting contests, hunting and fishing trips, and gulf tournaments; an \nMMS inspector conducted four inspections while negotiating a job for \nhimself with the company that owned those platforms, and finding--guess \nwhat--no violations during those inspections.\n\n  A 2007 inspector general report into the Minerals Revenue Management \nOffice of MMS cited ``significant issues worthy of separate \ninvestigation, including ethical lapses, program mismanagement, and \nprocess failures.''\n  As my hometown Providence Journal wrote in a recent editorial:\n\n       The Deepwater Horizon accident has made it painfully clear \n     that, in its current form, MMS is a pathetic public guardian. \n     Neither it nor BP was prepared for a disaster of this \n     magnitude, and MMS's cozy relationship with industry is a big \n     reason why.\n\n  I agree with the Providence Journal.\n  The scope, the extent, the insidious nature of corporate influence in \nregulatory agencies of government--this question of regulatory \ncapture--is something we should attend to here. It is the lesson, and \nit raises the question beyond the Minerals Management Service: How far \ndoes this corporate influence reach into our agencies of government?\n  The wealth of the international corporate world is staggering. The \nfive biggest oil companies just this quarter posted profits of $23 \nbillion--that is a 23 with 12 zeroes behind it--in just one quarter. \nThe Republican appointees on the Supreme Court just overturned decades \nof precedent and 100 years of practice to give these big corporations \nfreedom to spend unlimited funds in our American elections. Put it to \nscale. Consider $23 billion of pure profits just in one quarter by big \noil, and compare: The Obama and McCain campaigns together spent about \n$1 billion in the last election. Do the math. For 5 percent of one \nquarter's profits, big oil could outspend both American Presidential \ncampaigns. That may be some politician's idea of a happy day because \nthat is who they work to please, but it is wrong and it needs to be \nstopped.\n  But think, if that is what corporate influence could do in a national \nelection, think of what those vast, powerful tentacles of corporate \ninfluence can do to a little government agency such as the Minerals \nManagement Service: Revolving doors to lucrative jobs in the industry \nso you are set for life; sports tickets, gifts, drugs; constant, \nrelentless lobbying pressure and threats of litigation; steadily \ninserting operatives in regulatory positions. Inch by inch, the \ntentacles of industry reach further and further into the regulator, \nuntil it silently and invisibly comes under industry control and \nbecomes the industry's puppet, until it is serving the special \ninterests and not the public interest.\n  This is no new phenomenon. Marver Bernstein wrote about regulatory \ncapture more than 50 years ago. He explained that a regulator tends \nover time to ``become more concerned with the general health of the \nindustry and tries to prevent changes which will adversely affect it,'' \nto become ``passive toward the public interest.'' This, he said, ``is a \nproblem of ethics and morality as well as administrative method,'' and \nhe called it ``a blow to democratic government and responsible \npolitical institutions.'' Ultimately, this leads to what he called \n``surrender: the commission finally becomes a captive of the regulated \ngroups.''\n  If you don't want to go back half a century for a discussion of \nregulatory capture, look to last week's Wall Street Journal editorial \npage where a senior fellow at the Cato Institute writes:\n\n       By all accounts, MMS operated as a rubber stamp for BP. It \n     is a striking example of regulatory capture: Agencies tasked \n     with protecting the public interest come to identify with the \n     regulated industry and protect its interests against that of \n     the public. The result: Government fails to protect the \n     public.\n\n  There is plenty of evidence that the oil and gas industry had \ncaptured MMS. When you have a captive agency, you get what we have \nseen: altering, deleting, or ignoring recommendations from government \nscientists.\n  A draft environmental analysis for drilling in the gulf from May of \n2000 included the haunting prediction that ``the oil industry's \nexperience base in deep-water well control is limited,'' and a massive \noilspill, ``could easily turn out to be a potential showstopper for \nthe'' Outer Continental Shelf ``program if the industry and MMS do not \ncome together as a whole to prevent such an incident.''\n  This unwelcome observation was deleted from the final analysis \npublished.\n  Oil and gas company employees filling out official inspection forms \nin pencil for the MMS inspectors to trace over in pen; nearly 400 \ncategorical exclusions, shielding even deepwater drilling from thorough \nenvironmental review. Cut-and-paste Environmental Assessments were \nprovided by the oil and gas companies. BP's Environmental Assessment \nlisted walruses as a species of concern in the Gulf of Mexico. There \nare not, and never have been in the memory of man, walruses in the Gulf \nof Mexico. When they are writing about walruses in the Gulf of Mexico, \nyou know, No. 1, they are cutting and pasting out of documents in \nAlaska; No. 2, they are paying no attention to what they write because \nthey know it doesn't matter; and, No. 3, they know perfectly well that \nMMS will never catch the fact that they have cut and pasted because \nthey are not looking at it either.\n  MMS adopted wholesale for its oil and gas drilling ``best practices'' \nproposals of the American Petroleum Institute, and then they made most \nof those best practices only suggestions.\n  There has been virtually no enforcement. According to the MMS Web \nsite, between 2000 and 2009, civil penalties averaged less than $130 \nper well per year on our Outer Continental Shelf, and only three \ncriminal referrals were made to the Department since 1990 in the last \n20 years. Add it all up and\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\nthere is no real question: MMS was a captive regulator.\n  So the question is, After all those years of corporate control of \ngovernment in the Bush years, how far-reaching is the insinuation of \ncorporate influence? We know big PhRMA wrote the Bush pharmacy benefit \nlegislation. We know big oil and big coal sat down in secret with Dick \nCheney to write their energy policy. But down below the decks, down in \nthe guts of the administration's agencies, how far were the tentacles \nof corporate influence allowed to reach? How many industry plants are \nstealthily embedded in the government, there to serve the industry, not \nthe administration or the public?\n  Well, how is it looking? It is not looking good. The Securities and \nExchange Commission, for instance, gave up its watchdog role years ago \nand became the lapdog of the big Wall Street financiers, raising \nleverage limits, refusing to investigate Bernie Madoff, and helping to \nprecipitate the biggest financial disaster since the Great Depression.\n  Twenty-nine miners were killed in a West Virginia mine with a safety \nrecord that President Obama called ``troubled.'' The Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration has been described as a ``revolving door'' with \nindustry, staffed by people with mining companies' interests at heart, \neven at the expense of worker safety.\n  The Bush head of MHSA, for instance, oversaw the rewriting of \nregulations in 2004 that allowed conveyor belt tunnels to double as \nventilation shafts, a practice that contributed to a fatal 2006 Massey \nmine disaster.\n  Who knows how far it leads? Think of the timber rights the taxpayer \ngives up every year, the grazing rights, the multibillion-dollar \ncontracts to big government contractors, the oil and coal leases on \nland, the carnival of public wealth at which these big corporations \nfeed.\n  The vital question is this: Are these assets of our Nation still in \nthe hands of servants of the Nation or have the servants of the Nation \nquietly and insidiously become the servants of the big private \ncorporations that want to profit from that public wealth--corporations \nfor whom every dollar of a sweet deal, every avoided expense allowed by \na cozy regulator, every corner cut in safety or environmental \nprotection, goes straight to their bottom line and right into their \npockets. The big multibillion-dollar corporations, is this who we want \nsafeguarding our national assets? Is this who we want controlling \nagencies of the U.S. Government?\n\n  Winston Churchill once said in a phrase I like that history turns on \nsharp agate points. What is the sharp agate point on which the history \nof this gulf catastrophe should turn? What lesson of history, if left \nunlearned after this disaster, are we condemned to repeat?\n  I hope the lesson we learn is this one: that we can never, never \nagain let agencies of the Government of the United States of America \nfall so under the influence of the corporations they are supposed to \nregulate.\n  This government of ours, founded in a revolution pledging the lives \nand fortune and sacred honor of those early patriots; this government \nof ours, which has raised for more than two centuries the promise of \nfreedom in human hearts; this government that lifts its lamp aloft to \nbrighten the darkness of chaos and despair in far distant corners of \nthe globe; this government, whose finely tuned balance, crafted by the \nFounders, has seen us through Civil War and World War, through westward \nexpansion and Great Depression, through the light bulb and the Model T \nand the Boeing 747 and the iPod; this government of ours, formed by \nWashington and Madison, Jefferson and Adams, and led by each of them, \nand later led by Abraham Lincoln and by Harry Truman and by Theodore \nRoosevelt and by Franklin Roosevelt and by John Fitzgerald Kennedy; \nthis American Government of ours should never be on its knees before \ncorporate power, no matter how strong. It should never be in the thrall \nof corporate wealth, no matter how vast.\n  This American Government of ours should never give the American \ncitizen reason to question whose interests are being served. Never.\n  In this complex world of ours, government must protect us in remote \nand specialized precincts of the economy. In those remote precincts, \nfew people are watching, but big money is made. We must be able to \ntrust our government, both in plain view in front of us, and in corners \nfar from sight, to be serving always the public interest, not doing the \nsecret bidding of special interests, of corporate interests because \nthat is where the big money is at stake.\n  Have we now learned, have we now finally learned, with the financial \nmeltdown and the gulf disaster, the terrible price of all those quietly \ncut corners? Have we now learned what price must be paid when the \nstealthy tentacles of corporate influence are allowed to reach into and \ncapture our agencies of government? I pray let us have learned this. \nLet us have learned that lesson. I sincerely pray we have learned our \nlesson and that this will never happen again. But let's not just pray.\n  In this troubled world, God works through our human hands, grows a \nmore perfect union through our human hearts, creates a beloved \ncommunity through our human thoughts and ideas. So it is not enough to \npray. We must act. We must act in defense of the integrity of this \ngreat government of ours, which has brought such light to the world, \nsuch freedom and equality to our country.\n  We cannot allow this government that is a model around the world, \nthat inspires people to risk their lives and fortunes to come to our \nshores--we cannot allow any element of this government to become the \ntool of corporate power, the avenue of corporate influence, the puppet \nof corporate tentacles.\n  I propose a simple device in this country of laws--not men, of rule \nof law--and that is to allow our top national law officer, the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, to step in and clean house whenever an \nagency or element of government is no longer credibly independent of \nthe industries and businesses it is intended to regulate.\n  When a component of government is deemed no longer credibly \nindependent of the corporations or industry it is supposed to regulate, \nI suggest that the Attorney General be allowed to come in and clean up, \nhire and fire and take personnel action to ensure the integrity of the \npersonnel; to establish interim regulations and procedures to ensure \nthe integrity of the process; to audit permits and contracts and ensure \nthey were not affected by improper corporate influence, and if they \nwere, to rescind them where they are not in the public interest due to \nthat improper corporate influence; to establish an integrity plan for \nthat component of government, all subject to appropriate judicial \nreview where private rights are affected. Then the Attorney General can \nget back out, with his or her job done, sort of like an ethics \ntrusteeship or receivership.\n  I will conclude by saying that the damage to America from the \ncorporate takeover of the SEC was nothing short of catastrophic. Just \nin my State of Rhode Island, 70,000 Rhode Islanders are unemployed. \nMany have lost their homes, retirement, health insurance. The toll is \ndevastating. The damage from the corporate takeover of the Minerals \nManagement Service has also been catastrophic. Who knows what \npotentially catastrophic damage lurks in whatever other agencies of \ngovernment that have silently succumbed to corporate takeover but just \nhave not yet exploded in disaster.\n  If the financial catastrophe and the gulf catastrophe and whatever \nother catastrophes lurk have any meaning at all, it is that business as \nusual is no longer enough to stem the tide of corporate influence--\ninsidious, secret corporate influence--in agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment. It is an institutional problem--relentless, remorseless, \nconstantly grasping and insinuating corporate influence. It will never \ngo away. It will only worsen as corporations get bigger and richer and \nmore global, and there has to be an institutional mechanism in place to \nresist it so that it no longer takes a catastrophe to call the failure \nof governance of an American regulator to proper attention.\n  I think this is the right way. If a colleague has a better idea, I am \nmore than willing to listen. But one thing I know is that after an \neconomic catastrophe and this environmental catastrophe, this much, at \nleast, is clear: We can no longer wait for catastrophes to\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\nroot out improper corporate influence in our government, in this \ngovernment of our United States. We have to, at long last, address the \nproblem of insidious regulatory capture of agencies of our government, \ncaptive to the industries they are supposed to regulate.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the next four amendments in order to the Baucus motion to concur, \nwith each of the amendments in this agreement subject to an affirmative \n60-vote threshold; that if the amendments achieve that threshold, then \nthey be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table; that if they do not achieve that threshold, then \nthey be withdrawn; that if there is a sequence of votes with respect to \nthese amendments, then prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form and that after the \nfirst vote, any succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes each; \nfurther, that no intervening amendment be in order during consideration \nof these amendments: No. 4371, Casey; Coburn, No. 4331; Whitehouse, No. \n4324; and that the Whitehouse amendment be modified with the changes at \nthe desk. And the final amendment in this sequence is the LeMieux \namendment No. 4300.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nspeakers be Senator Coburn--does the Senator from Oklahoma have any \nidea how long he will be?\n  Mr. COBURN. A fairly short period of time.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Casey, how long?\n  Mr. CASEY. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Stabenow?\n  Mrs STABENOW. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We need not do a consent agreement. Everybody can watch the \nclock on their own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4331 to Amendment No. 4369\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4331 to the Baucus \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4331 to Amendment No. 4369.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, at this time, I ask that the amendment be \ndivided in the form I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to have his amendment \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that will actually \npay for everything we are doing. It does several things that the \nAmerican people are demanding that we do.\n\n  It discloses the true cost of borrowing and spending that we actually \ndo in this body.\n  It reduces the budgets of the Members of Congress. We had a 4.8-\npercent increase in our budgets. This is going to decrease that by less \nthan a third, making us suffer with the rest of the country in terms of \ntrying to get control of our massive debt and deficit spending.\n  It enacts what President Obama has been asking his own agencies to \ndo: it takes 5 percent from all the agencies, except Defense and \nVeterans Affairs, and says: Cut that amount. The size of the agencies \nhas doubled since 1999. We are asking the agencies to find 5 percent of \nefficiency within their agency to help us not continue to add trillions \nof dollars of debt to our children.\n  It eliminates nonessential government travel. It will save us $10 \nbillion over 10 years. It doesn't eliminate essential; it just says \nthat when you can do a teleconference, you do that. You don't \nnecessarily fly and take a hotel room when you can accomplish it \nanother way.\n  It reduces unnecessary printing and publishing costs of government \ndocuments. That saves us $4 billion over 10 years. Nobody reads these. \nThey are all available online. If we get rid of the ones that don't \nhave to be printed, we save hundreds of thousands of trees every year--\nwhich absorb CO2, by the way--but it also saves us $4.4 \nbillion by not printing stuff we all have on our computers already.\n  In working with the OMB, they are behind what we are trying to do in \nterms of unused and unneeded government property and government \nbuildings. So what it does is it gives us $15 billion in direct savings \nin revenue by getting rid of things that we are spending $8 billion a \nyear on maintaining that we are not using. So we save $15 billion over \n10 years, plus we get the savings of not having to maintain what we own \nbut are not using.\n  We will sell unused and unneeded equipment. We have $\\1/4\\ billion \nworth just sitting there in warehouses. We are never going to use it, \nbut it is sitting there. We can get good prices from the private sector \nthat can go out and utilize this and put it to work.\n  It caps the total number of Federal employees. Why is that important? \nI am a supporter of our Federal employees. We had a speech on the floor \ntoday accusing those of us who want to limit the growth of the Federal \nGovernment in terms of employees and the size, saying we were against \nour Federal employees. We are not. What we are saying is that in a time \nwhen we are running a $1.6 trillion deficit--that is what it will be \nthis year; we said 1.4, but we have already borrowed $200 billion more \nthan that on this floor since February 12--we ought to be getting more \nproductivity out of what we have, not because it is not the right thing \nto do--it is the right thing--but because we cannot afford to be lax in \nanything we are doing today. Every time we don't save a dollar, we are \nnow charging that dollar to our children and grandchildren.\n  It puts a cap on the total number of Federal employees. There is \nplenty of flexibility within the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment has added 160,000 employees in the last 16 months. There are \n441,000 for the census, but that doesn't count them. This is 160,000 \nfull-time Federal employees in the last 16 months. How many more \nemployees do we need? Can we afford more Federal employees at this time \nor should we get more with what we have?\n  We also put a temporary 1-year freeze on total salary. That doesn't \nmean people who work for the Federal Government cannot get a raise. \nThey can. But they need to be more productive and recognized for it. \nBut there should be no more automatic pay increases this next year \nbecause we are running a $1.6 trillion deficit and also because the \naverage Federal employee makes $78,000 a year and has benefits worth \n$40,000. The average private sector employee makes $42,000 a year and \nhas benefits worth $20,000. Freezing that for 1 year will have a \nminimal long-term effect, especially when we saw today that we are \nactually in a deflationary period where the Consumer Price Index went \ndown one-tenth of 1 percent. We had a nine-tenths of 1 percent decrease \nthis year. So the cost of living is not going up; it is going down. All \nwe are saying is, let's do this for 1 year and demonstrate that we \nunderstand the tough choices the public is making and that we are \nwilling to make tough choices.\n  I agree, it is a tough choice. It is hard. But it does not mean that \nstellar employees cannot get raises. They can. That saves $2.6 billion \nthis year, for 1 year.\n  It collects unpaid taxes from employees of the Federal Government. We \nhave employees of the Federal Government who owe $3 billion. It directs \na garnishee of those payments from the Federal employees. These are not \ndisputed. These are not still under negotiation. These are things that \nhave already been agreed to that are owed by Federal employees to the \nFederal Government. That gets us $3 billion that we do not have.\n  We also have a section that excessive duplication and overhead within \nthe Federal Government should be eliminated. Two easy examples: Across \n60\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\ndifferent agencies, we have 70 different programs to feed people who \nare hungry. Why do we have 70? Why don't we have 7 or one? Not one of \nthose 70 programs has a metric on it to see if it is effective in what \nit does.\n  We have 105 programs across seven different agencies that incentivize \nat the cost of billions of dollars a year people to go into math, \nscience, engineering, and technology. Why do we have 105 programs? Why \nnot one run by one set of overhead and one agency and measure the \nresults? There are 640 other examples of duplication just like that in \nthe Federal Government.\n  What this amendment says is we ought to be about eliminating that \nduplication. We ought to be able to increase productivity and also \nincrease the results of the very programs for the people we are trying \nto help.\n  The other thing we do is we eliminate bonuses for contractors to the \nFederal Government who are not meeting performance requirements. That \nis $800 million a year that your government is paying out to people who \ndo work for the Federal Government who do not meet the minimum \nrequirements for their contract, and yet we are paying them $800 \nmillion in bonuses as if they were meeting the requirements of their \ncontract. That saves $8 billion over 10 years. None of us would do that \nwith anybody who worked for us. Why do we allow the Federal Government \nto do that?\n  This government gives the United Nations 25 percent of its entire \nbudget. But we also give voluntary payments to the United Nations. I \njust talked with Peter Orszag from OMB, and I am getting that report as \nwe speak. It was due January 1. It is now mid to late June.\n  What we do is eliminate no more than $1 billion more than what our \nobligations are in terms of peacekeeping or our dues to the United \nNations. There are good reasons to do that. There was, with the last \nforeign appropriations, a requirement that the United Nations show us \nwhere our money is going. That got thrown out in conference. But we do \nnot even know where the $6 billion a year that we give to the United \nNations is spent because they will not show us where it is spent. We \nwould never tolerate that from any agency we fund. And yet we don't. We \nare saying do not give more than a billion more than that to the United \nNations. We limit that. That is a $10 billion a year savings.\n  Here is what we do know about the United Nations. In the peacekeeping \nmoney that we give, 45 percent of it is lost to fraud. Think about \nthat. Forty-five percent of the $3 billion that we give to peacekeeping \noperations is lost to fraud, documented. We found that one out by \naccident. They did not want us to find that out.\n  We ought to be good stewards with the money of the American people \nwhen it comes to contributing their money to the United Nations.\n  Returning excessive funds from an unnecessary, unneeded, unrequested, \nduplicative reserve fund that will never be spent: That is $362 \nmillion. It is a one-time savings. It will never be spent. It is \nsitting there. We ought to take it back.\n  Rescinding unspent Federal funds: There is $1.7 trillion sitting in \naccounts right now. Of that, $690 billion has not been obligated for \nthe future expenditure. We are saying move $50 billion of that back \ninto this year and use it to pay for things that are important, such as \nunemployment insurance, rather than borrow from our children.\n  Why is that important? If you have three bank accounts and each one \nhad $100 in it and you had to write a $200 check, you would go to the \naccounts you had and write the check from the two accounts so you could \npay the check. This money is rolling out there to the tune of $600 \nbillion every year that is not obligated.\n  Common sense would say we would be more efficient with our money \nrather than paying interest on that money. We would use it in a more \ntimely fashion. Everybody does that except the Federal Government. We \nought to be doing it as well.\n  Reducing wasteful costs at the Department of Energy. The Department \nof Energy is supposed to be setting the example for this country on \nenergy efficiency. They are the worst agency as far as energy costs and \nefficiency in energy. All we are doing is you follow the rules you have \nset for everybody else. It saves $13.8 million per year. That is just \none agency following the rules they have told every other agency to \nfollow.\n  Finally, we strike the new taxes that are in this bill because we do \nnot need to pay for them because we can cut spending somewhere else. \nThe last thing we need to be doing, as we have the threat of a double-\ndip recession, is taking more private capital out of the economy and \nputting it into government because the multiplier effect of government \nspending is very low. Private spending multiplier effect is about 1.5. \nThat means for every dollar you spend, you end up generating about $1.5 \nin economic activity. For every government dollar that is spent, you \ngenerate $1.1 in economic activity. The last thing we ought to be doing \nis raising taxes. I don't care where it is in this economy. It is so \nprecarious that we need private capital being invested to create jobs \nand opportunities for jobs in this country.\n  I have listed the vast majority of provisions that are in the bill. I \nwill be back to discuss each one individually.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4371 to Amendment No. 4369\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the extension of premium assistance for COBRA \n                               benefits)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, Senator Brown of Ohio and I have offered \nthis amendment which will extend the eligibility period for the COBRA \nPremium Assistance Program until November 30. We appreciate the support \nof many Senators--Senators Franken, Stabenow, Reed, Leahy, Akaka, \nBegich, Whitehouse, Lautenberg, Kerry, Wyden, Harkin, Levin, Burris, \nthe Presiding Officer, Gillibrand, Kaufman, Specter, Menendez,\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\nMerkley, Schumer, Mikulski, Dodd, Durbin, Murray, Shaheen, Rockefeller, \nand Boxer. All are cosponsors of the original amendment we offered the \nother day, first offered by Senator Brown and me as an amendment to \nSenator Baucus's original amendment.\n  I thank Senator Baucus, the Chair of our Finance Committee, for his \nvery hard work on this bill. We are nearing the end. We are working \nvery hard to complete this bill.\n  As we do that, we are also mindful that we are recovering from this \neconomic recession. We must continue, in my judgment, to support vital \nsafety net programs that our citizens need to support their own \nfamilies.\n  The national unemployment rate now stands at 9.7 percent. That \ntranslates in Pennsylvania into more than 584,000 people out of work. \nWe got a report today that across the country, jobless claims are going \nup, unfortunately, after having gone down for a number of months. The \neconomy is showing improvement. We are recovering. Jobs are being added \nevery day. But certain industries are experiencing layoffs, and that is \nwhy we must continue this program to ensure that Americans have access \nto quality health care, especially those who have lost their jobs.\n  Without the extension of the COBRA Premium Assistance Program, a \nreport from the National Employment Law Projects predicts as many as \n150,000 Americans each month will lose out on the subsidies necessary \nto afford quality health care.\n  In the Senate, we do not have to worry about health care. We have \nboth job security and health care that millions of Americans do not \nhave today.\n  Today we received a report from the Treasury Department which \noutlines important information on the success of the COBRA Premium \nAssistance Program. The report is entitled ``Interim Report to The \nCongress on COBRA Premium Assistance.'' It is dated June 2010 from the \nDepartment of Treasury. I commend this report to my colleagues.\n  In the report, it states that over 2 million households in America \nhave benefited from the COBRA Premium Assistance Program. In \nPennsylvania, that means over 100,000--107,311--Pennsylvania households \nhave benefited from it. That is 2 million households across the country \nwere able to afford quality health care while they were searching for a \njob. Millions of Americans had one less thing to worry about--their \nhealth and the health of their family--while they searched for that \njob.\n  In very brief form, I wish to highlight a section from the report \nthat talks about how this program actually works, and many Americans \nunderstand this. I am quoting from page 2:\n\n       Workers eligible for COBRA premium assistance send a \n     premium payment to their employers, plan administrators, or \n     insurers for continuation coverage.\n\n  Because of the Recovery Act we passed in 2009, those individuals pay \nonly 35 percent of the premium. Then, of course, the employers are \nallowed a credit against their payroll taxes for the remaining 65 \npercent. That is how it works. It works well, and it has shown results, \naccording to this new report from the Treasury Department.\n  The total cost of this program in 2009 was $2 billion. However, the \nscore that the Congressional Budget Office gave it originally back in \n2009 was $16 billion. They predicted $16 billion; it cost but $2 \nbillion. Of course, in 2009, we had a tremendously high job loss \ncompared to this year.\n  That cost is going to go significantly down. Part of the reason for \nbeing so much cheaper is the efficiency of administering this program. \nThe Treasury report I referred to states that the total cost to \nadminister the program, with three Federal agencies involved, was $8 \nmillion--.5 percent of the cost of the overall program. Based on the \nTreasury report, it is obvious this program is both effective and \nefficient and has assisted millions of Americans.\n  In addition to ensuring quality health care, the program is a \nlifeline for Americans across the country. I received a letter back in \nMarch from a woman in Pennsylvania, Lisa. I will not give her name and \naddress. I do not have permission. But I want to highlight her personal \nsituation without identifying her. I am quoting a pertinent part in her \nletter. She said:\n\n       I have been receiving chemotherapy nearly every other week \n     for the past 18 months--\n\n  After being diagnosed in 2008.\n\n       The treatments were covered by my COBRA benefits and has \n     kept me alive. I must continue chemotherapy but ran into a \n     problem when an extension of my COBRA coverage was denied.\n\n  Lisa in Pennsylvania speaks for hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions, of Americans when she tells us what this program means to \nher. It is, in fact, a program which has kept her alive, to use her \nwords, not mine. That is what this is about. It is about real life. It \nis about real families who are living through the double nightmare--the \nhorror of losing a job and then being hit over the head again by losing \ntheir health care coverage.\n  There are countless stories similar to Lisa's across the country, and \nmany of us have heard these stories. These stories relate to how COBRA, \nincluding this premium assistance program itself, gave people hope in \nthe midst of despair from losing a job and also losing health care \ncoverage.\n  So I would encourage my fellow colleagues in the Senate to support \nthe amendment that Senator Brown of Ohio and I have introduced, which \nincludes an offset to the extension of the program so it is paid for.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I thank my friend from \nPennsylvania for his leadership and passion on this issue, and I am \nvery pleased to join him in this amendment. I also thank the chairman \nof the Finance Committee for many hours on this floor working very hard \nto put together this very important jobs bill that we need to get done \nas quickly as possible.\n  I want to spend a few moments talking about the gulf and what has \nhappened and what it more broadly represents--both in terms of what is \nhappening on the Senate floor and in our country.\n  When I flip on the television and see what is happening in the gulf, \nlike all of us, I know this truly is a tragedy. To see the workers who \nhave lost their jobs, who can't go out on their fishing or shrimping \nboats, who haven't seen any tourists come their way in over a month; to \nsee the environmental devastation, I know it is a terrible crisis that \nis testing our Nation and our government. The Obama administration \ninherited a perfect storm--an oil company known for a history of \negregious safety violations, being given permits to drill a mile down \nunder the ocean with no credible public oversight, and a public agency \nthat believed oil companies should basically police themselves, even if \nthere was a risk to American families. That is what they inherited.\n  The tragic events in the Gulf of Mexico started with an explosion \nthat killed 11 workers onboard an offshore oil rig operating in waters \ndeeper than it had ever operated before, with technology that wasn't \ndesigned for drilling that deep. It happened because the company \noperating the oil rig took risks with the lives of the workers. They \ncut corners, and they ignored the interests of millions of Americans in \nthe gulf who would be affected by their actions.\n  This is a tragedy that was allowed to happen by an agency that was \ntransformed by 8 years of Republican policies urging them to look the \nother way, an agency whose employees thought they worked for the oil \nindustry rather than the American people, an agency that allowed the \noil industry to fill out their own inspection reports.\n  There was a belief articulated by a current Republican Senate \ncandidate who said it was un-American for President Obama to criticize \nBP.\n  Well, I don't think it is un-American for our President to stand up \nfor the men and women who work in the Gulf of Mexico, whose livelihoods \nand lives have been jeopardized by this catastrophe. We are seeing \nmillions of barrels of oil being spilled into the waters--waters that \nare owned by the American people--and I think it is the duty of the \nAmerican President to make sure BP cleans it up and does everything \npossible in the gulf to make the people whole.\n  Just this morning, during an ongoing Congressional hearing, we heard \nanother example of this belief in the words of a senior Republican \nHouse\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\nMember who apologized--apologized--to BP for the President's actions in \ndemanding that BP set up a fund to reimburse the losses of local small \nbusinesspeople and families in the gulf and for their tremendous \nhardships caused, I might add, by BP. This Congressman called it a \nshakedown, a slush fund. Mr. President, I call it leadership and \nstanding up for the American people. That is his job, and that is our \njob as well.\n  But there is a larger issue represented in this disaster. Public \naccountability and commonsense regulations do matter. That is our job \nas well. My colleagues know that as a Senator from Michigan, there is \nno one who will fight harder for the auto industry than myself. But \neven while I will fight tooth and nail--and I have--for this industry \nand the success of this industry, I still support safety regulations.\n  When I put my grandkids in a car, I want the car to have seatbelts \nand airbags, and I want to make sure that automobile has gone through a \nrigorous crash test. Our economy and our quality of life depend on \nvibrant successful businesses, but our quality of life also depends on \npublic accountability, on commonsense regulations to protect the health \nand safety of our families.\n  Someone has to stand and protect the water and the air we breathe. \nSomeone has to stand for our children and for our elders. Someone has \nto stand for the safety of workers--the 11 workers who were killed on \nthat rig or the 29 workers who were killed in the mine collapse in \nApril or the millions of fishermen and shrimpers and tourism workers \nwhose livelihoods are at risk today on the gulf coast.\n  When we look at our record in this Congress, we have seen this same \ndebate played out time and time again. Even this week, two different \nbeliefs, two different sets of values. The first bill that President \nObama signed into law was named after a woman named Lilly Ledbetter--\nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--to require equal pay for equal work. \nOn that very first bill, we saw two different views and beliefs: the \nRepublican view that essentially said corporations should be able to \ndiscriminate against women or people with color if they choose to and \non our side we stood with a woman, Lilly Ledbetter, who for years had \ngotten paid significantly less than her male coworkers for doing the \nexact same job just because she was a woman. We passed that bill, and \nit was signed into law so that women, so that people of color would not \nhave to go through that in the future. We happen to believe in fair \nplay. We happen to believe in equal pay for equal work.\n  Then there was the Recovery Act. There, again, we saw a very big \ndifference. After the biggest bailout of Wall Street in the history of \nour country, on one side was a belief that government shouldn't get \ninvolved to help the American people hurt by the financial crisis in \nthe face of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression; that \nthe proper course would be to sit back and let the economy fix itself, \neven though those who caused the financial crisis were, in fact, being \nhelped. Never mind that millions of people who used to live comfortable \nmiddle-class lives lost their jobs, their entire life savings and their \nhomes to a bunch of traders on Wall Street who made some bad deals with \nno public accountability.\n  But we believed something different, Mr. President: that when the \neconomy is on the edge of a cliff and millions of middle-class families \nhave been hurt due to no fault of their own, you don't just sit back \nand hope for the best. That is not leadership; you do something. So we \npassed a historic Recovery Act focused on the American people--focused \non jobs, on helping small businesses grow by building clean energy \ntechnology, schools, bridges, and roads--and making investments in our \nfuture and, yes, helping people who had been caught in that economic \ntsunami so they could keep the lights on at home and have a roof over \ntheir head and take care of their families.\n  When President Obama took office in January of 2009, we were losing \n750,000 jobs a month. Today, thanks to this Recovery Act and other work \ndone here, we are creating jobs. It is not as fast as I would like, \ncertainly coming from Michigan, where we have been hit harder than \nanyone else, but we are moving in the right direction. It wouldn't be \nthe case if we had done nothing last year.\n  We heard for years that Wall Street needed less regulation, more \nfreedom to innovate, and for nearly a decade there were policies in \nplace that took a hands-off approach. What we saw was an over-the-\ncounter derivatives market that grew to be worth over $500 trillion, \ncompletely in the dark, completely unregulated, with no oversight and \nno transparency. There were many people who thought this was great. \nHere was an example of a market with no public oversight at all, and it \nwas making money hand over fist.\n  Then the bubble burst, and it turned out the whole thing was smoke \nand mirrors. Because there was nobody there speaking out for the \nAmerican public, it was the American families who paid the price, and \nwe paid a heavy price. That is why we recently passed Wall Street \nreform, and we need to get it to the President to create public \naccountability and commonsense regulation to protect investors and \nconsumers. That is our job.\n  We passed a bill to give consumers the power to get their mortgages \nmodified so they could stay in their homes and prevent foreclosures \nfrom emptying out entire communities. We also passed a law giving new \ntools to law enforcement and prosecutors to help them crack down on \nmortgage fraud and securities fraud. On each and every issue our \nDemocratic majority has been fighting for the people of this country. \nOur Republican colleagues believe and have expressed--and I assume this \nis sincere--that the old policies of deregulation and no public \naccountability are better. They believe that large corporate \ninterests--mining companies, oil companies, Wall Street, big banks--\nshould police themselves and things will be OK.\n  But for the 11 workers on the oil rig in the gulf and the millions of \npeople who live in that region of our country, those policies just \ndidn't work. For the 29 miners who lost their lives in West Virginia, \nthose policies just didn't work. For the millions of Americans who lost \ntheir jobs or their life savings because of Wall Street's recklessness, \nthose policies just didn't work. I can't believe the American people \nwant to go back and relive all of that again. I certainly don't.\n  When President Obama took office, we saw the wreckage left behind \nafter 8 years of deregulation and, frankly, it was time to put people \nfirst. So that is why we got to work. From day one we have seen \nunprecedented obstruction--the Republican leadership using every trick \nin the book to stop us from making the changes the American people \nwant. But we have kept on fighting, we have passed now 242 bills, 175 \nof them signed into law to move our country forward.\n  Frankly, though, this isn't about numbers. Numbers don't matter. What \nmatters is whether things are getting better for people. But let me \njust review some of what has been put in place to begin to turn things \naround.\n  The Recovery Act I mentioned to focus on jobs, the expansion of \nhealth insurance for children so that working moms and dads can know at \nleast the kids are going to be able to see a doctor, protection of our \npublic lands and national parks so our kids and grandkids can enjoy our \nbeautiful land and our beautiful parks in this country, credit card \nreform, veterans health care so our troops coming home get the care \nthey need and the care they deserve, that is the least we can do.\n  We have increased support for our disabled veterans. We have enacted \ntobacco regulation to keep our kids from smoking. We have stood up to \nthe tobacco industry on behalf of our children's health. We also passed \nthe Serve America Act to support our young people and seniors and help \nget them involved to give back to the community--a very important value \nthat we believe in as Americans. We also passed an FAA bill to \nmodernize our air traffic control systems so that we have safer air \ntravel; a national Defense bill that gives a pay raise to our men and \nwomen in uniform, which is the least we can do, and that helps our \nveterans who don't have a home; a jobs bill to help our small \nbusinesses expand and local communities have the tools they need to \ncreate jobs; a health care bill that saves families money, makes sure\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\nthat every family can have a family doctor and improve the quality of \ncare in this country; student loan changes to stop subsidies to banks \nand putting more money into making sure students can get some help to \ngo to college and that it costs less so they can afford to go; and \nmajor financial industry reform so we never see another Wall Street \nbailout.\n\n  As I said, we know none of this matters if you do not have a job and \nif you are fighting to keep your home. We have to make sure that all of \nthis--and we are working hard to make sure--adds up to real \nimprovements in people's lives and economic security.\n  We are beginning to see things turn around because we have changed \nthe values, we have changed the priorities back to what is best for the \nAmerican people, what is best for middle-class families--the people we \nall talk about who are playing by the rules and want to know they will \nhave a fair shot to be able to care for their families and be \nsuccessful.\n  At every issue we run into roadblocks and opposition from the other \nside because they believe--and I believe it is an honest belief; we \nhear it over and over again--that more tax cuts for wealthy Americans \nand less regulation is always the answer. If that were true, given what \nhas happened in the former administration when they controlled the \nHouse and Senate and the White House, things would be great. I wish \nthings were great. But that view has not worked for the majority of \nAmericans.\n  Today, every American with a television set can see the results of \nthose beliefs. We had 8 years of that and we cannot go back. But this \nis not only about the past, it is also about the differences we debate \nevery day in the Senate. It is about this week, last week, and I am \nsure next week. It is about the future. We need someone to be a check \non the mining and the oil and the banking industries. We need \ncommonsense regulators who do not think they work for the industry they \nare supposed to oversee. That is what this new administration is about \nand what we are about. We have to hold companies accountable when they \nignore the rules and put the public or their workers at risk. We have \nto move America forward and continue making the changes this country \nneeds. That is what we have been fighting for. That is what all of the \nactions we have taken have been about. That is what we will continue to \ndo.\n  But it is not about growing the government. We know that \noverregulation is not the answer either. But we want the government we \nhave to work. That is the question: Who should our government work for? \nThe special interests, those with great wealth and power, or families \nworking hard to make ends meet and hold onto the American dream--small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs with a great idea; people who want to know \nthat the rules are fair for them, that if they work hard they will be \nable to have a job and they can be successful in our economy; families \nwho want to know that somebody is making sure the rules protect their \n401(k), their pension, their savings; that they can drink the water and \nbreathe the air and eat the food they buy without getting sick.\n  We all want to be able to trust that the safety rules are enforced. \nIf you or a loved one work on a mine or on an oil rig--or if you are \ngetting in the car to take your kids to a soccer game--we all want to \ntrust that when you get permits to drill in our precious waters, we \nwill be looking out for the fishing jobs and our Nation's tourism \nindustry and that we will not allow risky drilling without strong, \ncommonsense regulation and accountability.\n  Our country cannot afford to go back to the previous beliefs that \ncreated the crises that President Obama and this Congress have been \nforced to deal with every day. We believe, the majority believes, it is \nour public responsibility to be on the side of the American people and \nthat is what each of these legislative battles here in Congress is all \nabout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3347\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I welcome following my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan and her impassioned plea against \nobstructionism. I have been facing the same challenges in particular \nwith certain programs that are absolutely crucial for Louisiana but \nmore broadly for the country. One that is absolutely important for all \nof us in Louisiana is the National Flood Insurance Program. It is a \nnational program. It is important for our economy. It is important for \nthe real estate industry. It is important for homeowners and closings \naround the country, for economic activity to move forward, particularly \nwhen we need every bit of economic activity in these tough times of \nrecession. But it is really important in Louisiana. We face enormous \nflood threats so it is important there.\n  Unfortunately, the extension of the present National Flood Insurance \nProgram--which everyone, as far as I know, supports--is being held \nhostage, essentially, in this extenders bill. I have been trying to pry \nit loose from that so we can extend the program, not let it expire as \nit has expired--it expired June 1; it is not in operation today--get it \nback in place, get it fully extended through the rest of the calendar \nyear.\n  I would have thought this would be a ``no brainer,'' this would be \nconsensus, this would not be partisan. It should not be. This is a \nsimple extension of the National Flood Insurance Program. What is more, \nthis extension does not create any additional deficit. Obviously, a big \npart of this debate about this larger bill on the floor is about \nincreasing deficit spending. Lots of folks, including me, have real \nconcern about that. I think that is a legitimate concern that all of us \nhave at some level. This extension does not increase the deficit at \nall.\n  I came to the floor before the Memorial Day recess because I saw this \ntrain wreck coming. I asked unanimous consent to simply extend that \nNational Flood Insurance Program with no deficit impact, extend it by \nunanimous consent until the end of the year.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, objected. I tried to \nengage in a meaningful debate, because I think the American people \ndeserve it, about what is wrong with the program, what is wrong with \nthe extension, what is wrong with the proposal. It has no deficit \nimpact.\n  The silence from the distinguished majority leader was deafening. He \nobjected because he could object. That is his right--no explanation, no \njustification.\n  The result has been the train wreck I was trying to avoid. The \nprogram expired on June 1. The program is not in place today. That is \nstopping and making a lot more complicated real estate closings--people \ntrying to buy their first home, people trying to buy another home. Lord \nknows we need every real estate closing we can get to happen in this \neconomy. We cannot create unnecessary barriers to that when we are \ntrying to come out of this real-estate-led recession. Yet this \nmajority, this Senate, this Congress let that absolutely crucial \nNational Flood Insurance Program expire June 1. So here we are again.\n  My plea is the same. Everyone, as far as I know, supports the \nextension of the National Flood Insurance Program which is now expired. \nEveryone, as far as I know, says, rightfully, that it is a necessary \nprogram. We need to reinstate it to get the economy humming again, to \nmake these real estate closings easier and not harder, to help \nrecovery, not hinder it. And everybody admits, including the \nCongressional Budget Office, there is zero deficit impact with this \nextension. It is a clean extension. It does not increase the deficit in \nany way.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's extend that. Let's not make something \npartisan which should not be. It is not an ideological difference. Many \nmembers of our community--homeowners, folks in the real estate sector--\nstrongly support this effort. In that vein, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record this letter from 22 trade associations, \nincluding the National Association of Realtors and many others strongly \nin support of this sort of stand-alone extension of the program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 15, 2010.\n       To All Members of Congress: On behalf of our organizations, \n     we want to share with you our respective memberships' \n     frustration\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\n     with the fact that Congress, on May 31, 2010, again allowed \n     the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to expire--the \n     third time this year. We urge you to immediately reauthorize \n     the program.\n       Five and a half million taxpayers depend on the NFIP as \n     their main source of protection against flooding, the most \n     common natural disaster in the United States. Without flood \n     insurance, no federally-related mortgage loans may be made in \n     nearly 20,000 communities nationwide.\n       The frequent lapses in the NFIP program are undermining \n     homeowner and commercial property owner confidence in this \n     vital program.

Mr. President, the letter truthfully says--it is very \nsimple:\n\n       The frequent lapses in the National Flood Insurance Program \n     are undermining homeowners and commercial property owner \n     confidence in this vital system. Given the fragile state of \n     residential and commercial real estate markets, Congress \n     should take immediate action to restore confidence in the \n     National Flood Insurance Program through a long-term, stand-\n     alone extension.\n\n  That is what my stand-alone bill is. It is not complicated. It is not \ncontroversial--should not be. Not partisan--should not be. It doesn't \nincrease the deficit in any way, shape or form--not by a penny.\n  Again, I will ask what I asked before the Memorial Day recess, trying \nto avoid this train wreck which has now happened for over a couple of \nweeks.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 372, which is my bill, S. 3347, a bill I \nintroduced that extends the National Flood Insurance Program through \nDecember 31, 2010; that that bill be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsay I very much understand and appreciate the concerns of the Senator. \nThis is in the bill we have in front of us today that we hope will be \npassed today. The complete language is in the bill. I understand his \nconcern. I feel the same about extending unemployment benefits which \nusually is overwhelmingly supported on a bipartisan basis but has been \nheld up as well. I have been in the same situation on that. To me it is \na ``no brainer.'' I would love to see that extended as well. I would \nhave loved to have seen that extended a month ago. But the reality is \nthese items have been put together in a package and we will have the \nopportunity, hopefully later today or tomorrow, to vote on that. So on \nbehalf of the leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, again, I think it is a shame. If the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan wants to propound a UC to separate \nunemployment insurance, I will support that. I will not object. I think \nit is a good idea. I think we need to come together around things on \nwhich we agree. I think those things are and should be bipartisan and \nwe should not bend over backwards to somehow make them partisan in this \nsilly game. So I would support that unanimous consent request. I am \nsorry she cannot, at least on behalf of the leader, support mine.\n  I understand it is part of the larger bill. It was 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago \nand that is exactly why the program lapsed on June 1--because it was \npart of the larger bill and that larger bill was not going to pass \nthen, did not pass yesterday, probably is not going to pass today.\n  In the meantime, it is not some theoretical bill that is being held \nhostage. It is American citizens who are being held hostage. It is \nfirst-time home buyers who are being held hostage. It is people in the \nreal estate industry who need every darned closing that they can close \nwho are being held hostage. It is not right. It is politics ahead of \npeople, purely and simply.\n  I am very sorry that again the majority leader has rejected this \nsimple idea. I will keep making the request because this program has \nnow lapsed. It has not existed since June 1 and that is hurting people \nand that is hurting the economy.\n  I would like to move on to another aspect of this bill which is \nhurting people, which is particularly offensive to me, representing \nLouisiana. This is only getting worse in terms of this bill going from \none version to another; that is, the aspect of this bill on the Senate \nfloor that pertains to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.\n  I represent Louisiana. More importantly, I live in Louisiana. I am \nall for oilspill cleanup. If there is anybody in the world who is for \nthat, nobody is for it more than folks in Louisiana for obvious \nreasons. I am for a healthy and vibrant Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. \nThat trust fund has to be increased and grown. And lots of things about \nthe Oil Pollution Act are clearly outdated. I have put forward \nproposals to update those, but unfortunately that is not what is going \non.\n  In this bill, there was initially an increase in the tax into the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund from 8 cents a barrel to 41 cents a barrel. \nThat is over a five-times increase. Now, if that was needed for \noilspill cleanup and was going to be used for oilspill cleanup, I would \nbe the first to say, great. The problem is, it was stuck in this bill \nnot for that reason at all but to be stolen--that money to be stolen \nand used for other spending. As soon as that money went into this so-\ncalled trust fund, it was going to be grabbed out and used for \ncompletely unrelated spending, nothing to do with any oilspill.\n  I had an amendment on the floor, and the amendment was very simple. \nIt did not disrupt the tax increase--did not touch that. It simply said \nthat anything going into the oil fund has to be used to clean up \noilspills--radical idea--and No. 2, anything going into the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund cannot be used as an offset, double-counted--Enron \naccounting to mask, to hide other deficit spending, which is going on \nin this bill.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated. But we had a good vote, \nquite frankly. I want to note and thank the Democratic majority \nchairman of the Budget Committee for voting yes on that. I think he \nvoted yes because of the simple reality of what I am saying. That money \nshould only be used to clean up oilspills. That money should not be \ndouble-counted, should not be used in Enron accounting to offset, to \nmask other completely unrelated deficit spending.\n  In the new version of this so-called extenders bill recently \nunveiled, unfortunately we are going from bad to worse because they \njust increased the tax from 41 cents to 49 cents. Originally, it was 8 \ncents, and it jumped to 41 cents--that is over a fivefold increase--and \nnow to 49 cents. Between those two versions of the bill, we actually \nhad President Obama meet with BP and set up a huge escrow fund to make \nsure BP, as the responsible party of the ongoing spill, pays for \neverything, as they absolutely should do. So in between the 41-cent \nversion of the bill and the 49-cent version of this bill, we set up \nthis escrow fund to ensure, as we should, that BP pays for everything.\n  So the increase has nothing to do with the real crisis in the gulf; \nthe increase has to do with politics in Washington because that first \nversion of the bill did not get the votes because it had too much \ndeficit spending. So what do we do? We are going to steal more. We are \ngoing to offset more out of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. And \nthat is why it went up again, from 41 cents to 49 cents.\n  Well, I have to say that I find all of that pretty darn offensive. We \nhave a\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\nreal crisis in the gulf. It is an ongoing crisis because the flow is \nnot stopped. Rather than deal with that real crisis through action, \nsome folks up here are using and abusing that crisis to advance their \nown agenda--deficit spending, unrelated spending--through politics. I \nthink that is wrong. I think it is wrong in a pretty raw way, and I \nfind it offensive. And I say that on the Senate floor. It is going from \nbad to worse. We are now, under the current proposal, stealing even \nmore from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, using it even more to \nmask other unrelated spending. We have a real crisis on our hands. \nLet's address it. Let's not use and abuse it politically.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4300 to Amendment No. 4369\n\n (Purpose: To establish an expedited procedure for consideration of a \n             bill returning spending levels to 2007 levels)\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I send an amendment to the desk, No. 4300, and I ask \nthat it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. LeMieux] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4300 to amendment No. 4369.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of June 7, 2010, under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I have offered amendment No. 4300 today. It is a piece \nof legislation in which Senators Wicker, Risch, and Gregg have joined \nme. It is called the 2007 Solution.\n  The No. 1 problem facing this country is our out-of-control spending. \nIt is to a point where it is unsustainable.\n  I am new here to the Senate. I came last September. My background is \nin business as well as in State government in Florida. In both of those \nvenues, I had the responsibility, both in chairing a business I helped \nto run as well as being the Governor's chief of staff in Florida, to \nmake sure ends met. In the business I worked in, I would look at \nreceipts, and we could only spend as much money as we took in. In State \ngovernment, we had a balanced budget requirement. We had a balanced \nbudget requirement in Florida.\n  When the economy went bad in 2007, when I was the Governor's chief of \nstaff, I would be on the phone with the budget people almost weekly \nmonitoring how much money was coming in because I knew we could only \nspend as much as we had. We had three choices if revenues declined: We \ncould raise taxes, we could cut spending, or we could find a new source \nof revenue. We did not have the option of spending money we did not \nhave.\n  So I always knew there was a problem in Washington when Washington \ndid not understand those basic dynamics that families in Florida and \naround the country had to deal with in terms of making ends meet, the \nsame decisions families make around their kitchen tables to decide: \nWell, we cannot afford it this month, so we are going to have to put it \noff until next month or we are going to have to cut down on some of \nthis spending so we can make sense of our fiscal house. I knew that \ndidn't happen in Washington, but I never knew the degree to which it \ndid not happen.\n  When I came here and was sworn in in September of last year, the \nnational debt of this country was $12 trillion. That is a staggering \namount, and it is a number that is hard for us to get our brains \naround.\n  One trillion--what does it mean? Well, 1 trillion is 1,000 billion--\n$1,000 billion--and 1 billion is 1,000 million. Just to put it into \nsome perspective, if you took dollar bills and put them on the floor \nand laid them side by side, $1 million would cover two football fields; \n$1 billion would cover Key West, FL--3.4 square miles of one-dollar \nbills carpeting Key West, FL; $1 trillion would cover Rhode Island \ntwice. If you stacked 1 trillion one-dollar bills on the ground up to \nthe sky, it would go 600 miles into the sky.\n  When I came here in September, this government owed $12 trillion in \nmoney that it shouldn't have spent in the past, that it couldn't afford \nto spend, and it was carrying that debt. That was bad enough, but time \nhas elapsed and now we are in June of 2010, and now the national debt \nis $13 trillion. The debt has gone up $1 trillion in less than a year's \ntime. It took 200 years for this country to amass its first trillion \ndollars in debt, and we just did another trillion dollars in less than \n1 year's time.\n  Right now in our budget, we spend $200 billion a year paying interest \non the debt. That is on expenditures we shouldn't have made in the \npast--$200 billion. At our current rate of spending, as projected by \nthe White House, by the end of this decade we will spend $900 billion a \nyear just making interest payments on debt. By 2020, it is estimated \nthat our debt, our national debt, will not be $13 trillion, it will be \n$25.7 trillion. And when we get to that point, our country is going to \nfail. This is not just a problem for our children or our grandchildren, \nit is a problem for all of us. And $900 billion is more than we spend \nfighting both wars and all of the expenditures for the Defense \nDepartment right now. And we are going to be paying that just in \ninterest?\n\n  Perhaps most troubling of all is this fact: Today the money we take \nin in revenues is only enough to cover Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--the entitlements. Every other dollar we spend for every other \nfunction of government--from the men and women who keep us free and \nsafe in the military to the FAA that guides your plane, to the roads \nyou drive on, to the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, \nthe Department of Agriculture--every other function of government is \nborrowed. It is unsustainable.\n  I am new enough to Washington to not think this is normal. This still \nseems bizarre to me. What this body and what the body down the hall \nfail to do is set priorities and say: We are going to afford this, but \nwe cannot afford that--just as families do, as the State government in \nTallahassee does, as businesses do every day.\n  We do not go into the agencies now that are spending all this money \nand say, are they spending money on things that are effective, \nefficient? Are they getting bang for the buck? No. What we do in \nWashington is create new programs. We pass this financial regulatory \nreform bill, and instead of firing all the people at the SEC who failed \nto do their job in policing Wall Street, we create a new governmental \ninstitution because that is what Washington does--more and more layers \nof government on top of government, with nobody looking to see what \ngovernment is doing now and whether your tax dollars are being spent \neffectively and efficiently because there is no mechanism in place to \nbalance the budget.\n  I wish we had a balanced budget amendment. I wish we had to do what \nour States have to do. This past spring, in Florida, our State leaders \nhad to sit down, when there were less revenues than there had been in \nthe past, and they had to make decisions about what to cut. That is \nwhat leaders do. We do not do that in Washington.\n  But I have an amendment, a proposal, that would get us into a \nmechanism to at least have the debate about how we can save this \ncountry by stemming this uncontrollable spending. It is called the 2007 \nSolution. It would require this, simply: Each year, the majority leader \nwill be required to offer a piece of legislation that would have 50 \nhours of debate, where we would have to go back to 2007 spending \nlevels. Why 2007? Well, 2007 was the last year we had a robust economy. \nIt was not until December of that year that we entered into recession.\n  When I talk with most Floridians, they would be happy to have the \nmoney they made in 2007 as income in 2010. It was before the stimulus. \nIt should be enough for us to live off of. And it is not as though \nthings were being done efficiently and effectively in 2007. It is not \nas though someone was going into the agencies trying to chop out waste \nand abuse, set priorities. It was not being done then, either. So there \nshould be plenty of wiggle room.\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\n  So if we go back to 2007 level spending at $2.729 trillion, by 2013 \nwe would balance the budget, and by 2020, instead of having a $25.7 \ntrillion national debt, we would cut the current national debt in half, \nand it would be somewhere around $6 trillion, and we would save \nAmerica.\n  What this amendment does, what this proposal does, is require the \nmajority leader to offer an amendment where we will have 50 hours of \ndebate on the floor of the Senate--as they will in the House--to set \nspending levels at 2007 levels. And guess what we are going to have to \ndo then. We are going to have to be adults. We are going to have to be \nleaders. We are going to have to make decisions about what is \nimportant.\n  The $90 billion Washington spends every year to subsidize different \nbusinesses around the country--is that important? The billions of \ndollars that go into earmarks--are they important? Could we not cut 10 \npercent from each agency, 20 percent from each agency? The $100 billion \nof Medicare fraud a year--could we not combat that? Would we not then \nhave a motivation, an impetus, to actually start doing better by the \nAmerican people and watching the dollars they send to us, and spending \nthem as if they were our own, and doing it wisely?\n  My amendment does not say what has to be cut. It does say there will \nnot be any tax increases. We do not need to create more revenue and \ncreate more of a problem because, trust me, if we create more revenue, \nthis Congress will spend it. We do not have a revenue problem. We have \na spending problem.\n  Let's have this debate. Who is afraid of a discussion? Let's go back \nand forth and say what we could cut. Should we cut things in the \nDepartment of Defense? Is there not waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nDepartment of Defense? Sure there is. Let's cut it. Secretary Gates \nwants to cut spending in defense. No one wants to cut our capabilities. \nBut are there things we could do without, and do things more \nefficiently, not just in defense but in every department of government?\n  There are 100,000 people working at the Department of Agriculture. By \nbest estimate--and it is less than this--there is 1 person at the \nDepartment of Agriculture for every 30 farmers. What are all these \npeople doing? Has someone looked under the hood at that agency?\n  The President is now asking all the agency heads, the Cabinet \nmembers, to look for 5-percent cuts, some of which would go toward \ndeficit reduction, some which would go toward other programs they could \nspend money on. When is the last time we cut any agency? We have not \nhad fiscal sanity in the Congress since the mid 1990s when we balanced \nthe budget. We are talking 13 years, 14 years. Someone needs to look \nunder the hood of these agencies and set priorities.\n  This amendment will require that discussion to happen. We are going \nto have to look at the entitlement programs.\n  We are going to have to look at Medicare. We are going to have to \nlook at Social Security. This is not a popular thing to talk about. You \nare not going to see my colleagues come to the floor of this body and \ntalk about reforming entitlements because it is politically dangerous. \nBut the truth is, if we do not reform them, they are not going to be \nthere for our seniors in the generations who follow. We are going to \nhave to have the courage of our convictions. We are going to have to \ncare about the next generation more than we care about the next \nelection.\n  I hope the 2007 Solution will pass. It does not require any specific \nprogram be cut. It just requires that we have a debate about it every \nyear. If the majority leader does not introduce it, the minority leader \ncan. If the minority loader does not introduce it, any Senator can. \nThere would be 50 hours of privileged debate. It can go through \ncommittees, but only for 30 days so it does not get stuck in the \ncommittees. It would require a three-fifths majority to pass. That is a \npeculiarity of the Senate--our 60-vote rule. So it makes sense, and it \nis consistent with the history and the precedents of this body.\n  I want to conclude with this: For us to be here and to do anything \nelse, without tackling this debt issue, is unfair to the American \npeople. I have four little kids. My wife and I just welcomed a new \ndaughter into the world. It is our first daughter because we have three \nyoung sons. My greatest fear is that my four kids--or one of the four \nkids--someday will come to me and say: Dad, I am moving to a foreign \ncountry. I am going to Brazil or India or China or--pick your country--\nbecause the opportunities in that country are greater than the ones in \nthe United States.\n  The greatest threat we have to this country today is our inability to \ncontrol this out-of-control spending. If we do not do it, we will \nviolate the American creed, which is that we leave this country a \nbetter place than we found it for each generation that follows.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will embrace this \namendment. Again, it does not require anything to be cut. It requires a \ndiscussion and a good debate on what should be cut. It sets the \nparameter that if we hold ourselves to that cap, we could save this \ncountry. There are folks I know on the other side of the aisle who care \nabout this issue. I have talked to them. This is not a Republican \nissue. This is not a Democratic issue. This is a moral issue. It is a \nmoral obligation of the people who serve in this body and the one down \nthe hall to fix this out-of-control spending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I did not intend to speak again, except \nafter hearing my colleague, I do feel it is important to say--I am not \nspeaking to the specifics at all in terms of a proposal--but I do feel \nit is important to talk for a moment about how we got to where we are \nwith the deficit. Because it is pretty hard to listen to folks who were \ninvolved in policies that got us where we are and are now talking to us \nabout how terrible it is as to where we are.\n  I want to stress, when I came to the Senate in 2001, we were trying \nto figure out what to do with the largest budget surplus in the history \nof the country. I was in the House when we made the very tough vote to \nbalance the budget under President Clinton.\n  Unfortunately, for all of us--I mean that sincerely--rather than \ndoing what many of us had proposed--which was to take that large budget \nsurplus and take a third of it to do strategic investments in tax cuts \nand a third of it for investments in things such as health research and \neducation and jobs, and a third of it to prefund the deficit for the \nfuture; that was a proposal we had--instead, all of it went to top-down \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country. It put us in a \nsituation where we had no backup, no surplus. Then we went to war with \ntwo countries and put it on the credit card, which we have now used for \n10 years.\n  Then we saw a huge new Medicare entitlement. I certainly believe \nstrongly in providing prescription drug help for seniors, but that was \nnot paid for either. There was item after item after item--until \nPresident Obama inherited now the largest deficit.\n  So as we are trying to dig our way out of this now, it is very \ndisconcerting to hear over and over, with all due respect, about how \ndeficits matter. Deficits did not matter when it was the Republican \nagenda. And my guess is, if we were talking about another round of huge \ntax cuts, it would not matter either. It matters now when we are \ntalking about things that middle-class families want. It matters now \nwhen we are talking about jobs or the cost of college or whether we are \ngoing to be able to have families be able to have a family doctor for \ntheir kids--or all the other things. Now it matters. It did not \nmatter--the Wall Street bailout? OK. A people's bailout? A families \nbailout? Oh, no, no, no, no, that is deficit spending.\n  I will say this, with all due respect: with over 15 million people on \nunemployment benefits right now and another how many--who knows--\nworking part time or who completely had to leave the labor market--\nmillions and millions of people--we will never get out of deficit until \npeople get back to work. We will never get out of this deficit ditch \nuntil people get back to work and they are back contributing and being \na part of the economy and being able to care for their families and \nbeing able to get this economic engine going again.\n  That is a basic philosophical difference we have. It is a basic \ndifference\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\nin beliefs that I was talking about earlier today: about whether it is \nimportant to focus on people and putting people back to work on things \nthat middle-class families need or now--when it is a different agenda, \nwhen we have different priorities and different values, and we are \nfighting for different people--now, all of a sudden, despite the former \nVice President's claim that deficits did not matter, now they matter.\n  I believe they do matter. I believed they mattered in, I think it was \n1997, when I voted for a balanced budget under President Clinton. I \nbelieved they mattered in 2001 when I was a member of the Budget \nCommittee. I voted for efforts to have us be fiscally responsible. And \nI believed they mattered when we voted to reinstate rules that were \ntaken off for 8 years--that you should pay as you go when you do \nsomething. I know we have to make sure we are actually living up to \nthat.\n  But with all due respect, we have a very different view of the world. \nComing from the great State of Michigan right now, our folks would say \nit is about time somebody focused on them and their jobs and what is \nhappening to their families. That is what this bill is all about that \nis on the floor. That is what we are all about. I think it is the right \ncourse.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Your State has high unemployment and my State does too. \nI think you are at 14-some percent, and we are at 12 percent. Everybody \ncares about trying to get folks back to work, but shouldn't we find a \npay-for on this bill? Everybody wants to extend unemployment \ncompensation, but why should we put it off on our kids and our \ngrandkids? Is there not $55 billion we could find to pay for this bill?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend, the \nreality is that we have an economic emergency in this country. If 15 \nmillion people out of work isn't an emergency, I don't know what one \nis. So I would just fundamentally disagree with the Senator.\n  In order for something to be an economic stimulus every economist--\nfrom Reagan economists to Clinton economists to Bush economists to \nObama economists--has said by funding this as emergency spending, we \njump-start the economy. For every dollar we put into a family's pocket, \nwe get $1.60 in economic turnaround, economic benefit because families \nwho are out of work are forced to spend the money that is put in their \npockets.\n  So, no, I would fundamentally disagree. We have had economists \ntestify who would fundamentally disagree with that premise. It sounds \ngood. It sounds good. I wish we had paid for the huge tax cuts that \nwere done a number of years ago. I wish we had paid for that. But right \nnow what we are saying is, where we ought to focus our energies is on \ntaking away the stimulus that comes from unemployment benefits, and \nsomehow we have to get our focus back on people who have lost their \njobs. So I fundamentally have a disagreement.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, if I could just ask one more question. I \ndon't disagree with the Senator about spending the money; I would like \nto extend unemployment compensation. But would my friend not agree with \nme that there is $50 billion we could find somewhere in this \ngovernment, money that has not been spent that is sitting in accounts, \nwasteful spending, programs that aren't working? Why can't we as a body \nget down to the business of looking at government and all of the \ntrillions of dollars we spend and find money and set priorities and pay \nfor this?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I guess I would ask my friend back, would you agree \nthat rather than decreasing the estate tax for less than one-half \npercent of the public, maybe we should make sure any dollars there \nshould go back to somebody who doesn't have a job and maybe help create \na partnership with a business to create a job? Would you say that is a \nbetter priority than what is going to be coming up not too long from \nnow on the Senate floor to try to help folks who already make millions \nof dollars a year?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Respectfully, I think the estate tax issue is a \ndifferent issue, but I will address it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I don't think it is a different issue, with all due \nrespect.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Ma'am, I let you finish. If I may, we don't have an \nestate tax right now. The joke is, don't go hunting with your children \nbecause right now there is no estate tax in this country this year. So \nwe all agree that needs to be fixed.\n  We have a difference in belief on taxes, but I am talking about just \nthis spending issue. You and I and many of us in this Chamber all agree \nthat we should continue unemployment compensation. People in your State \nare hurting; people in my State are hurting.\n  My question is, Is there not $55 billion we could find somewhere in \nthe more than $2 trillion that we are going to spend this year--\nactually, more than $3 trillion--could we not find an offset so we \ndon't put this upon our kids and our grandkids?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Finally, I would say before having to leave the floor, \nI appreciate that in theory. I guess I would ask my colleague to come \nup with what your list would be of priorities, because----\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. We will do that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. From my standpoint, unfortunately, what I see over and \nover again are middle-class families and folks who are out of work are \nthe ones who get hit over and over again. That is my concern. That is \nmy concern when we get into tax policy, about who we are going to give \na tax cut to, who is going to get money back in their pockets. Not too \nmany folks in my State believe it has gone to them. So that is why I \nraise the estate tax.\n  In general, I would just simply say we know President after \nPresident, Republican and Democrat, has extended unemployment benefits \nas emergency spending for decades. I am just very disappointed that \nnow, suddenly, that is trying to be changed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank my colleague for the good conversation, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves to refer \n     the House Message to accompany H.R. 4213 to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate with changes to include a permanent extension of the \n     15 percent income tax rate on capital gains and dividends \n     under section 1(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and \n     to include provisions which decrease spending or increase net \n     revenues as appropriate to offset such permanent extension.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we are obviously considering a tax bill \nin the middle of a recession, with a lot of folks out of work. Yet we \nare talking very little about the fact that, within 6 months, tax rates \nfor every American and every business are going to go up. It is already \nbeginning to create uncertainty in our economy. Folks who would \notherwise take risks and invest are holding back because of the \nincrease in taxes.\n  One of the main focuses of what we are doing needs to be on capital \ngains taxes as well as dividend taxes. Right now, the capital gains \ntax, in January, is going up--if we do nothing--from 15 to 20 percent. \nThis will discourage investment. The dividend tax will go up from 15 \npercent to the top rate of nearly 40 percent.\n  The Heritage Foundation estimates that if we would hold tax rates the \nsame on these two taxes, we would save over 250,000 jobs next year \nalone.\n  I am asking my colleagues to consider the urgent need to keep our \ncurrent tax rates the same, particularly on capital gains and \ndividends, as we know a lot of seniors are living in part off dividends \nthey receive. If we raise the tax rates on them, it is not going to do \nanything to help them or our economy.\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\n  I am asking that this bill be referred back to committee, that they \nadd this requirement that the capital gains and dividends stay the \nsame, at 15 percent, and bring it back to the floor for a vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to address my colleagues on a \ncouple of different issues. One would be to speak in support of part of \nthe Coburn amendment, and the second one would be to speak on the issue \nof taxes.\n  I want to speak in favor of Senator Coburn's amendment that would \nrepeal a special deal for California. As I have said before, Medicare's \npayment system for physicians is flawed in many ways. One of those \nflaws has resulted in unfairly low payments to physicians in my own \nState of Iowa and many other rural States over the course of many \nyears.\n  Medicare payments vary from one area to another based upon geographic \nadjustments made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \nThese adjustments are supposed to reflect the differences in the cost \nof providing care in different areas and equalizing physician payment. \nBut the geographic adjustors have been a dismal failure. They do not \naccurately represent the costs in rural States. Instead, they have \ncreated unfairly low Medicare rates and have, in fact, even discouraged \nphysicians from practicing in rural areas such as Arkansas, New Mexico, \nMissouri, Iowa, North Dakota, and maybe, you could say, a lot of rural \nStates.\n  Last fall, I offered an amendment to reform the unfair formula that \nhas caused these unduly low rural payments during the Finance Committee \nmarkup of the health care reform bill. My amendment requires CMS to use \naccurate data rather than inaccurate proxies to calculate the \ngeographic adjustors for physician practice costs. My amendment was \naccepted unanimously by the entire Senate Finance Committee, and it was \nincluded in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was \nsigned into law by the President in March. It is a national solution to \nthis problem that has plagued so many rural States.\n  Unfortunately, the rural equity that my amendment would finally \nachieve has been endangered by the Democratic majority's sweetheart \ndeals. One of these sweetheart deals was added to the Senate health \ncare reform bill that is now law. This special deal was added behind \nthe closed doors of the Senate majority leader, and it addressed the \nunfairly low payments in rural States. It was included in the Senate \nhealth reform bill for two of my Democratic colleagues from so-called \nfrontier States. It is what I call the frontier freeloader provision. \nAnd it can be called that because it just helped five States at the \nexpense of 45 others.\n\n  The frontier freeloader deal gives higher Medicaid payments to just \nfive States--North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah--\nand it is at the expense of every other State. Even though Iowa, New \nMexico, Arkansas, Missouri, and other rural States do not benefit from \nthis deal, they have to pay for it. Here we are. Taxpayers in your \nState and mine--all the other 45 States--have to kick in to pay the $2 \nbillion for higher Medicare payments for these 5 so-called frontier \nStates. This is another example of how the secret deals made by the \nDemocratic majority leader to get votes during health care reform led \nto bad policies such as the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Louisiana \npurchase,'' and the Florida ``Gator aid.'' I introduced legislation in \nApril to repeal this sweetheart deal for frontier states. My bill, the \nMedicare Rural Health Care Equity Act, would eliminate this special \ndeal for these five States. We should improve physician payments for \nall rural States, not just a select few.\n  The Coburn amendment would address a similar concern--yet another \nspecial deal for just one State has been included in the Democrat's tax \nextender bill. Section 522 of the Democratic substitute would provide \n$400 million over 10 years to create yet a new system for calculating \npayments for physicians in rural areas, but you know what, only in one \nState--California. This is just one more example of the sweetheart \ndeals that have permeated the Democratic leadership's efforts during \nthese times. Will these special deals ever stop? I strongly oppose \nthese sweetheart deals, and I will continue to speak out against them, \nand I will continue to work to pass legislation to repeal these special \ndeals, such as the Medicare Rural Health Care Equity Act, that I \nintroduced this year.\n  That is why I strongly support the amendment by my colleague from \nOklahoma to strike this $400 million sweetheart deal for California \nfrom the bill, and I urge my colleagues, especially those from other \nrural States, to do the same. You see, what happens here when you start \ndoing something for 1 State here and 5 States over here--there are \nabout 30 States, maybe 35 States that have similar problems. We ought \nto attack these similar problems with the same principle, as I see it.\n  As I said, I wish to continue to address my colleagues on the subject \nof time-sensitive tax legislative business. I have already spoken on \nother items. I have a chart here that says what the four items are that \nare time sensitive that we ought to be working on and how far we have \ngotten on some of them. Obviously, as you can see from the Xs there, we \nhave not gotten very far on most of them.\n  Last week, I discussed the unfinished tax legislative business. This \nchart gives you an update of the legislation before the Senate. It \ndeals with only one small, however important, part of unfinished tax \nlegislative business.\n  These tax extenders are on their second Senate stop. This is the bill \nnow before the Senate. As this chart shows, the tax extenders which are \noverdue by almost half a year are not alone. There are three other \nmajor areas of unfinished business.\n  One area is the one I discussed a couple of days ago--the alternative \nminimum tax, the AMT patch. That issue, if you do not deal with it, is \ngoing to raise the taxes of 24 million Americans, middle-class \nAmericans who, frankly, were never intended to pay the alternative \nminimum tax. If we do not fix it, 24 million people are going to see \ntheir taxes go up.\n  Yesterday, I addressed the issue of the death tax. That is an area \nwhich is very important. I took a lot of time of my colleagues last \nnight to explain the issue and particularly the impact on small, \nfamily-owned businesses that may be sold off because we do not have a \ngood estate tax policy.\n  The third area and the one I am going to address now is the 2001 and \n2003 tax rate cuts and family tax relief package. That is the one that, \nif Congress does nothing between now and December 31, starting January \n1, 2011, the American people are going to have the biggest tax increase \nin the history of the country and without even a vote of Congress. \nExisting law, with the tax reductions of 2001 and 2003, sunsets. \n``Sunset'' simply means that if Congress does nothing, the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of the country happens without us even casting \na vote here in the Senate.\n  As important as the AMT patch and the death tax are, these two I just \nmentioned are dwarfed by the impact of this third package of expiring \ntax provisions. I am referring to the marginal rate cuts and the family \ntax relief of the bipartisan tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and \n2003. Efforts to make these tax relief packages permanent were \nrebuffed. The resistance was the result of a hard and determined \nminority back then, marshaled by the Senate Democratic leadership. It \nwas reflected in the budget resolutions offered in filibusters.\n  Even more inexplicable than the Democratic leadership's failure to \nextend popular and bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 were \nsome of the reasons given. It was basically said that since Republicans \nwrote the law, it is our--meaning Republicans--problem. The left wing \nof the blogosphere echoed the Democratic leadership's position.\n  Some of those reflections in the blogosphere even alleged that the \nsunset was a Republican conspiracy. I\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\ncame across a 2007 posting on Daily KOS blog. The posting referred to \nthe provisions of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n2005, which was enacted in May 2006. That legislation contained two \nbasic pieces. One was an extension of lower rates for capital gains and \ndividends. Another was the extension of the alternative minimum tax \npatch. The poster's analysis concluded that the bill was a ``poison \npill'' designed--can you believe it--to sabotage the economy, which \nsupposedly would increase the prospects of Republican candidates in \n2012. I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but that is what the KOS \nposting on their blog said. The argument seems to be that having \npopular and bipartisan tax relief from 2001 and 2003 all sunset at the \nend of 2010 would cause such an economic mess that the Democrats, \nassumed by the posters to be in power at the time, will take the blame \nand suffer at the polls.\n  In the posting titled ``The Monster Republican Tax Hike,'' the poster \nstated that:\n\n       Republican Congresses chose not to make their tax cuts . . \n     . permanent.\n\n  The argument seems to be that Republicans put sunset clauses in the \nbill solely to improve long-term budget projections and that \nresponsibility for the expiration of tax relief rests completely with \nRepublicans. The implication is that by lowering taxes, Republicans are \nresponsible for a tax increase that would occur when the Democratic \nmajorities control both Houses of Congress. That is a little far-\nfetched because it is just some sort of conspiracy that you can control \nthe electorate and these things are going to exactly work out this way. \nThat is obviously stupid, but that doesn't keep bloggers from talking--\nwhatever they want to believe.\n  The commentaries I just referred to are available to anyone in the \nApril 12, 2007, edition of the Congressional Record.\n  I have heard some Members on the other side as well as key staff have \nmade similar assertions. As one who was involved in the writing of \nthese tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003, I want to tell my fellow \nSenators without reservation that these assertions are absolutely \nuntrue, besides being ridiculous. To begin with, it is completely \nridiculous to suggest that President Bush and Republicans in general \ndid not intend or desire the permanence of tax relief. President Bush \nand Republicans in general have favored tax relief permanence. You need \nto look no further than the budgets to which I referred. The \nadministration and Republican Congress budgeted for extension of the \nbipartisan tax relief provisions. That action affected the bottom lines \nof those budgets.\n  We heard over and over the criticism of those budgets. We heard it \nfrom the Democratic leadership, liberal think tanks, and some \nsympathetic east coast media. As a matter of fact, after 3\\1/2\\ years \nof congressional control, we still hear the Democratic leadership's \ncriticism every day. Just recently, the Speaker of the House was asked \nwhen the Democratic leadership would cease laying the blame for all \nfiscal problems on Republican budgets of the years 2001 to 2006. \nMSNBC's Chuck Todd recently interviewed the highest ranking Democrat in \nthe House. Mr. Todd asked if there was a statute of limitations on \nplacing responsibility on the Presidency of Mr. Bush.\n\n       At what point do you think the public says something [like \n     this]? ``You know what, yes, we were unhappy with the Bush \n     administration . . . [but] stop blaming the Bush \n     administration.\n\n  Mr. Todd went on to say:\n\n       When does that run out?\n\n  But then the Speaker specifically replied:\n\n       Well, it runs out when the problems go away.\n\n  The blame game is no substitute for doing the job you have been hired \nto do. People elect folks to public office to do--what? To govern; \ngovern at the will of the people. Governing is not just about enjoying \nthe benefits of public office. This is a public trust we hold. We work \nfor the American people; they don't work for us. Part of governing is \nalso about making choices. Some of those choices are tough, as we know, \nand those of us in public life need to be accountable for those \nchoices.\n  The Democratic leadership cannot have it both ways. They cannot \ncontinue the bipartisan tax relief and not be responsible for the \ndeficit impact those policies carry. No family can make decisions about \nits budget and evade the consequences by blaming their next-door \nneighbors. No business can make decisions about its budget and evade \nthe consequences by blaming a competing business. The fiscal \nconsequences are an important part of that decision.\n  The statutory pay-go or pay-as-you-go regime was enacted as part of \nthe last debt limit increase. It covers only part of the revenue loss \nof making permanent the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003. \nFor instance, the alternative minimum tax patch is extended for only 2 \nyears. Death tax policy is extended at 2009 levels only through 2011. \nHow do you plan estates when you only have a tax law in place for 2 \nyears?\n  Even with those limitations, the Joint Committee on Taxation states: \nComplying with the pay-go rule means a revenue loss of over $1.5 \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nJoint Committee on Taxation's estimate of the tax relief covered by \nstatutory pay-go. And this is a summation of that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS17JN10.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS17JN10.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The expiring tax relief I am talking about today \nincludes the marginal rate cuts and family tax relief. Under the \nstatutory pay as you go, the amount permitted in this area is about \n$1.4 trillion as you can see at the top of the chart on the right. It \ncovers about 80 percent of extending all of the marginal rate cuts and \nfamily tax relief from the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan plan.\n  That number makes sense because the bipartisan tax relief plans cut \ntaxes for virtually every American family who pays income tax. How \nsignificant and how widespread is this tax relief? This chart here, \ndrawn by the Congressional Budget Office--and I want to remind people \nthroughout the Nation that CBO is a professional group of people who \nsee numbers as what they are, void of politics, and make predictions. \nSo I hope this may shed some light on the question of how significant \nand widespread is the tax relief.\n  The line measures the effective tax rate paid by the top 5 percent of \nthe taxpayers. That is at the top, the top line. This group roughly \nrepresents those taxpaying families with incomes over $250,000. Under \nthe Democratic leadership's budget, this line will go back up to where \nit was in the year 2000. That is also where the President's budget, \nmeaning President Obama's budget, and the statutory pay-as-you-go \nregime would take the rates.\n  The Republicans believe this significant tax increase will be a \nmistake. We hope we will be able to debate this policy in the House and \nSenate, in committee and on the floor. That was, after all, the process \nthat was followed when the bipartisan tax relief plans were passed in \nyears 2001, 2003, and 2005.\n  We will point out that about half of the heavy tax increases will \nfall on small business owners. The top marginal rate on small business \nowners will rise by 17 percent. Democrats and Republicans agree, small \nbusinesses are a key job creator of the future and for a long period of \ntime in our country. President Obama correctly points out that small \nbusiness creates 70 percent of new jobs. I do not argue with his \npercentage.\n  The rest will also hit investment hard. The top capital gains rate \nwill rise by 33 percent. The top dividend rate could rise by almost 275 \npercent. All of this is set to occur not at some far distant future \npoint, it occurs a little over a half a year from right now.\n  We all hope the economy is on a path to recovery. But does this heavy \ntax increase on small business owners and investments ever make sense? \nBecause even the most liberal Members on the other side might wonder \nwhether it makes sense right now to increase taxes at this time. Is the \nrecession ending? There is good news some days, bad news some days. But \nthe uncertainty is a factor that people do not want to move forward \nwith investment and creating jobs.\n  Do we think then that the private sector will grow if we hit small \nbusinesses and investors this hard 6 months from now? They are not \ngoing to wait 6 months from now to make some decisions. They are making \nthose decisions right now. If we can give them some certainty, I think \nit would be a big boost for our economy.\n  You can see that the broad bipartisan tax relief brought the \neffective rate down with respect to the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers. \nThis is the red line. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle may be thinking to themselves, sure, this is true for income \ntaxes. But what about other Federal taxes such as Social Security, \nwhich make up a large percentage of the taxes paid by middle and low-\nincome individuals?\n  Well, this chart is not just a depiction of Federal income taxes, it \nincludes all Federal taxes. This includes Social Security, other \npayroll taxes, excise taxes, frequently referred to by my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle as regressive taxes, everything, including \nall Federal taxes over the last 30 years.\n  The top 5 percent has paid a lot higher effective tax rate than the \nbottom 95 percent. It has been that way no matter which party has \ncontrolled the White House or controlled Congress or controlled both. \nIt shows something you would never know if you listened to the rhetoric \nfrom the other side or even the punditry of the media and the left.\n  Here is what it shows: A progressive income tax system is very deeply \nembedded into our culture. The bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and \n2003 made the system yet more progressive. Those plans brought the \nrates down for the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers. The 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief plans dropped the effective tax rate for taxpaying families \nunder $250,000 to their lowest levels in a whole generation.\n  This is the current law level of taxation. In a little over half a \nyear, these rates will pop back up for all of these taxpayers. I have a \ncouple of charts that illustrate how significant the tax hit will be. \nMiddle-income families will run right through these tax walls. I have \nused these charts several times in the last few months.\n  For a family of four with an income of $50,000, that is a tax wall of \na $2,300 tax increase. For a single mom with two kids earning $30,000, \nthat tax wall will be $1,100. The President, as powerful as he is, \ncannot unilaterally hike or cut taxes. He needs a bill from Congress to \ndo that. On our side, we want all of the tax relief made permanent. We \nwant the opportunity to debate and to amend a bill that deals with this \nbasic level of taxation.\n  As has been made clear for the last 3\\1/2\\ years, Republicans do not \ncontrol this Congress. We cannot decide the fate of the marginal rate \ncuts and family tax relief. This is unfinished business. It is \nunfinished tax legislative business that affects every American \ntaxpayer. It will have fiscal consequences. They are pretty significant \nfiscal consequences, as you can see by the figures on this chart. That \nis going to raise taxes an awful lot. If the Democratic leadership \nwants to keep these levels of taxation low, then they have to deal with \nthe fiscal consequences. Alternately, the Democratic leadership can \nraise taxes and claim the revenue.\n  Not changing the law by failing to act is the same as raising rates \non virtually every American taxpayer. But they will have to explain to \nthe taxpayers why they raised taxes by almost 10 percent, on average. \nIn the 2006 election, almost 4 years ago, the American people provided \nthe Democratic leadership with control of the Congress. In the 2008 \nelection, over 18 months ago, the American people provided the \nDemocratic leadership with yet the largest majority in more than a \ngeneration. They also provided the Democratic leadership with a \nPresident of their party.\n  The Democratic leadership spent the periods of 2001 to 2006 thwarting \nour efforts to make bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent. \nIt would seem okay to keep Republican bills from 2001 through 2006 from \nbeing made permanent, but the 2001 tax bill was very bipartisan.\n  Upon assuming control, they have spent 3\\1/2\\ years with no \nlegislation to make permanent or even extend marginal tax rates and \nfamily tax relief packages. My friends in the Democratic leadership \nneed to step to the plate. We have had budgets and statutory pay-as-\nyou-go. We have debated this and voted on the breadth and composition \nof marginal rate cuts and family tax relief in those contexts, yet no \nlegislative action; no House committee and floor action; no Senate \ncommittee and floor action. And that would be the bottom line there. \nThe Xs show nothing happening on something to give permanence to tax \nlaw, to give predictability to the future of those people who have to \nput up money to create jobs that expand our economy.\n  Without it, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country \ncould be a fact. So I say once again, step to the plate. Blaming former \nPresident George W. Bush and Republican Congresses of many sessions ago \nis no substitute for running this time-sensitive tax legislative \nbusiness through the process. Put forward proposals. Let us debate \nthose proposals. Let's allow for amendments. Allow votes on amendments. \nDo the people's business. It is time to check every one of these boxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I offered a rather lengthy amendment to \nthis bill, not because I was trying to be cute, but I think the \nAmerican people have got to hear from us on whether we are going to \nmake some of the commonsense changes they would expect us to make.\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n  There are a lot of easy votes in this amendment. I mean, to not pay \ncontractors when they do not deserve to be paid, whether to continue to \ndo it, we did it to the tune of $6 billion at the Pentagon in the last \n6 years. That is not hard.\n  To quit printing and wasting money on printing things we should not \nbe printing, that is not hard. But the debate is.\n  It is just as important as taking care of those people who are \nunemployed. If we don't cycle through to a good recovery, we are going \nto have less opportunity to borrow money to help those people who are \nunemployed. We now stand at a crossroads we have never been at before. \nOur gross debt is in excess of $17 trillion. Our net debt is at $13.2 \ntrillion. The difference between that is the money the Congress has \nstolen from Social Security and myriad other trust funds that are much \nsmaller. But we have borrowed it and put a piece of paper in that says: \nWe will pay you back.\n  The fact is, we have to pay interest. It is compounded. We will \neventually have to pay it back. Only in Washington would we talk about \nnet debt when, in fact, we are paying interest on the gross debt.\n  We had testimony before the debt commission 2 weeks ago by Dr. \nReinhart, one of the leading economists in the country, who said we are \nin excess of 90 percent of our GDP, our debt. What did they tell us? We \nare struggling with a recession. We are trying to come out of a \nrecession. They told us with that much debt, it is suppressing the \ngrowth of our economy by 1 percent a year. One percent a year is $170 \nbillion in productivity and economic activity that didn't happen. If we \ncalculate that in terms of jobs, that is about 3 million jobs that are \nnot going to be created next year because Congresses before us and this \none as well have refused to live within their means.\n  We have, in terms of Washington, a relatively small bill now, $100 \nbillion plus. It was pulled from the floor to make it smaller--not to \npay for a significant amount more, just to make it smaller--when, in \nfact, what the American people want us to do is find something within \nthe Federal Government that doesn't make sense, don't borrow it from \nour children, do the hard work of finding what is not working here.\n  We are going to have a cloture vote on this legislation. My hope is, \nunless we change this bill, that this bill does not proceed until we \naccede to the demands of the American public. It is simple: Congress, \nstart living like we are living. Start making the hard choices. When \nyou have a limited budget, do what is most important first. Do what is \nleast important last. Get rid of waste, get rid of things that should \nhave been gotten rid of a long time ago and do what is best for the \nfuture.\n  We are not doing that with this bill, and we can't get anybody to \ndebate on the other side. They will not defend it. You cannot defend \nborrowing $50 billion more against our children and grandchildren when \nwe have $300 billion of waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication in the \ngovernment right now that we have rejected every time when those \namendments come to the floor. You can't do it.\n  So we play the political game in Washington. We had it in February, \nwhen our colleagues passed pay-go. It is really to pay-go or not to \npay-go. What pay-go means is, you American taxpayers, you pay, and we \nwill go spend your money.\n  The statute said we would no longer spend new money on anything \nunless we paid for it. Since February 12 when this bill was signed into \nlaw, on February 24 we borrowed $46 billion. We waived pay-go. We said \nthe rule doesn't apply now. This is more important. It was the highway \ntrust fund. Rather than cut some of the waste, fraud, and abuse, rather \nthan cut out some of the things that are duplications, we borrowed that \nfrom our grandchildren. We did it twice in March, $99 billion out of \nthe Senate and $10 billion. One was for an extension; one was for the \noverall tax extenders. We didn't quit there. April came, $18 billion \nmore. May came, May 20, we did $20 billion more. Pay-go didn't apply. \nWe waived it. We said it doesn't count. The rule doesn't count.\n  What good is it to have a rule or a statute that says we are not \ngoing to steal from our children anymore, and every time something \ncomes up we steal from our children? It is a farce. It is meaningless. \nThat is why we didn't vote for it, because it was just a charade to \ntell the American people somebody was doing something they actually \nweren't.\n  The proof is in the pudding. Then we borrowed $59 billion on May 27. \nNow we have a bill out here on June 17 that is going to borrow another \n$50 billion. How valuable are the lives of our children that we would \nsteal opportunity? That sounds like a fallacious claim. It is not.\n  I want you to meet Madeline. Madeline is a little girl. I saw this on \nthe Internet. I actually got to meet her. Her sign actually said \n$37,000 6 months ago. In the last 6 months, she has gone from owing \n$37,000, every individual, man, woman and child in this country, to \nowing $42,000. What is her life worth? What is the opportunity for her \nworth? Are children just a toy, or do we owe it to them, based on what \nhas been given to us, to create opportunity and a chance for a better \nlife for the Madelines of this country?\n  The problem is, as we are set up right now, 9 years from now, that \nnumber is going to be $187,000 per man, woman, and child. In 25 years, \nif we don't change what we are doing--and we will change because the \nworld financial community will quit loaning us money--it will be over \n$1 million.\n  Put your calculator on for a minute and calculate 6 percent of 1 \nmillion. That is the interest cost for what we will have spent in money \nthat we didn't have per person in this country. That is $60,000 25 \nyears from now that every one of us who is still alive will be paying \neach year just in additional interest before we do anything with the \nFederal Government.\n  This government is so far out of control. It is not President Obama's \nfault, it is the Congress's fault. Presidents can't do things without \nus. We allow it or don't allow it. We have been rebellious against the \nprinciples and values that made this country great. There has never \nbeen a country that has achieved--economically, culturally, and \nscientifically--anything close to what we have created. Congresses are \ndestroying it. This bill is another drop that will eventually turn the \nstatute over that says the future is not here.\n  This isn't a partisan debate, this is a generational debate. We are \nthieving. Generational theft is what we are about because we lack the \ncourage to confront the real problems we have and embrace, though it \nmay cost us politically, doing the right things to ensure an American \ndream for the Madelines of this world. We are failing to do that. What \nan abandonment of our oath, what a rejection of what was given to us. \nYet we have the gall to come out here week after week and spend money \nwe don't have on some things that are necessary, some that are not, but \nthat allow us to continue to spend billions of dollars on things that \nwe should not be spending it on because, basically, we lack courage. It \nis cowardice.\n  I am committed not just to Madeline. This doesn't have anything to do \nwith the Republican or Democratic Party. It has to do with the survival \nof our country as we know it.\n  Yet we continuously hear: No, we can't. We can't do this. We can't do \nthis. We can't get rid of the easy things to get rid of because \nsomebody well heeled or somebody well connected somewhere doesn't want \nus to. So who runs the country? Do the people of this country control \nus or is it the well heeled or the well connected or those who will be \nadvantaged by us continuing to waste money?\n  Is it a fact that we spent $6 billion over the last 5 years paying \nperformance bonuses to companies that contract with the Federal \nGovernment on performance they didn't earn, and we will not pass a law \nin a bill that says they can't do that anymore? Who is getting that \nmoney? Whose palms are we greasing? The fact is, we will not vote that \nout of here and say it isn't going to happen anymore. You are either \ngoing to perform under your contract or you are going to lose the \ncontract, and we are not going to give you bonuses for not performing. \nYet three times the Senate has voted that down.\n  Who benefits? It certainly isn't the average American. It is some \ncorporate client somewhere who has too good of a sweetheart deal \ncontracting with the Federal Government and has allies\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\nwithin the Congress who say: We will protect you on the basis of having \nhelped them in a campaign before. Do we want a future or do we want \nwell-heeled buddies for the short term when it all collapses around us?\n  What we are is addicted to bad behavior. We are addicted to spending \nmoney that we don't have on things we don't need. We are addicted to \nnot confronting the very real problems in the government. Again, it is \nnot President Obama or President Bush's fault. Congress has that \nresponsibility. We reject our responsibility. We have abandoned our \nresponsibility and, with that, our integrity by not doing what we \nshould do.\n  As a physician, I know what addictive behaviors are all about. What \ndo we need to do? One of the things President Obama wants us to do that \nwe refuse to do is to end no-bid contracts. Let's end the sweetheart \ndeals. Let's get rid of the no-bid contracts that the well connected, \nwell heeled get to have at a higher price than what we would pay if we \ncompetitively bid it. Why don't we do that? That has been voted down by \nthis body as well twice; we can't do that; we have to protect our \nfriends; we are more interested in protecting our friends than we are \nin saving the country. Eliminate bonuses to contractors, I talked about \nthat. Determine the total number, cost, and purpose of every Federal \nprogram. The Government Accountability Office can't give us that \nnumber. It is too big. The Congressional Research Service can't tell us \nall the government programs, what their cost and what their purpose is.\n  We did get through, late last year, an amendment that is going to \nforce the Government Accountability Office to tell us. Do you know how \nlong it will take them to tell us? Three years. That is how big the \nproblem is. With all their resources, it is still going to take them 3 \nyears to tell us all the government programs.\n  What do we know that I found out and my staff has found out in \nresearching this over the last 5\\1/2\\ years? We have identified at \nleast 640 different areas where there are more than five programs that \nhave the same goal run by different agencies in the Federal Government.\n  We know, for example, right now some American people are struggling \nand a lot of people are actually having trouble getting enough food. So \nwe have to guess how many programs to help feed those people who are \nneeding food? Across six different Departments, we have 70 government \nprograms. Not one of them has a metric on it to say: Are you effective? \nHow do you measure your effectiveness? But we have 70 sets of overhead \nin the Federal Government to do exactly the same thing.\n  You may say, How in the world did that happen? I will tell you how it \nhappens. Some constituent comes up here and says: Here is a problem. \nOh, yes, it is a problem. We do not research it to see what the Federal \nGovernment is already doing, so we author a bill. Because nobody wants \nto keep food away from the hungry, we pass a bill, not knowing that we \nalready have 69 other programs. That happens time after time after \ntime, still today, because we do not know what we have.\n  In math, engineering, science, and technology, which is where we \nwould like for lots of our young people to go, we have documented 105 \ndifferent programs that are funded by the Federal Government to \nincentivize our young people to go into those areas in eight different \ngovernment agencies, eight different government Departments. Not the \nDepartment of Education--some of them are in there--but in every area. \nWhy? Yet we do not want to do the hard work of eliminating those.\n  Let's identify the 105, and let's cut it to one. Let's put metrics on \nit. Let's have just one set of overhead. Let's accomplish that.\n  We have added 160,000 Federal employees in the last 16 months. Every \nbusiness I know out there is doing more with less. That is not a \ndenigration to our Federal employees. It is embracing reality that we \ncannot continue to add Federal employees. We cannot afford the \ngovernment we have. Forty-three cents out of every dollar the Federal \nGovernment spends today is borrowed from China or Russia or countries \nwith sovereign bank accounts, many of which would like to see us end. \nCan we continue to do that? Can we continue to have 40 percent of \neverything we are spending borrowed?\n  What we do know is, necessity becomes the mother of invention, and if \nwe put the clamps and the brakes on both the growth and the size and \nthe total amount the government spends, we will get more for the same \namount--but not until we try, not until we mandate it has to happen.\n  Limit the overhead costs of the Federal programs. The overhead and \nthe layers of duplication are unbelievable. A tremendous amount of \nsavings can be done. I just visited with a three-star general who is \nworking inside the Pentagon. One of the areas where I want to see us \neliminate $50 billion a year in spending is inside the Pentagon because \nthey have that much waste. They are going through a process now to look \nat where they have redundancy. Do you know what. They are finding it \neverywhere. But the Pentagon is so big, unless you look for it you are \nnever going to see it.\n  So we now have the military starting to do what they finally need to \ndo. They have never done it before--starting to look at redundancy, \nstarting to look at good management, best practices, to create \nefficiencies so more dollars can defend us and less dollars will be \nspent on overhead. We need to do that government-wide, but especially \nin the Pentagon because it is our greatest discretionary cost with the \nexception of interest.\n  Disclose the cost, purpose, and text of legislation that is \nconsidered by Congress. There should not be a bill that comes before \nCongress that we do not adequately and accurately know what it is \ndesigned to do. Have a measurement on it so we know it did what we \ndesigned it to do, know what it is going to cost, and then force \nourselves to evaluate it.\n  This is the 111th Congress. In the 109th Congress, I held 47 \noversight hearings. That was more oversight hearings than the entire \nrest of the Senate combined. You see, we do not want to do the \noversight because it is hard work and you do not get great press \nclippings. It does not help your campaign, your political career. But \nwe were not sent up here for a political career. We were sent here to \ndo the best, right thing for the country as a whole.\n  Most of the problems we are seeing are parochial in nature, where we \nhave concentrated on what is best for our State at the expense of what \nis best for our country. I would posit that my State, Oklahoma, and the \nPresiding Officer's State cannot be healthy if the country is not \nhealthy. They cannot be. Yet when our focus becomes more parochial than \nnational, we actually undermine our future as a country.\n  No. 8, require the Congress to justify the creation of new government \nprograms that duplicate existing ones. I am notorious for not letting \nbills get to the floor because they duplicate something that has \nalready been done. We have created a new program, but we did not \neliminate the old one, so now we have both of them running. I usually \nget beat. I usually get rolled with 60 votes and we create the new \nprogram. But we never eliminated the one that was not working, and we \nnever changed the one that was not working. So we just create another \nprogram.\n  Mandate that Congress has to do oversight--has to do it. It must do \noversight. We can do that by changing our rules. But we do not have any \ninterest in changing our rules. It is easier to coast and not do the \nhard job of oversight.\n  I will just finish up.\n  One of the things I have thought about--I am not sure it will be \nhelpful, but right now in the trouble we are in, everybody who walks \nthrough this Capitol ought to be informed of how much debt we owe and \nwhat it is per person. We ought to have that. It is in my office. If \nyou walk by--the Rules Committee will not let me put it in the hall; \nthey say it does not look professional--I have a computer screen where, \nif you walk by my office, you can see the national debt clock ticking. \nYour eyes will roll as fast as it is coming up. Remember, we are \nborrowing about $4 million a second. That is how fast it is going up.\n  So, anyhow, there are a lot of things we can do to stop the \naddiction.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia.\n  I ask the Senator, did you want to have some time? I will be happy to \nyield to you if you would yield back to me.\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding. I will be brief.\n  But I spend a lot of time, as all of us do, listening to the speeches \nof our colleagues. I spend a lot of time thinking about what they say. \nI was compelled to come to the floor, as I heard the opening remarks by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, to tell a little story.\n  Talking about grandchildren, my wife and I are blessed. We have nine \nof them. This past Tuesday, June 15, was our 42nd wedding anniversary. \nReally, the rest of my life is about those grandchildren, to whatever \nextent I can do it, either as a grandfather or a legislator, trying to \nmake sure we leave them a life that at least has the hope of \nopportunity as great as was left to all of us by the generations who \npreceded us.\n  A few weeks ago, in Albany, GA--actually a few months ago--I was \nmaking a speech, as all of us do, and used ``a trillion'' as easily as \nall of us do in our speeches. After my speech, I opened the floor for \nquestions, and a gentleman at the back of the room said: I just can't \nquite get my hands on how much a trillion really is. Can you explain \nit?\n  I was up there doing the best I could. I got the number of zeroes \npast a billion, and all this. But I could not quantify it to magnify \nthe gravity of what that number means.\n  So when I got home that night, my wife of 42 years suggested: Why \ndon't you just figure out how many years have to go by for a trillion \nseconds to pass? I said: You know, that is a good idea. Everybody would \nunderstand that.\n  So I got the calculator out and multiplied 60 times 60 to get how \nmany seconds are in an hour, 3,600; multiplied that by 24 to get how \nmany seconds are in a day; multiplied that by 365 to get how many \nseconds are in a year. Then I divided that into 1 trillion. The answer \nis it would take 31,709 years for 1 trillion seconds to go by.\n\n  Thursday, 2 weeks ago, our debt went above $13 trillion. So you can \ntake that and multiply 13 times 31,709 and see how big that obligation \nis. If you spread it over a lot of people, you can reduce the number \ndown to an amount that does not seem as big, but we are one country. It \nis our debt. To pay it off we do one of either three things: We inflate \nthe dollar to a value that is so cheap that what everybody has is \nworthless, and you pay off the debt with cheap dollars, but you destroy \nyour country or you can just look the other way and say: Well, maybe \nnobody else will care. Maybe they will still buy our debt. We are going \nto keep spending, which is kind of what appears to be happening now or \nyou can do what American families have been doing all their lives, but \nin particular the last 18 to 24 months: you sit around the kitchen \ntable--and in this case we sit around the conference table--and you \nstart setting your priorities to live within your means.\n  I just want to commend the Senator from Oklahoma because his examples \nabout accountability for expenditures, doing away with redundancy and \nall those things--yes, that is hard to do, and, yes, it is tedious to \ndo, and, yes, it is more fun to talk about other things, but that is \nwhat Americans are having to do, and they are having to do it big time \nright now.\n  So I just could not help but come to the floor, having just \ncelebrated my 42nd wedding anniversary. Well, I did not get to \ncelebrate it because I was here and she was in Marietta, but we are \ngoing to celebrate it this weekend. Thinking about my nine \ngrandchildren and thinking about the challenges of the debt that is \nrising and the increase that is just in this bill alone--as well as \nsome of the pay-fors in this bill, which actually are going to stunt \ngrowth even worse, like carried interest--I thought I would just come \nand commend the Senator from Oklahoma on being right on point.\n  We all might have different opinions of what ought to be cut and what \nought to be moved and what ought to be removed from being redundant, \nbut we ought to be at the table figuring out what those should be, \nmaking agreements we can live with, and making the future for our \ngrandchildren at least as bright, as prosperous, and as free as the one \nour parents left to us.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. It \ndoes not matter if you are a Democrat or Republican, liberal or \nconservative or Independent, what your faith is, what your sexual \norientation is: Out of many one. But if we are not careful, that one is \ngoing to fall based on what we do, and the debt affects a liberal as \nmuch as it affects a conservative. It steals opportunity from liberal \nchildren as much as it does conservative children. We have to come to a \npoint where we say: Enough is enough.\n  I was just thinking, as the Senator talked, the $50 billion we are \ngoing to borrow from our kids with this bill, it would run the \ngovernment of the entire State of Oklahoma for 8 years--every branch, \nevery employee, pay all the costs, build all the highways, do \neverything we do for 8 years, just on what we are going to borrow.\n  When you start putting it down into, how much is $50 billion?--we \nthrow away billions like they were pennies here.\n  And how many years for a trillion seconds?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. That is 31,709 years.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is 31,709 years. So we are going to have a $1.6 \ntrillion deficit this year. Well, that is 50,000 years of seconds. Just \nthis year, it is 50,000 years of seconds.\n\n  Let me go into the amendment a little bit and talk about it. The \nfirst section of this amendment would require public disclosure of the \namount of any new borrowing or spending approved by the Senate. In \nother words, it is about transparency. It is about letting the American \npeople hold us accountable. It means that on the Senate Web site, after \nwe make new spending decisions and borrowing decisions, we have to \npublicize it so the American people can see it, rather than hide behind \nit. It is simple. There is no score for it on savings. I guarantee it \nwill save money, because if we know the American people are going to \nknow what the financial consequences are of what we do with every vote, \nit is going to change some votes around here.\n  The other question we ought to be asking is why shouldn't they know \nwhat we are doing and the ramifications of it. It is pretty simple. It \nis pretty straightforward. I have told the Rules Committee that I would \npay out of my personal office budget the cost of that program. In other \nwords, I would turn back over $500,000 every year. I will pay for it \nout of my budget and make sure that is available, so there is no cost \nto it whatsoever. I will pay for it out of my budget, out of my office, \nso it doesn't cost us anything. But it gives the transparency the \nPresident and I worked on in this body, and he wants to see from this \nbody, and it makes it available to the American people. So we are going \nto get a vote on that.\n  It is important to know that with this bill, if it passes, we will \nhave borrowed 59 plus 20, that is 79; 89, 97, 143, 513, 252, plus 50--\n$302 billion since February 14, outside of the budget. That is outside \nof the budget. Now, $300 billion will run Oklahoma for 40 years. We \ncould run the whole State of Oklahoma for 40 years on what we have \nspent in 6 months. So why shouldn't we let the American people see what \nwe are doing, since it is going to cost nothing, and it is \ntransparency, so they can hold us accountable? Why should we not do \nthat?\n  The second thing that is important is in the last year, we have \nmarkedly increased--not counting the stimulus bill--the discretionary \nspending of the Federal Government. We didn't leave ourselves out on \nthat. Inflation was nothing, but we increased our own budget by 4.8 \npercent. So the other component of one of these amendments is that 4.8 \npercent, I say we give $100 million of it back, which would be a third \nof that. That means we still get three times what the rest of the \ncountry got in terms of an increase, but it shows at least we are \nwilling to let--and if anybody ran their office with any \nappropriateness, they would have a surplus as well every year. So it is \nnot a hard cut, but it is important, since we gave ourselves a budget \nincrease, that we demonstrate to the American people we are serious \nabout doing it. Vote against it and say you don't think so or vote for \nit and let's put it in this bill. Let's start showing the American\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\npeople we get it. We will do the right, best thing for the country in \nthe long term.\n  I have occasional conversations with the President, and one of the \nthings he has told his administration to do, and we heard it flatly \nrejected--not just rejected but flatly rejected on the basis of a lack \nof knowledge by the chairman of the Finance Committee. He has told \nevery agency to find 5 percent in cuts. Those are the instructions he \nhas sent out to the head of every agency. Why has he done that? Because \nhe knows we have to. This portion of the amendment says that is exactly \nwhat we are going to do. We are going to cut 5 percent of the \ndiscretionary spending of every branch of government save Defense and \nVeterans. Some would say, Well, that is \\1/20\\th of the budget. Yes, it \nis. But when you look at it in light of the size of the agencies today, \nin the last 10 years they are twice as big as they were 10 years ago. \nThey have grown by an average of 10 percent per year and we can't find \n5 percent or one-fifth of the growth they have had over the last 10 \nyears that can be done more efficiently or as a lower priority or not \nas important? We can't find that? Yet, as the Senator from Georgia \nsaid, almost every family in this country is having to do that. We \nrefuse to mandate that the Federal Government get on a diet, do things \nmore efficiently, more effectively; take another look to see if it can \nbe done a different way. It is called productivity increases. We can \nget that.\n  We won't ever get it if we don't ask for it. It is not a hard \nconcept. We can do that. We allow the agencies to make those \nrecommendations, and that is one of the things President Obama has \nalready asked all of his agencies to do, to go find that 5 percent. \nThat sends a wonderful signal to the American people that we get it.\n  It does something else that is important, and so will the defeat of \nthis bill, and if we pass it with it being paid for. Right now in this \ncountry the value of our dollar is pretty good. The reason it is good \nis because people are worried about Japan and the value of the yen, and \nthey are significantly worried about the Euro because of what is \nhappening to Greece and now what is getting ready to happen to Spain. \nSo money is rushing in. Smart money around the world in these other \neconomies is rushing to hide in dollars. In about 2 years from now, \nthat money is going to be sucked back out of here, because those \neconomies will have made the hard choices of austerity with which to \nrestabilize the Euro or their currencies. They will have done it.\n  What we need to send to the international finance market is a signal \nthat says we too are way overextended and we are going to start making \nthe appropriate choices to secure our financial future.\n  It was 2 months ago that Moody's put a notice out that said if things \ndon't happen and start to change with U.S. Government bonds, they are \ngoing to be downgraded from AAA to AA. That is a big downgrade. We have \nnever had an AA rating. So all of a sudden, the world rating system is \ngoing to say that maybe an investment in our product, our dollars, is \nnot what it should be.\n  We need to make sure that doesn't happen. We need to make sure we \nhave sent a signal to the world. When we start doing things where we \nare paying for new things by cutting lower priority items, we send that \nsignal. We build that confidence back. When we start paying for new \nbills and the extensions of benefits, we extend that back up.\n  We are going to hear--actually, we won't hear, because we won't hear \nanybody come out and debate against these things. What they will choose \nto do is to ignore them and then vote against them. So the American \npeople won't hear a legitimate debate on why we shouldn't cut 5 percent \nacross the board, letting them decide what areas are most important and \nrecommending them to us; we won't have a debate. We won't debate, and \nthen we will kill it, thinking it will go away. Well, the American \npeople have gotten that already. That is not acceptable to the American \npeople. If you think we shouldn't cut spending in the Federal \nGovernment, come out here and defend it. Come out here and give us a \nphilosophical, logical reason why we ought to continue to steal from \nour children and grandchildren. We won't see that. We won't see a \nstrong debate against each of the points I am going to make associated \nwith this amendment. The real question ought to be: Why? Because it is \nindefensible to vote against it. That is why. You cannot see the waste, \nfraud, abuse, and duplication in this government and not say we can do \nbetter.\n  Section 4 of the amendment eliminates nonessential government travel. \nDo my colleagues realize that almost every government office now has \naudio-visual equipment for the ability to carry on a teleconference \nanywhere in this country and overseas? Yet, last year, we spent--no, 2 \nyears ago we spent--the data is behind--we spent $13.8 billion on \nairline tickets and hotels for Federal Government employees of which \nover half was nonessential. In 2006, $3.3 billion was spent on airfare. \nIn 2007, $3.5 billion was spent on airfare. In 2008, $4 billion was \nspent on airfare. We can't get the numbers for 2009 yet. Hotel rooms, \n$2.3 billion, up to $2.5 billion. Car rentals, from $423 million to \n$437 million. Most of this can be done by teleconferencing. Why \nwouldn't we say at a time when we are borrowing $1.6 trillion from our \nkids that maybe we ought to teleconference rather than get on an \nairplane? I can tell you it is a whole lot easier than traveling 1,600 \nmiles twice a week. So what does this do? It saves us money.\n  One of my favorite ways of saving money is to cap the printing costs \nin the Federal Government. We have examples of it right here. Every \nday, we put a Calendar of Business out, we put an Executive Calendar \nout, and we publish the Congressional Record, and we print hundreds of \nthousands of copies. You know what. It is all on line. We can save $4 \nbillion over the next 10 years by printing limited amounts of things we \nneed and not printing some things everybody else has access to on a \ncomputer. Why would we not do that? Why would we not cap our printing \ncosts? Think of the thousands of acres of trees we can save every year. \nWhat we know is every year, Federal employees, through our direction, \nspend $1.3 billion on printing. The analysis by GAO says $440 million \nof that is unnecessary. So over 10 years, that is $4.4 billion. That is \n$4.4 billion that we won't take from Madeline. Madeline and her other \n3- and 4-year-olds won't have to pay it back. Remember, they won't be \npaying $4.4 billion back; they will be paying the compounded interest \nthat will double that debt in 10, 12 years. In 20 years, it will triple \nit. In 30, it will quadruple it. So they won't be paying $4.4 billion \nback, they will be paying $20 billion back. Why would we not do that? \nWhy would we not make this decision to do that? It has been rejected by \nthis body in the past.\n  Before the Bush administration left, I was working with them on \nunused Federal real property. We have billions, if not hundreds of \nbillions, in underutilized Federal property owned by the taxpayers.\n  We spend $8 billion a year maintaining buildings we are not using. \nThink about that. We are spending $8 billion a year maintaining \nbuildings we are not using. But we can't sell them because there is a \nlittle bill called the McKinney-Vento Act that says every used building \nin the Federal Government has to be offered as a homeless shelter \nfirst--even if it is an airplane hangar on a closed military base.\n  We created a bureaucracy nightmare that doesn't allow us to do that. \nConsequently, we could take a tenth of the $8 billion we are spending \nand appropriate that directly to the homeless and save $7.2 billion a \nyear. But this body has rejected that as well. They voted it down. They \ndidn't give a reason, they just voted it down. We have 46,745 \nunderutilized properties, 18,849 properties we are not using at all, \nand a total of 65,000 properties we are not utilizing with an estimated \nvalue of $83 billion. That's $83 billion of property you are paying the \nmaintenance on that we are not using, that we could sell and pay for \nalmost all of this bill. But we won't do it.\n  Of course, we don't buy many properties anymore. The reason for that \nis because of the way our budget scoring is, even though it would be \nsmarter to buy it because the total cost of the building is charged to \nthe agency in the year in which the building is completed. None of the \nagencies are buying buildings anymore, they are renting\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nthem. We should not be renting the first building. We should be getting \nrid of the $85 billion worth of buildings we don't need and buying a \nbuilding, because you can own a building a lot cheaper than renting \none--maybe not last year, but commercial rates are coming back up. Yet \nwe don't do it.\n  Since 2005, out of this $85 billion, because of the bureaucratic \nnightmare of steps you have to go through, we have only sold $2.5 \nbillion worth of an $85 billion portfolio. None of you would do that \nwith your own property. If you had property out there that you owned, \nand you were spending 10 percent of the value of that property every \nyear maintaining it, and you weren't utilizing it, and you had an \nopportunity to sell it, you would sell it. Not the Federal Government. \nWe ought to be asking why. Who took a stupid pill to say not to do \nthat?\n  Some of the properties are not of any value, so we ought to demolish \nthem, because it costs less to do that than to maintain them. I will \ngive you a rundown on some of them. On the buildings we now have, which \nwe are utilizing, we have a maintenance backlog of $35.5 billion. We \nare spending money on buildings we don't want, maintaining them, but we \ncan't take care of the buildings we have because we don't have enough \nmoney because we are spending it on buildings we don't use.\n  Section 7 provides that the Department of Defense would auction new, \nunused, or excellent condition excess inventory to the highest bidder, \nrather than transferring it at no cost to State agencies and others. \nYou buy tons of stuff every year through the Defense Department that \nthey don't need. As a matter of fact, they don't even know what they \nhave. It is sitting in warehouses around the country. And what do we do \nwhen we figure out we don't need it? We give it away. When we are $13.2 \ntrillion in debt, it is time to stop giving it away. It is time to get \nsome value for the American taxpayers who paid retail price for that \nand turn around and sell it. It has been voted on before and rejected.\n  I mentioned in my opening words about capping the total number of \nFederal employees this year. That is called a hiring freeze. But it is \nnot a hiring freeze because if you have retirements, you can replace \nthem. We added 160,000 Federal employees in the last 16 months. We have \nonly have an increase in net new jobs of about 450,000. Almost 50 \npercent of the net new jobs have been Federal jobs--at a time when our \ndeficit is going to be one of the highest on record.\n  I say time out. I say do it with whom you have. If you have \nretirements, or people who leave, replace them, but don't increase the \nnumbers anymore. Those numbers don't include the census of 441,000 \ntemporary workers we have hired and will go away. How else are we going \nto get our budget under control if we don't do it in terms of \npersonnel?\n  The other thing is, if you look at the process over the last few \nyears on Federal employees--and I will say it again--I will discuss the \nfact that those of us who think we are in a crisis moment in our \ncountry and feel we ought to be making tough choices would say we ought \nto freeze total salary costs. That is not a salary freeze per \nindividual. That is just saying that in this department, this agency, \nhere is how much you are going to spend on salaries, and we are not \ngoing to go up this year. We are not going to raise the total amount we \nspend on salaries this year. That still allows every manager great \nflexibility. You can promote and give raises to people who are \nperforming. But you can't increase the total amount of money.\n  Why is that important? There is an article in today's paper that OPM \nis starting to look at it. We looked at it, and here is what we know: \nIn 1999, the average Federal salary was $49,536. It is now $78,806. \nInflation during that period of time averaged 2.4 percent. Salary \nincreases during that period of time averaged 4 percent--1\\1/2\\ times \nthe rate of private pay increases in this country.\n  What happened to benefits? Average personnel benefit per Federal \nemployee is nearing $40,000 per year. Depending on how much you make, \nthat may seem like a lot, or not, but when you look at the average \nprivate sector pay, it is $42,000. It is $36,000 less than the average \nFederal employee is paid. I don't want Federal employees to get a cut. \nI just don't think we ought to increase them at a time when most people \naren't getting pay increases. I don't think we ought to increase \nFederal pay.\n  The benefit differential is even more stark. The average for benefits \nfor the average person in this country, who doesn't work for the \nFederal Government, is $20,000 per year. So we have almost twice as \nrich a benefit, or 1\\1/2\\ to 2 times as rich a benefit for Federal \nemployees as everybody else in the country who is employed. I am not \nsaying cut them. I am saying for 1 year let's not let it increase. \nLet's do right by the American people, who are struggling, and let's do \nright by the grandchildren and young children in our country by putting \nsome common sense into what is allowable, given that we are in a time \nof crisis. We voted on that before. It failed.\n  Federal employees also have, unpaid to the Federal Government, $3 \nbillion in back taxes, and that is not under dispute. Federal \nemployees, who average $78,000 a year, owe the Federal Government $3 \nbillion. I say they ought to be paying that. I say it ought to be \ncoming out of their wages. It is time to not allow that as a condition \nof your employment anymore. It seems unconscionable to me that you \ncannot pay your taxes, when you make $78,000 a year, and we are not \ngoing to force you to pay them. So it is a $3 billion savings, but it \nis an important signal to send to people: We are all paying taxes, and \nyou ought to, too, since you make 1\\1/2\\ times what the average person \nin this country makes.\n  We talked earlier about section 11. It eliminates the awarding of \nbonuses to government contractors when they have unsatisfactory \nperformance. That is a no-brainer. Nobody in the private sector is \ngoing to give a bonus to somebody who isn't performing. But the Federal \nGovernment does it all the time. We need to statutorily say you cannot \ndo that anymore.\n  We now know that we spent $6.2 billion at the United Nations last \nyear. We have no transparency from them on how our money was spent. We \nknow we account for 25 percent of their regular budget and 26 percent \nof the peacekeeping budget. We did get a little piece that leaked data \non an audit. We know that nearly 40 percent of the money spent on \npeacekeeping is defrauded. Our voluntary additional contributions to \nthe U.N. were $1.3 billion last year.\n  All this amendment says is, don't give more than a billion to an \nincompetent organization where we cannot find out where they are \nspending our taxpayer money. It is a ridiculous commitment. Why would \nwe even let them have a billion? At least save $3 billion a year over \nthe next 10 years, but by not allowing that to go forward.\n  I want to talk about one other thing I think is important that most \nof this body has voted against several times. We have $1.7 trillion \nsitting in the bank--money that the Congress has appropriated to be \nspent in outyears. Almost $700 billion of that has not been obligated \nfor anything. Yet we have T-bonds and T-bills we are paying interest on \nwhile that sits over there.\n  Prudent management would say that rather than borrow more money, you \nwould use money from the bank account you already have. So this portion \nof the amendment takes $50 billion out of that $700 billion. We ought \nto eliminate it all, if it is unobligated. I recognize they have to \nhave some movement back and forth, but they will never notice that $50 \nbillion that isn't in the unobligated balances, and when that \nexpenditure comes, we can appropriate money for it. We are letting \nmoney sit idle while we borrow additional money to do additional \nthings. This simply says that we move $50 billion out of that.\n  Section 18 is about getting energy efficiency at the Department of \nEnergy.\n  Section 19--I talked to one of the Senators from California on this \namendment. I am not opposed to fixing the problems with Medicare, the \nstatistical inaccuracies in their payments, but I am opposed to not \nfixing it for the five other States that have it as well.\n  It is unfair to take the State of California when the States of \nGeorgia, Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia all have exactly the same \nproblem. Yet in this bill, as we heard Senator Grassley say\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nearlier, we only fixed one of the States. That is called an earmark. \nThere is nothing wrong with fixing it for California, but there is \nplenty wrong with fixing it for California but not fixing it for these \nother four States. If it is something that needs to be fixed, why would \nwe advantage California over these other States? It is called \nfavoritism. It is called exceptionalism. It says that the citizens of \nCalifornia are worth more in this country than the citizens in Ohio and \nGeorgia and Virginia and Michigan. They are not. If it is a problem \nthat needs to be addressed, let's address the whole problem.\n  Why did they not address the whole problem? Because it would have \ncost more money. We are going to borrow $400 million per year to fix it \nin California, and that is OK but it is not OK to fix it in the other \nStates. That is inherently unfair, it borders on the unethical, and it \nis exactly the type of thing the American people reject. If there is a \nproblem, fix it for everybody. Do not single out one group of people at \nthe expense of the rest of Americans.\n  Finally, this amendment eliminates all tax increases in this bill. \nThe last thing we need to be doing right now is decreasing capital \nformation in this country, decreasing the ability to invest in new \nideas, decreasing the capability of small businesses, which this bill \ngoes after in terms of their subchapter S status, and making it more \nexpensive to start a new business or keep one running when 70 percent \nof the jobs that are created in this country--and we are hurting for \njobs--are created by small businesses.\n  This amendment has 20 segments, and we are going to have 20 votes. We \nare going to see where this body lines up on these issues. Vote against \ncommon sense at your peril. Vote against the future of our country. \nVote against Madeline and everybody else like her. Vote to increase the \ndebt even higher. Vote to increase the size of the Federal Government. \nVote to undo pay-go again. Continue doing what we are doing, and what \nwe will see is the American people are going to reject that. They are \nrejecting it now. It is high time we started listening to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the oilspill that \nis absorbing so much of the time and attention of our country. There is \na minor point, one that I think needs to be addressed right now, and \nthat is the Jones Act.\n  The Jones Act was put in place in 1920 to ensure that the United \nStates was able to maintain a fleet of merchant ships. It was really \nfor protection of U.S.-flagged carriers against competition from \nforeign carriers that might undercut our ability to have profitable \nmerchant ships.\n  The Jones Act is currently preventing resources, however, from being \nused in the massive cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico. This legislation \nthat has been on the books since 1920 is hindering foreign vessels from \nassisting gulf communities as they work to prevent oil from reaching \ntheir shores.\n  Currently, foreign vessels need to obtain a Jones Act waiver from the \nFederal Government in order to help with the cleanup efforts. For many \nof the vessels wishing to respond, this request needs to be reviewed by \nthree separate agencies--the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, \nand Customs and Border Protection. That is three layers of bureaucracy \nwhen time is of the essence. During this crisis, we need to cut through \nthe redtape. We must get all available assets on the scene as quickly \nas possible. I think everyone agrees.\n  Other countries have offered their services. They have offered to \nhelp. There are European countries that also drill in the oceans and \nwaters on their shores, and they have offered to send ships to help to \ntry to absorb the oil and skim it off. There are volunteers waiting \nwith the right equipment, and they are willing to come to our aid. We \nshould know that with oil leaking from the ocean's floor, the natural \nresources of the gulf are being destroyed as we speak. We need every \nresource at our disposal to prevent further destruction. In my State of \nTexas, I have a constituent who would like to provide equipment to aid \nin the cleanup--his ship has a foreign flag--but he is unable to help \nbecause no waiver has been issued to the Jones Act in this particular \ncrisis.\n  There is precedent for waiving the Jones Act in disasters. It has \nbeen waived to speed up disaster responses in the past, including a \nwaiver that was issued in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina nearly 5 \nyears ago. It was done by the Executive with an Executive order.\n  Without this key waiver, foreign vessels are prohibited from working \nwith their American counterparts to skim the oils from the water of the \ngulf within 3 miles of shore. Of course, that is where we desperately \nneed to have the most help to skim the oil before it reaches and \ndamages our shores.\n  That is why next week I intend to introduce legislation that will \nwaive the Jones Act for vessels whose sole intent is to assist in the \ncleanup of the Gulf of Mexico. We will ensure these foreign ships will \nwork under the auspices of the Coast Guard. We will make sure there is \na clearinghouse for them, but we should not be waiting to have three \ndifferent Federal agencies look at a Jones Act waiver request when we \nknow what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico. We see the pictures every \nday. This waiver would be applied for a period of time that is \nnecessary to respond to this oilspill and restore the waters of the \nGulf of Mexico during this emergency.\n  The Federal response to this spill has been a little short of \nimmediate. It has been a day late and a dollar short, and that is not \nacceptable. It is time that Congress does what we can with the \nresources we have to urge the administration to act while it can to \nmitigate the damages we know are already there. It is time for us to be \nproactive. It is time for us to act.\n  I look forward to having cosponsors. I am in the process of getting \nthis bill in order now. I want to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. Our Gulf States have a bipartisan senatorial delegation. \nI want to help to do everything possible. If we can waive the Jones Act \nfor this disaster with all of the appropriate cautions that are \nnecessary and get those foreign ships that are ready to help our \ncountry, that have offered to help our country, to get into the 3-mile \nlimit before this oil does further damage to our coast and to the \nwildlife and to the natural resources on our coast, we need to do it. \nThis is something that should have been done weeks ago. It was not \ndone.\n  It is time for Congress to step in. I hope my colleagues will help us \nmove this legislation expeditiously and urge the administration to do \nwhat is within their realm, even before Congress acts. That would be my \nwish. If the President would issue an Executive order, that would do \nit. But since he has not and since weeks have passed, it is time for \nCongress to take the reins and try to do everything that is within our \npower to mitigate the damage to the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Baucus motion to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4213 with amendment No. 4369 \noccur at 7:30 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4213 with \nan amendment be modified to provide for\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\ntechnical changes to my amendment which are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will have to object simply because we \nhaven't read it yet. We are going to take a look at it. Quite possibly, \nafter figuring out what it is, we might not object, but for the moment \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I renew the request and let the leader reserve the right \nto object again. The modification is to provide that the enterprise \nvalue, the good will of a partnership interest which is sold, would be \nvalued at 50 percent cap gains, 50 percent ordinary income. That is the \nprovision those in the industry who cared about carried interest agreed \nto. That was the intent in the underlying substitute amendment. \nUnfortunately, when the amendment was drafted, there was a glitch which \ndid not fully provide for what I just described. It is my full intent \nfor the substitute amendment to provide for what I just stated; namely, \nthat the good will value, enterprise value of the sale of a partnership \ninterest, be valued at 50 percent cap gain and 50 percent ordinary \nincome. It is unfortunate that we are unable to make that change.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate that explanation. As the \nchairman of the committee knows, we still need to see the actual \namendment, and we will take a look at it.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report \nthe motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     4213, the American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act of \n     2010, with the Baucus amendment No. 4369.\n         Harry Reid, Max Baucus, Patrick J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur with amendment No. 4369 to the House amendment to the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 4213, the American Workers, State, and \nBusiness Relief Act of 2010, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), \nand the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 194 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bond\n     Byrd\n     Graham\n     Roberts\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 56, the nays are \n40. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 210, H.R. 3962, and that the Baucus substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; that the \nbill, as amended, be read the third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating thereto \nbe printed in the Record, as if read, with no further intervening \naction or debate.\n  Mr. President, what this is, as of Tuesday, the doctor fix--the \nreimbursement for Medicare physicians--expired. The administration was \nable to--the Health and Human Services Department--extend that for 3 \ndays. It runs out, I think, tomorrow. It is still good until tomorrow. \nSo if we don't do this, not only will doctors who take Medicare \npatients get a 21-percent cut, in addition to that, so will others that \nare based upon Medicare reimbursements--veterans, insurance companies, \nHMOs, even TRICARE and the military. It will be a shame if this weren't \nagreed to. Remember, it is paid for. It is not a question of running up \nthe debt.\n  My friends on the other side have the opportunity to take care of the \ndoctors for the next 6 months, fully paid for. If not, there is going \nto be havoc in America starting tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we just \ngot this a few moments ago. We are going to take a look at it. I think \nwe are all hoping we can come up with a way to do the so-called doc fix \nand in a paid-for fashion, but for today I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a bill to provide for an extension of unemployment insurance \nprovisions that are in this bill we just had a vote on, for an \nextension of unemployment insurance provisions; that the bill be read \nthe third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that statements relating to the matter be printed in the Record, \nas if read, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. President, this is extending unemployment benefits for people who \nhave been out of work a long time. As Mark Zandi, Senator McCain's \nchief economic adviser, says, nothing stimulates the economy more than \ngiving an unemployment check to somebody who has been unemployed for a \nlong period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are still working together, on a \nbipartisan basis, to try to figure out how to go forward. For the \nmoment, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a bill--the provision in this \nbill we just dealt with--to extend the temporary increase of the \nMedicaid FMAP through June 30, 2011; that the bill be read the third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that \nany statements relating to the matter be printed in the Record, as if \nread, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this issue is currently covered through \nthe end of this calendar year. This matter doesn't have the urgency at \nthe moment that some of the others arguably do. We still have 6 months \nto address this issue. Therefore, for the moment, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here is one I hope we don't have objection \nto. If there were ever a bipartisan piece of legislation, this is it. \nThis is legislation originally devised by the Senator from Georgia, \nJohnny Isakson. It has been good for the economy--the first-time home \nbuyers tax credit.\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n  Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of people who have \nqualified for this first-time home buyers tax credit. The problem is \nthat the banks processing the paper are taking too long. If we don't \nextend this time, they will lose the opportunity to buy a home for the \nfirst time. It is fully paid for. It passed by a large margin. It seems \nthat we should at least get this done tonight. It would allow these \npapers to be processed. I cannot imagine why something as bipartisan as \nthis should not go forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nH.R. 4994, and that the Senate proceed to its consideration; that the \namendment we dealt with yesterday, the so-called Reid amendment, which \nis at the desk, be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread the third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that any statements relating to this matter be printed in \nthe Record, as if read, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader is entirely correct \nthat there is support on both sides for the step he recommends we take. \nSenator Isakson has been the leader on this issue on our side. However, \nincredibly, CBO has decided this costs money, which nobody can quite \nunderstand. So there is still a disagreement over how to pay for it. \nThere is an agreement on the result, but there is a disagreement on how \nto pay for it, since CBO has decreed that it will cost the government \nmoney.\n  We are going to have to continue to work on this and, therefore, for \nthe moment I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with respect to some of the previous \nconsents, Americans are frustrated with the amount of spending and \nborrowing we are doing here. We have an opportunity to show the \nAmerican people that we can be fully responsible and cut spending \nelsewhere. Earlier today, we voted for a bill that would have cut the \ndeficit by almost $70 billion. Let's not wave on through legislation \nthat is going to worsen the deficit and dig an even deeper hole than we \nare currently in.\n  Americans want us to show that we are serious about lowering the \ndebt. Therefore, I have a consent to extend all of these expired \nprovisions, including unemployment insurance and the doc fix. I will \npropose that now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 411, S. 3421; further, that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  Before the Chair rules, for clarity, this is a paid-for 30-day \nextension of the extenders bill, which includes unemployment insurance, \nthe doc fix, COBRA, flood insurance, and the extension of the small \nbusiness loan guarantee program, and the 2009 Federal poverty \nguidelines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how is it \npaid for, I ask my friend?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With stimulus money.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I thought. First of all, that money is not \nthere; it is obligated. I also say this. The economic recovery money--\nthe stimulus money--has created millions of jobs in America today--at \nleast 3 million. But the best bang for the buck will come in the next \nquarter of this year. All the economists say that. It has taken a while \nto get the programs up and running. This would be taking good money \nthat will create lots of jobs. We are all aware of the deficit. We are \nall aware of that. We understand where it came from. We understand that \nPresident Obama found himself elected President in a huge hole created \nby the one who was President before him. That is the reason we passed \nthe recovery bill. It wouldn't be right, with the country still \nstruggling to gain its economic viability, to cut the legs out from \nunder this program that has worked so well.\n  I think this is the wrong way to go. I think it is too bad that we \nare trying to take good money and abuse it. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside and I be allowed to call up my amendment No. \n4313, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming still has the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am trying to get my amendment No. 4313 \npending so we can have an up-or-down vote. It is unfortunate that this \nhas been blocked.\n  This amendment fixes flaws in the Cobell v. Salazar settlement, which \nis important to Indian country. These fixes will benefit thousands of \nclass members involved in this suit.\n  Congress has a responsibility, when they know legislation is broken, \nto fix it. The Cobell settlement legislation is no different. I will \ncontinue to raise this issue as long as the debate on this bill is \noccurring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at around lunchtime, the Senate voted on \nSenator Thune's alternative to the Democratic leadership's extender \nbill. Senator Thune's amendment took the exact opposite approach to the \nDemocratic leadership's substitute. It cuts taxes by $26 billion by \nextending current law. It cut spending by over $100 billion, and \nreduced the deficit by $68 billion. Those are Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, and Joint Committee on Taxation estimates.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the current \nversion of the Democratic leadership's extenders substitute would \nincrease direct spending by about $105 billion through 2020 and raise \nrevenues by about $50 billion over that period, resulting in a net \ndeficit increase of about $55 billion for the 2010-2020 period.\n  The contrast couldn't be clearer. The Republican Conference, along \nwith one member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, voted to change the \nbottom-line fiscal effects of the Democratic leadership's extender \nsubstitute. The Thune amendment would reduce the deficit by $13 billion \nmore than the amount the Democratic leadership's extender substitute \nwould add to the deficit. Senator Thune's amendment reached this better \nfiscal result by restraining Federal spending.\n  All but one of the Democratic Caucus who were present, 57 Senators, \nvoted against Senator Thune's amendment.\n  The junior Senator from Florida, one of the 41 Senators who voted for \nSenator Thune's amendment, came to the Senate floor to highlight the \ndifferences between the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference \nin the approach to this extender bill.\n  The junior Senator from Michigan also made some comments on the \ncurrent fiscal problems. She made her arguments in response to comments \nfrom the junior Senator from Florida. Last year, at about this time, \nthere was a lot of revision or perhaps editing of recent budget \nhistory. I expect more of it from some on the other side.\n  The President signaled as much in an interview with George \nStephanopoulos a few months ago. I agree with the President that \nthere's a lot of revisionism in the debate.\n  The revisionist history basically boils down to two conclusions:\n  1. That all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived \nfrom a partisan tax increase bill of 1993; and\n  2. That all of the ``bad'' fiscal history of this decade to date is \nattributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans.\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally \noppose tax relief and support tax increases. The same crew generally \nsupport spending increases and oppose spending cuts.\n  In the debate so far, many on this side have pointed out some key, \nundeniable facts. The stimulus bill passed by the Senate, with interest \nincluded, increases the deficit by over $1 trillion. The stimulus bill \nwas a heavy stew of spending increases and refundable tax credits, \nseasoned with small pieces of tax relief. The bill passed by the Senate \nhad new temporary spending, that,\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\nif made permanent, will burden future budget deficits by over $3 \ntrillion. That is not Chuck Grassley speaking. It is the official \nCongressional scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO.\n  All of this occurred in an environment where the automatic economic \nstabilizers thankfully kicked in to help the most unfortunate in \nAmerica with unemployment insurance, food stamps and other benefits.\n  That antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts, and \nthe TARP activities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.4 \ntrillion for the fiscal year that ended several months ago. That is the \nhighest deficit, as a percentage of the economy, in post-World War II \nhistory.\n  Not a pretty fiscal picture. And it is going to get a lot uglier with \nthe budget put forward by the President this year. It's the same result \nunder the budget crafted last year by the Democratic leadership. So, \nfor the folks who see this bill as an opportunity to ``recover'' \nAmerica with government taking a larger share of the economy over the \nlong-term, I say congratulations. You have recovered America with a \nvast expansion of government and the American people have a lot of red \nink to look forward to.\n  Members who voted for the budget and the fiscal policy envisioned in \nit put us on the path to a bigger role for the government. But \nsupporters of that fiscal policy need to own up to the fiscal course \nthey are charting.\n  That's where the revisionist history comes from. From the perspective \nof those on our side, it's seems to be a strategy to divert, through a \ntwisted blame game, from the facts before us. How is the history \nrevisionist? Let's take each conclusion one-by-one.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the ``good'' fiscal history was \nderived from the 1993 tax increase. To test that assertion, all you \nhave to do is take a look at data from the Clinton administration.\n  The much-ballyhooed partisan tax increase of 1993 accounts for 13 \npercent of the deficit reduction in the 1990s. Thirteen percent. That \n13 percent figure was calculated by the Clinton administration's Office \nof Management and Budget, OMB.\n  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from a \nreduction in defense spending. Of course, that fiscal benefit \noriginated from President Reagan's stare-down of the communist regime \nin Russia. The same folks on that side who opposed President Reagan's \ndefense build-up take credit for the fiscal benefit of the ``peace \ndividend.''\n  The next biggest source of deficit reduction, 32 percent, came from \nother revenue. Basically, this was the fiscal benefit from pro-growth \npolicies, like the bipartisan capital gains tax cut in 1997, and the \nfree-trade agreements President Clinton, with Republican votes, \nestablished.\n  The savings from the policies I have pointed out translated to \ninterest savings. Interest savings accounts for 15 percent of the \ndeficit reduction.\n  Now, for all the chest-thumping about the 1990s, the chest thumpers, \nwho push for big social spending, didn't bring much to the deficit \nreduction table in the 1990s. Their contribution was 5 percent.\n  What's more the fiscal revisionist historians in this body tend to \nforget who the players were. They are correct that there was a \nDemocratic President in the White House. But they conveniently forget \nthat Republicans controlled the Congress for the period where the \ndeficit came down and turned to surplus. They tend to forget they \nfought the principle of a balanced budget that was the centerpiece of \nRepublican fiscal policy.\n  Do my friends on the Democratic side remember the government shutdown \nof late 1995? Remember what that was about? It was about a plan to \nbalance the budget. Republicans paid a political price for forcing the \nissue, but, in 1997, President Clinton agreed. Recall as well all \nthrough the 1990s what the year-end battles were about.\n  On one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration \npushed for more spending. On the other side, congressional Republicans \nwere pushing for tax relief. In the end, both sides compromised. That \nis the real fiscal history of the 1990s.\n  Let's turn to the other conclusion of the revisionist fiscal \nhistorians. That conclusion is that, in this decade, all fiscal \nproblems are attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001, \n2003, 2004, and 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office. He inherited an economy \nthat was careening downhill. Investment started to go flat in 2000. The \ntech-fueled stock market bubble was bursting. Then came the economic \nshocks of the 9-11 terrorist attacks.\n  Add in the corporate scandals to that economic environment.\n  And it is true, as fiscal year 2001 came to a close, the projected \nsurplus turned to a deficit.\n  In just the right time, the 2001 tax relief plan started to kick in. \nAs the tax relief hit full force in 2003, the deficits grew smaller. \nThis pattern continued up through 2007.\n  If my comments were meant to be partisan shots, I could say this \nfavorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from \n6 months in 2001, where Republicans controlled the White House and the \nCongress. But, unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying \nto make any partisan points, I am just trying to get to the fiscal \nfacts.\n  There is also data that compares the tax receipts for 4 years after \nthe much-ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after the \n2003 tax cuts.\n  In 1993, the Clinton tax increase brought in more revenue as compared \nto the 2003 tax cut. That trend reversed as both policies moved along. \nOver the first few years, the extra revenue went up over time relative \nto the flat line of the 1993 tax increase.\n  So, let's get the fiscal history right.\n  The progrowth tax and trade policies of the 1990's along with the \n``peace dividend'' had a lot more to do with the deficit reduction in \nthe 1990s than the 1993 tax increase. In this decade, deficits went \ndown after the tax relief plans were put in full effect.\n  No economist I am aware of would link the bursting of the housing \nbubble with the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003. Likewise, \nI know of no economic research that concludes that the bipartisan tax \nrelief of 2001 and 2003 caused the financial meltdown of September and \nOctober 2008.\n  As I said, from the period of 2003 through 2007, after the bipartisan \ntax relief program was in full effect, the general pattern was this: \nrevenues went up and deficits went down.\n  That is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what is \nmost important is the future. People in our States send us here to deal \nwith future policy.\n  They don't send us here to flog one another, like partisan cartoon \ncut-out characters, over past policies. They don't send us here to \nendlessly point fingers of blame. The substitute before us takes us in \nthe direction of more deficits and debt. The Thune amendment, which was \nrejected by most of the Democratic Caucus, would have put us on a path \nin the opposite fiscal direction. My friends on the other side fool no \none if they pretend that the fiscal choices made by the Democratic \nLeadership and the President over the last year have nothing to do with \nthis rapidly rising debt.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring the campaign. I would like to paraphrase a quote from the \nPresident's nomination acceptance speech:\n\n       We need a President who can face the threats of the future, \n     not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n\n  President Obama was right.\n  We need a President, and I would add Congressmen and Senators, who \ncan face the threats of the future. Grasping at ideas of the past or \nplaying the partisan blame game will not deal with the threats to our \nfiscal future.\n  It is not too late to correct the excesses of the stimulus bill or \nthe bloated appropriations bills that will come. The Senate missed an \nopportunity, with a partisan rejection of Senator Thune's alternative.\n  Senator McCaskill's and Sessions' amendment, which calls for a time \nout on the exponentially rising levels of appropriations spending, is a \ngood start. The President called on the Democratic leadership to do \nsomething similar. That is what the American people want and need. \nThere is a way to reach a real bipartisan compromise, not just picking \noff a few Senators that frequently vote with the Democrats.\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5099-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy of \nDr. Robert Smith, cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, which is \ncelebrating this year its 75th anniversary.\n  Dr. Smith, commonly referred to as Dr. Bob, was a prominent surgeon \nin my State in Akron, OH, when his friend, Henrietta Seiberling, an \nheir to the Goodyear fortune, introduced him to New Yorker Bill Wilson \nin 1935.\n  Dr. Bob and Bill Wilson's discussion that year on Mother's Day in \nGate Lodge on the grounds of the Seiberling's Stan Hywet estate laid \nout the framework for the modern-day Alcoholics Anonymous.\n  Having shared the common disease of alcoholism, Dr. Bob and Bill \nWilson recognized the need to offer dignified healing of sobriety for \nall people who struggle with the disease of alcoholism.\n  What started as an informal conversation in Gate Lodge on the Stan \nHywet estate led to small group meetings and conversations at the home \nof Dr. Bob and his wife Anne on Ardmore Avenue.\n  Dr. Bob and Anne subsequently opened their home to those seeking \nsobriety, and the understanding of the 12 steps that Dr. Bob and Bill \nWilson were refining.\n  As one of Akron's premier physicians at Summa Health's Akron City \nHospital, Dr. Bob also understood that prevailing medical treatment was \ninadequate in treating a disease that did not discriminate among \ngender, age, culture, wealth, or social standing.\n  This was an era when alcoholism was not understood as a disease, so \nthose seeking treatment were not admitted to hospitals.\n  Dr. Bob and Bill understood that the alcoholic needed the help of the \n``Angel of Alcoholics Anonymous,'' Sister Mary Ignatia and St. Thomas \nHospital.\n  Dr. Bob took to bringing alcoholics from the back entrance of the \nhospital up to empty rooms in Sister Ignatia's unit.\n  Sister Ignatia would ask Dr. Bob: Are they sick?\n  Dr. Bob would respond: Very sick.\n  Sister Ignatia replied: Then they shall come to the front door--a \nvery different treatment of alcoholism than ever before.\n  Sister Ignatia and St. Thomas Hospital then filled the void of the \nlack of formal treatment to help those battling alcoholism. They helped \nfill the gap in the lack of public and medical understanding of the \ndisease.\n  Therein lies the root of the modern Alcoholics Anonymous--in Akron, \nOH, on Olive Street--where St. Thomas Hospital remains an institution \ncommitted to offering health services to those afflicted with \nalcoholism.\n  Since those early days 75 years ago in the 1930s, Dr. Bob and Sister \nIgnatia helped foment the public consciousness that alcoholism is, in \nfact, a disease; that it is never fully cured but only managed with \nself-determination and with family and community support.\n  Dr. Bob and Sister Ignatia imbued a sense of urgency in the movement \nwhere literally the common refrain for those who live the disease is to \nlive one day at a time.\n  It is that sense of urgency that often found Sister Ignatia saying, \n``Time is running out and I must work while I can.''\n  Earlier this week, the people of Akron gathered at St. Thomas \nHospital to rename Olive Street ``Dr. Bob's Way'' to recognize his \ncontribution to our Nation's history. And earlier this month, thousands \nof supporters of AA--alcoholics and family members throughout the \nNation--traveled to Akron for Founders Day which celebrates the legacy \nof Dr. Bob and Sister Ignatia.\n  Many visitors traveled to Stan Hywet Hall where they walked along the \npristine landscape, walking past the Gate Lodge where AA meetings \ncontinue to this day.\n  From that single conversation at Gate Lodge to Dr. Bob and Anne's \nhome on Ardmore Avenue to St. Thomas Hospital on Olive Avenue, AA has \nturned into one of the most unified and diverse organizations in the \nworld.\n  Since its earliest days, AA opened its doors and services to all \nthose who seek it, regardless of gender, age, socio-economic status, or \nsexual orientation.\n  Fully self-funded, prominent statesmen and judges have sat alongside \npaupers and peasants--each seeking a shared experience and the support \nof each other.\n  Today, 117,000 groups totaling more than 2 million members live in \nmore than 150 countries and are working with them and being helped by \nAA.\n  It all started in Akron. Ohio has often been an epicenter of our \nNation's history--home of more Presidents, and poets to inventors and \npioneers; first in light, first in flight--Thomas Edison, the Wright \nbrothers, and so much else.\n  We are also part of our Nation and our world's basic humanity. \nThrough the Great Depression to the wars in the Pacific, Vietnam, \nKorea, Iraq, and Afghanistan, AA has been a source of strength for \nservicemembers and veterans.\n  Across borders and devoid of religious affiliation, AA has been a \nsource of faith for one's self. Whether a factory worker or physician, \nparents and educators, all are alike. Regardless of one's station in \nlife, AA has been a source of resiliency, demonstrating the capacity \nfor all of us to see the better stronger angels within ourselves and \nwithin others.\n  To St. Thomas Hospital, now part of Summa Health, and the city of \nAkron, congratulations for carrying on Dr. Bob and Sister Ignatia's \nlegacy for 75 years. More important, congratulations to the members and \nsupporters of AA. Thank you for your service to our families, our \ncommunities, our Nation and for a greater humanity for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5099-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5099-S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I want to talk about something \nelse. I sat here, as did the Presiding Officer from Illinois, who was a \nstrong supporter of passing this legislation that again failed because \nof the Senate's anachronistic, outmoded requirement of 60 votes, a \nsupermajority. We could not get there because no Republicans--no \nRepublicans--cooperated. We could not do today what we should do, and \nthat is extend unemployment benefits to tens of thousands of Ohioans \nand millions of Americans. We could not extend the assistance to help \nthem keep their insurance, which Senator Casey has worked so hard on, \nsomething called COBRA, so that people who lost their jobs would not \nlose their insurance. We could not help those physicians who are about \nto face a 21-percent cut in their payments. We could not stop the \noutsourcing through our tax system of too many jobs abroad. We could \nnot do any of that today because we did not get any cooperation.\n  I understand partisanship. I understand ideological differences. But \nwhat I don't understand is when I hear Republican after Republican \nstand on this floor and talk about the budget deficit, I am just \nstruck. I have only been in this institution for 3 years. I was in the \nHouse of Representatives for 14 years before. I am struck by the utter \nhypocrisy when I hear Republicans all of a sudden decide deficits \nmatter, all of a sudden decide everything needs to be paid for.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, George Bush came to \nCongress and asked for the authority to go to Iraq and did not even try \nto pay for it. I voted no, but that is beside the point. It passed. It \nwas not paid for.\n  Then President Bush came to the Congress again with a Republican \nmajority and asked for huge tax cuts that overwhelmingly went to the \nrichest Americans. They did not pay for that\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\neither. They charged that to our grandchildren.\n  Then around the same time in the name of Medicare privatization, he \nasked for what he called a Medicare drug benefit, what I call a bailout \nfor the drug and insurance industry, tens of billions in subsidies to \ndrug companies and insurance companies, and they did not pay for that \neither.\n  Throughout the first decade of this century, Congress has spent close \nto $1 trillion on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and did not pay for it. \nNobody on that side said: Wait a second. We shouldn't do this without \npaying for it.\n  Then Congress passed hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts for \nthe richest Americans and did not pay for that. They did not say we \ncan't do that unless we pay for it. They did the same thing for this \ngive-away to the drug and insurance companies.\n  Now when we want to extend unemployment benefits to people who have \nlost their jobs, when we want to extend some assistance for health \ninsurance to people who have lost their health insurance, all of a \nsudden all these conservatives around here say we cannot do this unless \nwe pay for it. Then their little cheerleaders on the Wall Street \neditorial board, and talk radio, and their people on Fox TV, like one \nbird flying off a telephone wire, they all fly off and say: We have to \npay for it.\n  They never said we have to pay for a trillion-dollar war. They never \nsaid we should pay for the tax cuts going to the rich people. They \nnever said we should pay for these subsidies going to the drug \ncompanies. We start a war, we attack Iraq, we go to Afghanistan, and we \ncharge it to our grandchildren. We give a tax cut to the richest \nAmericans, and we charge it to our grandchildren. We pass this give-\naway to the drug and insurance companies, and we charge it to our \ngrandchildren.\n  But again, when it is time to help laid-off workers--we know what \nhappens when a person is laid off. They almost act as if unemployment \ninsurance is a welfare program. All I can think of when I see the \nbehavior of refusal to extend unemployment insurance or the refusal to \nhelp people get health insurance when they have lost their jobs, all I \ncan think of is most of my friends on the other side of the aisle, most \nof my colleagues must not know anybody who has lost their job, who has \nlost their insurance. They must not know anybody who, because they lost \ntheir job and their insurance, may next lose their home.\n  Try to think about this. I know people who have lost their homes. I \nknow people who were doing pretty well and lost their homes. I have \ntried to understand what it is like. You come home one day and for the \nlast 3 or 4 months you tried to make your mortgage payment. You were \nlate the first month. Then you got the second payment in on time. The \nnext month you were late. The following month you could not pay and you \nrealize you are in trouble. And then the bank comes to you and tells \nyou they will foreclose.\n  Think what that is like. You worked hard. Maybe your kids are still \nsmall. You have lost your job. You want to pay your mortgage, but you \ndo not have the money to do it.\n  So the bank is going to foreclose on your house. Think about that. \nYou have three kids and your spouse has lost her job or you don't have \nenough money to make these payments and you are going to have to tell \nyour kids: Guys, we are going to have to leave our house.\n  Where are we going to live, Dad?\n  We will try to move in with somebody.\n  What are we going to do with all our stuff?\n  I don't know; put it in storage. If we can't afford storage, I guess \nwe will have to give it away.\n  Think about what it would be like to lose your job, then your \ninsurance, then to lose your home. That has happened to a whole lot of \npeople who even look like me, people who dress well and have middle-\nclass jobs. This just doesn't happen to a bunch of people who were just \nlazy and didn't do anything; this is happening to all kinds of people \nin this country.\n  I wonder if my Republican colleagues--if the conservatives here who \nalways preach self-reliance and always say we have to do better in this \ncountry and that people should have to stand on their own two feet--\nreally know people who have lost their jobs and lost their insurance \nand lost their homes. I think if they did, they might be willing to \nextend unemployment benefits; if they did, they might be willing to \nextend subsidies to help those people get their health insurance.\n  That is what is so troubling about what has happened the last few \nweeks. We can't get 60 votes because we need some Republicans. We can't \nget 60 votes to extend unemployment to help people out a little bit. \nAgain, unemployment insurance is not welfare. You have a job and you \npay into unemployment every paycheck. You pay into this insurance fund \nso that if you lose your job, you get help from that fund. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess my patience runs short--as is the case for \nmany of us on this side--when I hear my colleagues saying we can't do \nthis because it would add to the budget deficit.

Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to \ncongratulate El Mundo, a weekly Spanish language newspaper in Las \nVegas, as it celebrates an important milestone in its history. On June \n20, 2010, El Mundo, an award winning publication and a longstanding \nfixture of Southern Nevada's Hispanic media, will celebrate its 30th \nanniversary.\n  As the oldest Spanish language newspaper in southern Nevada, El Mundo \nhas covered the issues of greatest impact to the Nevadan Hispanic \ncommunity over the last three decades, providing invaluable insight \ninto the ever-evolving diversity which characterizes Nevada's Hispanic \ncommunity. It currently serves a bicultural and bilingual readership of \nmore than 175,000.\n  In its pages, El Mundo highlights the experiences, needs, and \nconcerns of Hispanics in Nevada and contributes to the future of our \nstate's local economy, politics, and culture through its editorial, \nopinion and commercial advertising content.\n  Throughout the years, El Mundo has grown and evolved alongside \nsouthern Nevada's Latino community, which has multiplied from 50,000 in \n1980 when the newspaper was founded by publisher Eddie Escobedo, to \nmore than half a million today.\n  In addition, I would like to recognize Eddie's vision and tenacity, \nwhose steadfast leadership at the helm of El Mundo has contributed to \nthe publication's continued relevance, influence and impact. Eddie is a \nprominent voice for Nevada's Hispanics, a trusted servant leader, and a \ntrue Nevadan. I congratulate Eddie, his family, and the El Mundo staff \non this great occasion as they continue marching toward greater and \nbigger milestones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5100-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5100-S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sunday, June 20, is the 147th anniversary of \nwild and wonderful West Virginia's joining the United States as the \n35th State. I am proud of all that West Virginia has offered and \ncontinues to offer to the United States.\n  West Virginia is a unique gem among the 50 States. It is the only \nState to be formed by seceding from a Confederate State, and only one \nof two States to be added to the Union during the Civil War--the other \nbeing the home State of my good friend Senator Reid, Nevada, which \nseparated from the Utah Territory.\n  Known as the Mountain State, West Virginia is the only State located \nentirely within the ancient Appalachian Mountain range which was formed \nover 300 million years ago. West Virginia has the highest elevation of \nany U.S. State east of the Mississippi River, with an average of 1,500 \nfeet above sea level. That elevation means that the Monongahela \nNational Forest Region in the southeastern part of the State has a \nclimate more akin to northern New England and Canada, with spruce \nforests, cool summers, and snow-filled winters. In fact, Dolly Sods, \nwhich is part of the Monongahela National Forest, has tundra-like \nvistas where, amid\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nscenery reminiscent of Alaska, visitors might spot snowshoe hares. Our \ncolder, tumbling waters also support trout that are an angler's dream, \nas well as a rafter's or kayaker's delight.\n  Unlike its name, West Virginia's New River is actually very old, \nperhaps one of the oldest rivers in the world. Flowing in a generally \nsouth-to-north course through the Appalachian Mountains from North \nCarolina to West Virginia, where it merges with the Gauley River to \nform the Kanawaha River, the New River goes against the west-to-east \nflow that most other nearby rivers take, emptying into the Mississippi \nRiver rather than the Chesapeake Bay. Near Fayetteville, WV, the New \nRiver is spanned by the spectacular New River Gorge Bridge, featured on \nthe reverse of the West Virginia State quarter coin. Each autumn, the \ncommunity celebrates Bridge Day, allowing parachute-clad jumpers to \nleap from the highest vehicular bridge in the Americas to the New River \nsome 876 feet below.\n  For centuries, West Virginia has been a place where people could \nescape summer's heat and enjoy the great outdoors. In the eastern \npanhandle, the spa town of Berkeley Springs has welcomed visitors since \nthe days when George Washington's family and friends laid out a town \naround the warm medicinal springs that bubble to the surface. In \nsouthern West Virginia, the majestic Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur \nSprings has hosted Presidents and other distinguished guests since \n1778.\n  West Virginia has also long been a nearby winter getaway for snow-\nseekers from milder climates. Since the Canaan Valley was discovered by \nair in the 1960s, West Virginia has become a skiing destination for \ndownhillers and cross-country skiers. In addition to Canaan Valley, \nSnowshoe, Winterplace, Alpine Lake, Timberline, and Elk River offer \nskiing, tubing, snowboarding and sledding within easy driving distance \nof major metropolitan areas from Pittsburgh to Atlanta.\n  Should a visitor come to West Virginia in June, he or she would be \ntreated to beautiful misty views of tree-covered mountains stretching \ninto the distance. In the foreground, wildflowers would be blooming in \nsunlit meadows and along roads that curve along steep hillsides or \ncross deep-flowing rivers and streams tumbling over massive boulders. \nIn the shadowed hollows, dense stands of rhododendron, the State \nflower, would be coming into bloom. Later in the year, the hills come \nalive with vibrant color as the State tree, the sugar maple, bursts \ninto flaming red, blazing against the deep russet of oaks, the bright \nyellow of tulip poplars, and the rich, deep green of spruce and pine. \nIn the winter, nature's palette becomes more stark, as leafless trees \netch sharp designs against crisp white snow. The West Virginia State \nbird, the northern cardinal, offers a bright spot of crimson on the \notherwise monochromatic scenery. But every evening--winter, summer, \nspring or fall--the night sky will come alive with more stars than it \nis possible to count, as God sprinkles his blessings on West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5101-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with great pleasure I congratulate the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Daniel Inouye, for becoming the second \nlongest-serving Senator in history. He achieved this distinction last \nFriday when he became only the second person to have served in the \nSenate for 17,327 days.\n  I also want to use this opportunity to congratulate Senator Inouye on \nwhat I am sure he considers a bigger, and even more important event in \nhis life, the birth of his first grandchild, Mary Margaret ``Maggie'' \nInouye. Maggie was born on April 20 to Ken and Jessica Inouye, the son \nand daughter-in-law of our esteemed colleague. I wish all of them the \nbest of health and happiness.\n  I have remarked many times on this floor that Senator Inouye is my \n``No. 1 hero.'' No one has ever served our country more extensively, or \nmore bravely and with more loyalty and determination, than has Senator \nInouye.\n  During World War II, he served in the famed 442nd Infantry Regimental \nCombat Team, the most decorated Army unit in the history of United \nStates. In recognition of his war heroics, he was awarded the \nDistinguished Service Cross, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, making him one of only seven Senators to \nhave been awarded our Nation's highest military honor.\n  In 1963, he became the first Japanese American ever to serve in the \nU.S. Congress. And in this Chamber he has served his State and our \ncountry with great distinction. Senator Inouye has served on the Senate \nWatergate Committee, the Congressional Iran Contra Committee, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and as Secretary of the Democratic \nConference.\n  And during his long and productive career in this Chamber, he has \nbecome my dear friend. I was honored and pleased when he was the person \nwho nominated me for my third term as Senate whip in 1975. Foremost, I \nhave always appreciated his deep loyalty to the Senate and to me when I \nwas the Senate Democratic leader and he was serving as secretary of the \nDemocratic Conference.\n  Now, Senator Inouye has achieved another milestone in a career filled \nwith achievements and successes, and I commend him on it.\n  Congratulations Senator Inouye, my friend, my colleague and my ``No. \n1 hero!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5101-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5101-S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HARRY MORGAN HOE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an honored \nKentuckian, Mr. Harry Morgan Hoe. A graduate of the Kentucky Military \nInstitute, Harry's leadership skill and valor were on full display at \nthe age of 19, when he joined the 4th Infantry Division and stormed the \nbeaches of Normandy. For his service, he was awarded both the Silver \nand Bronze Stars, among other medals. Upon returning to civilian life, \nHarry earned a degree in business and more importantly, at least to \nHarry, met his wife Mary while at college. The couple returned to \nMiddlesboro after graduation and Harry joined in the family business--a \nfoundry. He would go on to serve his community as chairman of the Clear \nCreek Baptist Bible College and his work with the Cumberland Gap \nNational Park board, the Mountain Laurel Festival board, as well as \nseveral other service organizations.\n  While I could certainly go on about the character of Harry Hoe, let \nme conclude by saying that Harry Hoe's impact in Middlesboro, Kentucky, \nshould be a model by which we all pattern our approach to leadership--\nbuilt on humility and grace.\n  Mr. President, the Middlesboro Daily News recently published a \nprofile story on Mr. Harry Hoe. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Middlesboro Daily News, May 5, 2010]\n\n                   ``Harry Hoe--An Enduring Leader''\n\n                            By Lorie Settles\n\n       Harry Morgan Hoe began his life 85-years ago in \n     Middlesboro. He remembers a town much different than the one \n     most of us are familiar with today--where groceries were \n     delivered and children walked to school. The simplicity of \n     life remains one of his dearest memories.\n       ``Growing up here was a real treat,'' Harry recalled, \n     ``everything was free and easy. The town was growing; they \n     were building buildings and paving streets.'' Harry's \n     generation was the first of his family to grow up in \n     Middlesboro. In 1909, J.R. Hoe, Harry's grandfather, moved \n     his family to Kentucky from Pittsburg, PA after a labor \n     strike put an end to his career as the superintendent of a \n     large steel mill. He purchased the town foundry and re-named \n     it J.R. Hoe and Sons. Together, he and his five sons worked \n     long hours to create the business Middlesboro knows today.\n       ``My father worked like a dog,'' Hoe remembered. ``He \n     poured 20,000 pounds of iron per day and the things had to be \n     carried, by hand, to the railroad station.'' Harry went to \n     Louisville to attend high school at the Kentucky Military \n     Institute, from which he graduated in 1943. At the age of 17, \n     just before graduation, he received his draft notice for \n     World War II. After a few months of training, he briefly \n     returned home to see his family, and then shipped out. ``We \n     had all gone through basic training; we'd done the physical \n     exercises and the bayonets and it was fun . . . It never got \n     through to me that we were training to kill,'' he remembered. \n     He arrived with the 4th Infantry Division on the beaches of \n     Normandy shortly thereafter. ``I served under General \n     Patton,'' Harry recalls. ``He said: Half of you guys are not \n     going home, you know that don't you? You're over\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n     here to take that hill and if you don't take it, I want to \n     see the truckload of dog tags that show me that you proved \n     yourself.' So we fought. We were his soldiers--that was all \n     we knew to do.''\n       He was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in \n     action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf Cluster for heroic \n     action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal--all \n     before reaching the age of 19.\n       During his tour of duty, Harry fought in five major \n     European campaigns. ``It was different then,'' he said. ``It \n     was a different war. Everyone was for it, we were very \n     patriotic. We wanted to keep Hitler from ruining the world.''\n       His return home was bittersweet. ``I spent weeks when I \n     came home saying: `What? He didn't come back either? He's \n     dead too?' The boys you hugged at the train station, the ones \n     that came back, were badly wounded and missing limbs. We \n     didn't see all of the consequences until the war was over,'' \n     he remembered.\n       Shortly after his return, he enrolled at the University of \n     Tennessee. He graduated in 1949 with a B.S. in Business. ``My \n     father wanted me to go to college,'' Harry said. ``I thought \n     that I was too mature. I'd been to war, I felt too old for \n     college life.'' He met his wife, Mary, at the university \n     through a friend from Middlesboro and the two quickly became \n     an item. He credits much of his success and happiness to \n     Mary, who insisted that he finish college and worked as a \n     librarian at UT after her own graduation while Harry \n     completed his education.\n       ``She was my secret weapon,'' Harry said of the woman he \n     lost just last year. ``She was easy to love.'' The couple \n     returned to Middlesboro after finishing school and Harry went \n     to work for the family business. Though he was unsure that he \n     would remain in the business, he viewed it as a chance to \n     gain experience.\n       His family was happy to have him as the first college \n     graduate in the company for as long as he wished to stay. In \n     1953, Harry Morgan Hoe was honored as one of the three \n     Outstanding Young Men of Kentucky. His accomplishments would \n     only become more impressive as time went on. Harry worked as \n     the director of the Kentucky Utilities company for 19 years, \n     and was honored by the company with a $100,000 donation that \n     was awarded to Clear Creek Baptist Bible College. He served \n     as a board member of the college for 20 years and as chairman \n     for two terms.\n       The first integrated Little League Baseball team south of \n     the Ohio River was instigated in Middlesboro in 1953. Harry \n     began the team and was its president for seven years. In \n     1959, Harry worked as general chairman for the dedication of \n     the Cumberland Gap National Park. He has been the director of \n     Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival Board for 55 years and \n     served twice as president. Harry also acted as chairman of \n     the board of directors of Kentuckians for Better \n     Transportation and Associated Industries in Kentucky. He \n     spent two 3-year terms as director of the Kentucky Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n       In 1964, Harry Hoe decided to try his hand at state \n     politics. He was elected to the Kentucky House of \n     Representatives, where he served for six years. He wrote the \n     Drunk Driving Bill in 1968, and in what seemed to many \n     Kentucky politicians and reporters of the day as an unlikely \n     turn of events, it passed. Harry vividly recalls the day the \n     bill finally got off of the ground: ``It was the last day of \n     the legislature and a lot of my opponents were out \n     celebrating at a bar. So I went back to the House and asked \n     the Speaker to allow me to introduce my bill, as a favor \n     since it was my last term. The bill passed the House. I took \n     it to the Lieutenant Governor and asked for a vote in the \n     Senate. No one wanted to be on record as being for drunk \n     driving, but Kentucky produced a lot of whiskey. The \n     Governor, Louie Nunn, wouldn't sign it. He let it sit there \n     for 10 days. The law states that after ten days, if he hasn't \n     signed a bill that has passed the House and Senate, it \n     becomes law.''\n       Harry was the minority whip and the assistant minority \n     floor leader. He spent 12 years serving on the Kentucky \n     Republican State Central Committee and was recently inducted \n     into the Republican 5th Congressional District hall of Fame \n     by Congressman Hal Rogers.\n       He has been a deacon of the First Baptist Church for the \n     past 60 years and served as chairman of the deacons for three \n     terms. In addition, he has sung in the church's choir for 60 \n     years and been a Sunday School teacher for 55. Harry was \n     awarded the Salvation Army William Booth Award, the highest \n     honor given by the charity, after serving as chairman. He is \n     a life member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board and has \n     been for 60 years.\n       The Kiwanis Club of Middlesboro has had the benefit of \n     Harry's membership since 1949. He was twice elected president \n     and has won several awards including Kiwanian of the Year. He \n     founded the Middlesboro High School Key Club in 1954. Today, \n     Harry lives in the same house he bought 45-years ago with his \n     wife, Mary.\n       He continues to work, as needed, at the J.R. Hoe and Sons \n     foundry, where he served as the President of the firm from \n     1988 until 2009. He enjoys spending some of his free time \n     with his and Mary's three children: Priscilla, Harry (Bo), \n     and Marilyn, and with his seven grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5102-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5102-S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAN SANCTIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on June 14, Ephraim Sneh, a former Israeli \nDeputy Defense Minister, wrote a column in the Huffington Post, titled \n``Tickling Sanctions for Iran From the UN--It's Now Up to Congress,'' \nexplaining that the United Nations Security Council's recent sanctions \non Iran are insufficient.\n  Dr. Sneh wrote that the Security Council's new sanctions are merely \n``recommendations, not binding orders'' because they do not address the \nIranian regime's greatest vulnerability, its oil and gas industry. He \nurges Congress to pass the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, which \nhe believes is ``the last option left to promote peace, to free the \nIranian people and to prevent war.''\n  I agree with Dr. Sneh. Further, I believe it is imperative, in view \nof the feckless action by the Security Council, and the timid actions \nby the administration on unilateral designations yesterday, that \nCongress act without further delay to pass this new legislation to \nimpose crippling sanctions on Iran.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Dr. Sneh's column \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Huffington Post, June 14, 2010]\n\n    Tickling Sanctions for Iran From the UN--It's Now Up to Congress\n\n      (By Ephraim Sneh, Former Deputy Defense Minister of Israel)\n\n       Secretary of State Clinton promised to impose ``crippling \n     sanctions'' on Iran if it keeps cheating the international \n     community and enriching uranium for a nuclear weapon.\n       However, the sanctions decided by the UN Security Council \n     last week are tickling sanctions--definitely not crippling \n     ones. They annoy the Ayatollahs' regime, but they cannot \n     bring about its end. They will not delay the Iranian nuclear \n     project by one single day.\n       The main problem is that the sanctions do not effectively \n     harm the Iranian energy industry, which is the regime's life \n     artery. Iran's oil and gas industry enables the regime to \n     govern. The UN sanctions, instead, focus on the Revolutionary \n     Guards (IRGC), on the nuclear project, and on the banking and \n     shipping systems that directly support it. Moreover, \n     countries that are not keen to impose those sanctions are not \n     strictly obliged to do so. Actually, these are \n     recommendations, not binding orders.\n       Sanctions which do not substantially undermine the \n     financial basis of the regime do not impede the regime's \n     ability to govern. Such sanctions cannot create a \n     revolutionary situation in Iran that millions of protesters \n     who courageously took to the streets aspire for. The moral \n     support they received from the western democracies until now \n     has been feeble and disappointing.\n       Iran's nuclear project runs on two parallel tracks: It \n     produces large amounts of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU), and it \n     manufactures a large number of centrifuges. When the \n     Ayatollahs decide, many thousands of centrifuges, operating \n     at high speed, will create Highly Enriched Uranium in \n     quantities large enough to manufacture several nuclear bombs. \n     The critical process in nuclear weapon building is the \n     creation of fissile material. This is how Iran will obtain \n     it.\n       A nuclear Iran is not a threat only for Israel. It is a \n     threat for every state within range of its ballistic \n     missiles. Today Delhi, Moscow and Athens are inside this \n     range. In two years' time, when the next generation of \n     Iranian ballistic missile will enter operational status, more \n     capitals, including European, will join the club of \n     threatened states.\n       But there is one country, Israel, which cannot live even \n     one day under the shadow of an Iranian nuclear weapon. In my \n     office, as in many offices and homes in Israel, decision-\n     makers included, portraits of our grandparents killed by the \n     Nazis hang on the walls. Israel, bearing this collective \n     historic lesson, cannot allow those who twice a week declare \n     that they will liquidate the Jewish state to have the means \n     to do so. The Jewish people will not pay the price for the \n     weakness of the West twice in 70 years.\n       Maybe we are paranoid. But, as Henry Kissinger said, ``even \n     a paranoid may have real enemies.'' We do have enemies who \n     viscerally hate us, whether our policies are clever or \n     stupid.\n       The UN Security Council resolution means that the \n     international community actually acquiesces to a nuclear \n     Iran. Israel is in a corner, and the international community \n     is pushing us to act on our own. Regrettably, we were not \n     wise enough to avoid being so isolated at the same time that \n     we find ourselves in this corner. But our mistakes do not \n     diminish our existential need to act.\n       The United States could not achieve a better UN resolution. \n     In the current international situation, in a forum where \n     Russia and China can cast a veto, where Brazil and\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\n     Turkey can bluntly defy it, American diplomacy did its best. \n     But the bottom line is that the Iranian nuclear project will \n     not be stopped by these sanctions, and the regime in Teheran \n     will survive.\n       There is still something that can be done. The US \n     Congress's bipartisan Iranian Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act \n     (IRPSA), submitted by Congressman Howard Berman and \n     Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, is ready. The sanctions \n     enshrined in IRPSA may cripple the Iranian energy industry, \n     which bankrolls the Ayatollhas. It may bring the regime to \n     its knees. IRPSA poses a clear choice to international \n     corporations: With whom do you want to do business--Iran or \n     the US? If the traditional allies of United States and, most \n     importantly, responsible European countries implement these \n     sanctions, the regime in Teheran would not be able to govern. \n     It would not be able to cruelly repress the Iranian people, \n     export hatred and terror, and build nuclear weapons.\n       Voting for IRPSA and implementing it promptly is the last \n     option left to promote peace, to free the Iranian people and \n     to prevent war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5103-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Sergeant John Kenneth Rankel\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

He enlisted in the Marine \nCorps immediately after graduating from Speedway High School in 2005. \nThough he was a star athlete on his high school football team, he chose \nto serve rather than play football in college. A fellow marine \ndescribed John as ``the greatest guy I knew, and the best friend \nanybody could ask for.''\n  Today, I join John's family and friends in mourning his death. He is \nsurvived by his mother Trisha Stockhoff; his stepfather Don Stockhoff; \nhis father Kevin Rankel; his stepmother Kim Rankel; and his brothers \nNathan Stockhoff and Tyler Rankel. He will forever be remembered as a \nloving son, brother, and friend.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride \nin the example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his \nservice and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen marine, I recall President \nLincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: ``We \ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \nThe brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated \nit, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \nnote nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what \nthey did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Sgt John Kenneth Rankel in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.\n  I pray that John's family finds comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah, who said: ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5103-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SPECIALIST BLAINE E.

Four others were lost in this \ntragic event.\n  Specialist Redding served his country honorably and made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his fellow Americans.

It is a small comfort for those who must now go \non without one they loved so dearly, but they know that Specialist \nRedding gave his life for a noble goal.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to our Korean war veterans and to express my strong support for \nand admiration of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute, the nonprofit \npartner of the Truman Library, that is leading our Nation's \ncommemoration of the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean war. \nOn this important anniversary, we must not forget the lessons from this \noft-forgotten war, nor the men and women who demonstrated legendary \ncourage and valor in the face of unspeakable brutality.\n  Sixty years ago in Independence, MO, on June 25, 1950, President \nHarry S. Truman received word that the free people of South Korea had \nbeen invaded by some 135,000 communist troops from the North. America's \n33rd President responded swiftly and decisively, for, in his words, \n``In my generation, this was not the first occasion when the strong had \nattacked the weak.'' Today, the fateful crossing of the 38th parallel \nby communist forces stands as the opening paragraph of one of the most \nbrutal chapters in our American history, the Korean war.\n  It is impossible to understand our world today--and to have an \ninformed view on the conflict that continues to seethe on the Korean \npeninsula--without understanding the Korean war. And yet, the first \nconflict in the Cold War is sometimes called the ``Unknown War,'' or \nworse, the ``Forgotten War'' because it is not widely taught, studied \nor understood. That is why, on this important occasion, we must rise to \nhonor the courage and sacrifice of our Korean war veterans--so we can \nnever forget.\n  We cannot and will not forget that nearly 1.8 million Americans \nserved in Korea, along with the forces of the Republic of Korea and 20 \nother members of the United Nations, to defend freedom and democracy. \nWe will not forget that nearly 33,739 Americans died in battle during \nthe war. We will not forget that nearly 92,100 troops were wounded in \naction during the conflict. We will not forget that more than 8,100 men \nand women never came home, and are still listed as missing in action or \nprisoners of war.\n  We have, as we recognize the 60th anniversary of the start of the \nKorean war, an important opportunity to examine the roots and legacy of \nthe Korean war and to honor each individual who, in the defense of \nfreedom, bravely faced aggression of devastating tyranny. I urge all \nAmericans to observe the 60th anniversary of the Korean war and to take \nthis opportunity to learn about the conflict and, most importantly, the \nmen and women who participated in it. Their legacy is one of great \nhonor. I want to recognize the Korean War Veterans Appreciation \nCeremony--held on June 21, 2010, in the hometown of one of Nation's \ngreat leaders, President Harry S Truman, as a sterling symbol of our \nNation's commitment to always remember, understand, and honor our brave \nKorean war heroes and the history of the Korean war.\n  I want to especially recognize the men and women at the Harry S \nTruman Library Institute who tirelessly labored to make the \nAppreciation Ceremony possible and a tremendous success. It is with \ngreat regret I will not be able to join many Missourians, many \nveterans, my esteemed colleague, Congressman Ike Skelton, who is a \ntremendous student of military history, and keynote speaker GEN David \nPetraeus, a modern-day American war hero, on June 21 in Independence to \nrecognize this anniversary and celebrate Korean war veterans. However, \nI know this will be a momentous event on a momentous occasion. I stand \nwith all of those at the event in remembering the Korean war, in \nhonoring Korean war veterans, in paying\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nrespect to the remaining POWs and MIAs and the fallen servicemembers, \nand in celebrating America's freedom, which has for so long been \nguaranteed by our fighting men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5104-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JUNETEENTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the 145th \nanniversary of Juneteenth, the oldest commemoration of the end of \nslavery in the United States. On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers arrived \nin Galveston, TX, to inform the slaves that they were free. Although \nthe Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863, it was 2 \nyears later before the message reached slaves in Texas and the Union \ntroops enforced the President's order. Eighty-nine years after \nAmerica's Independence Day, Africans in America finally obtained their \nindependence from slavery. Juneteenth is a day when all Americans \nshould celebrate Black Americans' freedom and heritage.\n  In 2008, Congress apologized for the injustice, cruelty, brutality, \nand inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws. The congressional \nresolution acknowledged that African Americans continue to suffer from \nthe complex interplay between slavery and Jim Crow long after both \nsystems were formally abolished. This suffering is both tangible and \nintangible, including the loss of human dignity, the frustration of \ncareers and professional lives, and the long-term loss of income and \nopportunity.\n  On Wednesday, Congress honored the African-American slaves who built \nthe U.S. Capitol by dedicating plaques to their memory. Historians have \ndiscovered that slaves worked 12-hour days, 6 days a week on the \nconstruction of the Capitol. The Federal Government rented over 400 \nslaves from local slave owners at a rate of $5 per person per month, \nbut the slaves were not paid for their work.\n  On this day, it is fitting to remember our Nation's painful history. \nMillions of Africans were torn from their homeland and brought to the \nAmericas as chattel. While it is unknown how many died during the \nmiddle passage, it is estimated that 645,000 arrived in the United \nStates. My own State of Maryland had slaves. In 1790, more than 100,000 \nslaves, which would have been about a third of the State's total \npopulation, lived in Maryland. Seventy years later, the 1860 census \nindicated that there were more than 4 million slaves nationwide.\n  Despite Maryland's history of slavery, many Marylanders led the fight \nfor abolition. The underground railroad was a secret network that \nhelped enslaved men, women, and children escape to freedom. Its route \nthrough Maryland took passengers by boat up the Chesapeake Bay. Ships \ndeparted from the many towns located directly on the bay and from \ncities on rivers that flowed into the bay, including Baltimore. Many \nships' pilots hid fugitives and helped them on their way.\n  Another route led slaves by land up along the eastern shore of \nMaryland and into Delaware, where they could cross into Pennsylvania \nand go north to freedom in Massachusetts, New York, and Canada. This \nwas the route used by Harriet Ross Tubman, a native of Dorchester \nCounty, MD. Tubman not only guided herself and her family to freedom \nthrough the underground railroad, she also made more than 19 trips to \nthe South to lead more than 300 slaves to freedom. She never lost a \n``passenger'' along the route.\n  The abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass was born in Talbot County \non Maryland's eastern shore. At age 20 he escaped from slavery and \nspent the rest of his life advocating racial equality throughout the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom. Harriet Tubman, Frederick \nDouglass, and countless others who led slaves to freedom and fought to \nabolish slavery are the heroes who inspire us to persevere in the fight \nfor equality and justice in this country and worldwide.\n  In 1865, June 19 marked the end of slavery in America, but not the \nend of de jure racial discrimination. My own State of Maryland passed \n15 Jim Crow laws between 1870 and 1957. Maryland's schools, swimming \npools, movie houses and other facilities were segregated. Notably, in \n1930, the University of Maryland Law School denied admission to \nBaltimore native Thurgood Marshall, a man who would two decades later \nargue the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, outlawing legally \nsegregated schools, and who would soon after become the Nation's first \nBlack Supreme Court Justice.\n  While our Nation has made considerable progress over the past century \nand a half, many challenges remain. Discrimination, disparities, and \nracially motivated hate persist. We must confront these issues. We \ncannot ignore the disparities in health care that result in higher \npremature birth rates and reduced life expectancy for minority \npopulations. We cannot ignore discriminatory sentencing in our courts \nor discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. Racially \nmotivated police brutality and hate crimes cannot stand. We must \ncontinue to pursue justice in each of these areas, and for all \nAmericans.\n  We owe it to the legacy of our predecessors in the battle for racial \nequality to keep fighting injustice until the Declaration that ``all \nmen are created equal'' rings true. We cannot be complacent. As Martin \nLuther King, Jr. said, ``We will remember not the words of our enemies, \nbut the silence of our friends.''\n  We must continue to strive toward elimination of inequality so we can \ntruly honor the spirit of Juneteenth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5104-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING ARKANSAS FLOOD VICTIMS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, my home State of Arkansas is known for \nits natural beauty, drawing thousands of visitors each year for \ncamping, fishing, and outdoor recreation. Tragically, 20 visitors to \nCamp Albert Pike lost their lives last weekend after severe rain \nresulted in flash flooding early Friday. My heartfelt condolences go \nout to their families, friends, and loved ones, many of whom I met as I \ntoured the devastation. I will continue to pray that they find peace \nand consolation.\n  I have always had the utmost respect for our law enforcement, first \nresponders, search and rescue teams and offices of emergency \nmanagement. I have never been more impressed than in seeing their \nmonumental effort during this tragedy. These brave men and women put \ntheir own safety at risk to search for survivors and victims, and they \ndemonstrated amazing competence and dedication.\n  I was personally moved, as once again, Arkansans rallied to help \ntheir neighbors. While most of the victims of this disaster were from \noutside the boundaries of our State, local citizens embraced them with \nlove and true compassion.\n  It was heartbreaking to hear the stories of those who struggled to \nmake it out alive and those who were not so fortunate. There were many \ntrue heroes--of all ages--who continued to rescue others even when they \nknew members of their own families had perished and in the face of \nunbelievable personal danger.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we remember those who lost their lives in \nthis tragic event:\n\n\n                                ARKANSAS\n\n       Kaden Jez, 3, Foreman; Leslie Anne Jez, 23, Foreman; Debra \n     McMaster, 43, Hope; Sheri Wade, 46, Ashdown.\n\n\n                               LOUISIANA\n\n       Shane Basinger, 34, Shreveport; Kinsley Basinger, 6, \n     Shreveport; Jadyn Basinger, 8, Shreveport; Anthony Smith, 30, \n     Gloster; Katelynn Smith, 2, Gloster; Joey Smith, 5, Gloster; \n     Bruce Roeder, 51, Luling; Kay Roeder, 69, Luling; Deborah \n     Roeder, 52, Luling.\n\n\n                                 TEXAS\n\n       Robert Lee Shumake, 68, DeKalb; Wilene Shumake, 67, DeKalb; \n     Nicholas Wade Shumake, 8, DeKalb; Eric Wayne Schultz, 38, \n     Nash; Gayble Y.

Mr. President, this Sunday, June 20, is World Refugee Day. \nOn June 20, 2001, we recognized World Refugee Day for the first time, \nin commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Convention \nRelating to the Status of Refugees.\n  At the end of the last century, war and ethnic cleansing in the \nformer Yugoslavia left many people without a home or the protection of \ntheir country of origin. The Rwandan genocide of 1994 and the \nsubsequent wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo forced refugees to \nflee to Tanzania and other neighboring states. As of last fall, over \n300,000 individuals in Tanzania were\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\nstill waiting for safe, third country resettlement. The dissolution of \nthe former Soviet Union, followed by war and ethnic strife in Chechnya, \nthe Caucasus, and Central Asian successor states, created millions of \nrefugees and internally displaced persons. Some of these former Soviet \ncitizens were left stateless and remain so, unable to claim the rights \nor protection of any nation.\n  Despite these tragic events, the first World Refugee Day was an \noccasion of great hope. It provided an opportunity to celebrate the \nperseverance of refugees as they begin new lives in foreign lands, join \nnew communities, learn new languages, and help their families adjust. \nThe inaugural World Refugee Day celebrated the hard work of \norganizations such as the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees and other voluntary agencies dedicated to \nserving refugees. The day also acknowledged the personal contributions \nof volunteers in the United States and around the world to help \nrefugees resettle in their communities. Finally, World Refugee Day \nraised awareness about the challenging conditions faced by refugees, \nwhether they are fleeing violence and persecution, or waiting in a \ncamp, hoping that a safe nation will welcome them and provide them \nsecurity.\n  The last 10 years have not been easy for refugees. War and conflict \naround the globe have produced more refugees, yet the financial crisis \nand global economic downturn have made it more difficult for \ncomparatively wealthy countries to contribute funds to support refugees \nand resettlement programs. For refugees recently resettled in the \nUnited States, the high unemployment rate, increased demand for low \nincome housing, and strain on community service providers has made it \nmore difficult for these new Americans to start to build their new \nlives.\n  After the September 11, 2001, attacks, certain changes to U.S. asylum \nlaw were enacted that have the effect of denying protection to genuine \nrefugees, such as child soldiers and women forced into sexual slavery, \nif their coerced actions are labeled as ``material support'' for \nterrorism.\n  Throughout this difficult time, I have remained proud of the role \nthat our country plays in supporting refugees and internally displaced \npersons abroad and helping refugees resettle in the United States. \nSince the 1980 Refugee Act was enacted, more than 2.6 million refugees \nand asylum seekers have been resettled in the United States.\n  My home State of Vermont has welcomed more than 5,300 refugees since \n1989. In 2001, the same year as the first World Refugee Day, the first \ngroup of the ``Lost Boys'' of Sudan was resettled in Vermont. These \nboys had traveled hundreds of miles by foot to escape war and ethnic- \nand religious-based persecution. They were warehoused in refugee camps \nin Kenya and Ethiopia before being resettled in the United States. In \nthe 9 years since they have arrived in Vermont, many have graduated \nfrom college, and some have gone on to attend graduate school.\n  Vermont has received refugees from across the globe, including \nBosnia, Burundi, Vietnam, Somalia, and Russia. Hundreds of Vermonters \nhave volunteered to help these refugees adapt to life in Vermont, \nwelcoming them into their homes, schools, and places of worship. The \nnewcomers have had a profound effect on life in Vermont, starting small \nbusinesses, excelling in local soccer teams, creating art, running \ncommunity gardens, and sharing their cultures. In one Vermont school \ndistrict, all signs are in English, Vietnamese, and Serbo-Croatian, \nreflecting just a few of the many languages spoken by the diverse \nstudent population. Not only do the Vermont-born students learn a \nlittle more about the world from their classmates who are refugees, but \nthey also learn an important lesson about the resolve and durability of \nthe human spirit.\n  While I am proud of the United States' long-standing commitment to \nrefugees, I believe that we as lawmakers can do better for the world's \nmost vulnerable populations. That is why I introduced S.3113, the \nRefugee Protection Act of 2010. The bill will bring the United States \nback into compliance with the Refugee Convention. Through modifications \nto the statute and misinterpretations of law in court decisions, the \nUnited States is falling short in some areas of refugee protection. The \nbill corrects serious problems in our law, such as the material support \nprovision, which can prevent innocent victims of persecution from \ngaining protection. It also repeals the one-year filing deadline for \nasylum seekers in the United States. The deadline was unnecessary when \nit was added to the law in 1996, and remains unnecessary now. The bill \nalso improves due process protections for asylum seekers without \nlowering the standards that one must meet in order to gain refugee \nstatus.\n  For resettled refugees in the United States, the bill ensures that \nper capita grants to assist these new Americans are adjusted every year \nto reflect the cost of living and inflation. The Obama administration \nraised the per capita grant level this year after it had languished at \nan unacceptably low level for years. I commend that action, but want to \nensure the number does not remain stagnant.\n  I thank Senators Levin, Akaka, Durbin, and Burris for their support \nof the Refugee Protection Act. I hope that on World Refugee Day, others \nwill join us in helping victims of persecution worldwide.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Sunday, June 20, the world will \nobserve the tenth annual World Refugee Day. On this day, we call \nattention to humanity's efforts, through the United Nations, the work \nof individual governments, and of nongovernmental organizations, to \nalleviate the plight of those forced from their homes by conflict or \nhatred.\n  Sadly, while the world's commitment to these refugees is great, the \nscope of the problem is even greater. Last year, more than 43 million \npeople were forcibly displaced from their homes, the largest number \nsince the mid-1990s. At the same time, data from the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees show that the number of refugees who \nresettled in 2009 was at the lowest level in two decades.\n  These figures, just for 2009, include more than 2.8 million people \nwho have fled homes in Afghanistan, more than 1.7 million people from \nIraq, more than half a million in Somalia, nearly half a million from \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo. These stunning numbers represent the \nhuman cost of humanity's inability to live in peace. These seemingly \nendless millions represent mothers who struggle to feed their babies, \nchildren unable to go to school, families without dependable access to \nclean water or food or medical care. They are without homes, and if the \nworld is silent to their pleas for aid, they will be without hope.\n  Fortunately, this human tragedy has prompted global action, with the \nUnited States in the lead. The Refugee Act of 1980 guides U.S. policy \nwith regards to refugees, and since its passage, more than two and a \nhalf million people forced from their homes have been resettled in the \nUnited States. Of the more than 112,000 refugees who found refuge in \ncountries other than their home in 2009, about 80,000, or nearly three-\nquarters, were resettled in the United States.\n  Despite our commitment to aiding refugees and to finding them new \nhomes, our current policies often stand in the way of fulfilling our \nresponsibility to help. Current law and administrative practice too \noften put unnecessary burdens on those seeking asylum here, even \nbarring some who hope to escape the worst sorts of violence and \npersecution from entering the United States.\n  Seeking to address these problems, I have joined Senators Leahy and \nDurbin in sponsoring the Refugee Protection Act of 2010. Our \nlegislation would extend protections for those seeking asylum in the \nUnited States; reform the process by which asylum seekers can be \nexpelled from this country; modify existing law to ensure that \nlegitimate asylum-seekers are not inadvertently caught up in \nantiterrorism protections while ensuring that terrorists are unable to \nmanipulate the system to gain entry; and ease the path to resettlement \nfor asylum-seekers and their families. Failing to remedy these gaps in \nour refugee law would carry a great human cost. As Dan Glickman, the \npresident of Refugees International, testified to the Judiciary \nCommittee during a hearing on our bill last month, ``The Refugee \nProtection Act will help us do the right thing by\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\ncreating a more efficient and fair process for providing safe haven to \nthe world's most vulnerable.''\n  We face this continuing challenge without one of the world's most \neloquent and effective advocates for the world's refugees. Senator Ted \nKennedy led the drive to pass the original Refugee Act of 1980. He was \na tireless advocate for the innocent victims of conflict, religious \npersecution and ethnic hatred. As we approach another World Refugee \nDay, we would benefit enormously from his leadership, but we can gain \ninspiration from his example. So long as there are people forced from \ntheir homes by war and persecution, this Nation will have a \nresponsibility to act, and the Refugee Protection Act is an important \nopportunity to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5106-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5106-S5107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UIGHUR PROTESTS IN URUMQI\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, it has been nearly a year since deadly \nethnic rioting between ethnic Han Chinese and the native Uighur \npopulation engulfed the city of Urumqi in China's vast, far-western \nregion of Xianjiang--one of the worst ethnic clashes in China in \ndecades.\n  Last year, after the protests began, I spoke on the floor, expressing \nmy concern about human rights abuses and a lack of press freedom in \nXianjiang, as demonstrated by the decision by the Chinese government to \nblock access to journalists, which prevented the world from knowing the \ntruth of what was occurring. Unfortunately, it is now clear that things \nwere even worse than we knew at the time.\n  The Chinese police, the People's Armed Police, and the military \nresponded with a heavy hand, conducting many large-scale sweep \noperations in two mostly Uighur areas of the city, operations that \nreportedly continued at least through mid-August of 2009. Internet and \ntext-messaging services were immediately limited or cut off, and were \nonly restored last month, depriving the people of Xianjiang from access \nto news, information, means of communication, and other benefits of \nconnective technology.\n  The official death toll from the July 5, 2009, rioting was reportedly \n197--though human rights observers say the actual number of casualties \nis higher. At least 1,700 people were injured, and some 1,500 people, \nby the government's own account, were detained. According to an \ninsightful article published in the Washington Post this week, as of \nearly March, there have been 25 death sentences among the 198 people \nofficially sentenced. Twenty-three of those 25 were ethnic Uighurs.\n  The Post, which sent a reporter to Urumqi for a look at the city 1 \nyear after the riots, reports that residents ``seem most terrified of \ntalking,'' and not just with journalists but also with each other. \nUniformed and plainclothes police officers are pervasive, the newspaper \nreports. Most Uighurs are Sunni Muslims, but their religious freedoms \nhave been sharply curtailed. Economically, they lag well behind the \nethnic Han population.\n  I condemn the continued repression of the Uighurs, as well as the \nviolence perpetrated against all innocent civilians in China, and I \ncall on the Chinese government to bring this reprehensible behavior to \nan end. I also reiterate my call from last year on the Chinese \ngovernment to open Internet and mobile phone access, end jamming of \ninternational broadcasting, and lift the grave and growing restrictions \non the press. If China is going to assume a position of leadership in \nthe international community on par with its economic standing, it must \nlead by example in granting essential freedoms and human rights to its \ncitizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article entitled \n``One year later, China's crackdown after Uighur riots haunts a \nhomeland'' published on June 15 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Washington Post Foreign Service, June 15, 2010]\n\n One Year Later, China's Crackdown After Uighur Riots Haunts a Homeland\n\n                           (By Lauren Keane)\n\n       Urumqi, China.--A hulking shell of a department store \n     towers over this city's Uighur quarter, a reminder of what \n     can be lost here by speaking up.\n       For years, it was the flagship of the business empire of \n     Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled leader and matriarch of the Uighur \n     people. If Chinese government accounts are accurate, she \n     helped instigate fierce ethnic riots that killed hundreds and \n     injured thousands here last July--an accusation she \n     vehemently denies.\n       Still a prominent landmark even in its ruin, the Rebiya \n     Kadeer Trade Center was partially confiscated by the \n     government in 2006 when Kadeer's son was charged with tax \n     evasion, although tenants were allowed to stay. After the \n     riots, it was shuttered and slated for destruction. The \n     government said the building had failed fire inspections, but \n     it seems in no hurry to set a demolition date.\n       The forsaken structure makes for an effective deterrent. \n     Last summer's chaos has been replaced with a level of fear \n     that is striking even for one of China's most repressed \n     regions. Residents are afraid of attracting any attention, \n     afraid of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But \n     they seem most terrified of talking.\n       ``Every single family on this block is missing someone,'' \n     said Hasiya, a 33-year-old Uighur who asked that her full \n     name not be used. Her younger brother is serving a 20-year \n     prison sentence for stealing a carton of cigarettes during \n     the riots. ``Talking about our sorrow might just increase it. \n     So we swallow it up inside.''\n       Fear is not unwarranted here. For years now, those caught \n     talking to journalists have been questioned, monitored and \n     sometimes detained indefinitely. More striking is that \n     residents now say they cannot talk even with one another.\n       The Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs consider Xinjiang their \n     homeland but now make up only 46 percent of the region's \n     population, after decades of government-sponsored migration \n     by China's Han ethnic majority.\n       The riots started as a Uighur protest over a government \n     investigation into a Uighur-Han brawl at a southern Chinese \n     factory. Several days of violence brought the official death \n     toll to 197, with 1,700 injured, though observers suspect the \n     casualty count to be much higher. Most of the dead were Han, \n     according to authorities. The government officially \n     acknowledged detaining nearly 1,500 people after the riots. \n     As of early March, Xinjiang had officially sentenced 198 \n     people, with 25 death sentences. Of those 25, 23 were Uighur.\n       The events forced China's national and regional governments \n     to address, at least superficially, taboo issues of ethnic \n     conflict, discrimination and socioeconomic inequality. The \n     central government in April named a different Communist Party \n     secretary for Xinjiang, Zhang Chunxian, who promptly \n     announced that he had ``deeply fallen in love with this \n     land.'' In May, the government announced a new development \n     strategy to pour $1.5 billion into the region. It also \n     restored full Internet and text-messaging access to the \n     region after limiting or blocking it entirely for 10 months.\n       The riots ``left a huge psychic trauma on the minds of many \n     people of all ethnicities. This fully reflects the great harm \n     done to the Chinese autonomous region by `splittist' \n     forces,'' said Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese \n     Embassy in the United States.\n       The ability to confront what happened last July, and why, \n     still eludes people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. White-\n     knuckled, they hold their spoons above steaming bowls of \n     mutton stew, poking nervously at the oily surface. They \n     fiddle with their watchbands until they break. They repeat \n     questions rather than answer them. They glance through \n     doorways, distracted, and shift side to side in their chairs. \n     Summer's full swelter has yet to arrive, but everyone \n     starting to speak to a reporter begins to sweat. One man \n     leaves the table six times in half an hour to rinse the \n     perspiration from his face. He returns unrefreshed.\n       When asked what changes the riots had brought, Mehmet, a \n     former schoolteacher who resigned last year because he \n     opposed requirements that he teach his Uighur students \n     primarily in Chinese, took a long glance around the room \n     before pointing halfheartedly out the door. ``They built a \n     new highway overpass,'' he said.\n       Suspicion of fellow citizens is still common throughout \n     China but seems especially acute here. Academics accept \n     interviews only if they can avoid discussing the conflict's \n     lingering effects. An apologetic professor backed out of a \n     planned meeting after his supervisor discovered his plan, \n     called him and threatened his job. A businessman said that he \n     believed government security agents often trained as \n     journalists, and asked how he could be sure that he would not \n     be turned in.\n       ``We're seeing increasingly intrusive modes of control over \n     religious and cultural expression,'' said Nicholas Bequelin, \n     a Hong Kong-based senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n     ``They live in fear of being overheard.''\n       The Kadeer Trade Center is at the center of a protracted \n     conflict. The Urumqi government said that compensation talks \n     with tenants were still ongoing, and that it had moved the \n     tenants to a nearby location. A spokesman for Kadeer, who now \n     lives in Fairfax, said she had not been offered compensation.\n       Although the government says it is striving for stability, \n     getting there is uncomfortable. On a single street near this \n     city's main bazaar, four different types of uniformed police \n     were on patrol one recent day--not counting, of course, an \n     unknown number of\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\n     plainclothes security guards. They marched haphazardly along \n     the sidewalks, the different units so numerous that they \n     sometimes collided. Late into the evening, they perched on \n     rickety school desk chairs placed throughout the bazaar, \n     watching. On the corner outside Xinjiang Medical University, \n     armed police in riot gear peered out the windows of an olive \n     green humvee or leaned on riot shields under the afternoon \n     sun.\n       ``It's quiet here on the surface,'' said Yu Xinqing, 35, a \n     lifelong Han resident of Urumqi whose brother was killed by \n     Uighurs during the riots. He now carries a knife with him \n     everywhere, avoids Uighur businesses and rarely speaks with \n     Uighur neighbors he previously considered friends. He says he \n     is saving money to leave Xinjiang behind for good.\n       ``We don't talk about these things, even within our \n     families,'' he said. ``But our hearts are overwhelmed; we \n     hold back rivers and overturn the seas.''\n       Still, every once in a while, when a resident is safely \n     alone with a neutral observer, months' worth of stifled \n     thinking tumbles out. That was the case for Ablat, a Uighur \n     businessman who sells clothing near the main bazaar; he would \n     not allow his last name to be mentioned. Ablat had been \n     speaking in vague, evasive terms for three hours, and then--\n     ensconced in his car, speeding north out of town--something \n     finally released.\n       ``Give us jobs, stop holding our passports hostage, and let \n     us worship the way we want to,'' he said. ``That would solve \n     these problems. That is all it would take.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5107-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT TABASH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to extend my thanks to \nDr. Robert Tabash for dedicating his career to the Holy Family Hospital \nin Bethlehem, Palestine. Thanks to his concern for the people of \nPalestine, Dr. Tabash has created a hospital that is truly an oasis of \npeace in the troubled region and is a shining example of humanitarian \nassistance.\n  Dr. Tabash's work to build an oasis of peace to serve mothers and \nbabies in conflict-torn Palestine has not been an easy road. After \nserving as a staff physician beginning in 1971, Dr. Tabash was \nappointed the Director of Administration to the Holy Family Hospital in \n1985. That same year the hospital was forced to close due to the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. After a 5-year renovation period, Dr. Tabash's vision \nfinally came to life when the hospital was inaugurated. That same year, \nDr. Tabash saw the first baby born in the new facility. Since, the \nhospital has successfully delivered over 50,000 newborns. With the only \nneonatal intensive care unit in the area, Holy Family Hospital has \namazingly limited the mortality rate to around 2 percent, on par with \nWestern hospitals and remarkably different than the roughly 30 percent \nmortality rate found in government-run hospitals in the West Bank.\n  This impressive success rate with high risk pregnancies and track \nrecord for saving premature babies makes the Hospital special. But what \nmakes Holy Family truly shine is their commitment to serving pregnant \nwomen and babies in the West Bank, regardless of religion or race. \nDespite this commitment, more than 90 percent of Holy Family's patients \nare Muslim. Backed by U.S. dollars--and I am proud to have secured $3.5 \nmillion for the hospital in 2005--Holy Family not only gives the unborn \na chance at life in a troubled part of the world, it also works to \ndispel the false notions that America is at war with the Muslim world \nand sides only with the Israeli people.\n  Holy Family Hospital is one of the most successful and touching \nexamples of Smart Power in the Middle East--where through non-military \nengagement, like diplomacy, education, and in this case, humanitarian \nassistance, we can win hearts and minds, a necessary first step to \npeace.\n  Dr. Tabash is a Christian Palestinian doctor. Born in Bethlehem \nhimself, it is Dr. Tabash, and his endless devotion to serving the most \nvulnerable in Bethlehem--pregnant mothers and babies--that has made the \nhospital the success story it is today. Dr. Tabash is the rare \nindividual who recognizes that the work of one person--every person--\ncan make a difference. Through his work, Dr. Tabash has saved thousands \nof babies' lives and touched countless more.\n  On the occasion of Dr. Tabash's retirement I offer gratitude and \ncongratulations for the good Doctor's contributions--to the lives of \nmany mothers and babies and to the long-hoped dream of peace in the \nMiddle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5107-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEVADA CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the Nevada City Fire Department in Nevada City, CA.\n  The Nevada City Fire Department was formed in June 1860 after a group \nof local women set up theatrical shows and a ball to raise funds to \nform a fire department. The fire department began with three fire \ncompanies: the Nevada Hose Company No. 1; Eureka Hose Company No. 2; \nand the Protection Hook and Ladder Company No. 1. In 1861, the first \nfire station was built to house the volunteer fire departments in \ndowntown Nevada City and had a service area of about 1 square mile.\n  Over the years, the Nevada City Fire Department has evolved to meet \nthe growing needs of Nevada City. In 1938, a new city hall and fire \nstation were built and, in 1960, the first paid fire chief was hired. \nNearly four decades later, in 1999, a new fire station was built to \naccommodate the department's needs. In 2000, the city hired its first \npaid fire fighter to staff the fire station during the day and, by \n2003, three paid fire fighters were hired to man the fire station 24 \nhours a day.\n  Today, the Nevada City Fire Department has 20 employees serving over \n3,000 residents with three fire engines and two fire stations. They \nrespond to over 500 calls for service every year in their 2 square mile \nservice area, and assist on calls from mutual aid areas including wild \nland fires on national forest land.\n  As the community celebrates the Nevada City Fire Department's \nsesquicentennial anniversary, I would like to congratulate and thank \nall of the brave men and women of the Nevada City Fire Department who \nhave proudly served their community over the past 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5107-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5107-S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AUGUSTA STATE UNIVERSITY MEN'S GOLF TEAM\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Augusta \nState University men's golf team on their historic NCAA Championship \nwin last week.\n  On June 6, 2010, Augusta State beat Oklahoma State 3-3-1 in the \nchampionship match of the 112th NCAA Division I Championships.\n  ASU's Henrik Norlander, Patrick Reed, Mitch Krywulycz, Taylor Floyd \nand Carter Newman had already defeated No. 3 Georgia Tech and the No. 2 \nFlorida State to bring them to the championship. All that was left now \nwas Oklahoma State, the No. 1 team in the country.\n  The win seemed unlikely. Oklahoma State was not only ranked higher, \nbut had more funding, more experience and more championship titles. \nThey were giants in the golf world.\n  In addition, Taylor Floyd was sick. So sick, that it seemed as though \nhe couldn't play.\n  But Augusta State was determined. They had tried to win 11 times \nbefore this and failed. This was their year to win.\n  So, at the Honors Course just north of Chattanooga, TN, ASU did just \nthat. Its win was not only the first NCAA championship title in Augusta \nState's history, but also marked the team's 10th straight top-five \nfinish of the season.\n  And they deserved to win. Throughout the tournament they played with \nheart, played with courage and played with sportsmanship. They became \ngiants on that course.\n  They not only made Augusta State proud but the Augusta and the State \nof Georgia proud.\n  But no one could be prouder than ASU's head coach Josh Gregory. As \ntears pooled in his eyes, he said, ``This means everything. This is a \ndream come true, and they are incredible players.''\n  Gregory's commitment and dedication to his team has resulted in four \nNCAA championships appearances, the most by any coach in school \nhistory.\n  We can all be inspired by the story of this small school and its \nstruggle to victory. Its hard work and perseverance is unparalleled, \nand I am grateful that they have represented our state so well.\n  Once again, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Augusta \nState\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nUniversity team on this special occasion, and wish its players the best \nof luck as they defend this title over the next year.\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I honor in the Senate the \nmen's golf team at Augusta State University and congratulate them on \ntheir new title--National Champions.\n  On June 6, 2010, Henrik Norlander, Patrick Reed, Mitch Krywulycz, \nTaylor Floyd, and Carter Newman won the National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation Division I National Championship in dramatic fashion at The \nHonors Course in Ooltewah, TN. These fine young men played outstanding \ngolf throughout the entire tournament, including wins against the No. 3 \nseed Georgia Tech and the No. 2 seed Florida State. However, in the \nfinal match, they soared and played like true professionals. The team \ndefeated 10-time national champion and No. 1 seed Oklahoma State to \nbring home the trophy. This is the first of no doubt many national \nchampionships to come for Augusta State University.\n  In addition, on June 15, 2010, Coach Josh Gregory was named Coach of \nthe Year by the Golf Coaches Association of America. Coach Gregory has \nplayed such a vital role in the team's success, and I am proud to honor \nhim. Coach Gregory recently completed his eighth year as Director of \nGolf and Head Men's Golf Coach at ASU and has guided the Jaguars to the \nbest season in school history this year. ASU posted four tournament \nvictories, matched the highest national ranking in school history at \nNo. 2, and registered 10 consecutive top-five finishes to close out the \nseason.\n  I salute this team on their work ethic, including playing through \nillness, and their big win as a result of their efforts. I am pleased \nto acknowledge the great achievement of these young men and to extend \nmy deepest congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5108-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CARSON, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. From June 25-27, the residents of Carson will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  The rural post office opened on August 11, 1902, in Carson. A man by \nthe name of John Erickson suggested the name Zelma for the town, after \nthe daughter of a local rancher. However, the selected name of Carson \nwas coined by combining the names of local settlers, Frank Carter and \nSimon and David Pederson. A few years later, the city merged with the \nrival town site of North Carson when the Northern Pacific Railroad \nbrought the two communities together. It became the county seat of \nGrant County when the county organized in 1916.\n  Today, Carson remains a small, proud community. Just this year, a \ndevastating ice storm crippled much of rural southwestern North Dakota, \nleaving many without power. While the residents of Carson lost power \nfor approximately four days themselves, they helped to serve the people \nof several surrounding communities who went without electricity for \nnearly a month. This is just one example of the resilience of the \npeople of Carson.\n  To celebrate the town's centennial, the residents of Carson have \nplanned a number of festivities. They will gather for an all-school \nreunion, an alumni basketball game, attend a Bull-A-Rama, and \nparticipate in other celebratory festivities.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Carson, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century. By honoring Carson and all the historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Carson that have helped shape \nthis country, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Carson has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5108-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KUAKINI HEALTH SYSTEM\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 110th \nanniversary of the Kuakini Health System. This great institution of \nHawaii was born from necessity and boundless compassion for others. \nFrom the humble beginnings of 38 beds, the Kuakini Health System's \nhospital has grown to serve a 250-bed occupancy. This impressive \nestablishment has marked the lives of countless people and has indeed \nlaid the foundation for a legacy that will endure for years to come.\n  I am proud to honor the Kuakini Health System. Through the unwavering \ndedication to serve those in need, its staff has played a pivotal role \nin the health care of Hawaii's residents. Since its inception, the \nstandards of high quality care were set as the basis for this medical \ncenter and though it has been many years, these core values were never \nlost and the aspiration for excellence has only amplified. Such \nattributes can be exemplified through the many accomplishments that \nhave set this center apart from all others in Hawaii. It leads in the \nfields of oncology, geriatric and cardiac care, gastroenterology \nservices, orthopedic surgery, pulmonary disease treatment, and \ntelemedicine and cyberhealth. The commitment demonstrated by all its \nmembers is commendable and a model of distinction. The Kuakini Health \nSystem is and will always remain an integral part of Hawaii's \ncommunity. They have my respect and profound appreciation for their \nsteadfast ambition and the necessary work they do.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging this \ntruly remarkable occasion for the Kuakini Health System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5108-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5108-S5109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ROBERT DEAN MOORE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ninspirational life and dedicated service of Robert Dean Moore. It has \nbeen my great honor to know Robert for many years and to consider him a \nfriend. I have always appreciated his guidance and insight on issues \nimpacting American Indian tribes in South Dakota and throughout Indian \nCountry.\n  Robert was born on May 3, 1963. He was an enrolled member of the \nRosebud Sioux Tribe and a proud graduate of Sinte Gleska University in \nMission, SD. Robert passed away on May 29, 2010. His family, friends, \nand extended community have lost a great leader and dear friend. His \nfuneral was held on June 5, 2010, and the outpouring of memories and \ntributes at the service reflected the widespread impact that Robert had \non so many lives.\n  Robert represented South Dakota as a delegate to the Democratic \nNational Convention. Robert was an incredibly talented singer, and in \n1996 and 2008, he gave powerful renditions of the National Anthem to \nthe delegates. I was also fortunate enough to have him sing during my \nfirst swearing in ceremony in the U.S. Senate in 1997.\n  In the early 1990s, Robert served as a staff member for my colleague, \nSenator Tom Daschle. It was during his time in Senator Daschle's office \nthat Robert developed an in-depth understanding about Federal \nGovernment and the legislative process. Robert advised Senator Daschle \non Indian affairs and excelled in that position. He would utilize this \nvaluable perspective to benefit the Lakota people for the rest of his \nlife. Robert also worked to raise awareness in Congress about the \nFederal trust responsibility and the unique government-to-government \nrelationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Later, \nRobert moved to Denver to work for the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, in their tribal government division. He worked with \ntribes in Great Plains region on disaster mitigation and in other times \nof need.\n  Robert was elected to a 4-year term on the Rosebud Sioux Tribal \nCouncil in 2004. His passion for advocating for the Sicangu Lakota and \nother tribes of the Great Sioux Nation was never more apparent than \nwhen he worked on health care issues. He was a leader for American \nIndian health issues on the national level, often representing the \ntribes of the Great Plains region both to the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians and to the Tribal Technical Advisory Committee for the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid. I am truly sorry that Robert did not \nlive to see the effects of increased reimbursements for Medicaid nor \nfull implementation of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act; however, \nthose who witnessed his efforts will never forget his tireless \ninvolvement.\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\n  I greatly admired Robert's understanding of the cultural value and \nimportance of family. He was a dedicated son, showering his parents, \nMarrles and Frances, with genuine care and love. Robert's countless \naccomplishments, from his memorable vocal talents to his unfailing \npublic service, will live on for many years to come. Robert \ndemonstrated an admirable love of life and commitment to others, which \nought to serve as an inspiration for all of us.\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I pay honor to Robert Dean \nMoore of Mission, SD, who passed away on May 29, 2010, after a \ncourageous battle with cancer. He is survived by his parents, Reverend \nand Doctor Marrles and Frances Moore, and his brother and sister-in-\nlaw, Reverend Jack and Nancy Moore.\n  Robert dedicated his life to improving the health and well being of \nall Native Americans, including members of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, of \nwhich Robert was an enrolled member. This mission led him into public \nservice, where he was elected as a Rosebud Sioux tribal councilman as \nwell as being a member of the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairman's Health \nBoard. Robert was not only a vocal supporter of enactment of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act earlier this year, he was also a strong \nadvocate for better research, education, and prevention of tribal youth \nsuicide.\n  In addition to his dedication to public service and the betterment of \nhis people, Robert lived his life with a strong foundation in his \nfaith.

Mr. President, the Forest Products Laboratory, FPL, \nin Madison, WI, was established in 1910 to ``promote healthy forest and \nforest-based economies through the efficient, sustainable use of \nAmerican wood resources.'' This month we celebrate the 100 year \nanniversary of the establishment of the FPL. I would like to \ncongratulate all past and present employees for the FPL for a century \nof service to the American public and their steadfast devotion to \ndeveloping new and innovative usages for wood and wood products.\n  Over the years their research has led to many improvements and \nbreakthroughs in wood utilization. Early research at the laboratory \nfocused on timber testing, wood preservation, and wood chemistry. \nToday, the mission of the FPL has never been more relevant. Our \nNation's forest can help solve some of the greatest challenges our \nnation faces such as climate change and energy security. Forests \ncontain a significant amount of small diameter wood that increases the \nrisk of fire and disease. Finding new ways to utilize small diameter \nwood will improve forest health and has the potential to offset carbon \nemissions by utilizing wood, a renewable resource, as a building \nmaterial. Right now, the Forest Products Laboratory is developing \nbetter ways to utilize small diameter wood for energy production and as \na ``green'' building material. I am confident that the Forest Products \nLaboratory will continue to provide creative solutions to effectively \nmanage our national wood resources and create a green economy.\n  On behalf of our State and Nation, I thank the FPL for a century of \nresearch that has improved the lives of every American and the health \nof our Nation's forests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5109-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATION SINGERS OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I honor Coach Gene Stallings, \nwho will be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on July 18, \n2010.\n  Eugene Clifton Stallings was born March 2, 1935, in Paris, TX. As a \nyoung man, Gene was an accomplished athlete who demonstrated his \nnatural leadership as the captain for the Paris High School football, \nbaseball, and golf teams. Whether on the gridiron, the diamond, or the \nlinks, his abilities were readily apparent. These talents coupled with \na tireless work ethic earned him a football scholarship at Texas A \nUniversity, where he would play end for Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant.\n  At Texas A, Stallings would ultimately help the Aggies bring a \nSouthwest Conference Championship back to College Station. But the road \nto victory was paved with hardship, and it ran through Junction, TX.\n  When Bryant first signed on as the head coach for Texas A's \nfootball team in 1954, more than 100 players were listed on the Aggies' \nroster. What players were left after a grueling spring and summer \nregimen attended a preseason camp at an adjunct campus in Junction. \nAfter 10 days of practicing during a record Texan drought and heat that \nat times reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit, less than 40 players remained \nto take the field as the 1954 Aggies. Gene Stallings was among the \nstrong that survived and have since been known simply as the Junction \nBoys.\n  The Junction Boys returned to campus stronger, with a clearer sense \nof purpose and unity. Though their success was not immediate--the 1954 \nAggies won only one game--they persevered. These men, forged in the \nTexas heat, kept working through these setbacks and losses.\n  The Aggies would finish the 1956 season as undefeated Southwestern \nConference Champions, thanks in no small part to the resolve of the \nJunction Boys that lead that team. They demonstrated the truth of the \nBear's simple philosophy: ``the price of victory is high, but so are \nthe rewards.''\n  Stallings finished his playing career after the 1956 season, but his \nfootball\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\ncareer was far from over and would soon flourish. He followed Bryant to \nthe University of Alabama in 1958 and served as an assistant coach for \nthe 1961 and 1964 National Championship teams. After helping restore \nthe winning Tradition of the Crimson Tide, Coach Stallings returned to \nhis alma mater, where he would lead the Aggies to another Southwestern \nConference Championship in 1967.\n  Stallings left College Station for the Dallas Cowboys in 1972. After \n18 years in the NFL, he returned to the Capstone to lead the Crimson \nTide back atop the elite of college football yet again.\n  In 1992, Coach Stallings' Crimson Tide, led by a stifling defense and \na workhorse offense, won the inaugural Southeastern Conference \nChampionship game and the National Championship in classic wins over \nthe University of Florida Gators and the University of Miami \nHurricanes. Scenes from these great moments in Crimson Tide history are \nto this day replayed before each and every game at Bryant-Denny \nStadium.\n  In November of 1996, and after coaching the Crimson Tide to seventy \nvictories in 7 years, Stallings announced that he would retire from \nfootball for the one thing that he loved more: his son John Mark \nStallings. John Mark was born with Down syndrome and was not expected \nto live past the age of four. He lived 46 years, proving that uncommon \nstrength is a common trait in the Stallings household.\n  Though he was greatly missed at the Capstone, it was not hard to \nunderstand why Coach Stallings left for his son. John Mark, himself, \nwas much beloved by the Crimson Tide family. The equipment room at the \nfootball complex is even named in his honor. John Mark was known for \nhis ability to positively impact the people around him with his kind \nnature and genuine interest in their lives. After his passing, \nathletics director Mal Moore stated that ``For someone who never played \nor coached a game, I think John Mark may have touched more Alabama fans \nthan any other person ever did.''\n  By anyone else's standards, Coach Stallings' time in Tuscaloosa was \nhis most successful, but Stallings doesn't measure success in wins, \ntrophies, and championships. He measures his success by the lives that \nhe has positively affected. As a football coach, he did so by \ninstilling the values of character, discipline, and integrity in young \nmen. He did just that at every stop on his coaching path, and, even \nafter football, he continues to succeed in affecting his community and \nour Nation.\n  John Mark inspired his father to advocate on behalf of persons with \ndisabilities. Coach Stallings worked to start a golf tournament to \nbenefit the Arc of Tuscaloosa County, a local nonprofit organization \ndevoted to helping the intellectually and developmentally disabled. \nThis tournament raised more than $1 million for the program by the time \nhe left Tuscaloosa in 1996.\n  Stallings has also been a prolific fundraiser for the RISE School at \nthe University of Alabama, which provides family-oriented services to \nchildren with developmental disabilities. When he returned to the \nCapstone, the RISE School had devoted educators and a special cause, \nbut the underfunded program languished in subpar facilities. RISE's \nstaff worried that each year would be their last.\n  The value of RISE was not truly known nor its potential realized \nuntil Coach Stallings came on the scene. Following a 2-year capital \ncampaign, the RISE School moved to a state-of-the-art building with six \nclassrooms that serve more than 80 students. This beautiful building on \nthe Alabama campus is named the Stallings Center in honor of Coach \nStallings' tireless efforts on RISE's behalf, and John Mark is \nremembered at the school's playground, which is named for him.\n  With John Mark's inspiration and Coach Stallings' signature work \nethic, the RISE program spread from Tuscaloosa to Austin, Corpus \nChristi, Dallas, Houston, Denver, and Stillwater. Today, families \nacross the country can receive early intervention services for their \nyoung children with disabilities. The dedicated teachers and \nadministrators of the RISE program teach these children what they can \ndo, rather than what they cannot.\n  For enduring the trials of Junction, for passing on these lessons of \ncharacter, and for helping to grow a culture that embraces and \nencourages persons with disabilities, Eugene Clifton Stallings has \ncertainly proven himself worthy of being immortalized in the College \nFootball Hall of Fame.\n  On behalf of the University of Alabama, the Crimson Tide faithful, \nand the whole of the great State of Alabama, I thank Coach Stallings \nfor his contributions to my alma mater and our community. We are truly \nfortunate for the examples he has set as a player, coach and \nphilanthropist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5110-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING OXFORD NETWORKS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize a small \ntelecommunications company from my home State of Maine that has proved \nitself to be a dedicated leader throughout northern New England. Oxford \nNetworks, based in Lewiston with offices in Bangor and Norway, has been \nserving customers across Maine for over a century, and it has shown no \nsigns of letting up.\n  Alva Andrews, Oxford's founder, laid the foundation for the company \nin 1893 by setting up phone service between his family-owned business, \nlocated in South Woodstock, and the nearby railroad station in West \nParis. Seven years later, in 1900, Mr. Andrews incorporated his firm as \nOxford Telephone and Telegraph, a provider of telephone services to the \nlocal community in western Maine.\n  The company has expanded and grown significantly over the last 110 \nyears. In 1981, the company acquired Bryant Pond Telephone Company, and \ntwo decades later, purchased Revolution Networks to continue growing \nits reach. By 2004, Oxford was able to provide cable television, \nInternet, phone, and long distance service, one of Maine's only \nfacility-based competitive providers to do so. Additionally, the \ncompany's fiber optic backbone network presently spreads north as far \nas Bangor and south down to Boston.\n  A member of 12 different Chambers of Commerce throughout the State, \nOxford Networks, which now employs 125, has been named a Best Place to \nWork Company for each of the last four years, indicative of the \nenvironment the company fosters for its employees. But beyond this \nremarkable feat, Oxford has demonstrated its commitment to others by \nbecoming an active partner in the community, supporting a host of local \ncharities and initiatives, from the United Way to the Maine Discovery \nMuseum. Company employees raise money for Big Brothers/Big Sisters each \nspring during the Bowl for Kids Sake fundraiser, and also participate \nin walking teams for the American Heart Association's Heart Walk. The \ncompany has also been the Presenting Underwriter for the Maine Cancer \nFoundation's Pink Tulip Project since 2007. The project raises money \nfor the Maine Cancer Foundation's Women's Cancer Fund while paying \ntribute to those who have courageously fought the disease.\n  From its start in the 1890s with a simple telephone connection, \nOxford Networks has transformed the way Maine connects with the world. \nBecause of its forward-thinking and innovative efforts, Oxford is now \nable to offer a wide range of cutting-edge telecommunications options \nto its varied client base of small and large businesses, as well as \nindividual residences. Indeed, no problem is too large or too small for \nthis incredible company, which continues to impress its customers with \nits rapid responsiveness and quality service. I thank everyone at \nOxford Networks for the great work they do in the community, and wish \nthem continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5110-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5110-S5111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN ``JEANNE'' LAURENCE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Jeanne Laurence, \nwho will celebrate her retirement from Rapid City Area Schools this \nJune after 23 years of service. In reaching her retirement milestone, \nJeanne Laurence is finishing a career that pioneered computer usage \nwithin area schools in Rapid City, SD. Jeanne began her career in the \nreal estate field in Wyoming, but after eight years moved to Rapid City \nand joined Stevens High School as a secretary. At Stevens she tracked \nstudent attendance, grades, and discipline issues. In 1985, the school \ndistrict was not equipped with computers, so Jeanne performed all \ntracking and management functions by\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nhand. At the first opportunity to use a computer, Jeanne automated most \nof her tasks and encouraged administrators, teachers, and secretaries \nto take advantage of this new technology.\n  Over the next several years, Jeanne earned a reputation among co-\nworkers for being an expert on technology solutions. The district \nquickly recognized Jeanne's expertise and asked her to develop computer \nclasses for fellow staff members. Her knowledge of student management \nautomation resulted in her appointment to the selection committee for \nthe district's first student information system.\n  Jeanne's experience and reputation led to her selection for a \ndistrict-wide position in the newly formed Department of Information \nTechnology. In her new role, Jeanne became the sole trainer for over \n1,500 employees. She developed technology training for new employees \nand introduced downloadable video clips to the training process. The \ngroundwork provided by Jeanne Laurence in technical education and \ntraining has made a significant contribution to the professional \ndevelopment of the staff and to the educational success of the students \nin the Rapid City Area Schools. Her tireless efforts have brought great \ncredit to her school district and to herself.

A bill to strengthen the capacity of the United States to \nlead the international community in reversing renewable natural \nresource degradation trends around the world that threaten to undermine \nglobal prosperity and security and eliminate the diversity of life on \nEarth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I rise today to introduce the bipartisan \nGlobal Conservation Act of 2010 with my colleague and fellow advocate \non international conservation issues, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.\n  As our world grows increasingly intertwined through commerce, \ncommunication, and culture, we must also work together to protect the \nearth's natural resources through conservation. This bill acknowledges \nthe important role our natural resources play in global economics, \nglobal health, and global security, and takes steps to strengthen the \nUnited States' involvement and productivity in conservation on a global \nscale.\n  As described in the legislation being introduced today, competing \nneeds around the world are taxing natural resources that are vital to \nhuman survival. For example, 500 million people in developing countries \ndepend on fresh water from natural areas that are under threat of \ndegradation, and two billion people depend on rapidly diminishing fish \nstocks for a significant source of their daily protein. In contrast, \nwild species provide more than $300 billion in protection and benefits \nto world agriculture, including natural pest control and the \npollination of two thirds of the crop species that feed the world. \nForests prevent catastrophic flooding and severe drought, and coral \nreefs and mangroves reduce the impact of large storms on coastal \npopulations, saving $9 billion in damages each year and reducing \noutlays for disaster assistance.\n  As natural resources continue to be polluted and depleted throughout \nthe world, economies are threatened and conflicts begin to emerge. The \nUnited States National Intelligence Council expects demographic trends \nand natural resource scarcities relating to water, food, arable land, \nand energy sources to lead to instabilities and conflict in the years \nahead.\n  With such threats looming, it is with urgency that we introduce this \nlegislation that recognizes the intrinsic link between communities, \nconflict, and natural resources, and which looks to a future of local \ninvolvement in the preservation of natural resources for the benefit of \ninternational communities. The bill establishes conservation as a \nfundamental element in economic development, conflict mitigation, and \nadaptation to climate change.\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n  To meet the conservation challenges of the 21st century, the Global \nConservation Act reduces the duplication of Federal programs by \nbringing all U.S. agencies involved in conservation together to \nestablish a national strategy for global conservation. Several \nexecutive branch agencies are engaged in some aspect of international \nconservation, yet their efforts are not coordinated in a manner that \nmaximizes the effectiveness of the overall international conservation \nefforts of the United States.\n  By establishing an interagency working group, a special coordinator, \nand a presidential advisory committee on global conservation, this bill \nsets up the infrastructure to coordinate the efforts of the various \nfederal agencies under a national strategy for international \nconservation. The bill identifies measurable goals, benchmarks, and \ntimeframes for long-term action in the area of global conservation.\n  As our nation continues to strengthen its participation in the global \ncommunity through conflict mitigation, foreign aid, and economic \ninteraction, it is essential that we promote strong international \nconservation initiatives focused on the involvement and support of \nlocal communities. Such initiatives will only strengthen global \nsecurity, health, and economies. This bill establishes a clear and \nunified direction for our international conservation efforts, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to move it through the \nlegislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr.  \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 3509. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to promote the \nresearch and development of technologies and best practices for the \nsafe development and extraction of natural gas and other petroleum \nresources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator \nShaheen and Chairman Bingaman in introducing a bill to help prevent \nfuture disasters like the one we are seeing unfold in the Gulf of \nMexico. Our bill focuses Federal oil and gas research and development \nfunds on well safety and accident prevention. There are many lessons to \nbe learned from this tragedy, but one of the most important is that we \nneed more advanced technology to prevent future accidents and ensure \nthe safety of our oil and gas workers.\n  This oil spill has highlighted many problems with the operation of \nthe oil and gas industry and the threat that accidents have to our \nfamilies, economy and environment. While the industry has opened up new \nareas to oil and gas production, developments in safety and well \ncontrol technology have not always kept pace. That is unacceptable. \nEleven people lost their lives during this tragedy, and we do not yet \nknow the full extent of the economic, health and environmental damage \nthat will be caused by the spill.\n  Unfortunately, out of control wells are not a unique circumstance. \nOver the last month, two major onshore incidents occurred as well. \nFirst, a gas well explosion in West Virginia injured seven workers and \nthen another occurred in Pennsylvania where it appears that a blowout \npreventer did not work properly.\n  It is clear that oil is and will continue to be an important energy \nsource for us for many years to come, especially for our transportation \nsector. But, while we will continue to drill for oil and gas, we cannot \nrepeat the mistakes, negligence or recklessness that led to this \ndisaster. We must learn from this accident and aggressively develop \nbetter technology to stop these spills from happening in the first \nplace, both onshore and offshore.\n  That is why I am introducing the Safer Oil and Gas Production \nResearch and Development Act. This bill would change an existing oil \nand gas research and development program within the Department of \nEnergy, DOE, to re-focus it specifically on technologies to improve the \nsafety of exploration and production activities, including well \nintegrity, well control, blowout prevention, and well plugging and \nabandonment.\n  In addition, the legislation would also require DOE to publish an \nannual update of the program's work and outline recommendations for the \nimplementation of its research findings. This oversight is important so \nthat we can ensure this information is public, transparent, and readily \navailable to entrepreneurs and others who could further develop these \ntechnologies.\n  I should emphasize that my bill is only one of the many steps we must \ntake to respond to this accident. Not only do we need to work to \nprevent future accidents, we need to make sure we are better prepared \nto respond when they occur.\n  It is unacceptable that the spill prevention and response technology \nwe are using today is the same as was used in the last disaster--the \nExxon Valdez spill in 1989, over 20 years ago. That is why I am a proud \nco-sponsor of Senator Shaheen's bill to create a new program at the \nDepartment of the Interior to research and develop spill response and \nmitigation technology. Her bill, which also is being introduced today, \nis a perfect complement to mine--both programs are needed to move our \noil drilling technology forward.\n  Our two bills will take common-sense steps to improve drilling \nsafety, prevent accidents and help ensure that if an accident does \noccur, we are better prepared to respond. This tragedy is a wake-up \ncall that proves that we need to begin changing the way we generate and \nconsume energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/17/senate-section/article/S5114-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5114-S5115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 560--RECOGNIZING THE IMMEASURABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \nFATHERS IN THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN, SUPPORTING RESPONSIBLE \nFATHERHOOD, AND ENCOURAGING GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF FATHERS IN THE LIVES \n             OF THEIR FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY ON FATHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Burris, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Casey, and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subpart to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 553.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.J. Res. 33, a joint \nresolution providing for the reconsideration and revision of the \nproposed Constitution of the U.S. Virgin Islands to correct provisions \ninconsistent with the Constitution and Federal law, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 33) to provide for the \n     reconsideration and revision of the proposed constitution of \n     the United States Virgin Islands to correct provisions \n     inconsistent with the Constitution and Federal law.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Virgin Islands is an \nunincorporated territory of the United States that was acquired from \nDenmark in 1917. It is one of only two United States territories which \ndoes not have a locally adopted constitution to provide for basic \ngovernmental organization and operations. Instead, the Virgin Islands \ngovernment operates under the Revised Organic Act of 1954, as amended, \na Federal law written by Congress (48 U.S.C. 1541-1645).\n  In 1976, to enhance local self-government, Congress enacted Public \nLaw 94-584, which, as amended, authorizes the people of the Virgin \nIslands to convene a constitutional convention and draft a \nconstitution. The law provides for two consecutive 60-day periods for \nPresidential and Congressional review. Upon receiving a proposed \nconstitution from the President, Congress may approve, modify, or amend \nthe document by joint resolution, but if Congress does not act within \nits 60 legislative day review period, then the constitution is deemed \napproved by Congress. If Congress approves the proposed constitution, \nor passes modifications or amendments, it then goes before the Virgin \nIslands voters to be accepted or rejected in a referendum. Since 1964, \nthe people of the Virgin Islands have attempted five times to write a \nconstitution, but previous efforts have been unsuccessful.\n  On December 31, 2009, the Governor of the Virgin Islands submitted a \nproposed constitution drafted by the Fifth Constitutional Convention to \nPresident Obama, and it was transmitted to Congress with administration \ncomments. The end of the 60 legislative day Congressional review period \nis June 30.\n  In his February 26, 2010, message to Congress, President Obama \nattached the proposed constitution and a memorandum of the Justice \nDepartment which noted that several features of the proposed \nconstitution warranted comment: 1, the absence of an express \nrecognition of United States sovereignty and the supremacy of Federal \nlaw; 2, provisions for a special election on the Virgin Islands \nterritorial status; 3, provisions conferring legal advantages on \ncertain groups defined by place and timing of birth, timing of \nresidency, or ancestry; 4, residence requirements for certain offices; \n5, provisions guaranteeing legislative representation of certain \ngeographic areas; 6, provisions addressing territorial waters and \nmarine resources; 7, imprecise language on certain provisions of the \nproposed constitution's bill of rights; 8, the possible need to repeal \nof certain Federal laws if the proposed United States Virgin Islands \nconstitution is adopted; and 9, the effect of congressional action or \ninaction on the proposed constitution. I refer you to the President's \nmessage and DOJ memorandum in the March 1, 2010, Congressional Record, \npage S856. Both in the memorandum and in testimony on May 19 before the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Justice \nDepartment recommended that ``the provisions conferring legal \nadvantages on certain groups defined by place and timing of birth, \ntiming of residency, or ancestry. . .'' Item 3 above--be removed from \nthe constitution and that consideration be given to shortening the \nresilence requirements for certain officers--item 4--and to revising \nthe provisions concerning territorial waters and marine resources--item \n6.\n  I am pleased to join with the ranking member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, in introducing this \nresolution to provide for the reconsideration and revision of the \nproposed constitution of the Virgin Islands to correct provisions that \nare inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution and Federal law. More \nspecifically, the resolution would\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\namend P.L. 94-584, as amended, to provide that Congress may urge the \nconvention to reconvene, but following reconsideration and revision of \nthe proposed constitution, it would not be sent back to Congress for \nreview. Instead, the U.S. President would have 60 calendar days to \nprovide administration comments to the Governor and Congress, and to \npublish those comments in the Federal Register. Then, the revised \nproposed constitution would be submitted to the voters for approval or \ndisapproval. If the Constitutional Convention fails to reconvene, or if \nthe convention fails to make revisions, then there will be no \nreferendum of approval or disapproval of the proposed constitution by \nthe voters of the Virgin Islands, and this process ends.\n  It is challenging for Congress to act within the 60 legislative day \nreview period as established by P.L. 94-584, as amended, ending June \n30. The approach taken in this resolution to respond to the Federal \nconcerns raised with the proposed constitution has been reached in \nconsultation with counsel for the Virgin Islands Convention, and with \nthe Delegate and Governor of the Virgin Islands. While there were \ndiffering views on how Congress should proceed, I appreciate the \ncooperation and commitment of all involved in working out this \nconsensus approach.\n  There are few more solemn duties in government than that of \ndeveloping and adopting a constitution. I commend the delegates to the \nVirgin Islands Constitutional Convention for their effort and their \ncommitment to this solemn duty. I also urge them to carefully consider \nthe issues raised by the President and Congress and to revise the \nproposed constitution by removing or amending those provisions that are \nin conflict with the U.S. Constitution.\n  For generations, the people of the Virgin Islands have been a part of \nthe United States political family and together we share allegiance to \nour Nation and to the principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. \nUnder this resolution, the delegates will have the choice of conforming \nthe proposed constitution to these shared principles or of endorsing \nthe conflicts between the proposed constitution and the U.S. \nConstitution. Endorsing these conflicts will most certainly result in \neither disapproval of the proposed constitution by the voters of the \nVirgin Islands, or years of litigation that will eventually strike down \nthese provisions. I urge the delegates to take this rare opportunity to \nbring closure to the process--to make the needed revisions and to be \nremembered for their leadership in bringing a constitution to the \npeople of the Virgin Islands.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Jeff \nBingaman, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, in introducing this Joint Resolution to urge the Fifth \nConstitutional Convention of the United States Virgin Islands to \nreconvene for the purpose of reconsidering and revising its proposed \nconstitution. Let me first commend the delegates of the Virgin Islands \nFifth Constitutional Convention for their hard work and efforts in \ndrafting and putting forward this proposed constitution. Their \ncommitment to resolving this issue and getting a constitution enacted \nfor the people of the United States Virgin Islands should be applauded.\n  The Chairman has clearly laid out the historical and legislative \nbackground of the United States' relationship with the U.S. Virgin \nIslands and the process for Congress to consider a proposed \nconstitution. He has also explained the concerns and issues expressed \nby the Administration about some provisions in the proposed \nconstitution and that under Public Law 94-584, the only options \navailable to Congress are to approve, amend, or revise the \nconstitution. Disapproval is not an option. Because time is short, \nCongress only has 60 legislative days to take action, it is unlikely we \nwill be able to reach an agreement on the proposed changes before June \n30, 2010, which is the end of the 60 legislative days. If Congress does \nnot act before then, the proposed constitution will be deemed approved \nwith no changes.\n  As a result, the Chairman and I are introducing this Joint Resolution \nto amend P.L. 94-584 to allow Congress to urge the constitutional \nconvention to reconvene. In accordance with this change to the law, the \njoint resolution urges the Fifth Constitutional Convention to reconvene \nfor the purpose of reconsidering and revising the proposed constitution \nin response to the concerns outlined by the executive branch. It is my \nunderstanding that should Congress pass this joint resolution, the 60 \nlegislative day clock will stop. It is also my understanding that \nshould this Joint Resolution be enacted, there are three courses of \naction for the Fifth Constitutional Convention: do not reconvene; \nreconvene but do not revise the proposed constitution; or reconvene and \nrevise the proposed constitution. If the convention were to choose not \nto reconvene, or to reconvene but not revise, then the process is dead, \nthere is no further consideration of the proposed constitution, and it \ndoes not go to the people of the Virgin Islands for a vote.\n  If, however, the convention reconvenes and does revise the proposed \nconstitution, then the revised proposed constitution would \nsimultaneously be submitted to the Governor of the Virgin Islands and \nthe President of the United States. The President would then have 60 \ncalendar days to notify the Convention, the Governor, and Congress of \nthe comments of the President on the revised proposed constitution, and \npublish the comments in the Federal Record. Once the comments have been \npublished in the Federal Record, the revised proposed constitution \nwould be submitted to the qualified voters of the U.S. Virgin Islands \nfor acceptance or rejection.\n  The delegates to the convention have the choice to bring the proposed \nconstitution in line with the U.S. Constitution and Federal statutes. \nIt is my preference to see the Convention reconvene and make these \nchanges themselves, rather than have the courts impose them through \nlitigation. This is the fifth attempt to establish a constitution for \nthe people of the U.S. Virgin Islands and I am hopeful that this \nattempt, with the necessary revisions, will be successful.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \njoint resolution be read a third time, passed; that the preamble be \nagreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en \nbloc; and that any statements related to the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 33) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. J. Res. 33\n\n       To provide for the reconsideration and revision of the \n     proposed constitution of the United States Virgin Islands to \n     correct provisions inconsistent with the Constitution and \n     Federal law.\n       Whereas Congress, recognizing the basic democratic \n     principle of government by the consent of the governed, \n     enacted Public Law 94-584 (94 Stat. 2899) authorizing the \n     people of the United States Virgin Islands to organize a \n     government pursuant to a constitution of their own adoption;\n       Whereas a proposed constitution to provide for local self-\n     government for the people of the United States Virgin Islands \n     was submitted by the President to Congress on March 1, 2010, \n     pursuant to Public Law 94-584;\n       Whereas Congress, pursuant to Public Law 94-584, after \n     receiving a proposed United States Virgin Islands \n     constitution from the President may approve, amend, or modify \n     the constitution by joint resolution, but the constitution \n     ``shall be deemed to have been approved'' if Congress takes \n     no action within ``sixty legislative days (not interrupted by \n     an adjournment sine die of the Congress) after its submission \n     by the President'';\n       Whereas in carrying out Public Law 94-584, the President \n     asked the Department of Justice, in consultation with the \n     Department of the Interior, to provide views on the proposed \n     constitution;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice concluded that several \n     features of the proposed constitution warrant analysis and \n     comment, including--\n       (1) the absence of an express recognition of United States \n     sovereignty and the supremacy of Federal law;\n       (2) provisions for a special election on the territorial \n     status of the United States Virgin Islands;\n       (3) provisions conferring legal advantages on certain \n     groups defined by place and timing of birth, timing of \n     residency, or ancestry;\n       (4) residence requirements for certain offices;\n       (5) provisions guaranteeing legislative representation of \n     certain geographic areas;\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\n       (6) provisions addressing territorial waters and marine \n     resources;\n       (7) imprecise language in certain provisions of the bill of \n     rights of the proposed constitution;\n       (8) the possible need to repeal certain Federal laws if the \n     proposed constitution of the United States Virgin Islands is \n     adopted; and\n       (9) the effect of congressional action or inaction on the \n     proposed constitution; and\n       Whereas Congress shares the concerns expressed by the \n     executive branch of the Federal Government on certain \n     features of the proposed constitution of the United States \n     Virgin Islands and shares the view that consideration should \n     be given to revising those features: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROPOSED CONSTITUTION FOR \n                   UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the commitment and efforts of the Fifth \n     Constitutional Convention of the United States Virgin Islands \n     to develop a proposed constitution; and\n       (2) urges the Fifth Constitutional Convention of the United \n     States Virgin Islands to reconvene for the purpose of \n     reconsidering and revising the proposed constitution in \n     response to the views of the executive branch of the Federal \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 2.
