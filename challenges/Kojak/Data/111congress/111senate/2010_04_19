Following leader remarks, the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 3 p.m. today, with Senators allowed to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each during that time. Following the closing of \nmorning business, the Senate will turn to executive session to debate \nthe nomination of Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury. \nAt 5 p.m. today, there will be a cloture vote on that nomination.\n  Last week, I filed cloture on five nominations. It is my hope we will \nbe able to work out time agreements on each of these nominations. If we \nare unable to do so, we will be in session around the clock until we \nhave votes on all these nominations, with speeches and votes taking \nplace during that time. Upon disposition of the nominations, we will \nturn to the legislation to reform Wall Street.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Holding these huge banks accountable for the enormous economic crisis \nof recent years is about more than dollars and cents. It is about \nfairness and justice. It is also about learning lessons from the \nmistakes of the past so we are not bound to repeat them.\n  Those who cared only to boost their own holdings and accounts must be \nheld accountable. To those who gamed the system, the game is over. Wall \nStreet's ability to recklessly risk a family's future must be a thing \nof the past. Those who dealt in deception and benefited from the cover \nof darkness\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nmust be called out and brought into the daylight. That is why the bill \nwe will bring to the floor includes the strongest protections ever \nagainst Wall Street greed. It will also give families more control than \never over their own finances and give consumers more clarity so they \ncan make the right financial decisions.\n  Our bill will not end taxpayer bailouts--that is what some say, but \nthe fact is, that is what it is all about. It will end taxpayer \nbailouts. It will hold Wall Street accountable for its excess and the \nharm it does and make sure banks fully disclose what they are betting \non and, for once, make it more clear what people are allowing these \nbanks to do.\n  Our bill creates an independent agency to protect consumers, and it \nstops banks from taking excessive risks with families' hard-earned \nsavings. We are cracking down on the subprime mortgage scams and \nforcing big banks and credit card companies to deal more honestly with \ntheir consumers.\n  It is a good bill. I support it because I support transparency, \naccountability, and economic security. Those opposed to it favor \nsecrecy, irresponsibility, and reckless risk taking. I am sure my \ncounterpart, the distinguished Republican leader, has some thoughts to \nshare on this reform as well.\n  When the Senate hears from him, I assume he will continue to make the \ncase, the very weak case he has made for the past week or so in the \nChamber and out over the airwaves. This bill is about accountability \nand honesty, so let's hold the legislators to the same standard when \nthey talk about it. Before my Republican friends repeat more false \nclaims, let's acknowledge some basic facts. The bill that will come on \nthe floor will protect taxpayers, will not leave taxpayers with the \ntab, as the other side pretends. This bill is not a bailout. \nRepublicans know that, although they refuse to say it, and the \nPresiding Officer has done remarkably good work in going toward that \nend.\n  After all, if this were such a good deal for Wall Street bankers, why \nare they lobbying so hard against it? This is a bipartisan product and \nincludes many Republican ideas that were proposed during months--I \nrepeat, months--of negotiations with Republican Senators. Chairman Dodd \nhas worked for months with Ranking Member Shelby and Senator Corker. \nSenator Dodd has led bipartisan working groups and held bipartisan \nmeetings. All these meetings produced solid, bipartisan ideas that will \nbe in the legislation we bring to the floor.\n  Last November, Senator Shelby said Democrats and Republicans agreed \non nearly 70 percent of the bill. Last month, Senator Shelby said \nnegotiators agreed on nearly 80 percent. Senator Corker said the \nnegotiations were constructive and said consensus is in sight.\n\n  So the Republican leadership's claim that this is a one-sided effort \ndoesn't pass the laugh test. This plan is not partisan, as the other \nside pretends. Republicans know that, although again they refuse to say \nit. They also refuse to admit whose side they are on. Earlier this \nmonth, the Republican leader and the head of the Republican Senate \nCampaign Committee went to Wall Street. They met with the bankers and \nhedge fund managers who benefited more than anyone from the broken \nsystem and, of course, are trying harder than any to stop us from \nfixing it; that is, the hedge fund managers and the bankers. So every \ntime Republicans make false claims, at this late stage of the process, \nthey are saying they want to protect their special interest friends on \nWall Street.\n  Rather than stand for taxpayers and shareholders, they want to stand \nwith the same bankers who cost 8 million American workers their jobs, \ndevastated so many families' economic security, and jeopardized our \nNation's economic stability. Every time Republicans repeat their tired \ntalking points, what they are saying is they want to stop reform.\n  The American people who bore the burden of Wall Street's greed \ncouldn't disagree more. We learned recently that the SEC is \ninvestigating Goldman-Sachs for its role in the financial meltdown. I \nam glad the Government is looking at Goldman and other firms involved \nin this disaster, but this is not just about executives or the traders. \nIt is not just about familiar faces and bold names. This is about our \nability to trust in the financial system. It is about families keeping \ntheir homes and knowing their savings will be safe. It is about right \nand wrong. Again, it is our job to get to the root of the problem. The \nculprits are shortsightedness and selfishness. They are greed, \ndeception, and irresponsibility. Wall Street looked out for only their \nimmediate, fleeting gain. So far, the same is guiding our Republican \ncolleagues. Wall Street adjourned itself with short-term success rather \nthan to think about what is right for our economy in the long run.\n  So far, Republicans in the Senate have shown they share that same \nconcern, that callous concern. Wall Street dealt in myths and \nmisinformation and with disregard for hard-working families. So far, \nRepublican Senators are following the same game plan. Wall Street sees \nno need to ensure this kind of crisis never happens again. So far, \nneither do our Republican friends. Wall Street ran wild because there \nwas no transparency.\n  The Senate Republican strategy has been transparent as can be; all \nthey want is to stop necessary reform in its tracks. I agree with Paul \nKrugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist, who last week called Republican \ntactics ``a shameless performance.''\n  We have seen them run these plays before on health care and other \nissues. They didn't work then and they will not work now. The system is \nbroken. Consumers need better protection, taxpayers need our guarantee \nthat they will never again be called on to bail out a big bank. That is \nplain to see. You can draw a straight line from the lax oversight and \nexcess greed on Wall Street to the collapse of the housing market on \nMain Street, throughout Nevada and across America. Here is the \ndifference. We want to change the rules. Republicans want to change the \nsubject.\n\n\n                         Executive Nominations\n\n  As I indicated, we now have five nominations before us. I wish I \ncould say Wall Street reform is the only arena in which Republicans are \nplaying partisan games, but that is not true. It is a matter of fact, \nnot opinion, that Democrats treated President Bush's nominations far \nbetter than Senate Republicans are treating President Obama's. In fact, \nno President has been treated such as President Obama has been treated \nas far as his nominations--no President.\n  President Obama has 99 administration nominees awaiting confirmation \nby the full Senate. At this point in President Bush's first term--take \nthat as an example--the Senate had confirmed all but five. We have \nconfirmed all but 99, 99 to 5. Many Americans have never heard these \nnominees' names before, but that doesn't make their jobs any less \ncritical to our country. This is about one party deciding government \nshould not work and deciding they should not have to work either. They \nare preventing people from going to work to make our country better. \nThey are outright abdicating their constitutional responsibility to \nconfirm or deny the President's nominees. Their decisions are grounded \nin reflexive partisanship, not principled argument. Republicans are \ntreating judicial nominees the same way. President Obama had 22 \njudicial nominees awaiting confirmation--22 are awaiting it right now. \nAt this point in President Bush's first term, the Senate had confirmed \nall but 7, 22 to 7. That means Republicans have stalled more judicial \nnominations than they have allowed us to vote on. Many of these \nnominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, many without dissent, \nhave been pending for months and months. Every time Republicans stand \nin the way of our judicial system's ability to do its job, the public \npays the price.\n  This is not how the Senate is meant to operate nor how it has \noperated in the past. This is unique. This is unprecedented and \nindefensible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2400-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to join the majority leader in \nrecognizing the 15th anniversary of the\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nOklahoma City bombing and add my voice to the others who have \nremembered the loss of life we suffered on that terrible day. I also \nextend my sympathy to the survivors and to the families of the lost.\n  It is impossible for most of us to understand how someone could \ncommit such a terrible act. It is impossible for most of us to \nappreciate the pain of losing a loved one to such a violent, senseless \nact. But we can try to console them and we can work tirelessly to \nprevent other terrorist acts against other innocent men and women, both \nhere and abroad.\n  So on this solemn anniversary, we resolve once again to fight \nterrorism wherever we find it and to never forget the people who have \nsuffered from it. We will never forget Oklahoma City or the people who \nlost their lives on that day.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. President, turning my attention to the financial services bill, \nas we know, it came out of the Banking Committee on a party-line vote, \nwithout any Republican support. So where are we? The debate over \nfinancial regulatory reform continues this week, so let me recap where \nwe are, the progress we are making, as well as some of the more \nunhelpful things we have seen.\n  Over the past year or so, Democrats and Republicans alike worked long \nand hard to construct a bill aimed at preventing the kind of financial \ncrisis we saw in the fall of 2008, and, just as crucially, to prevent \nany future bailouts of the biggest Wall Street firms. That was the \ngoal.\n  Progress was made. But then, in a rush to get the bill to the floor, \nthese talks stopped. So last week, I came to the floor to point out the \nflaws that resulted from this partisan approach.\n  One of the biggest of these was the creation of a $50 billion bailout \nfund. It seemed to me and many others that the very existence of this \nfund would perpetuate the same kind of risky behavior that led to the \nlast crisis.\n  On this point, there seemed to be fairly broad consensus, from Senate \nRepublicans to Secretary Geithner himself.\n  So the reaction I got was somewhat amusing.\n  Some of our friends on the other side raised voices of protest \nbecause I had spoken up about flaws in the bill. Others ginned up the \npress with some inside-Washington line about talking points and \npollsters. And over at the White House, the President criticized me in \nhis weekly radio address even as his deputies worked to strip the very \nprovision I had called into question a few days before.\n  Well, they cannot have it both ways.\n  So my advice at the beginning of this week is that we focus not on \npersonal attacks or questioning each other's motives but on fixing the \nproblems in this bill, and that means doing everything we can to make \nsure the final product doesn't allow for future Wall Street bailouts.\n  Both parties agree on this point: no bailouts. In my view, that is a \npretty good start. So let us come together and direct our energies \ntoward making sure we achieve that goal and leave aside all the name-\ncalling and the second-guessing.\n  What last week showed me is that we have two options as this debate \nmoves forward: either we let the people who know this legislation best \nget back to the negotiating table and work out a solution that is \nacceptable to both parties and to the American people, or, I can come \ndown to the floor, identify some of the other flaws in this bill, watch \nas people come down to scream and yell about my suggestions and my \nmotives, and then wait for the White House to agree with me at the end \nof the week.\n  I am perfectly happy to do the latter if it means we get a better \nbill in the end. But it seems to me that a far more efficient way of \nproceeding is to just skip the character attacks on anyone who dares to \npoint out flaws with the bill, be they provisions that expose taxpayers \nto Wall Street bailouts or those that would further worsen the jobs \nsituation, and work out these problems now. Forget the theatrics, and \nget to work.\n  Again, I am happy to come down and identify additional problems. I \ncould mention, for instance, my worry that the current bill could dry \nup credit even more for small businesses and community banks. The \nexperts know that this and other problems exist in the bill. If the \nadministration wants to continue to pretend that it does not, then you \nwill see me down here every day. But my preference would be to let the \nexperts work through these problems on a bipartisan basis.\n  So let us go back to the negotiating table and work out these \nproblems, and then come together and have a bipartisan vote that will \ngive the American people confidence that this bil is not just one \nparty's way of solving this problem. These problems are not \ninsurmountable. This bill is not unfixable. We can reform Wall Street \nwithout making taxpayers pick up the tab. Let us do that, then give the \nAmerican people a strong bipartisan bill that an issue like this \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2401-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

However, to paraphrase George Orwell, \nsome people are more equal than others.\n  More specifically, several recent Presidential nominees have \napparently set themselves above the typical American citizen in the \nlack of importance they place on complying with their tax obligations. \nThis certainly seems to be the case with Dr. Brainard, nominated to be \nUnder Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.\n  As a nominee, Dr. Brainard was treated the same as any other nominee \nto come through the Finance Committee in the 9 years I have been either \nchairman or ranking member. For the past 9 years, and likely much \nlonger, the Finance Committee has vetted all Presidential nominees \nreferred to the committee, and that vetting includes a tax review. The \ntax review of Dr. Brainard uncovered three basic issues. These issues \nhave been described in much detail in a bipartisan Finance Committee \nmemo released November 18, 2009. I also discussed them in a statement \nthat was printed in the Congressional Record December 23 of last year.\n  Those seeking to criticize the Finance Committee's vetting process \nare quick to mention the length of time Dr. Brainard has been a \nnominee. She was nominated March 23, 2009, and her hearing was held on \nNovember 20, 2009. The reason for the passage of nearly 8 months was \nthat the nominee persisted in being evasive and nonresponsive to very \nbasic questions arising from the routine review of tax returns. There \nare still questions that were not clearly or consistently answered \ndespite multiple rounds of questions. Other questions necessitated \nmultiple answers as new information came to light.\n  For example, the committee learned on October 12, 2009, nearly 7 \nmonths after the nomination, that the nominee failed to timely pay 2008 \nproperty taxes for Rappahannock County, VA, and that the nominee was \ndelinquent while the tax vetting was going on. I have said this before. \nBut the reason the review of Dr. Brainard took several months was that \nshe was not forthcoming in her answers. As the committee memo details, \nsome of her answers contradicted each other.\n  I ask those who are critical of the committee's treatment of this \nnominee if there are some things it is okay to be evasive about to the \nCongress of the United States. Is there a point where Congress should \naccept vague and unclear statements and decide it is not some sort of \nbig deal?\n  Supporters of the nominee find themselves in the position of having \nto distort the facts in order to make their case. They say Dr. \nBrainard's tax problems involved small amounts of money and some \nmistakes, such as late payment of property taxes, and it could happen \nto anyone. While these statements may be true, they do not deal with \nthe nominee's real problem which, as I have said, is her unwillingness \nto fully and completely answer questions from the Finance Committee.\n  The Finance Committee's vetting process has uncovered tax \nirregularities with many past and current Presidential appointees. What \nthe committee requires is that the nominee acknowledge and fix these \nirregularities.\n  Unless these tax issues involve substantial dollar amounts, or there \nis information suggesting the nominee deliberately avoided fulfilling \ntheir tax liabilities, this information is not made public and the \nnominee is allowed to move forward. The Finance Committee is not trying \nto embarrass people for making simple mistakes, and neither the \ncommittee nor this Senator benefits from a lengthy vetting process.\n  In the case of nominees where difficulties arise to the point where \nour committee must release information publicly, the committee \ncompletes its review so that all information is released all at once \nand the nominee is allowed to review information to be released by the \ncommittee before the committee ever would release it, so that the \nnominee would know exactly where we are coming from.\n  Dr. Brainard was allowed to review the Finance Committee memo before \nit was released, and if she had withdrawn her nomination, that \ninformation would have remained confidential. It would not have been \nout there for anybody to know anything about. But we are moving forward \nwith this nomination; hence, any sort of information is public.\n  Dr. Brainard is the third senior Treasury Department nominee either \nthe Finance Committee or this Senator has taken issue with. Secretary \nGeithner's failure to pay his self-employment taxes as an International \nMonetary Fund employee is well known.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Jeffrey Goldstein was recess-appointed to the \npost of Under Secretary for Domestic Finance. While I do not believe \nDr. Goldstein failed to satisfy his tax liabilities, I do have \nquestions regarding offshore activities a private equity fund engaged \nin while Dr. Goldstein was a managing director.\n  I was in the process of asking more questions as to the business \npurpose of these activities and was prepared to let the nominee advance \ntoward confirmation once these questions were answered. Dr. Goldstein \nwas absolved of the need to respond to my questions by the recess \nappointment made under law by President Obama. Dr. Brainard and \nSecretary Geithner both had personal issues the committee released \ninformation on in a bipartisan way, and I have unresolved questions \nregarding offshore activities engaged in by Dr. Goldstein's previous \nemployer.\n  As concerned as I am with the issues involving this specific nominee, \nI am even more concerned by the reaction by some to the information \nreleased by the Finance Committee on this and other recent nominees.\n  Dr. Brainard was the fifth nominee of the current administration to \nrun into personal tax issues during the Finance Committee's vetting \nprocess. With the exception of one nominee, who voluntarily withdrew \nhis nomination, all of these nominees were confirmed, or will be \nconfirmed, as I expect Dr. Brainard to be confirmed. It is not clear \nthat the Finance Committee vetting of nominees has served a useful \npurpose and information released by the Finance Committee on \nproblematic issues surrounding nominees doesn't seem to have decreased \nsupport for their confirmations.\n  I am not saying that every nominee who runs into trouble should be \nautomatically rejected. I myself voted for one of the five nominees I \njust mentioned. However, it does not appear that the information \nreleased by the committee on nominees in this current Congress is given \nmuch consideration.\n  The issues involving Dr. Brainard should have no bearing on political \nparties, issue positions, or who is friends with whom. The only basic \nissues should be that everyone needs to pay their taxes as required by \nlaw, and the nominee should be fully responsive to the Congress. In \nlooking at the first of these issues, the nominee showed that she was \ndeficient in the second. For the reasons I have laid out here and in \nearlier statements, I will vote against this nominee.\n  However, I do plan to vote for cloture, and I want to explain that. \nDespite my own opposition to the nominee, I don't want to prevent other \nSenators from considering the nominee, and I am not attempting to \nprevent the nominee from receiving an up-or-down vote.\n  I hope other Senators consider the information the Finance Committee \nhas released and will consider what I have said and will come to their \nown decision as to which way to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are in executive session, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have the Executive Calendar of the \nSenate in front of me. It is on every desk. It has the pending \nnominations that have yet to be acted upon by the Senate.\n  I note that there are a large number of nominations that have been \nmade on which there are holds. There is delay, there is stalling, and \nyou wonder--here is a May 20, 2009 nomination, reported\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nout of the Homeland Security Committee of Marisa Dameo, of the District \nof Columbia, to be an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia. That was reported out in May of last year.\n  Here is one for John Sullivan, of Maryland, to be a member of the \nFederal Elections Commission, which was reported out last June and is \nstill pending.\n  Here is one for Stuart Gordon, to be an Associate Judge of the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia, which was reported out on \nJuly 29 of last year and is still pending.\n  I am going to read a rather lengthy list in a bit. These are \nnominations that have been stalled, delayed, held up. There are, I \nthink, nearly 100 of them on the Executive Calendar, which is on \neveryone's desk.\n  I specifically want to talk about one, and then I am going to \npropound a unanimous consent request. The one is about GEN Michael \nWalsh. I know General Walsh. I have known him for a long time. He is \nthe commander of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of \nEngineers. He has been to war for his country. He is a one-star \ngeneral. He served 30 years in uniform for this country.\n  He has been nominated to receive his second star to be a major \ngeneral. That request to receive a second star for General Walsh went \nthrough the relevant committee, the Armed Services Committee of the \nSenate, chaired by Senator Levin, and the ranking member is Senator \nMcCain. The nomination was unanimously reported out by the committee, \nby all Republicans and all Democrats. It is a nomination supported by \nSenator Levin and Senator McCain, the chairman and the ranking member. \nYet that nomination was sent to the floor of the Senate nearly 6 months \nago and has yet to be acted upon because there is a hold on it.\n  I have spoken on this issue before--last week. We have a Member of \nthe Senate who has said to the Corps of Engineers: I am going to stop \nthis general's promotion to major general until the Corps of Engineers \ndoes the following things that I demand from the Corps of Engineers in \nmy home State of Louisiana. This is Senator Vitter from Louisiana.\n  I did say to Senator Vitter--I would not come and speak of another \nSenator without first telling him I was going to do that. I told \nSenator Vitter I was going to be critical on the floor of the Senate of \nwhat he was doing to General Walsh--a patriot, someone who has served \n30 years for his country in the U.S. Army, someone who has gone to war \nfor his country, someone who has had a unanimous vote in the Armed \nServices Committee to become major general.\n  After all of these months, his promotion has not yet moved. Why? \nBecause of one U.S. Senator demanding something this general cannot do. \nThis general executes policy; he does not make policy. The demands by \nSenator Vitter in two letters that he has sent to the Corps and the \nresponse from the Corps of Engineers are four letters I put in the \nSenate Record last week.\n  It is unbelievable that the career of a distinguished general in the \nU.S. Army is handled this way by one Member of the Senate. It is unfair \nto him. It is unfair to the Army, in my judgment. And it is the last \nthing in the world we ought to be doing--singling out one person and \nputting their career and their advancement on hold, prohibiting this \none-star general from receiving a second star because one person in the \nSenate is demanding the agency for which this general works do things \nthat the agency says it cannot do in any event.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent, and then I want to say a few \nmore words about it.\n\n\n      Unanimous Consent Request--Nomination of BG Michael J. Walsh\n\n  I ask unanimous consent--and I have notified the minority--that the \nSenate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 526, the nomination of BG \nMichael J. Walsh to be major general; that the nomination be confirmed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that no further \nmotions be in order; and that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to make very clear that I do not \noppose this nominee, and I say to Senator Dorgan that I have no problem \nwith what he is doing. I have been asked on the part of Senator Vitter \nto object, so I must object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Iowa is \nacting on behalf of another Senator. I must say I think it is incumbent \non the other Senator to be here and make this objection himself. I know \nthe rules do not require that, but I think the rules at this point are \nderelict in terms of this circumstance.\n  We have a general in the U.S. Army who has served this country well \nwhose career is now on hold. It is on hold because one person is \ndemanding that the Corps of Engineers do certain projects for New \nOrleans and the State of Louisiana. In any event, this general cannot \ndo them.\n  I chair the subcommittee that funds the energy and the water \nprograms. As the chairman of the subcommittee that funds all of the \nwater programs, I can tell the Presiding Officer that billions and \nbillions of dollars have been sent to Louisiana and to New Orleans. I \nhave supported all of that because they were hit with a devastating \nhurricane called Katrina. It caused dramatic injury to life and limb. \nNo area of the country has been hit harder.\n  I include myself among all of those who say we have a responsibility \nand have begun to meet that responsibility in the most significant way \nthat has been done for any State in this Nation at any time. I have \nbeen proud to do that. But what the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, \nis demanding from the Corps of Engineers in a number of cases the Corps \ncannot legally do and in other cases the Corps will not do because the \nAppropriations Committee has already voted against it in a recorded \nvote.\n  To hold up the nomination to major general of a distinguished Army \ngeneral for all of these months because one Senator is upset is \nhorribly unfair to this general, Michael Walsh. I know him. I like him. \nHe deserves his second star. The Armed Services Committee unanimously \nhas said he deserves a second star. He does not have it. Now many \nmonths later, month after month, one Member of this Senate, Senator \nVitter, has decided to extract from the career of this officer some \npenalty because he will not do something he cannot do. It is \nunbelievable to me.\n  I say to my colleague, if he wishes to object, I will come tomorrow. \nI will set a time. I wish he would come to the floor and object to my \nrequest and tell us why he believes this general can do that which the \ngeneral does not have the authority to do. If he finally understands \nthat this general cannot do what Senator Vitter wishes him to do, I \nhope Senator Vitter will stand aside and decide not to interrupt the \nfine career of this great military general.\n  I will not speak more about this, but I will come to the floor \ntomorrow, and I will notify his office when I am going to be here. I \nhope perhaps he will not have others come and object for him. Perhaps \nhe would bother to come to the floor and explain to this general, \nexplain to the U.S. Army and the American people why this general, \nhaving served 30 years and served in wartime, is not able to get his \nsecond star and has had to wait month after month and more. It is \nunfair, it is wrong, and it needs to be corrected.\n  Let me again say that I believe 93 to 100--I am not sure of the \nnumber today; last week, it was 93; all of these nominations: Winslow \nLorenzo Sargeant to be Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration, reported out of the committee on September 16 last \nyear, not acted on; Brian Hayes, National Labor Relations Board, \nreported out October 21 last year--the list goes on and on.\n  I guess it is a strategy--not just on this but virtually on \neverything--to object. In fact, there was one person on this list who \nis coincidentally from my State. That person was a nominee for the \nGeneral Services Administration. Her name was Martha Johnson. Martha \nJohnson was nominated to be the head of GSA. GSA is the Federal agency \nthat manages more property than any agency in the world. It manages all \nof\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nthe Federal property. One Senator put a hold on Martha Johnson's \nnomination. The result was there was not someone to run the General \nServices Administration for almost a year; I believe it was 10 months. \nThen, when we finally invoked cloture after great length, the vote on \nthis nomination was 96 to 0. Not even the person who put the hold on \nfor almost a year voted no. Everybody voted yes. The result was a \nFederal agency that desperately needed leadership did not have \nleadership for almost a year. Why? Because one Senator said: I am going \nto put a hold on this nomination because of some building someplace. \nThey were upset about something. The result is that everybody pays. All \nthe American taxpayers pay because we did not have the leadership in an \nagency that desperately needed the leadership. That is just an example.\n  It has been so unbelievably disappointing to see what is going on in \nthe Chamber with all of these issues. I am almost inclined to think we \nshould go through one by one and have 93 unanimous consent requests. \nPerhaps I will do that tomorrow or the next day. I know others will as \nwell.\n  I guess if you object to everything, including having government work \nthe way it is supposed to work, effectively and efficiently on behalf \nof the taxpayers in these agencies that need leadership--I do not quite \nunderstand why you come to the Senate if you believe the only answer is \nno. It does not need to be someone who decides the only answer is no in \nevery circumstance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning I was looking at something I \nhave had on my desk for a long while. I was thinking about words and \nwords that matter because there have been a lot of words recently about \nthe issue of financial reform or Wall Street reform, how it is done, \nwhen it is done, whether it is done. I was thinking about the use of \nwords and that words do not mean what they used to mean.\n  I went back, because I have kept this on my desk for a long time, to \nsomething that was sent out widely across the country. It was from \nsomething called GOPAC. It was kind of the start or at least the \ngenesis of the collapse of comity and the use of good language and so \non. This was sent out widely around the country to several thousand \npeople. It said: We have heard all these candidates across the country \nsay: I wish I could speak like Newt--meaning Newt Gingrich. I wish I \ncould speak like Newt.\n  Then it said in the language that it sent out to people: You can \nspeak like Newt Gingrich. It said: We have actually done a lot of work \ndeveloping polling on contrasting words, and if you would like to speak \nlike Newt Gingrich, here is some help for you.\n  Here are words. Then they sent this out. It says:\n\n       Apply these words to your opponent, to their record, to \n     their proposals, their party.\n\n  They have a long list of words: sick, lie, betray, traitors, \npathetic, threaten, corruption, punish, corrupt, cheat, steal, abuse of \npower. Use these words when you describe your opponents.\n  They said: Here are the positive words you should use when you talk \nabout yourself: pro-flag, pro-children, pro-environment, liberty, \nprincipal, pioneer, truth, moral, courage, family. And the list goes \non.\n  I thought when I received this a long while ago how unbelievably \npathetic it was that there were merchants of destructive politics \nmarketing this trash around the country. Yet they were and have for a \nlong time. It is the case that they use pollsters to do this, to tell \neveryone what kinds of words exist that will motivate both negatively \nand describe your opponents--sick, pathetic, lie, betray--and what \nwords would positively motivate your supporters. I was thinking about \nthat, and I dug that out just because in recent days and weeks we have \nseen examples of language that matters and instructions by people of \nhow to use language, even though it does not apply, to describe your \nposition.\n  I was interested in seeing the results of a pollster who described \nthe way to attack financial reform. Again, it was not in the same way \nof the GOPAC polling to find the most destructive way you could \ndescribe something, but it was similar in the sense of, how would you \nconstruct something, notwithstanding the facts--how would you construct \nsomething to make an impression about something no matter what the \nfacts might be.\n  This is from some polling work that was done. It says:\n\n       Frankly, the single best way to kill any legislation is to \n     link it to the big bank bailout.\n\n  The words that would matter are these: No matter what the \ncircumstances are, the single best way to kill any legislation is to \nlink it to the big bank bailout. Words that work: ``taxpayer-funded \nbailouts,'' ``reward bad behavior,'' ``taxpayers should not be held \nresponsible,'' ``if a business is going to fail, no matter how big, let \nit fail.'' If these words sound familiar, it is because you have heard \nthem all on the floor of the Senate in recent days and you have heard \nthem on television a lot in recent days. It is the issue of, how do you \ndevelop language that motivates people, notwithstanding the set of \nfacts.\n  ``It is not reform''--again quoting from the polling work--``it's the \nstop big bank bailout bill.'' That is important. This is not a reform \nbill; it is to stop the big bank bailout.\n  What we have here is the battle of polling. How can you describe \nwords that work, language that works, notwithstanding the set of facts \nyou might be discussing?\n  Ultimately, if we are going to effectively deal with Wall Street \nreform, reforming our financial system, it is not going to be with a \nbattle of pollsters; it is not going to be regurgitating what one \nreads--here is how you motivate someone using these words. It is going \nto be that we think through what happened and then understand what do \nwe do to make sure this cannot and does not happen again.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the need for bipartisanship. I would love \nto see that. I would love to see bipartisanship on specifically the \nkinds of remedies that have teeth, that are effective, and that are \ngoing to prohibit that which has happened to this country from ever \nhappening again. That will not be done, in my judgment, by deciding to \nstep back a ways and use a light touch. I am for the right touch; I am \nnot for a light touch. I have seen the light touch for a decade now, or \nat least a substantial portion of the last decade.\n  We have had agencies, the SEC, and others in a deep Rip Van Winkle \nsleep. In fact, we had people come to the SEC who noticed what some \nfolks were doing to bilk taxpayers and investors and nobody did \nanything. I was here when new regulators came to town and said: You \nknow what. We are going to be willfully blind for a while. It is a new \nday.\n  The fact is, regulation is not a four-letter word. The free market \nsystem works, but it works when there is a referee. The referees with \nthe striped shirts and whistles are needed to call the fouls because \nthere are fouls from time to time in the free market system. That is \nwhy we have regulatory capability and authority.\n  So the question of what kind of financial reform or Wall Street \nreform is developed is not going to be about the language of financial \nreform--which is what this is about, a document that has been \ndistributed and that I heard quoted many times now in recent days. It \nis not going to be about the language but about the specific set of \npolicies that will prevent what happened to this country from ever \nhappening again.\n  I will come and talk about some of that, but I did want to say I was \nthinking about the issue of the use of words, and I find it pretty \ninteresting to listen to the use of specific words and to listen to the \nmenu of the language of financial reform that comes from the pollsters \nand then comes straight out of the mouths of others very quickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota, \nbecause I, too, for what it is worth, have been very distressed about \nthe conversations around financial reform. I don't think either side of \nthe aisle deserves a badge of honor as it relates to the way this has \nbeen discussed. I agree with him that this is something way beyond \nusing poll-tested language and should, in fact, be dealt with in a \nserious manner. So although I didn't hear all the Senator's comments, I \nagree with him that we ought to deal with this in a serious way.\n  Mr. President, you and I have had a number of conversations over the \nlast weekend regarding financial reform. We have had a lot of \nconversations over the last year regarding financial reform. As I have \nwatched the public discussions over the last several days, I have been \ngreatly distressed. As a matter of fact, I spoke this morning to a \nlarge number of businessmen in Nashville, TN, and, candidly, became so \nangry thinking about the way this debate has evolved that I had to \nthink about coming here today and controlling that and using that in a \nproductive way.\n  I have noticed throughout the day that maybe the rhetoric has changed \na little, and I know that my friend and colleague from Virginia and my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut had a press conference earlier \ntoday to talk about some of the issues that are being talked about \nrhetorically. Let's face it, what is happening right now--and it is \nunfortunate for the American people--is that both sides of the aisle \nare trying to herd up folks with language that in many ways I don't \nthink does justice to this issue, which is very important, is very \ndifficult, and something that is very much needed in our country.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about this funding mechanism--this \n$50 billion bailout fund, if you will. Those are someone else's words, \nby the way, not mine. The American people are probably tuning in, and \nin some cases they are wondering how we are jumping into the middle of \nthis on the Senate floor without a lot of free dialogue.\n  The fact is, we have a financial reg bill that I hope comes before us \nsoon that will deal with orderly liquidation so that when a large \ninstitution fails, it actually fails. I think that is what the American \npeople would like to see happen. So there has to be a mechanism in \nplace.\n  If a firm is systematically important to our country, there needs to \nbe the tools in place to make sure it actually goes out of business. I \ndon't think people in Tennessee like seeing that when a community bank \nfails it actually goes out of business, but when a large Wall Street \nfirm fails we prop it up.\n  I wish the Senator from Virginia, who happens to be presiding, were \non the floor so we could have a colloquy on this because the fact is, \nthis is something that needs to be dealt with in legislation. We need \nto know we have a process where we deal with derivatives and we don't \nhave a lot of people building up a lot of bad money, instead of doing \nit on a daily basis and they end up in a situation where there are huge \nobligations. We need to deal with some of the issues of consumer \nprotection.\n  So, Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion about how we \ncreate something called debtor-in-possession financing, so that when \nthe FDIC comes in and seizes one of these large firms that fails, it \nhas the money to keep the lights on and to make payroll and those kinds \nof things while it is selling off the assets of the firm.\n  The fund that has been discussed in this bill--and that is going to \nbe changed, I know, and I am fine with that and think that is perfectly \ngood--but this fund that has been set up is anything but a bailout. It \nhas been set up in essence to provide upfront funding by the industry \nso that when these companies are seized, there is money available to \nmake payroll and to wind it down while the pieces are being sold off.\n  Now, a lot of people have said this is a Republican idea. There is no \nquestion this is something that Sheila Bair has proposed. The FDIC \nwants to see a prefund. The Treasury would like to see a postfund; they \nwould like to see it come after the fact.\n  At this point I want to digress for one second and say I hope the \nreason that Treasury wants a postfund is not because, in lieu of having \na prefund of $50 billion from these large institutions, they want to \nsee a bank taxed. As a matter of fact, I am going to be surprised if \nafter Republicans argue against a prefund and it is changed, and the \nadministration comes back and Chairman Dodd comes back and we end up \nwith postfunding--both of which do the same thing, I might add, and \nboth of them work--but it will be interesting to see whether that \nargument basically leads to Treasury then having the ability to come \nback and do a bank tax. I think at the end of the day that is something \nthey have been wanting to achieve.\n  So it is interesting how this debate is evolving. But let me go back \nto this prefund. At the end of the day, I think what all of us would \nlike to see happen is to see these institutions go out of business. So \ndo we put the money upfront to take them out of business or do we put \nit up on the back end where, in essence, what is happening is we are \nborrowing money from the taxpayers?\n  Would we rather the industry put up the money so the taxpayers are \nnot at risk or would we rather that not happen and during a downtime, \nwhen it is procyclical, we actually get the firms to put up the money \nafter the fact?\n  I think both of those, by the way, are nice arguments to have, and I \nthink they should have been debated in the committee, and we can debate \nit on the Senate floor. But at the end of the day, to make the total \ndebate about whether it is pre or post--neither of which are central to \nthe argument because both work--it really doesn't matter. Either way we \nhave to have some moneys available as working capital to shut down a \nfirm. We can borrow it from the taxpayers, although I don't know if the \ntaxpayers would like that very much. We can do it after the fact, as I \nhave said, or we can put it in upfront by the industry. Either way it \nis going to be paid back by industry.\n\n  I will say that in the Dodd bill today there is postfunding; that if \nthere are any shortfalls the industry will pay that back. So, again, it \nis kind of a debate that ends up being silly. The fact is, I know it is \ngoing to be changed. The essence of the bill, though, is the fact that \nwe want to make sure these firms unwind and they go out of business.\n  Let me just talk about some of the arguments that are being made: \nPrefunding of resolution creates a system where certain participants \nare effectively designated as a protected class as a result of them \npaying into the fund.\n  I think that is ludicrous. That is a ludicrous argument. Now, what we \ncould do, if it would make everybody happy, is instead of getting large \nfirms to pay, we could get community banks to pay too. I don't think \nthere would be many people who would be interested in that, but if we \nwant to get everybody in the country and get the community banks in \nTennessee--I am not interested in that, and I don't think the Senator \nfrom Virginia is interested in that--but if we want to do that, we can \nensure nobody is part of the protected class. So I find that to be a \nludicrous argument.\n  There is another argument: This allows such firms competitive funding \nadvantage over smaller institutions such as community banks.\n  So, in other words, if we are saying these large firms, if they fail, \nare going to go out of business, and it is going to be more painful \nthan bankruptcy, that somehow they are protected or have a competitive \nadvantage, I find that to be kind of ludicrous, and I hope that \nargument is not used again. It probably will be, but I hope it would \nnot.\n  Here is one I read recently: The fund is a signal to credit markets \nthat the U.S. Government stands ready to prop up, bail out, and \ninsulate large financial firms. Now that is an interesting one. The \nfact is, we are talking about orderly liquidation.\n  The existence of the fund allows managers of large financial \ninstitutions to conduct riskier practices, therefore counterparties \nwill not feel obliged to perform due diligence because, in the event of \nstress, there is such a financial slush fund available to bail out \nunsecured and short-term creditors.\n  You have to be kidding me. That is absolutely the opposite of what is \nintended.\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n  Now, let me say this before somebody tunes out. I think this bill has \nproblems, and I think there are issues that need to be resolved around \norderly liquidation. The Senator from Virginia and I both know what \nthey are, and there are some flexibilities that have been granted to \nthe FDIC, to the Federal Reserve, and others that need to be tightened. \nThere are some words that instead of saying ``shall'' say ``may.'' That \nis a very important word when you are telling an agency what they have \nto do or what they ``may'' do. So there is much in this bill that needs \nto be fixed.\n  I want to say that as the Dodd bill sits today, I could not vote for \nit. I absolutely cannot support the bill. But what concerns me is the \nrhetoric that is being used to talk about something that is very \nimportant to our country, and it is being used on both sides, I might \nadd.\n  On one side they are saying the Republicans want to protect Wall \nStreet firms. Well, I can tell you this: I think there are very few \nRepublicans who do not want to see financial regulation take place. I \nthink there are very few Republicans who don't want to see it done the \nright way. Candidly, I think most Republicans and Democrats are \nlistening to community bankers. They are not listening to Wall Street. \nThat would be my guess.\n  So that rhetoric, to me, is off base. The rhetoric on my side of the \naisle saying this orderly liquidation title basically keeps ``too big \nto fail'' in place, the central pieces of it, is not true. Are there \nsome things around the edges that need to be fixed? Yes. My sense is, \nas I have said on the Senate floor, we can fix those in about 5 minutes \nif we just sit down and do it. I do not understand why the rhetoric has \ngotten to where it is. I would like to see us pass a bill that makes \nsense.\n\n  The kind of thing we should be talking about is not the fact that \nthis is a bailout fund. By the way, whether it is ``pre'' or ``post,'' \nthat debate doesn't matter to me. The fact is, we have to have some \ndebtor-in-possession financing available to wind these firms down, sell \noff the assets, make sure the stockholders are absolute toast, make \nsure unsecured creditors are toast, make sure it is so painful that \nnobody ever wants to go through this. We absolutely need to do that. \nThe American people need to know we in Congress are not going to prop \nup a failed institution, that they are going to live the same life in \ncapitalism that everybody else has to live. People in Tennessee, when \nthey fail, they fail.\n  The kind of thing we ought to be talking about and have been talking \nabout and I think can solve is that I think we ought to have more \njudicial involvement in the process. We ought to improve the bankruptcy \nprocess so that these large institutions have a more viable route \nthrough bankruptcy.\n  I think we ought to deal with the disparate treatment of similarly \nsituated creditors. The fact is, the way the ``post'' funding in this \nbill is now set up, we do not. If a creditor receives more money than \nthey should, that money is not recouped. We know how to fix that. I \nknow the Senator from Virginia and I both know how to fix that.\n  Those are the kinds of things we need to be talking about.\n  Creditor prioritization--there is no question that right now in the \nbill, certain creditors can be treated differently by the FDIC than \nothers.\n  We need to be looking at bankruptcy stacks so that people understand \nhow much they are going to be paid back, and they are going to be in \nthe same order they anticipate being in.\n  We need to be tightening the definition of a financial firm. Right \nnow in the bill, the way it reads, an auto company could end up being \npart of this. Right now, it is not tight enough. An auto company may be \na stretch, but something other than a financial firm could be dealt \nwith, the way the language is now reading. And certainly for sure \nFannie and Freddie need to be treated the same as any other financial \nfirm.\n  We need to have a solvency test to make sure regulators--that does \nnot allow regulators the flexibility to protect firms in crisis.\n  We need to make sure there is a duration. In other words, if the FDIC \ncomes in and has to take over, after due process--three keys being \nturned--take over one of these firms that has posed systemic risk, we \nneed to know there is an end date. I know the Senator from Virginia and \nI absolutely agree that conservatorship should not be on the table. \nThis is only a receivership and those firms should go out of business, \nand that, no doubt, should be language added. It is not in there right \nnow.\n  There are a number of things like this. I could go on and on. I am \nprobably boring much of the watching audience, if there is any, with \nsome of these technical issues, but those are the kinds of things we in \nthis body ought to be talking about. They are important. They matter. \nBut to use up time with rhetoric that, in essence, is used to sort of \nbrand something in a way that really isn't the way it is, to me, is not \nproductive. I did not come here to do that.\n  Again, I think both sides of the aisle tried to cast the characters \nin certain ways. It is this herd process that happens around here. \nEverybody wants to get everybody on the same team. What we do is we use \nrhetoric that charges people up and gets everybody on the same team. I \ndo not like that process. I do not want to be a part of that process.\n  I have joined with other Republicans to try to make sure this bill \ngets in the middle of the road. I have done that on the basis that both \nsides are going to deal in good faith.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia knows we went through a process with \nthis bill where we voted it out of committee in 21 minutes--a 1,336-\npage bill we voted out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments. \nThe stated goal was to make sure that both sides did not harden against \neach other and that we could negotiate a bill before it came to the \nfloor--came to the floor--we would negotiate a bipartisan bill. That is \nwhy it was stated that we did that. How can responsible Senators, 23 \nSenators, all of whom have problems with this bill--how can you vote \nsomething out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments unless you \nknow that a negotiation process is going to take place afterward to \ncreate a bipartisan bill? Nobody in their right mind would have agreed \nto do that.\n  What I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle and \nwhat I would say to the folks at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, \nwho seem to be turning up the rhetoric--I take it as a commitment from \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle that we are going to \nnegotiate a bipartisan bill and we are going to do it in good faith. \nBut I also expect the same on my side of the aisle, that we are going \nto negotiate in good faith to get a bill and that before it comes to \nthe floor the major template pieces will be worked out, the issues \naround consumers, the issues around orderly liquidation, and the issues \naround consumer protection.\n  As I have mentioned, there are a number of issues we need to debate \nhere on the floor that, to me, are outside the realm of the template \nitself. I hope this body--I know the Senator from Virginia and I have \nworked together a great deal. I know we both came from a world that was \ndifferent from this. I have become greatly distressed. I get distressed \nat both sides of the aisle when we have an important issue such as this \nand we turn it into sound bites.\n  I hope, again, over the next several days--this bill has been through \nso many iterations. Everybody who has worked on it understands what is \nin it. Everybody understands what the points are on which we disagree. \nAs a matter of fact, if we do not end up with a bipartisan bill, it is \nnot going to be over philosophical issues, it is going to be over the \nfact that the two sides just decided they didn't want to do it. It is \ngoing to be over the fact that it takes both sides.\n  The fact is, the White House can make an issue out of this. I know \nthings are not going particularly well in the polling areas. I know my \nfriend from North Dakota talked about polling data and testing things \nand all that. I realize things are not going particularly well. Maybe \nthis financial reform bill can be something that changes that. Maybe if \nyou push the bill as far to the left as you can and you dare \nRepublicans to vote against it, maybe that is a good thing. That is not \nwhat I came here to do. I do not think that is what the Senator from \nVirginia came here to do. I know that\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nif Republicans brand this bill as prolonging too big to fail--that is \nwhat we are doing--then we might be able to keep the bill from passing \nthat way too.\n  I hope all of us will sit down and do what we came here to do, and \nthat is to create good policy for the American people.\n  I am very distressed about where we are today. What I hope is \nhappening is that this is just a bunch of buzz and that our committee \nstaffs and the chairman and ranking member are actually sitting down, \nhaving serious discussions, and that very soon we are going to come \nforth with a bill that is bipartisan, where we can debate it on the \nedges and end up passing legislation that stands the test of time.\n  I hope that bill will deal with the very core issues that got us into \nthis crisis. And we can castigate all kinds of people. There is enough \nblame to go around. You almost couldn't find a regulator, a credit \nrating agency, a firm, management that was not in some way involved in \nhelping create this crisis. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I \nhope the bill, at the end of the day, will also address, as I have \nstated every time I have come to the floor on this bill, the whole \nissue of underwriting; the fact that at the end of the day, at the \nbottom of this, whether you read what happened supposedly with Goldman \non Friday, you read about these synthetic CDOs where they were not even \nreally underwriting mortgages there--in reality, they were just doing \nsomething that reflected what certain mortgages would do--at the end of \nthe day, it still was about the fact that in this country, we wrote a \nbunch of mortgages that couldn't be paid back. You can talk about this \nall you want, but the underwriting, the bad loans that were written, at \nthe end of the day, are what created much of this crisis. Candidly, I \ndon't think much of this bill addresses that. I hope we will address \nthat more fully before this bill comes to the floor.\n  With that, I think I have taken up my allotted time. I thank the \nMembers of this body for their patience. I hope we will do the work \nthat needs to be done here. As I mentioned, at this point I don't think \neither side of the aisle deserves a badge of honor, but I hope over the \nnext several days that will change. I hope our rhetoric will be \ntempered. I hope our discussions will center around those things that \nreally matter and will not be used to basically get people in the \npublic off on rabbit trails or try to herd our teams together.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with you as we try to \ncomplete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to return to the nomination \nof Dr. Lael Brainard.\n  Today, at long last, the Senate is considering the nomination of Dr. \nLael Brainard to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International \nAffairs.\n  President Obama nominated Dr. Brainard more than a year ago, in March \nof 2009. After an extensive vetting process, the Finance Committee held \na hearing on her nomination in November of last year. And the Finance \nCommittee favorably reported her nomination with a bipartisan majority \nin December of last year.\n  The path to her Senate confirmation has been neither short nor easy. \nBut throughout this process, Dr. Brainard has demonstrated persistence \nand determination.\n  These vital qualities supported her well as a nominee. And these \nqualities will support her well as she assumes her responsibilities as \nUnder Secretary of Treasury.\n  The world economy is emerging from a deep economic recession. America \nmust lead the way to recovery. And we must do so by creating jobs, \nreducing unemployment, and encouraging smart, balanced growth here at \nhome.\n  But the health of the global economy does not rest on our shoulders \nalone. In fact, the recent financial crisis has demonstrated how \ninterconnected our world is.\n  The world's many national economies have the potential to rise \ntogether. And they have the potential to fall together, as well.\n  To ensure a stable, prosperous economic future, countries must work \ntogether to support balanced economic growth. No country can rely \nsolely on export-driven growth, just as no country can rely solely on \nits domestic consumption.\n  But this economic rebalancing will not happen overnight. The global \neconomic downturn has been powerful because of its persistence. And we \nmust be just as persistent and determined in our efforts to overcome \nthe effects of this crisis.\n  As Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, Dr. \nBrainard will lead our bilateral and multilateral efforts on these \nissues. She will work with key trading partners such as China and the \nEuropean Union. And she must help to guide our country from an economic \nrecovery to economic growth.\n  Dr. Brainard has demonstrated that she has the knowledge, skills, and \nabilities to confront the tasks that lie ahead. She is brilliant and \nhard-working.\n  She has shown the tenacity and doggedness necessary to be successful \nas Under Secretary for International Affairs. And she has revealed that \nshe has the persistence and determination to address the vital issues \nfacing America and the global economy today.\n  I might add, I worked with Dr. Brainard during the Clinton \nadministration. A very key question is, What would the U.S. economic \nrelation be with China? Up to that point, America had annual extensions \nof MFN for China. They were contentious. They caused more problems than \nthey solved, and I spent some time with the President and others in the \nClinton White House and then later worked with Dr. Brainard as we moved \naway from these annual extensions of MFN and more toward PNTR with \nChina.\n  It was a hallmark change in United States-China economic relations. I \nthink this worked out very well for our country's best interests. I \nmust say it has also helped China. We pursued that objective, in part, \nbecause that meant China could then be a member of the WTO, and once \nChina became a member of the WTO--that is, the World Trade \nOrganization--that would help China live up to world standards that \nother countries were living up to under WTO.\n  Again, Dr. Brainard, throughout this confirmation process, has shown \nher dedication to serving the Treasury Department, the President, and \nthe American people. I am confident--and I am confident because she has \nhad deep experience and she is very talented; she is very good--I am \nconfident she is up to the task for which she has been nominated.\n  I urge the Senate to approve her nomination.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the assistant majority leader, the \nSenator from Illinois, be recognized to speak on whatever topic he \nchooses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  This is the Executive Calendar. It contains the names of the \nnominations the President of the United States has sent to the Senate \nfor confirmation. It is an orderly process, a historic process. It has \nhappened thousands and thousands of times. Very few times do we have a \nlot of controversy associated with these names. If there is a \ncontroversy, ultimately there is a vote--a debate, and then a vote.\n  But now there is a new approach being used by the minority side. That \napproach is to basically use one of three options: stall, stop, and \nkill. What they are trying to do, for the 104 nominations sent by \nPresident Obama, is to hold them on the calendar as long as possible so \nit is difficult for him to organize his administration and move \nforward.\n  There are some key positions. The one the Senator from Montana spoke \nof is the nominee for Under Secretary of the Treasury for International \nAffairs. We are concerned about the state of the American economy, our \ncompetition in the world, how we stack up against countries such as \nChina.\n  There is an allegation, which I think is valid, that the Chinese are \nmanipulating their currency so they continue to take jobs away from the \nUnited States. It gives them too big a competitive advantage. Here is \nthe Under\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nSecretary for International Affairs who would be tasked with looking \ninto that issue to try to help American businesses, small and large, \nand to save American jobs and this nomination now sits on the calendar \nwith 103 others.\n  What you find is that of those 104 nominations, most of them went \nthrough the committees on their way to the Senate floor with unanimous \nvotes or overwhelming majority votes. There is no controversy \nassociated with it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Illinois \nknows who has a hold on that nomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not know. Does the Senator know?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, I do not. The reason I asked the question is these \nholds are, in some cases, anonymous. I spoke earlier today about a hold \non a promotion for one of the generals in the Army to be a major \ngeneral that has now been held up for nearly 6 or 7 months by Senator \nVitter.\n  I use his name because I told him I was going to because he is \ndemanding of this general something the general cannot do. I mean, that \nis an example. We happen to know where that hold is from.\n  But of these other 100-plus nominations, they sit here, day after \nday, month after month, and someone has put a hold on them for some \nreason. If I might mention one other, the woman who was to head the \nGSA, that was vacant for nearly a year because of a hold of one \nSenator, and when we finally got around to voting for her, it was 94 to \nzero.\n  The Senator who held her up for a year even voted for her. That is \nthe kind of game that is being played. It is unfair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. I would say \nto those Senators who have holds on nominees: Come to the floor and \nexplain to the American people why you believe these people should not \nbe serving in our government. If you think there is something wrong \nwith them, if you think they are unqualified or there is some issue \ninvolving their character or integrity, do you not owe it to these \nnominees to step forward and say so?\n  I have held some nominees in the past but was open and public about \nit for a specific purpose. Recently, under the Bush administration, I \nwas looking for a report from the Department of Justice. The report was \nsent. The hold was lifted as quickly as it was sent. Those things I \nunderstand.\n  But to hold these people indefinitely in anonymous holds, secret \nholds, and never state the reason why is fundamentally unfair. It is \nunfair to the nominee who has gone through this process of FBI checks, \nbackground checks, poring through income tax returns, questions about \ntheir personal and private lives most Americans would not want to face.\n  They finally get through the nomination process, the President sends \ntheir name, and now they are being held up on the calendar \nindefinitely, 104 different people. I think we owe it to them, we owe \nit to the President and to the country to do this in an honest, orderly \nway.\n  During the course of this week, Members of the Senate are going to \ncome to the floor and ask to move these nominees forward. I hope those \non the other side who have the courage to hold them will have the \ncourage to stand and explain why. That, I think, is critical.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  There is another issue involving a hold, which goes to a much larger \nissue. We will have a bill before us soon, reported from the Banking \nCommittee, that is long overdue. This bill is Wall Street reform. Our \ncountry has been through one of the toughest economic downturns in \nmodern memory. For 80 years, we have never seen anything like what we \nare going through now.\n  Some 8 to 14 million Americans have lost their jobs, $17 trillion in \nvalue was taken out of the country. Virtually every one of us with a \nsavings account or retirement account knows what that meant. We lost \nvalue in things, our nest eggs, the money we put away for our future.\n  We know businesses failed, way too many of them. We know a lot of \npeople lost in that process, losing their jobs, losing retirement \nincome, losing their health insurance. Investors lost when the stock \nmarket went down to about 6,500 on the Dow Jones average. It is now \nback up in the 10,900 or 11,000 range. But with all that downturn in \nthe economy, people stood back and said: What happened? What did we do \nwrong?\n  Well, mistakes were made. Many mistakes were made in Washington. I \nwill concede that point. But a lot of mistakes were made on Wall Street \nwith the biggest financial institutions. The worst part of it was, when \nthese financial institutions were about to take a dive and go down, \nwhere did they turn? The American Treasury, the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  They said, under the Bush administration: We need a bailout, $700 \nbillion in taxpayer money to Wall Street to overcome the mistakes we \nmade and keep our banks afloat and insurance companies, in some cases, \nbecause of the big problems we have, problems many times of their own \ncreation.\n  They received the money. Many of us had a stark choice. We were told \nby the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve: If you do not send this money up to Wall Street and these \nbanks and insurance companies go down, the economy will follow them, \nnot just in America but globally.\n\n  So we voted for this bailout money. I did not want to do it. But I \nthought it was a responsible thing to do. Well, it turns out some of \nthese banks and other institutions are paying back the money, with \ninterest. The taxpayers are okay; but, by and large, a lot of others \nare not. We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to run through this \nscript again? Do we want to see this movie happen next year or the year \nafter?\n  The obvious answer is no. So the Banking Committee sat down and said: \nLet's rewrite the rules. If they are going to act like a bank and be \nprotected like a bank, they should have the oversight of a bank. If \nthey want to loan money on a bad loan, and they do not have a reserve, \ndo not ask the taxpayers to stand and make up the difference. That is \npart of what we are doing with this financial reform bill, to try to \ncreate the rules and oversight from organizations and agencies in \nWashington to make sure the taxpayers do not end up footing the bill \nagain.\n  Secondly, this whole world of derivatives, which I thought was \nexplained very ably by the Secretary of the Treasury over the weekend, \nis basically either an insurance policy that someone buys to make sure, \nif they are entering into a contract on a premise that they are going \nto make some money and they do not make money, they are protected--or \nit is a basic bet. They are basically betting on something that is \ngoing to occur, even if they do not have a personal interest in it.\n  Well, these derivatives got out of hand, so out of hand that there \nwas a lot of gaming that went on. We try to clean this up. I, of \ncourse, am partial to the Chicago model, where in the Board of Trade \nand Mercantile Exchange we have had transparency and open-market \ndealing in derivatives for decades. I think that is the answer. Let's \nput this all out in front of the public so they know exactly what is \ngoing on. Stop the backroom deals on Wall Street.\n  The third thing is to create a consumer protection agency so average \nconsumers across America have a fighting chance when banks and credit \ncard companies dream up new ways to fleece us. It happens with \nregularity. We know it does. So this agency would be there to make sure \nthese financial institutions are honest with consumers.\n  We do have agencies of government that make sure the toasters you buy \ndo not explode in your kitchen. You expect as much, do you not, that \nsome agency is going to make sure that product is safe? What about your \nmortgage? Should you not have the same peace of mind that when you walk \nout of the closing, you have not fallen into some trick or trap that is \ngoing to catch up with you later on?\n  Well, that is what we did. The Banking Committee had this financial \nregulatory reform bill. Senator Dodd of Connecticut went to Senator \nShelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican, and\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nsaid: Let's make it bipartisan. He worked with Senator Shelby for \nseveral months, and ultimately Senator Shelby said: We cannot reach an \nagreement.\n  Then he sat down, Senator Dodd did, with Senator Corker of Tennessee, \nwho just spoke. Senator Corker is a man I respect very much. They tried \nto work together. They spent about a month at it. It led to nothing. So \nSenator Dodd said: Well, at this point, we ought to move it to \ncommittee. Let's have the amendment process. Let's find out what this \nbill is going to look like. Let's have a debate. It was brought to the \nBanking Committee with over 400 amendments pending. The Republicans \ndecided, at the committee, they would not offer one amendment to the \nbill.\n  Instead, the Republican ranking member said: Just vote it in or out. \nThey voted, partisan rollcall. Democrats voted it out. It is now on the \nfloor and will be up next in consideration.\n  The Republican minority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, comes \nto the floor last week and says: We are going to oppose the bill \nbecause it is another taxpayer bailout. He fails to mention that what \nhas been built into the bill, with Republican input, is not a taxpayer \nbailout at all. It is says to the banks, which would be protected: You \nhave to create your own liquidation fund so if you get in trouble, the \ntaxpayers do not end up holding the bag.\n  This has to be bankers' money, not taxpayers' money. So if there is \nany bailout, it is a bailout of, by, and for bankers, for their \ninstitutions, so the taxpayers do not end up holding the bag, again.\n  So Senator McConnell's characterization of what this bill does is not \naccurate. It charges up people to hear about another bailout, as we \nwould expect. But it does not tell the story. Then comes a decision by \nthe Republicans, 41 of them, to sign a letter to say they oppose this \nbill. They did not participate in creating it, they oppose it.\n  One of the Republican Senators said: That means we are going to vote \nagainst your even bringing it up. We are going to start a filibuster \nagainst this bill to try to stop it.\n  Well, I would ask my Republican colleagues, all 41 of them, to pause \nand reflect for a moment. When Senator McConnell was selling to his \nRepublican caucus tickets on this ``pleasure cruise'' to end financial \nreform, to end this reform of Wall Street, there were pretty calm seas. \nBut last Friday something happened that changed the picture.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action against \nGoldman Sachs and said they had been engaged in conduct which was \nliterally reprehensible. They were basically misleading the people who \nwere investing in their investment products and steering the business \nfor an outcome.\n  It truly was the worst, at least the allegations of the complaint, \nare the worst in corporate greed at the Wall Street level. I would urge \nmy colleagues on the Republican side to think twice about the letter \nyou signed that said you do not want to be part of a reform effort. \nMost of America is fed up with what is going on, on Wall Street.\n  This latest action by the SEC is clear evidence of the problems. \nThose who signed the letter for this pleasure cruise trip have come \nonto some rough seas now with this SEC action. I would think, if they \nlook closely at that ticket that they have for this pleasure cruise \nwith Wall Street, they will find they are on the SS Titanic. They are \nabout to hit an iceberg because the American people are fed up with \nwhat has happened on Wall Street: Taking taxpayers' money for a \nbailout, using the money for bonuses for CEOs who made these boneheaded \nmistakes, taking it out on investors and savers across America, and \nthen saying to Congress: Whatever you do, our friends in Congress, do \nnot let them change the laws and make it more difficult.\n  Well, the American people want us to have laws that will protect them \nin their investments, in their savings, that will guarantee \ntransparency. They do not want us to continue down this path where we \nare allowing the financial institutions on Wall Street to engage in \npractices that are ultimately going to harm the economy. We do not want \nto see a rerun of this recession.\n  We need to move to this financial regulatory reform bill after we \nconsider nominations, and I hope--I hope--a few of the Republican \nSenators who are genuinely committed to reform will not get on a \npleasure cruise with Wall Street. We would rather have them roll up \ntheir sleeves and join us, going to work to bring real reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator believe the latest iteration \nof objection by the other side to this Wall Street reform effort is \nwhat I heard this morning: that they now say this legislation should \nnot be rushed through the Senate?\n  My question to the distinguished assistant majority leader is, How \nmany months have we been working, and working in a bipartisan fashion, \non this legislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can say, to my knowledge, 6, 8 months--maybe longer--\nthis has been in the process. It passed over in the House of \nRepresentatives. It came over here, and I know it has been under active \nconsideration. We did have health care reform going. But I know Senator \nDodd and the Banking Committee, at least for the last several months, \nhave been working with the Republicans trying to engage them in this \nprocess. So to say this is being sprung on them without notice I do not \nthink is accurate.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does it seem to the Senator--Mr. President, if \nI may continue a question--does it seem to the Senator there is \nsomething eerily symmetrical here in the way there is always the cry \nthat it is being rushed through the Senate Chamber? Did we hear echoes \nof that over the course of the last year with regard to health care \nlegislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response through the Chair to the Senator from \nFlorida, after the Senate in the HELP Committee adopted 150 Republican \namendments to the health care bill, every single Republican on the \ncommittee voted against it. And you know what happened--the same, of \ncourse--in the Senate Finance Committee. And then the complaints were \nmade that after 14 months of active consideration of this measure, we \nwere somehow rushing it through.\n  It is the same story. It is the same script being played over and \nover. As I said--I do not know if the Senator from Florida was on the \nfloor--the basic policy on the other side of the aisle is stall, stop, \nand kill. And this approach--saying no to everything, refusing to \nengage in even writing a bill--is not serving our Nation. There are \nthings we need to do, and this is one of them.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to speak on this \nlegislation as well, this legislation we are finding is strongly \nopposed by the Wall Street banks, which have fared so very well at \ntaxpayers' expense and now do not want any kind of legislation that \nwill call on them to have any kind of transparency and checks and \nbalances on what has been an intolerable situation.\n  If this motion to proceed to the financial reform bill fails, \nobviously, it is going to be the American taxpayer who is going to \nsuffer. When we get around to considering the motion to proceed, if it \nis denied, it will be a vote in favor of keeping the status quo. It \nwill be a vote in favor of $700 billion bailouts, reckless financial \nrisk taking, and all the other problems that come with our current \nfinancial regulatory system.\n  Is anybody satisfied with what we have been through over the past \ncouple of years? I do not think a vast majority of the American people \nare satisfied. To the contrary, I think they are outraged as to what \nthey have seen on Wall Street and thus the need for Wall Street \nregulatory reform.\n  Last week, I had spoken on the need to reform compensation practices \non Wall Street. I have put forth a specific proposal that would tie \nfuture tax deductions for huge executive compensation at big financial \ninstitutions to the\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nadoption of responsible performance-oriented compensation standards. \nWhat I have suggested are standards that have been developed already by \nthe Federal Reserve System and the Financial Stability Board, which is \nthe council of major central banks.\n  Some financial institutions have already begun to implement these \nstandards. But we need them to apply to all those major financial \ninstitutions. It only takes one reckless and irresponsible institution \nto wreak havoc on our financial system. So by requiring the very \nlargest banks to tie the pay of their highest paid executives to the \nlong-term performance of that financial institution is sound, \nresponsible reform we should be able to agree on. Remember, it has \nalready been adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Financial \nStability Board, which is the council of major central banks.\n  But today I want to address another important aspect of financial \nreform that is related to this complicated thing called derivatives \nregulation and energy speculation. Let's take derivatives. It is \narcane. It is abstract. It is something folks do not understand. It is \nvery difficult to understand. In essence, some of the examples I am \ngoing to give are--you can think of it as an insurance policy, a \nderivative. It is a derivation of normal financial instruments. Some \nderivatives provide companies with legitimate backup insurance. It is a \nway to hedge against the risk in the marketplace.\n  But the market for derivatives has gotten out of control. Many of \nthose derivatives today are simply bets--basically gambling bets--\nbetween banks that do little if anything to benefit the Nation's \neconomy. They help create financially speculative bubbles that increase \nprices, whether it is the prices at the gas pump or in the checkout \nline in the supermarket, but also the experience we have had that \nincreases the prices in our housing market.\n  In the area of derivatives regulation, the Banking Committee bill \ncreates some commonsense safeguards to improve accountability and \ntransparency. Over the last two decades, much of the activity on Wall \nStreet has moved away from traditional investment banking and asset \nmanagement and into this speculation on derivatives trading. For \nexample, in the 10-year period between 1998 and 2008, the value of \noutstanding derivatives grew from less than $100 trillion to nearly \n$600 trillion.\n  They can play an important function in managing risk, whether it is \nan interest rate, foreign exchange, or energy price risks. But when you \nallow investors to leverage all of their investment, derivatives allow \nspeculators to take on much more risk with much less capital.\n  Because the trading of derivatives is largely conducted in \nunregulated, over-the-counter markets, the reckless speculative \npositions taken by companies such as AIG and others nearly brought down \nthe financial system. Because derivatives are used to speculate on all \ntypes of goods--not just securities--they can have significant \nconsequences in other parts of the economy.\n  In early 2008, we saw the price of oil hit stratospheric heights, \nlargely because of excessive speculation in oil and energy derivatives. \nThere are a number of us in the Senate who have worked to close the so-\ncalled Enron loophole and clarify that energy derivatives should be \ntraded on a regulated exchange and treated like other commodity \nderivatives.\n  The financial reform bill that is coming to the floor addresses \nproblems in the derivatives marketplace by requiring that derivatives \nbe traded through clearinghouses and public exchanges. It authorizes \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish speculative \nposition limits on the amount of exposure that any one investor can \ntake. For example, if you are going to be buying and selling these \nthings on the exchanges, the person buying it--instead of turning right \naround and trading it--is going to have to buy and keep and hold a \ncertain percentage of the acquisition.\n  These are important first steps. But the bill coming here from the \ncommittee should do more to protect the taxpayers, and it should do \nmore to stop the excessive speculation that can drive up prices. Take, \nfor example, gas prices. I am going to be offering an amendment to do \njust that. It is going to require that regulators set hard caps on the \npositions taken by energy traders. In other words, there would be only \na certain amount they could buy of all that particular speculative \nproduct.\n  My amendment would eliminate the loopholes in the bill that will come \nto the floor that would allow these unwarranted exemptions from those \nlimits. The amendment would require these limits be put in place by a \ndate later this year.\n  I am concerned the committee bill coming to the floor retains current \nrules in the Bankruptcy Code that give the so-called counterparties in \nderivative contracts special, preferred treatment when a firm becomes \ninsolvent. This special treatment ensures that Wall Street banks and \nother large traders are put at the front of the line over an insolvent \nfirm's customers.\n  I want to give you an example. It was most apparent in late 2008 when \nbillions of taxpayer dollars were given to AIG, which was deemed too \nlarge to fail. Then those taxpayer dollars in the bailout, through the \nTARP funds, actually flowed through to counterparties, which were \npeople who had bought these derivatives like insurance policies, and \nthey paid them off.\n  Goldman Sachs received $13 billion from the taxpayers through the \nFederal bailout of AIG. Do you think that goes over well on American \nMain Street, when they see Wall Street having the Federal Government \nsaving a firm like AIG and then it turns around and pays off on those \nspeculative derivatives--in this case, to Goldman Sachs for $13 \nbillion? That does not go over very well, and it is not fair.\n  We simply need to eliminate the special treatment Wall Street banks \nand other financial firms that hold large derivative positions receive \nin the bankruptcy and liquidation process.\n  I am going to offer an amendment to clarify that those derivative \ncounterparties--such as that insurance policy for which I gave the \nexample where AIG paid off Goldman Sachs--those kinds of speculative \nventures are never again going to jump to the front of the line in the \nbankruptcy process--ahead of whom? Ahead of taxpayers and customers and \nother creditors.\n  It is time for us to move ahead with financial reform. So when we get \naround to whether we are even going to take up this bill, a vote \nagainst the motion to proceed to get to the bill is a vote against \nreform. It is a vote in favor of continued bailouts. The Banking \nCommittee has produced a strong committee bill, and I hope here on the \nfloor, with amendments, we will make it even stronger. I hope our \ncolleagues will join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in executive session.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will speak on the nominee at this time.\n  I come to the floor to support the nomination of Dr. Lael Brainard to \nbe the next Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.\n  Before I proceed, let me say I have known Lael Brainard for some \ntime. We participated together in a strategy group held by the Aspen \nInstitute, I think, for more than a decade now. I found her to be very \nincisive and bright. Additionally, in the course of her work at the \nBrookings Institution's Global Economy and Development Program she has \nworked with my husband over a period of some 6 years now. He has gotten \nto know her well as well.\n  On March 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Dr. Brainard to be the \nUnder Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. This is an \nespecially important position in the executive branch, and never more \nso than during this very critical time for the domestic and global \neconomies. Yet her nomination has languished for more than a year--\nanother casualty of obstructionist behavior, I believe, from our \ncolleagues across the aisle.\n  The Under Secretary position for which Dr. Brainard has been \nnominated\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\nfocuses on three primary objectives: First, fostering U.S. economic \nprosperity by pursuing international policies and programs that help \nstrengthen and grow our very own economy, create job opportunities for \nAmericans, and keep global markets open for American exports; second, \nensuring U.S. economic stability by promoting the American economy and \nworking to prevent and mitigate financial instability abroad; third, \nstrengthening U.S. economic security by supporting the administration's \nforeign engagement through the multilateral development banks to manage \nglobal challenges.\n  The Treasury Department needs a qualified person such as Dr. Brainard \nin this vital leadership position--especially at a time when the \nDepartment is continuing its efforts to ensure economic growth, engage \nChina on economic issues, and advance our global recovery agenda \nfollowing the financial crisis.\n  As a matter of fact, the Secretary of the Treasury himself has called \nabout this position simply to say how important it is that she get \nconfirmed at this time. I had the privilege to talk to Senator Kyl \nabout it yesterday by phone, and I am hopeful this confirmation will \ntake place this evening without further delay.\n  Let me speak for a few moments on her track record of service. I see \nher as a devoted public servant, someone who has spent most of her \ncareer serving our people. She has held several senior positions in the \nadministration and in the nonprofit and academic sectors, including \nDeputy National Economic Adviser for President Clinton; Vice President \nand Founding Director of the Brookings Institution's Global Economy and \nDevelopment Program, which is where my husband has worked with her for \nthe 6 years, as I mentioned; and associate professor of applied \neconomics at MIT's Sloan School.\n  She has also served as a White House fellow and a National Science \nFoundation fellow, among numerous other professional achievements.\n  In short, she is eminently qualified for this senior administration \nposition for which she has been nominated.\n  Despite these excellent qualifications and her impressive resume, \nhowever, her nomination has languished in the Senate for more than a \nyear. It is time to get it done this afternoon.\n  Dr. Brainard was nominated by President Obama on March 23 of last \nyear. She was favorably reported by our colleagues in the Senate \nFinance Committee in December of last year. However, a hold was placed \non her nomination, as well as that of two other senior Treasury \nnominees.\n  Many questions have been raised about her personal income tax \nreturns, business partnerships, and the hiring of household employees, \nall of which are done jointly with her husband, Kurt Campbell. Mr. \nCampbell--whom I have also known because he participated in the same \nAspen Strategy Group for more than a decade--is currently the Assistant \nSecretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, a position to \nwhich he was unanimously confirmed on June 25, 2009. So the same \nquestions were asked of him as were asked of Lael Brainard.\n  She has responded to questions in multiple rounds from majority and \nminority staff. She has answered every question asked of her and \nprovided hundreds of pages of submissions in a forthcoming, honest, and \ndirect manner. Clearly, at some point, there were some differences of \nopinion for some Members, but that has been settled, to the best of my \nknowledge. She submitted the same paperwork about taxes and the hiring \nof household employees as Mr. Campbell did during his confirmation, and \nduring that time neither the Foreign Relations Committee nor any Member \nof the full Senate raised any concerns regarding this information.\n  As the United States is entering a particularly intense period of \ninternational engagements this spring and summer, I believe Dr. \nBrainard's confirmation is essential to ensuring effective U.S. policy \ncoordination and implementation.\n  I wish to point out that she has broad bipartisan support, as well as \nthe support of a multitude of nongovernmental organizations and \nbusinesses. She is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nBusiness Roundtable, U.S. Council on International Business, Business \nCouncil for International Understanding, Council of the Americas, \nCoalition of Service Industries, the Emergency Committee for American \nTrade, the National Foreign Trade Council, and the National Association \nof Manufacturers.\n  In my opinion, she is a woman of strong common sense, integrity, \ncredibility, and sound judgment. She is exceptionally well qualified, \nand I urge my colleagues to approve her nomination without further \ndelay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of \nLael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for International \nAffairs.\n  I know Lael personally. She is a renowned expert in international \neconomics, a dedicated public servant, and is highly qualified for this \nimportant position. I had the privilege of working with her when she \nwas a member of the Clinton administration as Deputy Assistant to the \nPresident for International Economics. Then she went on to be a vice \npresident and founding director of the Brookings Institution's Global \nEconomy and Development Program and then an associate professor of \napplied economics at MIT's Sloan School.\n  She has extraordinary credentials and experience, but she is also, in \naddition to that, someone who has a wide ranging interest in \ninternational economics, international affairs, and international \nsecurity policy.\n  She is someone I have known for many years, someone I respect \nimmensely for her judgment, her maturity, and her dedication to not \nonly the country but also to ensuring that our policy reflects our \nhighest ideals, as well as advances our cause around the world.\n  She has been nominated for a very critical position. International \neconomics is no longer a secondary concern. It is of primary concern, \nif it ever was a secondary concern. We are now approaching a time when \nour relationships with the world's economies are no longer one of the \nstrong versus the many smaller economies. We are in a very competitive \nglobal economy, and we need this type of representation in the \nDepartment of the Treasury. We have to engage China, and no one is more \nthoughtful and better prepared to do that than Lael.\n  We have to stabilize this economy through this financial crisis which \nwe are seeing not just in terms of private markets but the situation in \nGreece, the issues of sovereign debt. All of these cry out for an \nindividual in the Department of Treasury who is not only well versed \nbut also in place to do the work. Again, I can find no higher qualified \ncandidate than Lael.\n  We have to expand export opportunities. The President has rightly \ncalled upon this country not only to begin to grow again but to direct \nour growth away from domestic consumption to export. We need someone in \nthe international arena fighting for us, the United States. We need an \nindividual who is responsible and accountable for that effort. Again, I \ncannot think of a more experienced, more dedicated, and more qualified \nindividual than Lael.\n  We have been waiting, the Department of Treasury has been waiting, \nLael Brainard has been waiting, since December 2009 for confirmation. \nThat is a long time to put a high priority issue on the back burner.\n  What is ironic is it appears no one is challenging her experience, \nher credentials, her demeanor, her temperament--anything. She is \ncollateral damage, if you will, in another dispute which is not one of \nthe most significant and commendable parts of the process here. We all \nhave issues with individual candidates, but after those issues are well \nventilated and since December 2009--that is a long time--we have to \ntake it to a vote up or down. I urge that her nomination move forward \nthis evening. She is extraordinarily qualified, and she is someone who \ncan take on the extraordinary challenges of this job.\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\n  Frankly, right now we have wasted months and months through this \nprocess where we could have had the very best person available focus on \nthe international competitiveness of the United States, and I think our \nconstituents demand it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Dr. Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury \nfor International Affairs. This is a vital role and it is important \nthat we fill this position during this time of immense global \nchallenges. The filling of this position is long overdue. Dr. Brainard \nis highly qualified and we are fortunate that a candidate of her \nquality is willing to serve.\n  The Under Secretary for International Affairs is critical to the \nadministration's efforts to engage China on economic issues, stabilize \nthe global economy following the financial crisis, expand export \nopportunities, and pursue reforms and effective U.S. investments in the \nmultilateral developments banks.\n  Dr. Brainard attended Wesleyan University before receiving a Master's \nand Doctorate in Economics from Harvard University. She is the \nrecipient of a White House Fellowship and Council on Foreign Relations \nFellowship. During the Clinton administration, Dr. Brainard served as \nDeputy National Economic Adviser and chair of the Deputy Secretaries \nCommittee on International Economics. Prior to joining the Clinton \nadministration, she was an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School. \nShe currently serves as vice president and founding director of the \nGlobal Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution.\n  During her tenure with the Clinton administration, Dr. Brainard faced \nglobal economic challenges, including the Asian finance crisis, the \nMexican financial crisis, and China's entry to the World Trade \nOrganization. She helped shape the 2000 G8 Development Summit that for \nthe first time included leaders of the poorest nations and laid \nfoundations for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria.\n  Over the years, Dr. Brainard has written extensively on international \neconomic issues. In recent years, she has focused on the links between \nU.S. competitiveness and climate change policy. As we address climate \nchanges issues, it will be helpful to have someone with her knowledge \nas part of our team.\n  President Obama nominated Dr. Brainard back in March and I appreciate \nher patience with the process. I look forward to working with Dr. \nBrainard to address the international economic challenges that we face.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the majority leader has taken a significant \nstep to address the crisis created by Senate Republican obstruction of \nPresident Obama's highly qualified nominations and the Senate's advice \nand consent responsibilities. Regrettably, Republican obstruction has \nmade it necessary for the majority leader to file cloture to bring an \nend to Republican filibusters and allow the Senate to consider at least \nsome of the long-stalled nominations languishing on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar.\n  In a dramatic departure from the Senate's traditional practice of \nprompt and routine consideration of noncontroversial nominations, \nSenate Republicans have refused for month after month to join \nagreements to consider, debate and vote on nominations. Their practices \nhave obstructed Senate action and led to the backlog of over 80 \nnominations now stalled before the Senate, awaiting final action. The \nAmerican people should understand that these are all nominations \nfavorably reported by the committees of jurisdiction. Most are \nnominations that were reported without opposition or with a small \nminority of negative votes. Regrettably, this has been an ongoing \nRepublican strategy and practice during President Obama's presidency.\n  Twenty-five of those stalled nominations are to fill vacancies in the \nFederal courts. They have been waiting for Senate action since being \nfavorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee as long ago as \nlast November. Those 25 judicial nominations are more than the 18 \nFederal circuit and district court nominees that Republicans have \nallowed the Senate to consider and act upon during President Obama's \nadministration.\n  To put this in perspective, by this date during George W. Bush's \nPresidency, the Senate had confirmed 45 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges. President Obama began sending the Senate judicial \nnominations 2 months earlier than President Bush did, and still only 18 \nFederal circuit and district court confirmations have been allowed. If \nwe had acted on the additional 25 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee but on which Senate \nRepublicans are preventing Senate action, we would have made comparable \nprogress. As it stands we are 60 percent behind what we achieved by \nthis time in President Bush's first term.\n  Republicans continue to stand in the way of these nominations, \ndespite vacancies that have skyrocketed to over 100, more than 40 of \nwhich are ``judicial emergencies.'' Caseloads and backlogs continue to \ngrow while vacancies are left open longer and longer. On this date in \nPresident Bush's first term, the Senate had confirmed 45 Federal \ndistrict and circuit court judges; there were just 7 judicial \nnominations on the calendar, and all 7 were confirmed within 12 days. \nThat was normal order for the Democratic Senate majority considering \nPresident Bush's nominations. Circuit court nominations by this date in \nhis first term waited an average of less than a week to be confirmed. \nBy contrast, currently stalled by Senate Republicans are circuit court \nnominees reported back in November and December of last year. The seven \ncircuit court nominees the Senate has been allowed to consider so far \nhave waited an average of 124 days reported to be considered and \nconfirmed after being favorably--more than 4 months compared to less \nthan 1 week for President Bush's nominees--and those delays are \nincreasing.\n  In the 17 months in 2001 and 2002 that I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senate confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial \nnominations. In stark contrast, to date, the Senate has only been \nallowed to act on 18 circuit and district court nominations. Twenty-two \nof the 25 nominations pending on the calendar have been pending for \nmore than a month. Eighteen were reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout dissent--without a single negative vote from any Republican \nmember. Still they wait.\n  Republican obstruction has the Senate on a sorry pace to confirm \nfewer than 30 judicial nominees during this Congress. Last year, only \n12 circuit and district court judges were confirmed. The lowest total \nin more than 50 years. We have to do far more to address this growing \ncrisis of unfilled judicial vacancies.\n  It has been almost 5 months since I began publicly urging the Senate \nRepublican leadership to abandon its strategy of obstruction and delay \nof the President's judicial nominees. But we have not considered a \njudicial nomination since March 17, when we finally confirmed the \nnomination of Rogeriee Thompson of Rhode Island to the First Circuit. \nEven though Judge Thompson had two decades of experience on her State's \ncourts, and her nomination was reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without a single dissenting vote, it stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar for nearly 2 months before she was unanimously \nconfirmed, 98-0. There was no reason or explanation given by Senate \nRepublicans for their unwillingness to proceed earlier.\n  Before that vote, the majority leader was required to file cloture on \nthe nomination of Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit. \nJudge Keenan's nomination was stalled for 4 months. After the time \nconsuming process of cloture, her nomination was approved 99 to zero. \nThere was no reason or explanation given by Senate Republicans for \ntheir unwillingness to proceed earlier or for the filibuster of that \nnominee either.\n  Similarly, there has yet to be an explanation for why the majority \nleader was required to file cloture to consider the nominations of \nJudge Thomas Vanaskie to the Third Circuit and Judge Denny Chin to the \nSecond Circuit, both widely respected, long-serving district court \njudges. Judge Vanaskie has served for more than 15 years on the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, and Judge Chin has served for 16 years on the \nSouthern District of New York. Both nominees have mainstream records, \nand both were reported\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nby the Judiciary Committee last year with bipartisan support. Judge \nChin, who was the first Asian Pacific American appointed as a Federal \ndistrict court judge outside the Ninth Circuit, and who, if confirmed, \nwould be the only active Asian-Pacific American judge to serve on a \nFederal appellate court, was reported by the committee unanimously.\n  The majority leader has also filed cloture to end the extended \nRepublican effort to prevent Senate consideration of the nomination of \nProfessor Chris Schroeder to lead the Office of Legal Policy at the \nJustice Department. Professor Schroeder was first nominated by \nPresident Obama on June 4, 2009. He appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last June, and was reported favorably in July by \nvoice vote, with no dissent. His nomination then languished on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar for nearly 5 months, with not a single \nexplanation of the delay. Then, as the year drew to a close, Republican \nSenators objected to carrying over Professor Schroeder's nomination \ninto the new session, and it was returned to the President without \naction, forcing the process to begin all over again. President Obama \nrenominated Professor Schroeder early this year, and his nomination was \nreconsidered and rereported by the Judiciary Committee with Republican \nsupport. A scholar and public servant who has served with distinction \non the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the Justice \nDepartment, Professor Schroeder has support across the political \nspectrum.\n  Democrats treated President Bush's nominations to run the Office of \nLegal Policy much more fairly than Republicans are treating President \nObama's nominee, confirming all four nominees to lead that office \nquickly. We confirmed President Bush's first nominee to that post by a \nvote of 96 to 1 just 1 month after he was nominated, and only a week \nafter his nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee. In \ncontrast, Professor Schroeder's nomination has been pending since last \nJune and will require cloture to be invoked before the Senate can \nfinally have an up-or-down vote.\n  The majority leader has also filed cloture to end the obstruction of \nthe longest-pending judicial nomination on the Executive Calendar, that \nof Marisa Demeo to the District of Columbia Superior Court. Her \nnomination has been blocked since it was reported by the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee in May 2009. This sort of \nobstruction of a DC Superior Court nomination is unprecedented. These \nnominations for 15-year terms on the District's trial court are not \nusually controversial. The nomination of Magistrate Judge Demeo, an \nexperienced former prosecutor and Justice Department veteran who is the \nsecond Hispanic woman nominated to this court, is one I strongly \nsupport. I know Judge Demeo and have known her for years. The chief \njudge of the Superior Court, Lee Satterfield, has written several times \nto the majority and minority leaders about the ``dire situation'' \ncreated by vacancies on that court for administration of justice in \nWashington, DC, our Nation's Capital. As usual, the cost of Republican \nobstruction is borne by the American people.\n  Not long after President Obama was sworn in, Senate Republicans \nsignaled their strategy of obstruction, threatening to filibuster his \nnominations before he had made a single one, in their letter of March \n2, 2009. The stated basis for their threat was to ensure consultation \nwith home State Senators. President Obama has consulted with home state \nSenators of both parties, yet Senate Republicans filibustered the very \nfirst of President Obama's judicial nominations, the nomination of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit, despite such \nconsultation. The Senate had to invoke cloture to consider Judge \nHamilton's nomination, even though he was a well-respected district \ncourt judge supported of Senator Lugar, the longest-serving Republican \nin the Senate, with whom President Obama consulted before making the \nnomination.\n  Senate Republicans have ratcheted up their bad practices from the \n1990s when they pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominations, creating a vacancies crisis on the Federal bench.\n  Democrats did not do the same to President Bush's nominees. I \nfollowed through on my commitment to treat them more fairly. I worked \nhard in 2001 and 2002, even after the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax \nattacks, holding hearings, including during Senate recess periods, in \norder to swiftly consider President Bush's nominees. That is why the \nSenate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees by the end of 2002. \nDemocrats only refused to rubber stamp a handful of the most extreme, \nideological and divisive of President Bush's nominees.\n  During the Bush Presidency Senate Republicans contended that \nfilibusters of judicial nominations were ``unconstitutional.'' Now that \nPresident Obama is in the White House, Senate Republicans have \nfilibustered the nomination of Judge David Hamilton, and Judge Barbara \nKeenan, who was then confirmed unanimously. The same Republican \nSenators who recently threatened to blow up the Senate unless every \nnominee received an up-or-down vote are now engaged in another attempt \nto abuse the rules of the Senate and undermine the democratic process. \nRepublican Senators who just a few years ago insisted that ``elections \nhave consequences'' have now made the use of filibusters, holds, and \nexcessive procedural delays the new normal in the Senate. They seem \nintent on continuing their destructive practices.\n  It is regrettable that the majority leader has to file cloture on \nthese mainstream nominations today, just to allow the Senate to hold \nthe up-or-down votes that Republican Senators once demanded for the \nmost extreme and ideological nominees of a Republican President. I \nthank him for doing so, and look forward to the confirmation of these \nnominees.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Rule of Law and Wall Street\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, as we continue to learn more facts from \nvarious investigations into the 2008 financial meltdown, a certain \npicture is becoming increasingly clear. Like a jigsaw puzzle slowly \ntaking shape, we can begin to see the outlines of many of the causes of \nthe crisis--and the solutions they demand. In my view, it is a picture \nof Wall Street banks and institutions that have grown too large and \ncomplex and that suffer from irreconcilable conflicts between the \nservices they provide for their customers and the transactions they \nengage in for themselves. It is also a picture of management that \neither knew about the lack of financial controls and outright fraud at \nthe very core of these institutions or was grossly incompetent because \nit did not. And the picture includes regulators who failed miserably as \nwell, due to malfeasance or incompetence or some combination of both.\n  Until Congress breaks these gigantic institutions into manageably \nsized banks and draws hard, clear lines for regulators to ensure that \neffective controls remain in place, we will have done neither that \nwhich is necessary to restore the rule of law on Wall Street nor that \nwhich will ensure that another financial crisis does not soon happen \nagain.\n  What have we learned in just the past 5 weeks?\n  On March 15, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the bankruptcy \nexaminer's report on Lehman Brothers and said, as many of us have \nsuspected all along, that there was fraud--fraud--at the heart of the \nfinancial crisis. The examiner's report exposed the so-called Repo 105 \ntransactions and what appears to have been outright fraud by Lehman \nBrothers, its management, and its accounting firm, which all conspired \nto hide $50 billion in liabilities at quarter's end to ``window dress'' \nits balance sheet and mislead investors. And this practice does not \nappear to be unique to Lehman Brothers.\n  I went further and noted that questions were being raised in Europe \nabout whether Goldman Sachs had an improper conflict of interest when \nit underwrote billions of Euros in bonds for Greece. The questions \nbeing raised include whether some of these bond-offering documents \ndisclosed the true nature of these swaps to investors and, if not, \nwhether the failure to do so was material.\n  Last week, we learned about more alleged fraud at the heart of the \nfinancial crisis. On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nfiled charges against Goldman Sachs and one of its traders for alleged \nfraud in the structuring and marketing of collateralized debt \nobligations tied to subprime mortgages. Goldman allegedly defrauded \ninvestors by failing to disclose conflicts of interest in the design \nand structure of these collateralized debt obligations. The SEC says \nthis alleged fraud cost investors more than $1 billion.\n  While I will not prejudge the merits of the case, the SEC's complaint \nalleges that Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital \ninformation about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge \nfund played in the portfolio selection process and that the hedge fund \nhad taken a short position against the CDO.\n  Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC Division of Enforcement, said:\n\n       Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against \n     the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage \n     securities to include in an investment portfolio, while \n     telling other investors that the securities were selected by \n     an independent, objective third party.\n\n  Kenneth Lench, chief of the SEC's Structured and New Products Unit, \nadded:\n\n       The SEC continues to investigate the practices of \n     investment banks and others involved in the securitization of \n     complex financial products tied to the U.S. housing market as \n     it was beginning to show signs of distress.\n\n  Goldman Sachs has denied any wrongdoing and has said it will defend \nthe transaction.\n  This particular case involving Goldman Sachs was almost certainly not \nunique. Instead, it was emblematic of problems that occurred throughout \nthe securitization market.\n  Late last month, Bob Ivry and Jody Shenn of Bloomberg News wrote \nabout the conflicts of interest present in the management of CDOs, a \ntopic also discussed at length in Michael Lewis's book ``The Big \nShort.'' The SEC should pursue other instances of conflicts of interest \nin the CDO market that led to a failure to disclose material \ninformation.\n  Last year, Senators Leahy, Grassley, and I, along with many others in \nthe Congress, worked to pass the bipartisan Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act so that our law enforcement officials would have \nadditional resources to target and uncover any financial fraud that was \na cause of the great financial crisis. However long it takes, whatever \nresources the SEC needs, Congress should continue to back the SEC and \nthe Justice Department in their efforts to uncover and prosecute \nwrongdoing.\n  I applaud SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro and especially Rob Khuzami and \nthe team he has reshaped in the Enforcement Division. They deserve our \nsteadfast support as the leadership of the SEC continues its historic \nmission of revitalizing that institution and making it clear to all on \nWall Street that there is a new cop on the beat.\n  Also last week, our colleague, chairman Carl Levin, ranking member \nTom Coburn, and the staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations began a series of hearings on the causes of the \nfinancial crisis. It is a testament to the professionalism and \ndedication of Chairman Levin that he has brought the subcommittee's \nresources to bear in such an effective and thorough manner. I also \ncommend ranking member Tom Coburn for his dedication and effort as a \npartner in this effort. Chairman Levin and the subcommittee staff \ndeserve credit and our deep appreciation for the work they have put \ninto this series of hearings on Wall Street and the financial crisis.\n  Since November 2008, subcommittee investigators have gathered \nmillions--millions--of pages of documents, conducted over 100 \ninterviews and depositions, and consulted with dozens of experts. It is \ntruly a mammoth undertaking, and the fruits of their labor were evident \nin last week's two hearings on Washington Mutual Bank. I look forward \nto the subcommittee's remaining two hearings on this subject, including \nthis Friday's hearing on the role of the credit rating agencies. I \ncommend this hearing to all my colleagues.\n  The Levin hearings deserve comparison to the legendary Pecora \ninvestigations of the 1930s, which were held by the Senate Committee on \nBanking and Currency to investigate the causes of the Wall Street crash \nof 1929. The name refers to the fourth and final chief counsel for the \ninvestigation, Ferdinand Pecora, an assistant district attorney for New \nYork County. As chief counsel, Pecora personally examined many high-\nprofile witnesses who included some of the Nation's most influential \nbankers and stockbrokers. The\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\ninvestigation uncovered a wide range of abusive practices on the part \nof banks and bank affiliates. These included a variety of conflicts of \ninterest, such as the underwriting of unsound securities in order to \npay off bad bank loans as well as ``pool operations'' to support the \nprice of bank stocks.\n  The Pecora hearings galvanized broad public support for new banking \nand securities laws. As a result of the Pecora investigation's \nfindings, the Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933 to \nseparate commercial and investment banking; the Securities Act of 1933 \nto set penalties for filing false information about stock offerings; \nand the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which formed the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, to regulate the stock exchanges. Thanks to the \nlegacy of the Pecora Commission hearings and subsequent legislation, \nthe American financial institution rested on a sound regulatory \nfoundation for over half a century; that is, until we began the folly \nof dismantling it.\n\n  The Levin hearings have shined a much needed spotlight on the role of \npotential outright fraud by financial actors as well as the \nincompetence and complicity of bank regulators in the financial crisis. \nThere is no better example of the danger that fraud and lax regulation \nposes to our financial system than the collapse of Washington Mutual \nBank, known as WaMu.\n  Far too often, the failure of institutions such as Washington Mutual \nis blamed on high-risk business strategies. It kind of sounds all \nright, doesn't it? While such strategies are clearly part of the \nproblem, they should not be used to mask other causes such as fraud and \nmalfeasance which played a significant role in the collapse of WaMu. \nEvidence developed by the subcommittee demonstrates that WaMu officials \ntolerated, if not outright encouraged, fraud as a byproduct of \npromoting a dramatic expansion of loan volume.\n  The most blatant example of WaMu's culture of fraud was its \nwidespread use of what are called stated income loans. Stated income \nloans is a practice of lending qualified borrowers loans without \nindependent verification of what they state their income is. Listen to \nthis. This is unbelievable. Approximately 90 percent of WaMu's home \nequity loans, 73 percent of its option ARMs, and 50 percent of its \nsubprime loans were stated income loans. You go to the bank, you walk \nin, they say: Ted, what is your income? You say what it is, and that is \nit. Based on that, you can get 90 percent of WaMu's home equity loans, \n73 percent of its option ARMs, and 50 percent of its subprime loans--\nstated income loans. As Treasury Department inspector general Eric \nThorson said last week, WaMu's predominant mix of stated income loans \ncreated a ``target rich environment'' for fraud.\n  Because WaMu made these stated income loans with the intent to resell \nthem into the secondary market, there was less concern whether \nborrowers would ever be able to repay them. WaMu created a compensation \nsystem that rewarded employees with higher commissions for selling the \nvery riskiest of loans. In 2005, WaMu adopted what it called its high-\nrisk lending strategy because those loans were so profitable. In order \nto implement this strategy, it coached its sales branch to embrace \n``the power of yes.'' The message was clear. As one industry analyst \nhas said: ``If you were alive, they would give you a loan . . . if you \nwere dead, they would give you a loan.''\n  That this culture led to fraud on a massive scale should have \nsurprised no one. An internal review by one southern California loan \nofficer revealed that 83 percent of loans contained instances of \nconfirmed fraud. In another office, 58 percent of loans were considered \nto be fraudulent. What did WaMu management do when it became clear that \nfraud rates were rising as house prices began to fall? What did they \ndo? Rather than curb its reckless business practices, it decided to try \nto sell a higher proportion of these risky, fraud-tainted mortgages \ninto the secondary market, thereby locking in a profit for itself even \nas it spread further contagion into our capital markets.\n  In order for WaMu and institutions similar to it to sell these low-\nquality loans to the secondary market, they need a AAA rating from \ncredit rating agencies. So what did these institutions do? They gamed \nthe system and manipulated the agencies by engaging in a practice \ncalled barbelling. Apparently, the credit rating agencies did not \nexamine individual FICO scores when rating mortgage-backed securities \nand instead relied on average FICO scores. As revealed at the hearing \nby a WaMu risk officer and detailed in Michael Lewis's book ``The Big \nShort,'' lenders could create the requisite average score by pairing \nloans whose borrowers had relatively high scores with borrowers whose \nscores were far lower and would normally warrant a loan, which is the \nreason why it is called barbelling. So if the raters wanted an average \nFICO score of 615, a lender could compare scores of 680 with scores of \n550, even though borrowers with scores of 550 were almost certain to \ndefault on the loan. This barbell effect satisfied the rating agencies, \neven though half the loans, in many cases, had little chance of \nsuccess. At the hearing, WaMu's CEO, Kerry Killinger, effectively \nadmitted to barbelling by saying ``I don't have the barbell numbers in \nfront of me.''\n  To make matters worse, WaMu scored high FICO scores by seeking out \nborrowers with short credit histories. Such borrowers often have high \nFICO scores, even though they have not demonstrated the ability to take \non and pay off large debts over time. These borrowers are called ``thin \nfile'' borrowers. According to a report in the New York Times, WaMu \nencouraged thin file loans, even circulating a flier to sales agents \nthat said ``a thin file is a good file.'' The book ``The Big Short'' \neven discusses a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 \nand no English who was ostensibly given a $724,000 mortgage on the \nbasis of his thin file.\n  Plainly, the Office of Thrift Supervision failed miserably in its \nresponsibility to regulate WaMu and to protect the public from the \nconsequences of WaMu's excessive and unwarranted risk-taking, including \nthe toleration of widespread fraud. Although WaMu comprised fully 25 \npercent of OTS's regulatory portfolio, OTS adopted a laissez faire \nregulatory attitude at WaMu. Although line bank examiners identified \nthe high prevalence of fraud and weak internal controls at WaMu, OTS \ndid virtually nothing to address the situation. In fact, OTS advocated \nfor WaMu, among other regulators, and even actively thwarted an FDIC \ninvestigation into WaMu during 2007 and 2008. The complete abdication \nof regulatory responsibility by OTS may find sad explanation in the \nfact that OTS was dependent on WaMu's user fees for 12 to 15 percent of \nits budget.\n  The regulatory failures at OTS were not unique. The overall \nregulatory environment at the time was extremely deferential to the \nmarket based on the widespread but faulty assumption that markets can \nand will effectively self-regulate. Self-regulate. At last Friday's \nhearing, the testimony of the inspector general at the Department of \nthe Treasury was particularly noteworthy. He said bank regulators:\n\n     . . . hesitate to take any action, whether it's because they \n     get too close after so many years or they're just hesitant or \n     maybe the amount of fees enter into it . . . I don't know. \n     But whatever it is, this is not unique to WaMu and it is not \n     unique to OTS.\n\n  Let me repeat. It was the conclusion of our Treasury Department's \ninspector general that the failure of regulators to harness the lawless \nnature of conflicted institutions was not unique to Washington Mutual \nor to the Office of Thrift Supervision.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: It is time we return \nthe rule of law to Wall Street, where it has been seriously eroded by \nthe deregulatory mindset that captured our regulatory agencies over the \npast 30 years. We became enamored of the view that self-regulation was \nadequate, that enlightened self-interest would motivate counterparties \nto undertake stronger and better forms of due diligence than any \nregulator could perform, and that market fundamentalism would lead to \nthe best outcomes for the most people. Some people even say that today. \nThey say transparency and vigorous oversight by outside accountants is \nsupposed to help our financial system--keep our financial system \ncredible and sound. The allure of deregulation led us instead to the \nbiggest financial crisis since 1929 and to former Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan's\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nfrank admission that he was ``deeply dismayed'' that the premise of \nenlightened self-interest had failed to work. Now we are learning, not \nsurprisingly, that fraud and lawlessness were key ingredients in the \ncollapse as well.\n  As we turn to financial regulatory reform, we must remember that \neffective regulation requires not only motivated and competent \nregulators but also clear lines drawn by Congress. Based on what we \nhave learned, what must we do?\n\n  First, we must undo the damage done by decades of deregulation. That \ndamage includes financial institutions that are too big to manage and \ntoo big to regulate--as former FDIC Chairman Bill Isaac has called \nthem: too big to manage, too big to regulate. It also includes a Wild \nWest attitude on Wall Street, in which conflict of interests are \nrampant and lead to fraudulent behavior as well as colossal failures by \naccountants and lawyers who misunderstand or disregard their role as \ngatekeepers. The rule of law depends, in part, on having manageably \nsized institutions, participants interested in following the law, and \ngatekeepers motivated by more than a paycheck from their clients.\n  That is why I believe we must separate commercial banking from \ninvestment banking activities, restoring a modern version of the Glass-\nSteagall Act to end the conflicts of interest at the heart of the \nfinancial speculation undertaken by mega banks that are too big to \nfail. We further should limit the size of bank and nonbank \ninstitutions, something Senator Sherrod Brown and I proposed in \nlegislation we intend to introduce this Wednesday. Otherwise, we will \ncontinue to bear these mega banks' claims that they are merely market \nmakers and no one who deals with them should trust whether the very \ncreator of a financial product they sell is secretly betting against \nits success.\n  Second, we must help regulators and other gatekeepers not only by \ndemanding transparency but also by providing clear, enforceable rules \nof the road wherever possible. One clear lesson of the Goldman \nallegations is, we need greater transparency and disclosure of \ncounterparty positions in the over-the-counter derivatives market. We \nshould mandate that derivatives are traded on an exchange or at least \nessentially cleared. The rare exemption should carry with it a \nreporting requirement so that all counterparties understand the \npositions being taken by other clients of the dealer firm.\n  Clearly, we need to fix a broken securitization market. No market, \nregardless of how sophisticated its participants, can function without \nproper transparency and disclosure. While I am pleased that the current \nreform bill would direct the SEC to issue rules requiring greater \ndisclosure regarding the underlying loans in an asset-backed security, \nI believe we must go further still. Requirements for disclosure should \nnot merely begin and end at issuance. Instead, disclosure should be \nautomated, standardized, and updated on a timely basis. This will \nprovide investors with relevant information on the performance of the \nloans, their compliance with relevant laws--fraudulent origination, for \nexample, is generally uncovered after the fact--and the replacement of \nnew collateral. This information should empower investors and \ncountervail the malfeasance of issuers looking to adversely select \ndodgy collateral that they are also shorting on the side. Moreover, \nsuch real-time monitoring by investors would also have beneficial \neffects further up the securitization supply chain. If originators know \nthey can't get away with selling fraudulent or poorly underwritten \nloans, they will also be forced to improve their standards.\n  While not a silver bullet, I am also generally supportive of \nrequirements that those who originate and securitize loans retain risk \nby keeping some percentage on their very own balance sheets. WaMu, for \nexample, developed, in Senator Levin's words, a ``conveyor belt'' that \noriginated, packaged, and dumped toxic mortgage products downstream to \nunsuspecting investors. Their lack of ``skin in the game'' allowed them \nto make a mockery of the originate-to-distribute model. While Bear \nStearns, Lehman Brothers, and other firms faltered due to their \nexcessive retention of risk, this basic requirement will better align \nthe interests of originators and securitizers with those of investors.\n  Moreover, a clear lesson of the Levin hearings is that Congress must \nban the widespread issuance of stated income loans.\n  I understand Senator Levin is developing further reform proposals \nbased on his conclusions from the hearings.\n  Third, we must concentrate law enforcement and regulatory resources \non restoring the rule of law to Wall Street. We must treat financial \ncrimes with the same gravity as other crimes because the price of \ninaction and a failure to deter future misconduct is enormous. That is \nwhy I'm pleased the SEC is turning the page on its recent history and \nsending a message throughout Wall Street: fraud will not pay.\n  Madam President, last week's revelations about Washington Mutual and \nGoldman Sachs reinforce what I've been saying for some time. \nDeregulation was based on the view that rational actors would operate \nin their own self-interest within a framework of law. But even with the \nmost rigorous regulators, it is impossible to trace the financial self-\ninterest of convoluted financial conglomerates, much less constrict \ntheir behavior before it runs afoul of the law. WaMu made loans they \nknew could not be paid back. Goldman Sachs allegedly permitted clients \nto take secret positions against the very financial products that it \nhad created.\n  The picture being revealed by the jigsaw puzzle of multiple \ninvestigations is now emerging clearly in my eyes. These financial \ninstitutions are too big and conflicted to manage, too big and \nconflicted to regulate, and too big to fail. Even Alan Greenspan has \nsaid about our current predicament: ``If they're too big to fail, \nthey're too big.''\n  Our country took a giant step backwards during the last financial \ncrisis, upending the dream of home ownership for millions of Americans, \nand throwing millions of people out of work as well. The credibility of \nour markets, one of the pillars of our economic success, was badly \ndamaged. It must be restored. There must be structural and substantive \nchange to Wall Street, where bankers must resume their central role of \nefficiently allocating capital, not taking bets in opaque markets that \nno one can understand.\n  The solution is clear. We must split up our largest financial \ninstitutions into more manageable entities; we must separate their \ncomponent parts so they are no longer inherently conflicted and so they \ncan be properly regulated. Only then, if necessary, can they be allowed \nto fail without sending our entire economy to the precipice of \ndisaster.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to honor one of Nevada's \ngreatest champions and advocates for victims throughout my home State. \nIn her living room in Las Vegas, NV, in 1974, Florence McClure \ncofounded Community Action Against Rape, CAAR, with Sandi Petta. \nThirty-five years later, CAAR has become the Rape Crisis Center, the \nlargest sexual assault center in Nevada, serving all of Nevada.\n  Florence McClure moved to Las Vegas, NV, in 1966. She was \ninstrumental in the opening of the Frontier Hotel. While making the \nhotel into a major resort on the Las Vegas Strip, Florence made history \nas a female executive in the casino industry. She also joined the Las \nVegas Chapter of the League of Women Voters and other women's groups in \n1967. She returned to college and obtained her bachelor's degree from \nUNLV in 1971.\n  Florence became a tireless advocate for victims of sexual assault. As \nthe director of CAAR for 12 years, she was instrumental in forcing \nimprovements and system changes in the way sexual assault victims were \ntreated. Not one to shy away from confrontation, Florence worked most \noften one-on-one with judges, law enforcement officers, and medical \npersonnel to increase the ability of a victim to recover and to be \nsuccessful in court by providing better care, counseling, evidence \ncollection, support, and privacy for victims.\n  Florence McClure did not stop there. In the 1980s she turned her \nenergy to advocating for a women's prison in Las Vegas instead of in a \nrural setting, so the incarcerated women could be closer to their \nchildren for visitation. She lobbied for improved programs within the \nprisons. Today that facility carries her name.\n  On April 30, 2010, we honor ``Hurricane'' Florence McClure for her \noutspoken, courageous, life-changing advocacy for the rights of victims \nof rape and sexual assault. Her efforts have made Nevada a better, \nstronger home for women and children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2417-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Tyler Griffin\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise with a heavy heart today to mark \nthe passing of Marine LCpl Tyler Griffin.\n  Lance Corporal Griffin was just 19 years old when he died serving our \ncountry in Afghanistan. He was born and raised in Voluntown, a small, \nclose-knit community of just 2,600 in eastern Connecticut that today is \nstruggling with the loss of one of its finest young citizens.\n  He graduated from Griswold High School, where he played on the \nfootball team, and attended the Voluntown Baptist Church. Athletic and \nintelligent, he could have devoted himself to any career, but chose to \nserve his country with great pride.\n  Neighbors recall him as a community fixture who always had time for \nyounger kids. One says that they always knew when Tyler was home on \nleave, because a Marine Corps flag would fly proudly at his house. His \nfriends and neighbors remember him not only for the example he provided \nthrough his selfless service, but also for his kind manner and friendly \ndemeanor.\n  He was the product of a community that took great pride in their \ncourageous marine. Bill Martin lives next door to Lance Corporal \nGriffin's mother and stepfather. He told the New London Day that he \nwould often see Lance Corporal Griffin running around the neighborhood, \ngetting in shape for basic training. ``We'd see him out there on Route \n49,'' Martin said. ``He'd always wave.''\n  In short, Lance Corporal Griffin was everything you would raise your \nson to be. I join his family, his neighbors in Voluntown, and all \nAmericans in deep appreciation for his service and mourning for his \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2417-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBRANCE OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today in honor of National Day of \nService and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors of Terrorism. Today \nmarks the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, one of the \ndeadliest acts of domestic terrorism on American soil. This cowardly \nact of terrorism killed 168 people, 19 of them children. The victims \nwere mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandparents, grandchildren, \nfriends, and coworkers. Today we pause to reflect on their lives and \naccomplishments, and offer our thoughts and prayers to their families \nand loved ones.\n  The bombing in Oklahoma City was a direct attack against the \ndedicated men and women of the Federal Civil Service. The Alfred P. \nMurrah Federal Building housed 14 Federal agencies, and nearly 100 \nFederal employees lost their lives that morning.\n  We must honor their sacrifice by remaining steadfast in our \ncommitment to prevent future attacks on the Federal government, Federal \nemployees, and other acts of domestic terror. I am deeply troubled by \nrecent threats of violence against government employees. This February, \nan attack on Federal offices threatened the lives of 200 IRS workers \nand took the life of Vernon Hunter, a 20-year Army veteran who served \ntwo tours in Vietnam, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and mentor \nto coworkers at the IRS. The Oklahoma City bombing anniversary and this \nrecent attack serve as stark reminders that threats against Federal \nemployees may pose real dangers. They remind us of our solemn duty to \nprotect our public servants.\n  After the Oklahoma City bombing, President Bill Clinton directed the \nDepartment of Justice to assess the vulnerability of Federal office \nbuildings. Prior to this study, no formal government-wide standards \nexisted for Federal buildings. With the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security, the responsibility to protect our Federal facilities \nwas transferred to the Federal Protective Service, FPS.\n  FPS is full of dedicated men and women who work hard to keep our \nFederal buildings secure and those of us who work in them safe. \nHowever, critical reforms are needed to improve their effectiveness. \nThe Government Accountability Office has repeatedly highlighted \ntroubling shortfalls in FPS training, staffing, contract guard \noversight, and many other facets of the Federal building security \nstructure. It is long past time to address these critical gaps. We must \nmake sure that all Federal employees and members of the public are safe \nand secure in any Federal building.\n  As we remember the victims and survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing \nand other acts of terrorism, let us all take a moment to reflect upon \nthe dedication and sacrifices of our Nation's public servants. These \nare honorable men and women who provide critical services to the \nAmerican people, including policing our streets, ensuring our food and \ndrugs are safe, caring for our wounded warriors, and responding to \nnatural disasters. America's public servants deserve our gratitude and \nrespect. I thank them for their dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2417-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2417-S2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF HOSPITAL PATIENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week, the country took another \nimportant step toward a more just and perfect union when President \nObama issued a Presidential Memorandum on Respecting the Rights of \nHospital Patients to Receive Visitors and to Designate Surrogate \nDecision Makers for\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nMedical Emergencies. I applaud the President for this effort to ensure \nthat every person enjoys the same right to have their loved ones with \nthem in hospitals and to designate surrogate decision makers when they \nare hospitalized, often in their time of greatest need. No one should \nbe forced to face important medical decisions or spend their last \nmoments apart from their loved ones just because the person they love \nhappens to be of the same sex.\n  The President has directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto issue regulations prohibiting hospitals that participate in Medicare \nand Medicaid from denying visitation privileges on the basis of race, \ncolor, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, or disability. The memorandum issued last week also calls for \ngreater enforcement of existing regulations that ensure all patients' \nlegal representatives have the right to make informed decisions \nregarding patients' care.\n  There is a tragic history of discrimination in health care, but \nfortunately, we are making progress to end it. Hospitals were racially \nsegregated until the 1960s, when Congress passed legislation \nprohibiting that discrimination in hospitals that are recipients of \nFederal funding. The President's memorandum is a similarly important \nstep toward equal treatment. For too long, some hospital patients have \nbeen denied the basic rights of receiving visitors and designating \nsurrogate decision makers without a remedy in Federal law. In Vermont, \nmany same-sex couples have sought to be recognized as committed couples \nby law to ensure that they and their families are entitled to these \nrights. Those families should not lose those rights when traveling out \nof State.\n  The fight for equal rights protections continues in Congress. I am a \nproud cosponsor of the bipartisan Domestic Partnership Benefits and \nObligations Act of 2009, which would provide domestic partners of \nFederal employees all of the protections and benefits afforded to \nspouses of Federal employees, including participation in applicable \nretirement programs, compensation for work injuries and health \ninsurance benefits. I also support the Tax Equity for Health Plan \nBeneficiaries Act of 2009, which would end the taxation of health \nbenefits provided to domestic partners in workplaces that provide \ndomestic partner health benefits to their employees.\n  Respecting the rights of all hospital patients to have their loved \nones near in times of crisis is something every American should \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2418-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN-ISRAELI PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to reflect on the current state \nof the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the special role the \nUnited States must play in moving these talks forward.\n  Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians have been stalled \nfor nearly a year. To restart these talks it is abundantly clear that \nit will require great courage amongst the negotiating parties to \nnegotiate in good faith. Efforts to negotiate a lasting peace in the \nregion have been interrupted by violent clashes and mistrust. When it \ncomes to peace, no one should doubt the sincere yearning of the Israeli \nand Palestinian people. Their dream of peace will be best realized when \nour countries work together.\n  Ever since Israel declared independence in 1948, the United States \nand Israel have enjoyed a close friendship. And our support for Israel \nremains unwavering. For over a half-century Israel has been a pillar of \nfreedom and democracy in the Middle East. In the face of countless \nthreats and challenges it is this commitment to freedom that has kept \nour relationship strong. In the past Israel played an integral role in \ncombating Soviet expansionism in the Middle East during the Cold War. \nToday it stands with the U.S. in confronting Iran in its dangerous \npursuit of a nuclear program.\n  Israel is an important strategic partner of the United States. Our \nnational interests are linked through our ongoing cooperation in trade, \ndiplomacy, intelligence, weapons development and military exercises. \nSince 1985, the U.S. has provided nearly $3 billion in grants to Israel \nannually. I am confident that we in Congress will continue to provide \nthe assistance that befits such long-standing strategic allies.\n  While there are moments of disagreement between Israel and the U.S., \nthey do not affect the mutual interests that we share in the Middle \nEast. The cause of freedom unites our vision for a peaceful future. It \nis critical that we continue our longstanding relationship of trust and \ncooperation as we meet the common challenges we face today. During rare \nmoments of disagreement, it is best for two allies to resolve them \nprivately and amicably. We should not allow our occasional differences \nto be exploited by our adversaries.\n  Restoration of the peace process is a shared goal because its \nbenefits are shared. For Israel, a lasting peace agreement brings \nassured peace to a land where peace has for too long been fleeting. For \nthe U.S., the pursuit of a mid-east peace deal illustrates America's \ncommitment to working for peace and security. Comprehensive peace in \nthe Middle East is, and should remain, one of the U.S. highest foreign \npolicy priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2418-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2418-S2419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESERVE COMPONENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, it is with pride that I bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a recent series of programs conducted in \nDowning Grove, IL, relating to medical care for our servicemembers. The \nprograms were sponsored by the Dupage Medical Group and the Defense \nEducation Forum of the Reserve Officers Association of the United \nStates, ROA. They were part of an ongoing series of six programs held \nover the past 2 years by these entities and related to the Reserve \nComponents and military medicine.\n  In November of last year, the topic was Mental Health Care Programs \nfor the Reserve Components and their Families. As we all know, the \nsignature injuries of the current overseas wars have been head injuries \nresulting in some degree of traumatic brain injury, TBI, and post \ntraumatic stress syndrome, PTSD. Treatment for our wounded warriors \nwith these injuries is paramount and has been correctly made a priority \nby the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The most \nrecent of the programs was on the lessons in military medicine from \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, which was \nconducted on April 9, 2010. It had a distinguished faculty and featured \nDr. Paul DeFina, chairman of the International Brain Research \nInstitute, who discussed brain trauma and its latest treatments.\n  I am especially proud of the efforts of several of my constituents, \nnotably, COL Janet Kamer and the doctors of the DuPage Medical Group, \nin developing and hosting these programs together with the Defense \nEducation Forum. Colonel Kamer is the command consultant for psychology \nto Air Force Reserve Headquarters and a psychologist with the DuPage \nMedical Group. She is also the president of the Illinois Department of \nthe Reserve Officers Association.\n  MG Robert Kasulke also deserves recognition for his efforts in \ncohosting these programs. He is commander of the Army Reserve Medical \nCommand and a vascular surgeon in his civilian career. RADM Paul Kayye \n(Retired), the national president of ROA, has also played a part in \nthese medical care programs by introducing the April 9, 2010, program. \nOther faculty for these programs that deserve recognition includes: BG \nMargaret Wilmoth, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nHealth Affairs; COL Nicole Keesee, deputy surgeon in the Office of the \nChief of the Army Reserve; Sergio Estrada, assistant director of the \nIllinois Department of Veterans Affairs; Adermi Olodun, of the DOD \nEmployer Partnership Program; and Bob Feidler, the director of the \nDefense Education Forum. Participants of the meetings included medical \nproviders, local representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nother caregivers, medical and legal, and several of our wounded \nwarriors.\n  It is through people such as Dr. Kamer, the DuPage Medical Group and \nthe Defense Education Forum of ROA, and the distinguished faculty of \nthese programs that the most up-to-date information is being provided \nto the medical community, Reservists and their families about the \nvarious programs and treatments available to\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nthem.

Madam President, each of us privileged to serve in this \nChamber knows that the Senate and each of our offices could not operate \nsuccessfully without the assistance of talented and dedicated staff. \nOne former Senator who certainly knew this was my fellow Kansan, Bob \nDole. During his nearly 35 years in the House and Senate--and most \nespecially during his decade as Senate Republican Leader--Bob was ably \nassisted by some of Capitol Hill's best and brightest.\n  One of those individuals was Jim Whittinghill, who many of my \ncolleagues will remember from his years as Bob's deputy chief of staff. \nJim passed away on Thursday. I have been in contact with Senator Dole \nsince learning of Jim's passing, and he asked me to enter the following \nstatement in the Congressional Record:\n\n       Jim Whittinghill--or ``Whit'' as his friends called him--\n     and he had many--worked with me during my time as Senate \n     Republican leader from 1986 until 1994 in a series of \n     positions, including Deputy Chief of Staff. Whit was a top \n     flight staffer who provided me with counsel on a wide variety \n     of issues, including 2nd amendment rights and energy. He was \n     a proud Republican, but he was respected on both sides of the \n     aisle. Democrat Senators and staffers knew that Whit's word \n     was his bond, and he was very influential and helpful in \n     reaching bi-partisan agreements. After his years on Capitol \n     Hill, Whit went on to have a very successful career in the \n     private sector. He will be greatly missed by all those who \n     worked with him.\n\n  On a personal note, let me add that I was in the House of \nRepresentatives when Whit was working for Bob, and I agree with all \nthat Bob said about him. I know I join with many others in this Chamber \nwho knew Whit in extending our condolences to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2419-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CRAIG F.

Craig's winning photos \ntracked Ian Fisher's 2-year journey as a high school graduate in \nLakewood, CO, to his yearlong deployment in Iraq.\n  The ``American Soldier'' project was a three-part series of photos \nthat told a compelling story and captured the raw emotional \nrollercoaster of one young man's decision and transition to become a \nsoldier. There is something about a photo that has the ability to \ncapture the truth in a single, fleeting moment. This series of photos \ncaptures individual moments that, when combined, create a powerful \nstory that everyone can connect to on an emotional level. During these \ntimes when we are fighting two wars overseas, it is important to remind \nevery American that these soldiers are regular people who have heard \nthe call of duty and dedicated their lives to serve their country.\n  Winning a Pulitzer Prize is the highest honor for a journalist, and I \nam proud that a photojournalist from Colorado's Denver Post received \nsuch a prestigious award, especially on such an important story. Craig \nshould feel very proud of his work, and I congratulate him again for \nthis great honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2419-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BROOKE JEAN ANDERSON\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming affirming Wyoming's sovereignty under \n     the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     of America over all powers not otherwise enumerated and \n     granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the \n     United States of America; to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States reads as follows: ``The powers not delegated to \n     the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n     to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \n     the people''; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of \n     federal power as being that specifically granted by the \n     Constitution of the United States and no more; and\n       Whereas, the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment \n     means that the federal government was created by the states \n     specifically to be an agent of the states; and\n       Whereas, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of \n     the federal government; and\n       Whereas, many federal laws are directly in violation of the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment assures that we, the people of \n     the United States of America and each sovereign state in the \n     union of states, now have, and have always had, rights the \n     federal government may not usurp; and\n       Whereas, Section 4, Article IV, of the Constitution says, \n     ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this \n     Union a Republican Form of Government,'' and the Ninth \n     Amendment states that ``The enumeration in the Constitution, \n     of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or \n     disparage others retained by the people''; and\n       Whereas, Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative \n     and regulatory processes of the states; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress frequently considers \n     and enacts laws, and the executive agencies of the federal \n     government frequently promulgate regulations, the \n     constitutional authority for which is either absent or \n     tenuous, including, without limitation, the Real ID Act, \n     which imposes significant unfunded mandates upon the states \n     with respect to the traditional state function of drivers \n     licensing, the Endangered Species Act, which, as construed by \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, authorizes a \n     federal executive agency to require specific state \n     legislation related to the traditional state function of \n     wildlife management, the Clean Water Act, which, as construed \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency, authorizes a federal \n     executive agency to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over \n     waters that are not subject to federal regulation, the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which implements a \n     policy of federal lands retention in derogation of the \n     ``equal footing'' doctrine. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the State of Wyoming Legislature claims \n     sovereignty on behalf of the State of Wyoming and for its \n     citizens under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and \n     granted to the federal government or reserved to the people \n     by the Constitution of the United States.\n       Section 2. That the rights and liberties of Wyoming, its \n     costates and their respective citizens must be protected from \n     any dangers by declaring that Congress is limited by the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \n     that this state calls on its costates for an expression of \n     their sentiments on acts not authorized by the United States \n     Constitution.\n       Section 3. That this resolution serve as notice and demand \n     to the federal government, as our agent, to cease and desist, \n     effective immediately, from enacting mandates that are beyond \n     the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers. The \n     state of Wyoming will not enforce such mandates.\n       Section 4. That all compulsory federal legislation that \n     directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal \n     penalties or sanctions be prohibited or repealed.\n       Section 5. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation, with a request that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the congressional \n     record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-95. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming requesting Congress oppose House \n     Resolution 980, titled the Northern Rockies Ecosystem \n     Protection Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 980 was introduced in the United States House \n     of Representatives on February 11, 2009; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 980 would designate an additional six million \n     five hundred fourteen thousand (6,514,000) acres to the \n     national wilderness system in the Greater Yellowstone \n     Ecosystem, regardless of their unsuitability and failure to \n     meet the wilderness criteria outlined in the 1964 Wilderness \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, these additions to the National Wilderness System \n     will have tremendous negative impacts to the economies of the \n     counties in which they occur and ultimately to the economy of \n     surrounding counties and the State of Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, the continuance of all multiple use activities, \n     including motorized recreation, outfitting, grazing, timber \n     harvesting activities and mineral development is crucial to \n     the long term economic diversity of all Wyoming counties and \n     the State of Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, the Wyoming congressional delegation, representing \n     a state heavily impacted by the proposed wilderness \n     expansion, is not on record in support of the designation; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress does not customarily \n     make wilderness designations without first seeking \n     concurrence with the states affected. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the Legislature of the State of Wyoming is \n     adamantly opposed to the Northern Rockies Ecosystem \n     Protection Act, H.R. 980, and hereby requests that the United \n     States House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee \n     oppose this legislation.\n       Section 2. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation, with a request that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the congressional \n     record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-96. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming relative to Congress amending the tenth \n     amendment of the Constitution of the United States and \n     amending the interstate commerce clause, article 1, section 8 \n     of the Constitution; to the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the tenth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States reads as follows: ``The powers not delegated to \n     the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n     to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \n     the people.''; and\n       Whereas, the tenth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States defines the total scope of federal power as \n     being that\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\n     specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States \n     and no more; and\n       Whereas, the scope of the power defined by the tenth \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States means that \n     the federal government was created by the states specifically \n     to be an agent of the states; and\n       Whereas, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of \n     the federal government; and\n       Whereas, many powers assumed by the federal government and \n     federal mandates are directly in violation of the tenth \n     amendment to the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the interstate commerce clause in article 1, \n     section 8 of the Constitution of the United States provides \n     that Congress shall have the power: ``To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with \n     Indian Tribes;'' and\n       Whereas, the interstate commerce clause is limited to the \n     federal government regulating trade between the states and \n     between the states and other nations, to help prevent \n     conflicts between states over commercial activities and to \n     prevent the erection of barriers to commerce between the \n     states; and\n       Whereas, the interstate commerce clause should not be used \n     to provide Congress with authority to regulate matters that \n     are primarily intrastate with only an insignificant or \n     collateral effect upon interstate commerce; and\n       Whereas, many federal laws are beyond the scope and intent \n     of the interstate commerce clause and the tenth amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the tenth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States assures that we, the people of the United \n     States of America and each sovereign state in the union of \n     states, now have, and have always had, rights the federal \n     government may not usurp; and\n       Whereas, article 4, section 4, of the Constitution of the \n     United States says: ``The United States shall guarantee to \n     every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government,'' \n     and the ninth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States adds ``The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain \n     rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others \n     retained by the people.''; and\n       Whereas, Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative \n     and regulatory processes of the states. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the Wyoming Congressional delegation and \n     Congress take action to initiate the amendment process \n     provided by article 5 of the Constitution of the United \n     States to amend the tenth amendment and article 1, section 8 \n     (the interstate commerce clause), of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       Section 2. That Congress amend the tenth amendment of the \n     Constitution of the United States as follows, with proposed \n     changes indicated in italic text:\n       The powers not expressly delegated to the United States by \n     the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. This \n     amendment shall be considered by all courts as a rule of \n     interpretation and construction in any case involving an \n     interpretation of any constitutional power claimed by the \n     Congress.\n       Section 3. That Congress amend the interstate commerce \n     clause, article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the \n     United States as follows, with proposed changes indicated in \n     italic text:\n       To directly regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and \n     among the several states, and with the Indian Tribes, with no \n     authority in Congress to regulate matters that are primarily \n     intrastate with only an insignificant or collateral effect \n     upon interstate commerce;\n       Section 4. That Congress shall specify that the amendments \n     to the tenth amendment and the interstate commerce clause, \n     article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United \n     States, as provided herein, shall be operative upon \n     ratification by the legislatures of three-fourths of the \n     several states, provided that such ratification shall occur \n     within seven years from the date of the submission of the \n     amendments to the states by Congress.\n       Section 5. That this state calls on its costates for an \n     expression of their sentiments on the need to amend the tenth \n     amendment and article 1, section 8 of the Constitution of the \n     United States as provided in this resolution.\n       Section 6.\n       (a) That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit copies \n     of this resolution:\n       (i) To the President of the United States, to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of the United States Congress and to the Wyoming \n     Congressional Delegation, with a request that the Wyoming \n     Congressional delegation take all reasonable and necessary \n     actions to initiate the amendment process to amend the \n     Constitution of the United States consistent with the \n     language proposed in this resolution and that this resolution \n     be officially entered in the congressional record as a \n     memorial to the Congress of the United States of America; and\n       (ii) To the speaker of the house of representatives and \n     president of the senate, or their equivalent, and the \n     governor of each of the other forty-nine states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2421-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Boxer), from the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works, with an amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute:\n       S. 1397.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na study of alternatives for commemorating interpreting the role of the \nBuffalo Soldiers in the early years of the National Parks, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer to introduce the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \nStudy Act. This legislation is an important step in preserving the \nlegacy of the Army's first all-black infantry and cavalry units and \ntheir unique role in the creation of our National Park system.\n  Established Congressionally by 1869, the Buffalo Soldiers served \nbravely in campaigns both at home and abroad before being stationed at \nthe military Presidio in San Francisco and given charge of patrolling \nthe National Park system. Although first tasked with taming the \nfrontier, these troops also took on the responsibility of preserving \nthat wilderness for future generations. Each summer, Buffalo Soldier \nregiments traveled roughly 320 miles from San Francisco to either \nSequoia or Yosemite National Park, where they patrolled the parks for \npoachers and loggers, built trails, and escorted visitors. They were, \nin essence if not in name, the nation's first park rangers.\n  In a time of segregation and adversity, these soldiers served their \ncountry bravely and the National Parks they worked to establish are \npart of the legacy they leave behind. Unfortunately, this unique aspect \nof their history is neither widely recognized nor remembered. This \nlegislation would address that by authorizing a study to determine the \nmost appropriate way to memorialize the Buffalo Soldiers. Money \nprocured under the act would be used to determine the feasibility of \nestablishing a national historic trail along the route traveled by the \nBuffalo Soldiers, scout for properties to add to the National Register \nof Historic Places, and develop educational initiatives and a public \nawareness campaign about the contribution of African-American soldiers \nafter the Civil War.\n  although the experiences of the Buffalo Soldiers are an important \npiece of our national history, we are in danger of losing their legacy \nto the passage of time unless we take conscious steps to preserve the \nmemory. This legislation works to ensure that the contributions of the \nBuffalo Soldiers will be remembered and shared by all. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in their support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers in the \n     National Parks Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the late 19th century and early 20th century, \n     African-American troops who came to be known as the Buffalo \n     Soldiers served in many critical roles in the western United \n     States, including protecting some of the first National \n     Parks.\n       (2) Based at the Presidio in San Francisco, Buffalo \n     Soldiers were assigned to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks \n     where they patrolled the backcountry, built trails, stopped \n     poaching, and otherwise served in the roles later assumed by \n     National Park rangers.\n       (3) The public would benefit from having opportunities to \n     learn more about the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \n     and their contributions to the management of National Parks \n     and the legacy of African-Americans in the post-Civil War \n     era.\n       (4) As the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016 \n     approaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct \n     research and increase public awareness of the stewardship \n     role the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize a \n     study to determine the most effective ways to increase \n     understanding and public awareness of the critical role that \n     the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act amendments of 2010. The Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act, known as RECA, was first introduced in this \nbody 21 years ago today. Proposed by the Senator from Utah, Orrin \nHatch, this original legislation was a monumental step in recognizing \nsome of the unheralded victims of the Cold-War era.\n  As the United States Government built up its Cold-War nuclear arsenal \nduring the mid-20th century, many Americans paid the price with their \nhealth. Some were sickened through exposure to aboveground atomic \nweapons tests. Others were exposed to heavy doses of radiation from \nworking in the uranium mining industry. All the while the government \nwas slow to implement Federal protections.\n  As a result, a generation of Americans who worked in the mines or \nlived near testing sites became sick with serious diseases such as lung \ncancer and kidney disease and many others.\n  Much of the U.S. uranium development occurred on the Navajo Nation. \nThat is where jobs in the mines and mills drew workers from the \nsurrounding rural areas. These workers and much of the country were \nunaware of the dangers of radiation exposure, and this was despite \nreports from the European mining industry indicating that uranium \nmining led to high rates of lung cancer. There should have been a \nwarning call, there should have been a wake-up call, but there wasn't.\n  In the ensuing years, rates of lung cancer among Navajo Indians went \nfrom disproportionately low to disproportionately high compared with \nthe rest of the U.S. population. This was clearly a result of uranium \ndevelopment and related radiation exposure.\n  In addition to lung cancer, numerous other illnesses began to emerge \nin the men and women who worked in the uranium mining industry. These \nindividuals were not limited to the Navajo Nation. In my home State of \nNew Mexico, the Pueblo of Laguna was home to the Nation's largest open \npit uranium mine. Workers from across the State came to the mines, \nespecially from the economically struggling communities of rural New \nMexico.\n  In the late 1970s, my father, Stewart Udall, took up the fight for \nthese workers. In 1979, my father filed 32 claims against the \nDepartment of Energy on behalf of widows of deceased Navajo uranium \nminers. In many ways, this marked the beginning of the fight for \ncompensation for all uranium workers.\n  I remember working those years with my whole family to collect \ninformation and push for recognition. It was a family effort to fight \nfor justice, and for me it continues to be a family priority.\n  Ten years later, the original RECA legislation was introduced in the \nSenate. It passed in 1990, giving a level of restitution to sick miners \nand millers, as well as individuals living downwind of nuclear tests. \nAmendments to RECA have occurred over the ensuing decades, most \nsignificantly in 2000. That is when the act was expanded to include \nmill workers and ore transporters and expand downwind counties, among \nother things.\n  Today, with Senators Jeff Bingaman, Mike Crapo, Mark Udall, Michael \nBennet, and James Risch, I introduced a piece of legislation that takes \nthe next step in addressing the remaining shortfalls of the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act. I wish to highlight some of the provisions \nof our bill.\n  First, the inclusion of post-1971 uranium miners and workers as \nqualified claimants. While the Federal Government ceased the purchase \nof domestic uranium in 1971, implementation of Federal work safety \nstandards was slow and regulation of mines was poor. As a result, \nthousands of miners and millers were never made aware of the dangers of \nthe yellow cake they handled on a regular basis.\n  In recent surveys, the majority of uranium workers from this period \nreported they did not have showers or wash basins in the mines where \nthey worked. They often took contaminated clothing home for laundering, \nunaware of the hazards, and with no other option for cleaning. Many \nalso reported that ventilation to prevent unnecessary exposure was not \nprovided in their work areas.\n  Today, these workers continue to suffer and die from illnesses \nrelated to radiation exposure. But because their employment dates began \nafter 1971, they have no opportunity for compensation. Our bill changes \nthat. If the measure passes, individuals working from 1971 until 1990 \nwill qualify to claim compensation for exposure-related diseases.\n  The bill we are introducing today would also expand the geographic \nareas that qualify for downwind compensation to include New Mexico, \nIdaho, Montana, Colorado, and Guam. And for the first time, the bill \nrecognizes downwind exposure from the original atomic weapons test \nsite--the Trinity Site in New Mexico.\n  This legislation would raise compensation levels for those exposed as \na result of aboveground weapons tests. This would make their \ncompensation consistent with their counterparts who worked in the mines \nand mills.\n  The bill would also facilitate epidemiological research on the \nimpacts of uranium development on communities and families of uranium \nworkers. It authorizes funding for the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences to award grants to universities and \nnonprofits to carry out such research. We are seeking to broaden the \nuse of affidavits to substantiate employment history and residence in \nan affected downwind area.\n  Many who have suffered as a result of Cold-War uranium and weapons \ndevelopment did not have the documentation to prove their exposure. \nOften mines and mills did not keep proper documentation of their \nworkers, and many communities impacted did not have a tradition of \nkeeping birth and marriage certification. The bill would allow \nindividuals to combine their time worked in multiple positions to meet \nthe work time requirements for compensation in the original RECA \nlegislation.\n  Finally, this legislation would allow miners to be compensated for \nkidney disease, and it would allow core drillers to join miners, \nmillers, and ore transporters on the current list of uranium workers \nwho qualify for compensation under the act.\n  Uranium and weapons development of the Cold-War era left a gruesome \nlegacy in communities of mine workers and downwinders. For more than \ntwo decades now the United States has tried to compensate in some way \nfor the sickness and loss of life. Today, we are taking the next step \nto close this sad chapter in history and to improve the reach of \ncompassionate compensation to those Americans who have suffered but \nhave not qualified under RECA in its current form.\n  In introducing this legislation, I honor all those who continue to \nsuffer from deadly illnesses as a result of radiation exposure but \ndon't qualify for compensation--especially those workers who began \nemployment after 1971 and, thus, do not qualify for RECA.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to recognize these \nindividuals and expand RECA to include all who are justified in \nreceiving radiation exposure compensation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3227. A bill to authorize the Archivist of the United States to \nmake grants to States for the preservation and dissemination of \nhistorical records; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Preserving the \nAmerican Historical Record Act, a bill that I introduced along with \nSenator Levin today. This is a piece of legislation designed to ensure \nthe protection of important historical documents housed and preserved \nat the State and local level.\n  Put simply, this legislation would require the Archivist of the \nUnited States to make grants to the States for a number of purposes, \nincluding protecting historical records, promoting the use of such \nrecords in new and creative ways, providing education and training to \nthose who care for historical records and creating a wide variety of \naccess tools of key records maintained by State and local \norganizations. The bill authorizes $50,000,000 a year--a very modest \nsum, all things considered--to be distributed among the States \naccording to formulas based on both size and geographical area.\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n  We live in a time where there has been a resurgence in interest in \nfamily history and genealogical research. With the advancement of \ninternet research tools, millions of Americans have gone online to \nlearn more about their pasts. Indeed, this type of research is among \nthe more prominent uses of Internet resources, as evidenced by the \ngrowth of websites and services like Ancestry.com and Family Search. \nAlso, millions of Americans have tuned into hit television shows \ndescribing the experience and revelation that comes with the discovery \nof one's family history.\n  I want to thank Senator Levin for working with me on this \nlegislation, as well as our cosponsors Senators Bennett, Schumer, \nKerry, Shaheen, and Gillibrand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 488--CONGRATULATING THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY \n   IFC/PANHELLENIC DANCE MARATHON (THON) ON ITS CONTINUED SUCCESS IN \n  SUPPORT OF THE FOUR DIAMONDS FUND AT PENN STATE HERSHEY CHILDREN'S \n                                HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 488\n\n       Whereas the Pennsylvania State IFC/Panhellenic Dance \n     Marathon, known as THON, is the largest student-run \n     philanthropy in the world, with 700 dancers, more than 300 \n     supporting organizations, and more than 15,000 volunteers \n     involved in the annual event;\n       Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State \n     University annually collect money and dance for 46 hours \n     straight at the Bryce Jordan Center for THON, bringing energy \n     and excitement to campus for a mission to conquer cancer, and \n     bringing awareness to countless thousands more;\n       Whereas all THON activities support the mission of the Four \n     Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, \n     which provides financial and emotional support to pediatric \n     cancer patients and their families and funds cancer research;\n       Whereas each year, THON is the single largest donor to the \n     Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, \n     having raised nearly $68,900,000 since 1977, when the 2 \n     organizations first became affiliated;\n       Whereas in 2010, THON set a new fundraising record of over \n     $7,830,000, besting the previous record of $7,500,000 was set \n     in 2009;\n       Whereas THON support has helped more than 2,000 families \n     through the Four Diamonds Fund, is currently helping to build \n     a new Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn State Hershey \n     Children's Hospital, and has helped support pediatric cancer \n     research that has caused some pediatric cancer survival rates \n     to increase to nearly 90 percent; and\n       Whereas THON has inspired similar events and organizations \n     across the Nation, including at high schools and colleges, \n     and continues to encourage students across the Nation to \n     volunteer and stay involved in great charitable causes in \n     their community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Pennsylvania State University IFC/\n     Panhellenic Dance Marathon (THON) on its continued success in \n     support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey \n     Children's Hospital; and\n       (2) commends the Pennsylvania State University students, \n     volunteers, and supporting organizations for their hard work \n     putting together another record-breaking THON.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to commend the \nPennsylvania State University and the many students across the \nCommonwealth who each year play a very important role in the fight \nagainst cancer.\n  The Pennsylvania State University IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, \nreferred to as ``THON,'' is a yearlong effort to raise funds and \nawareness for the fight against pediatric cancer. The effort culminates \nin a 2-day, no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon. Since 1977, THON \nhas raised more than $60 million for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn \nState Children's Hospital. The Four Diamonds Fund was established by \nCharles and Irma Millard, after the death of their son, Christopher, \nwho was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 11. In addition to helping \nwith the cost of treatment that insurance does not cover, as well as \nexpenses that may disrupt the welfare of the child, the Four Diamonds \nFund supports the medical teams that care for the children and funds \npediatric cancer research through start-up grants and the Four Diamonds \nPediatric Cancer Research Institute.\n  Since its inception, THON has assisted over 2,000 families and no \nfamily has been turned away from the Four Diamonds Fund. The hard work, \ndedication, and enthusiasm of thousands of student volunteers and \nhundreds of dancers combine with the support of the wider Penn State \ncommunity and students across the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to make \na potent weapon in the fight against pediatric cancer. Thanks to their \nefforts, the fight is one we are ever closer to winning.\n  To win the fight against pediatric cancer, and all cancers, once and \nfor all, we need to continue to support vital medical research. When I \ncame to the U.S. Senate in 1981, funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth totaled $3.6 billion. Since becoming LHHS chairman in 1996, I \nhave successfully worked to more than double NIH funding, which was \n$12.7 billion at that time. The fiscal year 2010 LHHS Appropriations \nbill provided $30.2 billion for NIH funding, an almost $1 billion \nincrease from fiscal year 2009. I also secured an additional $10 \nbillion in funding through an amendment to the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act.\n  I have fought and will continue to fight for increased funding for \nthe NIH because medical research saves and improves lives. Medical \nresearch, along with significant community support through efforts such \nas THON, provides children with a real chance to be cured so that they \nmay continue to grow and prosper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2427-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2427-S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 489--HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. \n                           BENJAMIN L.

Res. 489, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 489) honoring the life and \n     achievements of Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, on April 15, Benjamin Hooks died in \nthe city where he was born 85 years ago, the city of Memphis. Later \nthis afternoon, Senator Burris, Senator Corker, and I will introduce a \nresolution honoring the life and achievement of Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks.\n  Benjamin Hooks was certainly one of Tennessee's most distinguished \ncitizens and one of America's leaders in this last half century. He was \na patriot, a family man, a visionary, a lawyer, a storyteller, a \npreacher, and for my wife and me, he and his wife Frances were close \nand good friends.\n  There will be a funeral service in Memphis on Wednesday. I will \nattend it and will make remarks there. But I wanted to say a few words \nabout my friend Dr. Hooks on the floor of the Senate today.\n  Ben Hooks was born January 31, 1925. He leaves his wife Frances and \nhis daughter Patricia Gray and two grandsons. He was the fifth of seven \nchildren born to Robert B. and Bessie Hooks. Right from the beginning, \nhe was part of a pioneering family. He was the grandson of Julia Hooks, \nthe second Black woman in the United States to graduate from college.\n  Young Ben Hooks went on to LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis and \ngraduated from Howard. He served in the U.S. Army. He was a patriot. \nWhile in the Army, he learned something more about injustice when he \nfound that some of the prisoners of war he guarded had more rights than \nhe did to eat in a restaurant. His pioneering continued when he went \nback home to Memphis after the war.\n  First, he had to get a law degree. At that time, no Tennessee law \nschool would accept an African-American law student. It was the same in \nArkansas. I remember George Haley, the brother of Alex Haley--that is \nanother Tennessee family, the Haleys--George Haley was able to go to \nthe University of Arkansas at about the same time and was required to \nsit by himself in a separate room because they simply didn't know what \nto do with an African-American student.\n  Ben Hooks choose to go to DePaul University in Chicago, where he \nreceived his law degree in 1984, and came back to Memphis. He kept \npioneering. He was one of the few African-American lawyers to set up \nhis own practice in Memphis. He was appointed to the Shelby County \nCriminal Court by Governor Frank Clement of Tennessee in 1965, making \nhim the first Black criminal court judge in the history of our State.\n  He and Dr. Martin Luther King worked together. He lived to see Dr. \nKing go over from being someone who was reviled to someone who was \nhonored by having a national holiday in his name.\n  In 1972, Benjamin Hooks became the first Black appointee to the \nFederal Communications Commission. That was at the recommendation of \nSenator Howard Baker, a Republican Senator, and a Republican President, \nRichard Nixon. Ben Hooks was able to support leaders of both parties. \nHe supported the 1972 Presidential Republican ticket. He supported \nSenator Baker in his\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nraces. His wife Frances supported me every time I ran for public office \nin Tennessee, which has been a lot, five different times. Everybody \nknew that Frances Hooks would not have been supporting me if Ben Hooks \ndid not know about it. In fact, it is hard to think of Ben Hooks \nwithout Frances. I cannot think of a time I talked with him when I did \nnot start with her. She was his sweetheart, his ally, his secretary, \nhis assistant, his adviser, and all of us send to her and her family \nour thoughts during these days. I talked with her for a few minutes a \nwhile ago.\n  Benjamin Hooks became best known in this country when he was elected \nexecutive director of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People, NAACP, in 1976. He served in that role until 1992. \nDuring that time the NAACP grew by hundreds of thousands of members due \nto Ben Hooks' leadership.\n  Ben Hooks was an ordained minister. He delivered sermons for more \nthan half a century. They were sermons well worth hearing. Ben Hooks \nhad the combined gifts of a Southern preacher, a Southern lawyer, and a \nSouthern politician, and he could turn a phrase and turn the audience \ninside out and upside down with his phrases as well as anyone I have \never heard.\n  One of his most touching speeches was his eulogy at the funeral of a \nformer Tennessee Senator, Albert Gore, Sr., which I heard in Nashville.\n  In March of 2001, Benjamin and Frances Hooks renewed their wedding \nvows after almost 50 years of marriage.\n  In November of 2007, just about 2\\1/2\\ years ago, Benjamin Hooks was \nawarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor \nin the United States, by President George W. Bush.\n  He helped to establish, in his hometown of Memphis, the Benjamin \nHooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis. In \ntalking with some of the faculty members at that institute a few years \nago, one of them said Ben Hooks understands our country is a work in \nprogress. He had seen the hard parts of it. He had seen the injustice \nof it. Before he died, he was still sad and angry about some of the \ninjustices that exist today. But he had also seen the promise of it as \nwell. Through his lifetime, he had lived through the King days; the \nsit-ins; the days of the first Black criminal court justice, where it \nwas commonplace for African Americans to graduate from law school; the \nelection of the first African-American President; the rise of the \nNAACP. Ben Hooks saw the great promise of American life.\n  After he was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2007 by the President, I \nhosted a lunch for him in the Senate Dining Room downstairs. Those who \ncome to the Senators' dining room are accustomed to seeing \ndistinguished visitors. In fact, that is why most people go the \nSenators' dining room--to be seen. But that day Ben Hooks took over the \ndining room. He was by far the most distinguished visitor there. Some \nvery well known people came to pay respect to him. One of them was the \nlate Jack Kemp, who worked with Dr. Hooks on civil rights issues for \nmany years. But the greatest commotion was caused by the people who \nwork in the Senators' dining room--those who serve, those who wait \ntables, those who cook in the kitchen. They all wanted to shake Ben \nHooks' hand. They wanted to say hello to him. They wanted his \nautograph. And most wanted his picture.\n  We will miss Ben Hooks' leadership. We will miss his vision. We will \nmiss his capacity to work with Republicans as well as Democrats. \nTennessee has lost one of its most distinguished citizens. But we are \ngrateful for that life, and in Memphis on Wednesday we will celebrate \nthe life of Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I do want to say that Tennessee has lost \na great human being in Dr. Benjamin Hooks, and I want to join with my \nfriend and colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, in being part \nof a resolution to talk about his wonderful life. I know we will be \nhaving ceremonies in Tennessee this Wednesday, but certainly he was a \nwonderful individual who did much to benefit our country, and we all \nare saddened by his passing.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of the \nReverend Benjamin Lawson Hooks. I join all Americans in expressing my \nsadness at his passing and gratitude for his lifetime of service. Ben \nHooks was a man of faith who was dedicated to nonviolent change. He \nwill be remembered as one of the great civil rights champions of our \ntime.\n  Ben Hooks was born in Memphis, TN, at the height of the Jim Crow era \nin 1925. During World War II, he enlisted in the Army to fight for his \ncountry, a segregated nation that denied him access to many public \nvenues. Stationed in Italy, he was ordered to guard Italian prisoners \nof war, and like so many African-American soldiers at that time, he was \nutterly shocked to find that the very prisoners he guarded were \nadmitted to the all-White cafeteria, while he had to eat elsewhere. \nUpon returning to the United States, Ben Hooks completed his studies at \nHoward University and attended DePaul University College of Law in \nChicago.\n  But he never forgot his roots or the civil rights violations that he \nhad witnessed. After the war, he returned to his hometown of Memphis, \nTN, to open up a law practice and dedicate himself to the fight for the \nequality of all Americans. Of those years, he recalled: ``At that time \nyou were insulted by law clerks, excluded from white bar associations \nand when I was in court, I was lucky to be called `Ben.' Usually it was \njust `boy.' '' He also became a Baptist minister, joined the NAACP and \nparticipated in many civil rights protests. He joined Dr. Martin Luther \nKing Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which went on to \nspearhead the civil rights movement through famous nonviolent protests.\n  By 1965, Ben Hooks had made his mark on his home State, and was \nappointed to the Tennessee Criminal Court, making him the first Black \njudge since Reconstruction in a State trial court anywhere in the \nSouth. In years to come he would capture the attention of lawmakers in \nWashington, and in 1972, President Nixon nominated Hooks to the Federal \nCommunications Commission. He became the first Black Commissioner on \nthe FCC, and served for 5 years. During his time there, he fought for \nunderrepresented minorities in the media and helped to increase the \nnumber of African-Americans employed at the FCC.\n  Despite all these accomplishments, Ben Hooks is likely to be best \nremembered for his 15 years as executive director of the NAACP. In \n2007, when President Bush presented him with the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, one of our country's highest civilian honors, saying: ``Dr. \nHooks was a calm yet forceful voice for fairness, opportunity and \npersonal responsibility. He never tired or faltered in demanding that \nour Nation live up to its founding ideals of liberty and equality.''\n  His time at the NAACP was transformative. When he first arrived, \nmembership was down and the organization was saddled with debt, but he \ndeclared ``the civil rights movement is not dead. If anyone thinks that \nwe are going to stop agitating, they had better think again. If anyone \nthinks that we are going to stop litigating, they had better close the \ncourts. If anyone thinks that we are not going to demonstrate and \nprotest, they had better roll up the sidewalks.'' When he retired in \n1992, membership had dramatically increased and the organization had \nbeen completely reinvigorated and continues to be at the forefront of \nthe civil rights movement today.\n  The Reverend Jesse Jackson eloquently noted: ``Ben Hooks did it all, \ndid it well, and he did it over a long period of time. He fought \ntirelessly to tear down walls that make today's bridges possible. He \ntook us from racial battleground to economic common ground, across \nlines of race and religion.''\n  Today, I add my voice to the chorus of praise for Ben Hooks. He was \nan honorable man who fought for equality and justice for all Americans \nand to fulfill the promise of our great Nation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SOLTES, JR., O.D. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BLIND \n                         REHABILITATION CENTER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 4360 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4360) to designate the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs blind rehabilitation center in Long Beach, \n     California, as the ``Major Charles Robert Soltes, Jr., O.D. \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitation Center.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nH.R. 4360 by unanimous consent. Major Soltes was truly an inspiration \nto all of us, and I am proud to support this legislation. Major Soltes \ndeployed to Iraq in 2004 and paid the ultimate sacrifice for our great \ncountry after the vehicle in which he was traveling ran over an \nimprovised explosive device. Throughout his career in the Army, he \nassumed many leadership positions, received numerous military \ndecorations, and was instrumental in establishing a free medical clinic \nfor the local population in Iraq.\n  It is particularly fitting that we are naming the VA blind \nrehabilitation center in Long Beach, CA, after Major Soltes. He was \nfrom Irvine, CA, a graduate of the New England College of Optometry, \nand completed his residency at the prestigious Brooke Army Medical \nCenter. He also served as the Director of the Optometry Residency \nProgram at the U.S. Military Academy. In 1999, Major Soltes became the \nclinical director of Irvine Vision Institute, an optometry specialty \ncenter where served until his voluntary deployment to Iraq.\n  Major Soltes leaves behind his wife, Sally Dang, O.D., and three \nyoung children. Dr. Dang is a low-vision optometrist who received her \ntraining at the West Haven VA Blind Rehabilitation Center after \ngraduating from the New England College of Optometry. She has recently \nvolunteered to provide low-vision services and care for blinded \nveterans to fulfill a promise she made to her husband before he \ndeployed to Iraq.\n  Major Soltes was a dedicated Army officer, and an outstanding \nclinician, educator, and military optometrist and naming the Long Beach \nVA blind rehabilitation center in honor of him will be a fitting \ntribute to his lasting memory.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4360) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/19/senate-section/article/S2431-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 20, 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
