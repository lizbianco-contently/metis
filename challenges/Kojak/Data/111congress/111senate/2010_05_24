Mr. President, it has been nearly 5 weeks since oil started \nspewing into the Gulf of Mexico and onto our shores. Millions of \ngallons, miles of polluted coastline, and more than a month later, the \nconsequences of our oil addiction are as clear as the gulf's waters \nonce were.\n  It has also become clear that the companies responsible for this \nspill were poorly prepared for this possibility. There is no question \nthat they failed to adequately invest in the technology necessary to \nrespond to such a catastrophe. Days have turned into weeks, while the \nexperts continue to experiment with ways to stop the spill. We still \ndon't know when the end will come so cleanup can finally begin.\n  Every year, these companies rake in record profits. Then they turn \nand spend that money on trying to find more oil. It is time they also \nfind safer ways to drill for it and handle it. The five top oil \ncompanies have made $\\3/4\\ trillion in profits--$750 billion--over the \npast decade, but the amount they have invested in cleanup technologies \nis negligible.\n  They have invested embarrassingly little in alternative fuels that \nwould make us more secure both at home and abroad. I don't mind oil \ncompanies or any other company making money, but these multibillion-\ndollar corporations are getting rich at the expense of our national \nsecurity, our economy, and our environment. Every day we pay unfriendly \nregimes to feed our oil addiction is a day we are less safe.\n  Everyone who stands in the way of diversifying our economy makes it \nharder for businesses to recover, for the unemployed to find work, and \nfor our communities to prosper. And every time we see precious water \nand wildlife coated in crude oil, the threat to our environment is \nimpossible to ignore. Pelicans were on the endangered species list. We \ntook them off. Now, by the hundreds, they are dying. Where they do \ntheir hatching is soaked in oil. We may lose our pelicans as a result \nof BP.\n  Weaning ourselves off oil is a hard fact for us to face. We consume \nmore\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\nthan 20 percent of the world's oil but produce less than 3 percent of \nthe world's oil. It is not a change we can make overnight, but if we \ndon't start, the next disaster could make the current one look like a \ndrop in the bucket.\n  I am tired of waiting for oil companies to get the message. America \nneeds clean alternatives more urgently than ever. In the meantime, \nthose responsible for this terrible oilspill must foot the bill. I am \ngoing to do everything I can to make sure they do foot that bill. \nTaxpayers will not pick up that tab.\n  This is the final week of what has been a long and productive \nsession. I know everybody is eager to return home to our States and \nmeet with constituents and see our families and honor the sacrifice of \nour Nation's bravest this Memorial Day, which is 1 week from today.\n  We have a lot to accomplish between now and then.\n  One, we must pass a new jobs bill that cuts taxes for middle-class \nfamilies and small businesses. It includes a host of tax credits, tax \nextenders, and tax incentives--all of which will help put people back \nto work. It is something Republicans and Democrats should come together \nto finish because it is something we can all be proud to support. More \nthan that, it is something each of our States desperately needs.\n  Two, we have to finish the supplemental war appropriations bill. I \nhave heard some on the other side vow they will stand in the way of \nthis funding. I can think of no worse message to send our troops over \nMemorial Day than that. I hope Republicans will work with us, not for \nour sake or their own but for the sake of our Nation's security and all \nthose whose service makes it strong.\n  Finally, scores of well-qualified nominees have been reported out of \ncommittee. They remain on the Senate calendar and are eager to fill \nthese important, vacant positions. They should not be. At this time we \nhave more than 100 nominations on the calendar. During the same period \nof time in the Bush administration, there were 13--that is 108 to 13. I \nhope we can confirm many of them this week so they can finally get to \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4108-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Americans cherish and respect their \nmilitary. They support and celebrate those who wear the uniform and \nserve our Nation. When our Nation is at war, they understand that this \nobligation of support deepens. Indeed, just Friday, I got forwarded to \nme an e-mail from a mother whose son was being deployed to Iraq, and \nshe said that the one thing critical to them was to feel they had the \nsupport of the American people.\n  The American people understand that no matter what your ideology, no \nmatter your view of the conflict we are engaged in, you have to support \nthose whom we in Congress have deployed to execute policies that the \nPresident and the Congress have adopted. They didn't adopt the \npolicies; we did. And when we send them, they deserve our support. The \nAmerican people understand that it is not about politics but about the \nduty of citizenship--a duty to stand in solidarity with those in harm's \nway and those who defend our freedoms.\n  I believe these sentiments--shared by Americans overwhelmingly--are \nimportant as we evaluate the conduct of President Obama's Supreme Court \nnominee, Elena Kagan. They will raise serious questions that really \nmust be answered before we have a final vote. I think it is just as \nimportant for me to say that.\n  Some people have suggested that the issue I am going to talk about is \nnot significant. I think it is. I was involved in the debate of the \nSolomon amendment. I remember how it happened.\n  Ms. Kagan, who became the dean of Harvard Law in 2003, kicked the \nmilitary off Harvard's campus and out of its campus recruitment office. \nShe gave the big law firms full access to recruit bright young \nassociates but obstructed the access of the military as it tried to \nrecruit bright young JAG officers to support and represent our soldiers \nas they were risking their lives for our country. It was an \nunjustifiable decision. But rather than acknowledge that Ms. Kagan had \nacted inappropriately, the Obama administration has instead done \nsomething that, to me, is odd: it has tried to defend this indefensible \nactivity--distorting the clear facts in the process. We need to get \nthat straight. As we begin to think about this nomination, we need to \nunderstand the facts.\n  During a recent television interview, Vice President Biden actually \nsaid that Ms. Kagan was ``right'' to interfere with military \nrecruitment. He then defended her conduct with the suggestion that she \nwas somehow acting under a court order to keep the military people off \ncampus. In reality--let's be correct--I misspoke--to keep the military \nfrom utilizing the normal recruitment offices available to every other \nlaw firm in America. In reality, the opposite situation is true. Ms. \nKagan disregarded the law, really, in essence, in order to obstruct \nmilitary recruitment during a time of war.\n  In 1995, Congress passed the Solomon amendment, which required \nuniversities to give equal access to military recruiters if they wished \nto continue to receive taxpayer funding for their university programs.\n  The passage of the Solomon amendment was a matter of a large national \ndebate. I suspect most Americans have a vivid recollection of those \ndiscussions. It was well known that certain law schools, such as \nHarvard, were blocking the military from going to their recruitment \noffices and utilizing the resources like any other entity could do.\n  Administrators at Harvard and other law schools had been restricting \naccess of military recruiters to campuses for several years, citing as \ntheir reason their opposition to President Clinton's don't ask, don't \ntell policy about gays in the military. That was something on which \nCongress had voted. It is a matter of statutory law, and President \nClinton had indicated his support in the way it would be enforced. It \ncame to be fairly settled as a national policy in that regard.\n  It was Congress's hope that the Solomon amendment would put an end to \nthis obstruction. It basically said: You cannot deny our military the \nright to come on campus if they are following U.S. law, and still get \nFederal money. But Harvard persisted nonetheless.\n  Finally, in 2002, I believe it was the Air Force that made an \nofficial complaint. The Department of Defense spoke up. It quoted the \nstatute that had been passed in the U.S. Code, title 10. They quoted it \nto Harvard and said: If you continue to deny entrance of our military \npersonnel to the recruiting centers, you get no more Federal money. At \nthat point, the principle evaporated. This great principle on which \nthey were standing, a little money dangled in front of them and they \nfolded on this point.\n  Dean Clark, Ms. Kagan's predecessor at Harvard, got the message, and \nhe complied. The restrictions on the military recruitment were lifted.\n  This means that when Ms. Kagan became dean of Harvard, the military \nhad full, open, and equal access to campus facilities. That is the \npolicy she inherited; that is the policy she deeply opposed; and that \nis the policy she set about to reverse.\n  Ms. Kagan began her efforts to reverse the policy when she joined 53 \nof her academic colleagues in filing a brief to challenge the Solomon \namendment. This case had been filed in another circuit, not Harvard's. \nIf their efforts in this legal attack were successful, they would again \nobstruct the military's access on campus, and they could do so without \nlosing Federal funds. That is what she wanted, no doubt about that.\n  Initially, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, not her circuit, heard \nthe case, and they issued a 2 to 1 decision that ordered the district \ncourt in New Jersey to issue a preliminary injunction suspending \nenforcement of the\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\nSolomon amendment in that district in New Jersey. The injunction was to \ntake effect after a certain time period. I believe 50 days. But that \ninjunction was never issued, even in that one district of New Jersey, \nbecause the Supreme Court of the United States undertook to hear the \ncase, and the court of appeals, respecting the Supreme Court's view, \neliminated their order staying the enforcement of the Solomon \namendment.\n  I note, even if the Third Circuit's ruling had not been stayed, it \nwould have applied only to the Third Circuit, not to Harvard. Remember, \nthe Solomon amendment was a duly enacted law passed by the Congress.\n  Fully understanding all of this, as the trained and educated dean she \nwas, Dean Kagan still used this ruling as a pretext to deny the \nenforceability of the Solomon amendment on the Harvard campus, again \nkicking the military out of the campus recruiting office. It did not \napply. It was never made applicable and certainly not made applicable \nto the Harvard campus. But yet she used that as a pretext to carry out \nher desires about the don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  But I am told: Don't worry about that, Jeff. They could still talk to \nveterans groups on campus. They were not barred from campus. They just \ncould not use the center for recruiting, but they could still talk to \npeople on campus, and it is not so important. Well, if it is not so \nimportant, why did Dean Kagan go to such great lengths to have the law \noverturned, even risking Harvard's financial support? It was important.\n  Barred from institutional access, the military now had to work \nthrough a student group, the Harvard Law School Veterans Association. \nThe veterans association, however, did not believe this was fair to \nthem. They had courses to attend and school work to do. They wrote to \ntheir classmates about Dean Kagan's decision and explained they were \nunable to fill the role of the military recruiters that she had \nexcluded. This is what they said:\n\n       Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any \n     office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources \n     to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively \n     for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting \n     events.\n\n  But Dean Kagan still did not relent. Only when the military again \nthreatened to cut off money to Harvard did she give in. This was the \nsecond time they had to make this threat. This statute says the \nSecretary of Defense shall notify them that they will no longer get \nFederal funds if they do not allow recruiters on campus.\n  Ms. Kagan reversed Harvard's existing policy in order to obstruct the \naccess of the military recruiters. She disregarded a congressional \nstatute. Eventually, her view was rejected by the Supreme Court.\n  So what happened when the Third Circuit case got to the Supreme \nCourt? She filed a brief with a group of other academics attacking the \nSolomon amendment. What happened? By an 8-to-0 vote, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt rejected her brief.\n  According to Dean Kagan, actions she took against the military were \nmotivated by her opposition to don't ask, don't tell. But somehow her \nfierce opposition was not enough to prevent her, I note \nparenthetically, from serving as a loyal aide to the man who created \nthe policy, President Clinton. No, instead she directed her punishment \nto the military that had nothing to do with it. The soldiers, the \nrecruiters who wanted to come on Harvard campus had nothing to do with \nestablishing this don't ask, don't tell policy. It was Congress's law. \nIt is statutory, and President Clinton endorsed it with his don't ask, \ndon't tell enforcement strategy. It was the law of the land. It was not \na policy dreamed up by some general somewhere. She knew that.\n  Ms. Kagan's conduct may have been applauded by some in the \nprogressive circles of academia, but I think the American people would \nbe uneasy about it. They are not sympathetic to the actions she took \nagainst the brave men and women who defend the rights and freedoms of \nMs. Kagan, of Harvard professors, and of all Americans.\n  Dean Kagan has no judicial record to examine, and she has very little \nexperience as a lawyer. One of the most prominent features of her legal \nexperience and her tenure at Harvard is scarred by her open \nmistreatment of the military and her disregard for very clear law. I \nwish it were not so, but it is.\n  This matter does raise questions of whether Dean Kagan would be able \nto serve all Americans as a responsible, impartial jurist or whether \nshe would bring her ideological agenda to the bench and attempt to get \naround the Constitution and the laws of the United States to effectuate \nwhat she thinks might be a better policy. That is the question I think \nis legitimate to ask, as well as to ask, in a serious way: What were \nyou thinking when you punished our men and women in uniform because you \ndid not like what Congress and your President--President Clinton--did \nwith regard to their policies on gays in the military?\n  It is not a small matter. I believe this decision was clearly wrong. \nI believe it was not lawful. I believe it was not good policy. We will \nneed to talk about that as we go forward and to hear a sincere \nexplanation from the nominee.\n  This is not something from which we cannot learn. It is not \nnecessarily the decisive matter in this person's nomination. But it is \nnot correct to say it is an insignificant matter. It is a significant \nmatter, a very significant matter. And it is a matter of significance \nsuch that whoever comments about it, even if it is the Vice President \nof the United States, they should be accurate. They should not be \ninaccurate, as has happened repeatedly from my observation in the \nmedia, as well as my good friend, our former colleague, Senator Biden, \nwho also served on the Judiciary Committee. It is time we get these \nfacts straight.\n  I also wish to express a concern about one more matter. During her \ntime in the Clinton White House, 1995 to 1999, Dean Kagan, now \nSolicitor General Kagan, served in the White House Counsel's Office and \nlater as Director of Domestic Policy Council in the White House. That \nis one of the few extensive public records she has. We need to obtain \nthe documents relating to that service in advance of the hearings that \nnow have been set for June 28. I think it is a rush to get ready for \nJune 28, but I told Senator Leahy, our chairman, that he is the boss, \nand we will try to be ready by the 28th. But we both know it is \nimportant to have these documents in time to examine them before the \ncommittee hearing because so little other documents exist as to her \nrecord.\n  All the documents that have been requested I believe the committee is \nentitled to see. Senator Leahy has joined with me. We worked together \non this. It appears President Obama has decided not to assert any \nclaims of Executive privilege that would block the production of any of \nthese documents. We received a letter from the Clinton Library on \nFriday where these records are held indicating that they understand \nPresident Obama will not make any claims of privilege.\n  The White House recognizes these documents are an important part of \nMs. Kagan's record. In fact, after she was nominated, the White House \nsent a public letter to the National Archives asking for release of \ndocuments relating to her service in the Clinton White House. They \nincluded all of her e-mail documents in their request. But the White \nHouse request and media requests under FOIA are different from the \ncommittee request.\n  So last week, Chairman Leahy and I sent a letter to the Clinton \nLibrary requesting these documents.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Leahy, who has been through so \nmany of these confirmation matters--this is consistent with our \nhistory--and I appreciate his efforts on the letter and to get this \ninformation. But I would note there are important distinctions between \nthe Obama White House's request and the committee's request.\n  First, the restrictions that apply to run-of-the-mill Freedom of \nInformation Act requests do not apply when the committee requests \ndocument. Second, under the Presidential Records Act, President Clinton \nwould normally be able to block the release of certain documents for up \nto 12 years. But under the PRA, the committee's request overrides any \nattempt by President Clinton to block the release of these records. \nFaced with a committee request, the only basis for withholding \ndocuments is executive privilege, and\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nPresident Obama has apparently decided not to do that.\n  So the concern is that last week the director of the library was \nquoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying that it would be ``very \ndifficult'' for them to comply by the June 28 hearing date. The \ndirector said, ``there are just too many things here,'' and that \n``these are legal documents and they are presidential records, and they \nhave to be read by an archivist and vetted for any legal restrictions. \nAnd they have to be read line by line.''\n  In the letter we received on Friday, the library indicated they will \nstart delivering documents by June 4--3 weeks before the hearing--and \nthen they will make additional deliveries on a rolling basis. They did \nnot tell us by when they will provide all the documents. I know they \nhave a hard job. Maybe they have to do all these things, but the fact \nis we have a deadline that has been set by Chairman Leahy to start the \nhearing on June 28, and we are not able to, in my view, conduct a good \nhearing if we don't have the documents.\n  So I am trying to make clear to my colleagues that we are heading \ntoward what could be a train wreck. I don't believe this committee can \ngo forward without these documents in the request and have an accurate \nhearing. The public record of a nominee to such a lifetime position as \nJustice on the Supreme Court is of such importance that we cannot go \nforward without these documents. I hope we will get those in a timely \nfashion. If not, I think we will have no choice but to ask for a delay \nin the beginning of the hearings.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4110-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4110-S4111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WALL STREET REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, among the most difficult issues we dealt \nwith in the debate over the Wall Street reform bill we approved last \nweek is that of proprietary trading and conflicts of interest in the \nfinancial system. This trading, often involving risky investments with \nlarge amounts of borrowed money, was a significant contributor to the \nfinancial crisis of 2008--a crisis from which we have yet to fully \nrecover. The bill the Senate has approved includes important language \ndealing with proprietary trading and with conflicts of interest.\n  In the hope of strengthening that language, Senator Merkley and I \nintroduced an amendment which would have made Congress's intent clear: \nto end risky proprietary trading at commercial banks, to demand that \nthe largest nonbank financial institutions maintain sufficient capital \nfor their trades to prevent taxpayer bailouts, and to end the \noutrageous and destructive conflicts of interest which marked so much \nof Wall Street's behavior leading up to the crisis.\n  It is this last issue on which I have focused much of my attention. \nAs we move toward negotiations between the House and Senate and final \npassage of a Wall Street reform bill, hopefully the final product will \ndeal with these conflicts of interest. Failure to do so would accept \nthe status quo under which Wall Street firms can assemble complex \nfinancial instruments, instruments they have financial incentives to \nsee fail, sell those instruments to clients, and then profit by betting \nagainst the products they built and sold.\n  The hearings I chaired in the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations probing the causes of the financial crisis exposed \nrecklessness and greed up and down the financial system. In our last \nhearing, examining the role of investment bank Goldman Sachs in the \ncrisis, we demonstrated how Goldman profited by betting against \nfinancial instruments it had assembled.\n  In late 2006, Goldman Sachs made a strategic decision to begin \nunloading mortgage-related holdings and to short the mortgage market; \nthat is, to bet against the market and to profit from its fall. To do \nso, Goldman assembled a series of financial instruments it would profit \nfrom if there were a collapse of the mortgage market.\n  One e-mail chain from May 2007, for instance, shows how Goldman bet \nagainst certain mortgage-backed securities that it had assembled and \nsold to investors. In the e-mails, Goldman employees discussed how \ncertain securities that Goldman had underwritten and were tied to \nmortgages issued by Washington Mutual Bank's subprime lender, Long \nBeach, were losing value. Reporting the wipeout of one security, a \nGoldman Sachs employee then reported the ``good news''--that the \nfailure would bring the firm $5 million from a bet that it had placed \nagainst the very securities it had assembled and sold.\n  In addition to shorting existing mortgage-backed securities, Goldman \nconstructed a series of even more complicated financial instruments to \nbet against the mortgage market. These were known as collateralized \ndebt obligations or CDOs. One example is a synthetic CDO put together \nin late 2006 known as Hudson Mezzanine. A synthetic CDO is a financial \ninstrument whose value is based on a collection of referenced assets, \nbut it does not contain the assets themselves. It is essentially a bet \non whether referred-to assets will rise or fall in value.\n  Goldman constructed this $2 billion CDO to reflect the value of \nsubprime mortgage securities similar to those that Goldman held in its \nown inventory. Goldman's sales force was told that Hudson Mezzanine was \na top priority and it worked aggressively to sell Hudson securities to \nclients around the world. Internal e-mails released by our Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations showed that one Goldman client was \nunhappy that the firm was spending so much time on Hudson and not on a \ndeal the client wanted to make. In the documents Goldman used to sell \nHudson Mezzanine to clients, the firm even suggested to investors that \nGoldman stood to benefit if the investment performed well, telling \nthose customers: ``Goldman Sachs has aligned incentives with the Hudson \nproject by investing in a portion of the equity.''\n  In fact, that was not true. Goldman Sachs' interests were not aligned \nwith its customers. They were in conflict. Goldman was the sole \ncounterparty in the Hudson CDO and made a $2 billion bet; that is, a $2 \nbillion bet, that the assets referenced in the CDO would fall in value. \nGoldman won that bet big time. The CDO, filled with toxic subprime \nassets that Goldman had selected, assembled, and sold, began losing \nvalue. When Goldman first sold the securities to its clients, more than \n70 percent of Hudson Mezzanine had AAA ratings, but within 9 months \nthose AAA ratings were downgraded, and within 18 months Hudson was \ndowngraded to junk status, and Goldman cashed in at the expense of its \nclients.\n  To sum up, in late 2006, Goldman decided to bet against the housing \nmarket it had helped to create. It shorted mortgage-backed securities \nit had sold to investors, and designed and built CDOs that enabled it \nto make billions of dollars in bets against the housing market and its \nown CDOs, collecting money when the products it had peddled to its \nclients failed.\n  That kind of proprietary trading is not ``market making.'' It is not \nmatching buyers and sellers. It is one firm acting as a principal \nlooking out for its own self-interest and making bets that were \ncollected at the expense of its clients. Goldman served its own \ninterests, and if clients got burned in the process, so be it.\n  But Goldman's actions did more than hurt its clients. It helped \nundermine an entire financial market which, in turn, damaged numerous \nfinancial institutions that ended up requiring a $700 billion taxpayer \nbailout to stop the bleeding. Hudson Mezzanine and other synthetic \nvehicles Goldman used to bet against mortgages were particularly \ndamaging because they were not constrained by the number of mortgages \nin the market. They contained no real assets but were strictly bets on \nwhether referenced assets would fall in value. The creation and sale of \nthose synthetic instruments presented money-making opportunities for \nGoldman but magnified the risk in the financial system and made the \ncrisis more severe when it hit.\n  It is time for Congress to put an end to the conflicts of interest \nthat undermine our financial markets and pit investment banks against \ntheir clients.\n  The Merkley-Levin amendment contained a provision targeted at \ncleaning up this mess and preventing it from happening again. It would \nhave barred any financial institution that underwrote an asset-backed \nsecurity\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\nfrom placing bets against the securities it created. The amendment \nwould have also imposed new limitations on proprietary trading, \nlimitations which are also critical to repairing financial markets and \nwhich are contained in more limited form in the Dodd bill.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian ruled that the Merkley-Levin proprietary \ntrading and conflicts of interest provisions were germane to the Dodd \nbill. That is because the Merkley-Levin conflicts provision targets the \nsame problem as the Dodd proprietary trading section--stopping \nfinancial firms from putting their own interests ahead of their \nclients. Our proprietary trading provision and our ban on conflicts of \ninterest are essential to restoring client confidence in U.S. markets. \nThey are within the scope of the conference and ought to be included in \nthe conference report.\n  The financial landscape today is littered with the damage done by \nfinancial firms which pursued short-term profit at the expense of their \nclients, U.S. taxpayers, and the economy as a whole. Those financial \nfirms cannot be allowed to continue to sell securities to clients and \nthen bet against them. It is essential to remove these schemes that \nhave undermined U.S. financial markets. I urge my colleagues in both \nChambers, as they discuss final Wall Street reform legislation, to keep \nin mind how damaging these schemes have been, to strengthen the Dodd \nproprietary trading provisions, and to include a ban on conflicts of \ninterest.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when our colleagues arrive, I will be \npleased to yield the floor to them, but I will be offering, after 3 \no'clock, along with Senator Claire McCaskill, my Democratic colleague \nfrom Missouri, an amendment we voted on before in the Senate. It is an \namendment that would establish 3-year discretionary spending caps, \nlimits on how much we can spend, how much debt we can run up. To \nviolate those limits, it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate and \nthe House to pass. So this is a spending limitation amendment that will \nhave some teeth to it.\n  It will allow us to have in effect a budget because it looks like, \neven in light of the incredibly disastrous financial crisis we are in, \nwe will not pass a budget this year. We need to do that. But the House \nhas not even moved one. One has been moved out of committee on a \nstraight party-line vote, but there are indications we may not move it \nin the Senate, and if the House does not move, we will not have a \nbudget.\n  What our amendment would do is help fill that gap. That is another \nreason for it. It would set spending limits for 3 years. The limits we \nwould set are the limits President Obama submitted as spending limits \nlast time.

Mr. President, I rise to speak a little bit about the \nhealth care plan that was passed now a few months ago. Of course, there \nwas a lot of buildup to that plan. One of the things that was said over \nand over again by President Obama was: ``If you like your health care \nplan, you can keep your health care plan.''\n  The White House, of course, has very vigorously defended that \npromise. In fact, the White House responded to an op-ed that was \nentitled ``No, you can't keep your health care plan.'' That is what \nthat op-ed was titled. The White House responded last week on the White \nHouse blog and they said this:\n\n       The 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health \n     insurance--who make up the vast majority of those with health \n     insurance today--will not see major changes to their \n     coverage.\n\n  The White House's Stephanie Cutter went on to say:\n\n       At the end of the day, employer-sponsored insurance will be \n     improved but will look much the same as it does now.\n\n  The administration is continuing to try to convince the American \npeople that, in fact, that is going to be the case. However, no matter \nhow many times they say it, study after study tells us the opposite. \nLess than 2 months ago, after the bill became law, clear evidence is \nnow emerging that the promises are impossible to keep. Recently, \ncertain companies were required by securities law to report the impact \nof the new health care law on those companies. The company reports so \nconcerned supporters of the health care law that they said we are going \nto bring these companies in. We are going to do an investigation. We \nwill have a hearing on this. However, when they reviewed these \ncompanies' internal documents, the supporters of the health care law, \nthose demanding the hearing, immediately backed off. You see, they saw \nin black and white why so many Americans are going to lose the health \ncare coverage they like under this legislation.\n  Companies with longstanding employer-sponsored health plans were \nlegitimately, lawfully, legally contemplating just paying the fine \ninstead of continuing the more expensive employee insurance programs. \nYes, all of a sudden the hearing was canceled. There was no interest in \nthe hearing. One can speculate it was canceled because the findings \nwould have exposed a very serious policy flaw of the health care law.\n  Headlines are hard to defend when they shout: ``Companies contemplate \ndropping employer-sponsored health insurance plans.''\n  This is very worrisome, but it is not unexpected. Last July I spoke \nabout this on the Senate floor, right at this spot. I and many others \nwarned that the proposed penalties for businesses would create a very \nperverse incentive. I said this:\n\n       When you do all the math, this is no penalty at all \n     compared to the cost of private insurance. It would encourage \n     employers to dump their employees from their health \n     insurance.\n\n  That is what I said a year ago. But supporters of health care reform \ndenied it. They provided assurance to the American workers that they, \nin fact, would be able to keep their health insurance plan. Now, 10 \nmonths later, what is happening? Companies are, in fact, contemplating \ndropping their plans. Why? Because that perverse incentive is there.\n  To do so would significantly lower their costs and increase the costs \nfor taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries. Let's look at AT, for \nexample. You see, for them, paying the Government fine instead of \nproviding employee insurance would cut their annual health care \nexpenses from $2.4 billion annual expenses to $600 million. That is a \n75-percent savings.\n  Other companies, though, have sent similar signals. An official with \nJohn Deere has indicated they should look into, ``just paying the \nfine.'' Caterpillar said this: They are giving this ``serious \nconsideration.''\n  Another survey showed that these are not isolated cases. A Washington \nState University survey, published in the Puget Sound Business Journal, \nconcluded this:\n\n       [A]bout a third of Seattle area executives said it may be \n     cheaper for their businesses to stop offering health care \n     benefits and pay fines.\n\n  If a major employer discontinues health insurance for its employees, \nbrace yourself, because its competitors will do the same. The savings \nare just too dramatic, and that is not the only problem out there. The \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate assumed that companies would \nbe covering more employees in 10 years, not less. This optimistic view \nmay have led to a very optimistic cost projection. If employees lose \ntheir employer-sponsored insurance plans, then they are going to be \nforced to get their health insurance elsewhere, likely through the \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\ninsurance exchanges. Then they would be eligible for government \nsubsidies.\n  Let me state that another way: They would be eligible for taxpayer-\npaid subsidies to cover that cost. This will cause the actual cost of \nthe bill to skyrocket. From almost a year ago until early this year, \nmany of us warned that this law was built on the shakiest of policy \ngrounds and even shakier projections relative to its financing. Yet \nproponents said don't worry. As we go forward, though, expect more bad \nnews about this very flawed piece of policy.\n  The White House can do all it wants to try to convince Americans of \nthe merits of this law. But you know what. When Americans lose the \ninsurance they like and businesses struggle to grow and expand, \nAmericans will wonder how Congress could have been so foolish to pass \nsuch poor policy.\n  Many warned this was coming. Unfortunately, the warnings were ignored \nin the effort to try to get this passed. I remember standing here on \nChristmas Eve, voting against this piece of legislation.\n  But this new law is far from reform. It spends $2.6 trillion to take \nthis great Nation in the wrong direction. Now, hopefully, I pray that \nin the near future more rational minds can agree on a more rational \nnational policy. But until then, the adverse consequences will continue \nto fill the headlines and, more important and sadly, Americans will be \nhit by the realities of this flawed policy. They will have no recourse \nif one day their boss walks in and announces that it is more cost-\nefficient for this company to say to them: Go to the exchange. We will \nnot be providing a health insurance plan. You see, in this country \nemployees do not work by contract.\n  My hope is we can agree on a more efficient policy before we are left \nwondering why there are so many broken promises.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4111-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4111-S4112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE HEALTH CARE PLAN\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof H.R. 4899, the FEMA supplemental as passed by the House on March 24 \nand marked up by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, May \n13. As my colleagues may be aware, several attempts were made to \nproceed to the House-passed bill, but there were objections to \nproceeding.\n  Because of the delay in acting upon the House bill, the vice chairman \nand I agreed that we should consider all of the supplemental provisions \nin the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee that are pending \nbefore the Congress instead of just the FEMA portion as proposed by the \nHouse. The committee concurred in this recommendation and forwarded the \nbill to the full Senate by a unanimous vote of 30 to 0.\n  This bill contains $45.4 billion in discretionary spending and $13.4 \nbillion in spending on mandatory programs. This amount is the same as \nthe amount requested by the President. I want to point out to all of my \ncolleagues that the bill does not include funding for the settlements \nbetween the Federal Government and African American-farmers and Native \nAmericans.\n  While I am strongly in favor of funding these settlements, these \nitems are, in fact not in the jurisdiction of the Appropriations \nCommittee. We have been informed by the leadership that these matters \nwill be addressed elsewhere. I understand and expect that funding for \nthese two settlements will be approved by the Congress and forwarded to \nthe White House before the Memorial Day recess.\n  The recommendations that Vice Chairman Cochran and I are presenting \nto you on behalf of the appropriations Committee reflect the collective \nefforts of each of our subcommittees. The main parts of the bill \ninclude $33.5 billion in Department of Defense funding to cover the \ncost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, combat terrorism, and respond \nto the earthquake in Haiti. An additional $6.5 billion is provided for \nthe State Department and other agencies in support of these and related \nefforts.\n  The bill also includes $68 million in the first payment to cover \nFederal responsibilities resulting from the oilspill in the gulf. We \nrecognize that additional funding and new legislative authorities are \nlikely to be required in response to the oilspill. The amount we \nrecommend results from our review of the budget amendment which was \nonly submitted to the Administration the day before the committee \nmarkup. We are confident that the sums recommended are necessary but \nrecognize more action will be needed in the coming months.\n  As requested, the committee is also recommending $5.1 billion for \nFEMA'S disaster relief efforts. Everyone should be aware that the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency is out of funding for disaster \nrelief. Even this sum is below what we anticipate will be required \nbefore the end of this year. However, the recommended sum is the amount \nsought by the Administration. The committee was unable to identify \nadditional offsets to increase the total funding for FEMA.\n  In addition to these, the committee has identified rescissions and \nother savings within the Administration's request to address many \nnatural disasters for which the Administration did not request \nassistance.\n  Two weeks ago, more than 40 counties in Tennessee were underwater. \nRhode Island suffered through a once in a 500-year storm in March. A \ndisaster was declared by the President in January for fisheries in \nAlaska. Tornadoes have tormented the Midwest and South. We have dams in \nneed of emergency repair in the Northwest and an urgent requirement to \naddress mine safety, but no funds have been requested to address these \nneeds. Nothing has been offered to offset the enormous cost of clean-up \nand reconstruction for the States and communities which have suffered.\n  In total, the committee has provided more than $425 million to \naddress the disaster related shortfalls that were not requested by the \nAdministration. This is a mere pittance when compared to the $1 or $2 \nbillion that is needed now to meet these needs, but it was that we \ncould identify so late in the fiscal year to help meet these legitimate \nemergency costs.\n  Some will say, ``Well, surely there are other offsets.'' I do not \ndeny there are unobligated funds, but unobligated does not mean \nunneeded. For example, last week we identified a program with $8.3 \nbillion unobligated, the Joint Strike Fighter. The contract award for \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been delayed by months. Accordingly, \nthe funding remains unobligated. Surely those that want to cut \nunobligated balances to offset the cost of this bill do not want us to \nrescind funds for this new fighter.\n  We are told that some of our colleagues would like to send members of \nthe National Guard to the border using unobligated balances to pay that \ncost.\n  Well, I would point out that we have more than $2.6 billion in \nunobligated balances in funding that the Congress has appropriated over \nthe past 3 years to purchase additional equipment for our National \nGuard and Reserve Forces. I suppose we could reallocate funds from that \naccount to cover the cost of stationing additional National Guard \ntroops on the border, But I doubt the proponents of such an amendment \nwould support that. Moreover, like funding for the Joint Strike \nFighter, the amount provided for National Guard equipment is needed \neven if it has not yet been spent.\n  In recent months the rhetoric on Federal spending has focused solely \non how much money has been spent rather than on what was necessary and \nwhat is still required. Many Senators question why we bailed out Wall \nStreet. Others ask why we used Federal funds to ``prime the pump'' of \nour economy through the Recovery Act. I, for one, believe both were \nnecessary to forestall an economic depression. Over the past few months \nas the stock market has rebounded and we have seen the beginnings of \njob creation, I am more confident than ever that the Congress acted \nwisely.\n  But I want to inform all my colleagues that this bill is neither a \nbailout nor a stimulus. Instead, it is the minimum necessary to support \nour troops in harm's way and to meet emergency domestic and \ninternational requirements. The vice chairman and I agreed that the \nbill recommended by the committee would stay within the amounts \nrequested by the Administration, even though we know more could be \njustified for these purposes.\n  I recognize that many Senators on both sides of the aisle believe we \nsimply should not spend more, but I say to you the Nation still has \nlegitimate needs and a responsibility to act. We cannot stop investing \nin our Nation simply because of high deficits. This is a time for \nfiscal austerity but not for cutting legitimate spending needs. I can \nassure my colleagues this bill is both austere and responsible.\n  The items in this bill are all either fully offset or bona fide \nemergencies. Many items are both emergency and offset to stay within \nthe budget request. As chairman of this committee, I believe there are \nmany more items which could be justified; but, to maintain necessary \nsupport for this bill, Vice Chairman Cochran and I committed to holding \nthe line on spending. The committee met that objective.\n  I want to thank Vice Chairman Cochran and his staff for their \ndedication and cooperation. This bill has been written in a completely \nbipartisan fashion, with input from all the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of our 12 subcommittees. I thank all members of the committee \nfor their enormous contributions to this bill.\n  Let me be clear. FEMA is out of money. More than 40 States have been \ntold that they must wait for funds to cover disaster bills. Communities \nthroughout the Northeast and Southeast are waiting for funds in this \nbill to begin rebuilding after devastating floods. We have an urgent \nrequirement to respond rapidly to the devastating effects of the \noilspill in the gulf. Funding for all of these cannot wait while\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\nsome might seek to delay action on this bill.\n  But most importantly, next week, the Nation will honor those who \nsacrificed their lives in defense of our country. As I have said on \nmany occasions, my colleagues should be mindful that less than 1 \npercent of our population has volunteered to wear our country's \nuniform, to serve the rest of us. They defend our freedom, our way of \nlife. They are called upon ever more frequently to leave their families \nbehind and report to dangerous and inhospitable locations. Willingly, \nthey do so.\n  The Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and \nsacrifice. I can think of no better way to honor those who serve today \nand those who have gone before than by passing this bill expeditiously \nso that it can be forwarded to the House for action.\n  I urge all Members to work with Vice Chairman Cochran and me to \nsupport this bill and secure its quick passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, in \npresenting this supplemental appropriations bill to the Senate. The \ncentral purposes of the bill are to fund the military and diplomatic \nsurge in Afghanistan, to respond to natural disasters in this country \nand in Haiti, and to address the immediate challenges we face from the \noilspill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It has been 5 months since the President announced his strategy to \nachieve stability in Afghanistan. Central to that strategy is the \naddition of some 30,000 troops into the theater, together with a \nsignificant increase in aid and diplomatic resources to the region. \nCongress has the responsibility and the duty to carefully review and \nconsider the President's request for these supplemental appropriations \nand approve the expenditure of the funds that are necessary for a \nsuccessful outcome, one that serves the interests of the United States.\n  We must be mindful, however, that more than half of the additional \ntroops called for in the President's plan have already arrived in \nAfghanistan. Spring and summer offenses are being mounted now and in \nthe coming months will become critical to our chances for success. It \nis also important that we act on the President's request in a timely \nmanner. We should not procrastinate or drag our feet. We should not \nforce the Pentagon to juggle accounts, delay procurements, and \notherwise take actions that will detract from our efforts in the field.\n  The committee has spent several months, as the distinguished chairman \npointed out, carefully examining the supplemental request made by the \nDepartment of Defense and the State Department. Secretary Gates and \nSecretary Clinton have testified before the committee in support of \nthese requests. The committee members and staff have met with other \ngovernment officials and outside groups to refine the committee's \nrecommendations.\n  While this bill includes many of the supplemental requests made by \nthe President, some of his proposals were deemed premature, \nunwarranted, or inappropriate for inclusion in an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The committee also heard from both \nDemocratic and Republican Senators about urgent needs not addressed in \nthe President's supplemental request. The chairman and I, as well as \nthe various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, have worked to \naddress those needs. We have limited the total cost of the bill to the \namount requested by the President, and we have kept the bill focused on \nits central purposes.\n  In some parts of the country, recent natural disasters have left \ncommunities in desperate need of Federal assistance, but with flood \nwaters still receding and damage assessments not yet complete, it has \nbeen difficult to respond to all of the requests we have received. The \nchairman and I will continue to work with Senators representing those \ncommunities to see that the Federal response is appropriate and \naddresses the most critical needs.\n  For those of us who represent the gulf coast region, our States are \ndealing with a different kind of disaster. While it is not a natural \ndisaster, it is a very serious event that will have very serious \nconsequences for the natural environment as well as for local economies \nthroughout the region. We cannot predict now and we cannot now know \nwhat the long-term impacts of this spill will be. While the Federal \nGovernment is intimately involved in the response and cleanup efforts, \nclearly the parties responsible for the spill must bear the ultimate \ncost of cleanup and associated damages. The President submitted an \noilspill supplemental proposal 1 day prior to the committee's \nconsideration of this bill. The proposal contained funding requests \nprompted by the spill but not directly tied to the Deepwater Horizon \nevent. It also included broader policy proposals that would restructure \nthe oilspill liability regime currently in place. The committee has had \nvery little time to review these proposals. We have decided to \nrecommend funding only items that are within the committee's \njurisdiction that will address urgent needs.\n  We do not suggest that the committee has arrived at the perfect \nsolution. There may be other proposals that should be included in this \nlegislation. There may be recommendations included by the committee \nthat should be reconsidered based on additional analysis. I look \nforward to working with our colleagues from the gulf coast and all \nSenators to address this unfortunate event.\n  During consideration of this bill in committee, several members \nidentified additional funding needs or policy matters they intend to \nraise during floor debate. Members not on the committee will surely \nhave amendments as well, and we look forward to working with all \nSenators to improve this bill where we can. But it is clear that adding \nadditional costs to this bill will exacerbate our Nation's fiscal \nimbalance and potentially jeopardize our ability to rapidly get needed \nresources to our men and women in harm's way in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nin other parts of the world. This bill recommends $46 billion in \ndiscretionary appropriations and another $13 billion in mandatory \nfunds. No matter how important the purposes, that is a significant \namount of money. I expect amendments will be offered to offset some or \nall of these costs.\n  The disaster relief fund of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nis currently allocating funds for immediate needs only. The fund owes \nmore than $1.5 billion to States for projects already approved to \nassist communities recovering from disasters. Going into hurricane \nseason, the fund has less than $900 million available to respond to \ndisasters. One way or the other, we must take action to capitalize the \nfund.\n  We also must act with a sense of urgency to provide the resources \nneeded to succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq. We should consider those \nrequirements carefully. But I believe we will poorly serve our men and \nwomen in the field if we allow internal tactical battles to unduly \ndelay delivery of a bill to the President, or if we burden this bill \nwith other costs or legislative matters that are unrelated and \ncontroversial.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii and able members of his \nstaff for their work on this bill and moving it to this point through \nthe committee. I hope our colleagues who have amendments will contact \nus so we can help arrange for consideration of those in a timely \nmanner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n       (Purpose: To establish 3 year discretionary spending caps)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I won't discuss any further the \namendment I am going to call up. It was offered by Senator McCaskill \nand me 2 or 3 weeks ago. We reached as high as 59 votes for it, one \nshort of passage. It is an amendment that would put a statutory limit \non spending, making it more difficult to violate the limits we put by \nrequiring a two-thirds vote to break that limit except in time of war \nand emergency.\n  I ask at this time to call up amendment No. 4173.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator wish to set aside \nthe pending amendment?\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I now ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you, Mr. President. I would say, since I do not see a \nMember of the majority on the floor, if there is a concern with that \nlater, and somebody wishes to slip me a note, I would be happy to try \nto accommodate my schedule to the majority's schedule.\n\n\n                           New START Concerns\n\n  Mr. President, what I wish to speak to today is the START treaty \nwhich has been submitted by the administration for consideration by the \nSenate.\n  The President signed the treaty on April 8 of this year, submitted it \nto the Senate for ratification on May 13, and 2 weeks ago the Foreign \nRelations Committee began hearings on the treaty.\n  In the consideration of past treaties, the Senate has taken great \ncare to consider the entire record of relevant documents and to seek \nthe views of a wide variety of experts, and I am sure that will be done \nin this case as well.\n  According to a report from Senator Thune, who is the head of the \nRepublican Policy Committee:\n\n       [On] the original START, almost 430 days passed between the \n     time President George H.W. Bush signed it--\n\n  That was July 31, 1991--\n\n     and the U.S. Senate provided its consent to the treaty [on \n     October 1, 1992]. As for the Treaty of Moscow, which is to \n     terminate if New START is ratified, it was signed on May 24, \n     2002 and ratified by the Senate more than nine months later \n     on March 6, 2003.\n\n  That treaty, by the way, is only three pages long. So it is not \nsurprising that it takes some time. What is surprising to me is that \nsome have seemed intent on rushing the treaty that has been sent to us. \nAccording to Congressional Quarterly:\n\n       A congressional aide who briefed reporters on the treaty \n     said Thursday that Senate Foreign Relations [Committee] \n     Chairman John Kerry [of Massachusetts] intended to complete \n     hearings ``in time for the Senate to take up the treaty \n     before the August recess, if it so chooses.''\n\n  I am not aware of any similar precedent for so rushing such a treaty \nof this complexity, and I am not sure why the rush would be necessary. \nI wish to remind my colleagues, the White House assured us there would \nbe no problem when it permitted the treaty to expire by not seeking its \nextension. The reason is expressed in a Joint Statement, which said as \nfollows:\n\n       Recognizing our mutual determination to support strategic \n     stability between the United States of America and the \n     Russian Federation, we express our commitment, as a matter of \n     principle, to continue to work together in the spirit of the \n     START Treaty following its expiration, as well as our firm \n     intention to ensure that a new treaty on strategic arms enter \n     into force at the earliest possible date.\n\n  So what did these 65 words mean? Well, Deputy Secretary of Defense \nLynn told us they meant that:\n\n       In this interim period of START's expiration earlier in the \n     month, our two countries have agreed to continue observing \n     the spirit of the treaty's terms.\n\n  Spokesman Kelly said they mean that ``both sides pledged not to take \nany measures that would undermine the strategic stability that START \nhas provided during this period between the expiration of the START \ntreaty.''\n  So the idea that we are potentially disadvantaged every day the \ntreaty goes unratified seems to me to be untrue, unless the Joint \nStatement does not mean what we were told it means. Certainly, there is \nno reason the Senate should not take the time it needs to perform its \ndue diligence. The Constitution did not, after all, entrust to this \nbody the requirement to perform the process of advise and consent on \ntreaties, and did not set the extraordinarily high threshold of 67 \nvotes to achieve ratification because it intended the Senate to merely \nrubberstamp a treaty.\n  I remind my colleagues of the recommendation of Dr. James \nSchlesinger, who the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said \nin a recent hearing has been called ``the former Secretary of \nEverything.'' Dr. Schlesinger said:\n\n       First, the Senate will wish to scrutinize the Treaty \n     carefully, as it has previous arms control agreements. This \n     reflects the many changes as compared to START I.\n\n  Of course, the treaty is more than just the treaty text, protocols, \nand annexes, which we have only recently received. There are other \nthings we have not yet received. Again, quoting from Senator Thune's \nreport:\n\n       For example, the Secretary of State is required by statute \n     to submit a verifiability assessment of the treaty, and past \n     practice has been for the intelligence community to submit a \n     National Intelligence Estimate concerning the verifiability \n     of such matters. These two documents will be critical to \n     Senate evaluation of the treaty.\n       Another set of documents that will be critical to the \n     Senate's evaluation of New START, particularly the \n     verification issue, is the annual report the President is to \n     complete assessing other nations' compliance with their arms \n     control, nonproliferation, and disarmament commitments. This \n     annual report is due on April 15 of each year, with the last \n     one submitted in August 2005--meaning the White House is now \n     five reports behind.\n\n  So in this case, the verifiability assessment will be prepared by the \nAssistant Secretary for Verification, Rose Gottemoeller, who also \nhappened to be our lead negotiator on the treaty. I am not certain if \nshe will recuse herself from drafting the document, due to the obvious \nconflict of interest, but Senators must surely understand this.\n  On the matter of the NIE, Senators must carefully review the record \nof the proceedings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nwhich will file a report or submit a letter on the treaty. The NIE is \nimportant. It is not simply a statement on the verifiability of the \ntreaty or at least it should not be. To be useful, it will provide an \nanalysis of how the treaty informs our understanding of Russia's \nnuclear forces. It will analyze cheating scenarios and the likelihood \nwe will detect them. This is an important document and one that will \ntake time to put together.\n  Another document promised, but not yet sent to the Senate, is the \nnuclear force posture. Senators will, of course, want to know how the \ntriad will be composed during the 10 years of the treaty before we \nconsider it. It is not sufficient to merely trust that the 700 deployed \nlaunchers called for in the treaty will be sufficient. We need to see \nthe force posture and we need to see the analysis that supports it.\n\n  I joined with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee who \nhave requested access to the treaty negotiating record. I remind my \ncolleagues that 22 U.S.C. section 2578 requires the Secretary of State \nto maintain a negotiating record of treaties to which the United States \nis a party. Obviously, Congress did not enact this requirement merely \nfor the sake of doing it. Congress, obviously, intended to be able to \nhave access to the record.\n  There is a long history on this subject involving great disputes \nbetween the Senate, its committees, and its National Security Working \nGroup--or its predecessor, the Arms Control Observer Group--which, \nincidentally, I cochair along with Senator Byrd, and the Executive on \nthe INF and the START I treaty. I remind my colleagues of a statement \nmade by Sam Nunn, the\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nformer chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, when he was \nserving in this body in 1986:\n\n       Mr. President, in my opinion, the administration's \n     rejection of our request for Senate access threatens a basic \n     institutional interest of the U.S. Senate--its constitutional \n     role in the treaty process.\n\n  I agree with the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee that \nit is important for the Senate to have access to this negotiating \nrecord.\n  Finally, let me say, I come to this very serious process with an open \nmind. I supported the START II treaty and the Moscow Treaty. I opposed \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nNot all arms control agreements are the same. And just because they \nwere negotiated, it does not follow they are in our best interest. So \nwe need to examine the record and this treaty carefully.\n  Today, I want to identify some areas of concern I believe Senators \nwill want to focus on as they begin to consider the treaty. These are \nnot objections. They are matters of concern we will want to \ninvestigate:\n  One, the required nuclear modernization plan; two, limits on U.S. \nnuclear force levels and force structure; three, impact on U.S. missile \ndefenses; four, verification under the new treaty; five, the impact of \nthe treaty on the disparity between United States and Russian nuclear \nforce levels, especially regarding tactical nuclear weapons; six, the \nBilateral Consultative Commission; and, seven, the impact of the treaty \non prompt global strike.\n  Perhaps we should consider an eighth category and a new metric by \nwhich to evaluate the treaty. Secretary Clinton stated on March 18 \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       I am not suggesting that this treaty alone will convince \n     Iran or North Korea to change their behavior, but it does \n     demonstrate our leadership and strengthens our hand as we \n     seek to hold these and other governments accountable.\n\n  I suggest the administration may want to carefully consider whether \nit wants the Senate to evaluate the treaty on that basis. What real \nprogress has been made on nonproliferation since the President signed \nthe treaty? Is the latest Security Council resolution an indication of \nthe value of the New START?\n  While the U.N. Security Council has not adopted a resolution yet with \nrespect to Iran, the announcement by the administration on May 18 \nincluded no reference to any sanctions that would close the noose \naround the IRGC, around Iran's energy sector, especially refined \npetroleum products, and Iran's banking sector, and all the other \nrevenue streams that feed Iran's illegal nuclear weapons program and \nits terrorism apparatus.\n  Most of what is in the draft resolution--for example, references to \nthe Iranian Central Bank--are in the preamble. The administration has \ntold us that preambles are not binding. So which is it? Are preambles \nbinding or is the draft resolution a bunch of words with little effect?\n  Also very troubling is the disclosure that the resolution does not \nprohibit the sale to Iran by Russia of the S-300 antiaircraft missile \nsystem. Not including the S-300 in the draft Security Council \nresolution is unfortunate confirmation that the administration has not \n``reset'' relations with Russia in any meaningful way. In fact, the \nMoscow-based Kommersant Online reported this morning--and I quote--\n``Moreover, according to the terms of the deal, Washington is also \nlifting its objections to the sale to Iran of Russian S-300 \nantiaircraft missile systems.'' I cannot stress how important this \nissue is. Under no circumstances can the administration permit Russia \nto think the United States is not opposed to this transfer. If Russia \nproceeds with this transfer, not only will the Russian entities \ninvolved have to be sanctioned under U.S. law, but United States-Russia \nrelations will be in a grave state of crisis.\n\n  It would appear the reason Russia agreed to the weak U.N. sanctions \nresolution is it will not affect any of its ties with Tehran. At the \nsame time, it has announced it will embark on nuclear cooperation with \nSyria, as it announces, for example, the planned activation of the \nBushehr reactor next August. What is the administration's reaction? We \nhave learned it will roll back proliferation sanctions on Russian \nentities. Could this possibly be a quid pro quo for Russia's support \nfor the draft resolution? I thought the START treaty was supposed to \nensure their support. Nor has the President's ``leading by example,'' \ntouted by Secretary Clinton, affected even NATO member Turkey and \nhemispheric member Brazil. The administration was obviously blindsided \nby Brazil and Turkey, working instead with Iran on an alternative plan.\n  So it is fair to ask: What progress has been made on nonproliferation \nthat the administration can point to that suggests the START treaty is \na meaningful tool in keeping States such as Iran and North Korea from \nviolating their nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations?\n  Let me turn back directly to START and begin the seven items I \nmentioned, beginning with the first: the modernization plan. This is \nthe plan that section 1251 of last year's Defense Authorization Act \nrequired be submitted at the same time the treaty was sent to us for \nits ratification.\n  The key goal of most arms control agreements is to achieve strategic \nstability. The New START treaty was negotiated on the premise of \nnumeric stability, but there are a number of underlying factors \nrequired, a foundation upon which to base that stability. For the \nUnited States, it is the confidence provided by both the current U.S. \nnuclear warheads and delivery systems and by the weapons complex and \nits capacity to sustain and modernize those nuclear warheads. For this \nreason, 41 Senators wrote to President Obama last December, \nhighlighting the direct link between nuclear force reductions under the \ntreaty and modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex.\n  What are some of the factors that affect its strategic stability, \nbeyond the treaty numbers? Well, first, the weapons we deploy must be \nsafe, secure and, most critically, for stability they must be reliable. \nGiven the age of our current weapons, averaging close to 30 years, we \nmust be extremely diligent about monitoring those deployed weapons \nthrough our surveillance programs.\n  We also have warheads that require life extensions such as the W76, \nwhich is underway, and soon, I hope, the B61. Without life extension, \nthese weapons will soon cease to be capable of protecting our country. \nWe must be looking to the future stockpile with new approaches, \nincluding life extension, using a full spectrum of options responsive \nto future needs. To achieve this will require a strong science, \ntechnology, and engineering workforce in our national laboratories and \nmilitary complex that maintains critical skills and is resolute in its \ndetermination to solve the complicated problems at hand.\n  We must make an intense, unified push to restore a viable production \ncapacity for nuclear warheads. Herein lives the greatest chink in our \narmor. As former Secretary Schlesinger recently testified:\n\n       The Russians have a live production base. They turn over \n     their inventory of nuclear weapons every 10 years. We do not.\n\n  Finally, we cannot neglect the delivery systems that carry these \nnuclear weapons. They are also aging and they also are prey to neglect \nand loss of critical capabilities.\n  The section 1251 plan was to address the issues I have just \nhighlighted. We have received this classified report, and we are in the \nprocess of reviewing the statements of the administration to ensure \nthat modernization is, in fact, adequately addressed.\n  The administration has outlined in this report a plan to provide, \nover the next decade, $80 billion for nuclear weapon activities and \nabout $100 billion for delivery system activities. To be clear, most of \nthis money is not new. In fact, the bulk of the money covers current \nspending levels plus inflation for the decade. While this is a needed \nimprovement from the grossly inadequate fiscal year 2010 budget \nsubmission, we do not yet know how much the administration intends to \ncommit to modernization and how it will be spent.\n  It has been well advertised that there is a renewed emphasis by the \nadministration on sustaining our stockpile and modernizing the \ninfrastructure. Congress has long recognized the need for this extra \nattention, for example, calling for the Stockpile Management Program \nand the section 1251 plan requirement in the fiscal year 2010 National\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nDefense Authorization Act. But after reviewing the fiscal year 2011 \nbudget input, I am concerned the administration has not done all it \nshould.\n  The fiscal year 2011 budget weapons activities part of the budget of \n$7 billion is a 10-percent increase over fiscal year 2010, with a 26-\npercent increase in the category of Directed Stockpile Work. This looks \ngood on paper. The question is the substance. The fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2009 plans from NNSA predicted that the fiscal year 2011 budget \nshould be, on average, $7 billion--exactly what the administration \nasked for this year. What we need to know is how much in addition to \nthe $7 billion for NNSA weapon activities over the next 10 years.\n  A cursory review of the numbers recommended in the section 1251 plan \nshows the proposed funding is, in fact, barely keeping up with \ninflation. In fiscal year 2010, Congress provided roughly $6.4 billion \nfor the current nuclear weapons account at NNSA. If the fiscal year \n2010 budget is assumed as a new 10-year baseline, that would be $64 \nbillion of the $80 billion proposal for nuclear weapons activities at \nNNSA, assuming no increase for inflation or increased costs of \nmodernization. If you assume a standard rate of inflation of 3 percent \nto cover cost-of-living adjustments in salaries and increased material \ncosts using the fiscal year 2010 appropriations as the baseline, then \nholding that budget constant would require a total of $75.6 billion \nover the 10-year period. If a 2-year rate of inflation is used, then \nthe increase is about $8 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, we know the fiscal year 2010 budget is not a \nsustainable baseline. The Senate Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee noted in its committee report last year that:\n\n       The committee does not believe this level of funding is \n     adequate to support modernization of the complex including \n     critical investment in infrastructure and scientific \n     capabilities.\n\n  So our stockpile is aging, refurbishments are behind schedule, the \nCold War infrastructure is falling apart, and the critical science and \ntechnology skills that underwrite our nuclear deterrence are atrophied. \nBut rather than seeing a new commitment to this problem, the budget \nrequest and the 1251 plan seem to be based on a plan--the fiscal year \n2010 budget--that wasn't making much progress as it was.\n  It appears to me this plan was based not so much on what is needed \nbut what funding the administration was willing to make available. In \nthis case, it seems to be what funding Secretary Gates could sacrifice \nfrom his budget because that is how the additional money for this year \ncame about. Why was the administration only willing to find funding \nauthority in the DOD budget, the one department of the Federal \nGovernment engaged in fighting two wars? Secretary Gates had to \ntransfer money from his budget over to the Energy Department budget.\n  As important as the amount of money available is the freedom to \npursue all options available to ensure the safety, security, and \nreliability of our highly complex nuclear stockpile. The Nuclear \nPosture Review restricts options for modernizing existing warheads by \nstating:\n\n       In any decision to proceed to engineering development for \n     warhead LEPs--\n\n  That is, life extension projects--\n\n     the United States will give strong preference to options for \n     refurbishment or reuse. Replacement of nuclear components \n     would be undertaken only if critical Stockpile Management \n     Program goals could not otherwise be met and if specifically \n     authorized by the President and approved by Congress.\n\n  The 1251 plan tries to deal with this overly restrictive limitation \nby stating:\n\n       The Laboratory Directors will ensure that the full range of \n     life extension program approaches, including refurbishment, \n     reuse, and replacement of nuclear components are studied.\n\n  But it still reiterates that there is a ``policy preference for \nrefurbishment and reuse in decisions to proceed from study to \nengineering development.''\n  Why would our nuclear scientists spend time and limited resources and \nrisk their careers studying the full range of options if, when they \nmake their recommendations, the President requires that they prove the \nimpossible; namely, that replacement must be the only choice? Why isn't \nthe standard instead what is the best course of action?\n  The Perry-Schlesinger Commission noted the importance of flexibility \nwhen it reported to Congress last May. It stated there are:\n\n     . . . options along a spectrum . . . in between are various \n     options to utilize existing components and design solutions \n     while mixing in new components and solutions as needed. \n     Different warheads may lend themselves to different solutions \n     along this spectrum. The decision on which approach is best \n     should be made on a case-by-case basis as the existing \n     stockpile of warheads ages.\n\n  The bipartisan commission of six Republicans and six Democrats \ndetermined that:\n\n       So long as modernization proceeds within the framework of \n     existing U.S. policy, it should encounter minimum political \n     difficulty.\n\n  Well, the NPR changes that policy, and the section 1251 plan \nreiterates the NPR language after initially suggesting scientists will \nbe given complete latitude. I believe this will have a chilling effect \non the scientists' work and that this issue must be resolved.\n  Similarly, we have questions concerning the administration's \ncommitment to maintaining and modernizing nuclear delivery systems. \nWhile the administration suggests in the Nuclear Posture Review and the \n1251 plan that it will maintain a nuclear triad, there is no funding in \nthat plan for follow-on strategic systems, other than a replacement for \nour aging nuclear ballistic missile submarines. In fact, the 1251 plan \nnotes that the administration will not even make a decision regarding a \nnext generation bomber and a follow-on ICBM until 2013 and 2015, \nrespectively. Likewise, rather than commit to a new nuclear cruise \nmissile, the administration instead announces that a study is being \ndone to determine if it will be replaced. Finally, the 1251 plan is \nsilent on funding needed to develop and deploy conventional prompt \nglobal strike capabilities which, according to the Nuclear Posture \nReview, are to play a larger role in our strategic posture.\n  The notional nuclear force structure under New START suggested in the \n1251 plan lacks sufficient detail. It calls for up to 420 ICBMs, up to \n60 strategic bombers, and no more than 240 SLBMs. It would be helpful \nto know exactly how U.S. forces will be configured, how we might expect \nRussia to configure its nuclear forces, both strategical and tactical, \nand then have a net assessment to determine whether the United States \nis still capable of carrying out its deterrence missions, especially \nproviding nuclear security guarantees to allies and partners.\n  With regard to New START limitations and force structure, the New \nSTART treaty limits the number of deployed strategic delivery systems \nto 700. Since the United States today deploys approximately 800 \ndelivery systems, this will require a reduction of some 180 ICBMs, \nSLBMs, and/or strategic bombers to reach the treaty limitations--more \nif we deploy conventional global strike missiles, since, by the terms \nof the treaty, these must be counted as nuclear as well.\n  The Russians, on the other hand, are already below the 700 figure. So \nthis is the first time that at least I am aware the United States will \nagree to launcher limitations that will require the United States to \nreduce its forces but require no reductions by Russia. It is fair to \nask what the United States got for this concession.\n  Moreover, because a bomber counts as only one delivery system and one \nwarhead no matter how many bombs or cruise missiles are loaded on it, \nthe Russians are able legally to field more than 1,150 warheads limited \nby the treaty. While this may appear to advantage both sides, I do not \nfear U.S. cheating--we would not--but the Russians could, and because \nof weak verification tools in the treaty, I am not sure we will know. \nThis is another reason to await the NIE before making a decision on the \ntreaty.\n  Let me quote from the Heritage Foundation analysis on this point. It \nsays:\n\n       In fact, despite Obama administration claims to the \n     contrary, New START's counting rules and apparent lapses will \n     permit increases in Russian strategic force levels above the \n     1,700 to 2,200 deployed warhead limit of the Moscow Treaty.\n\n  I am not going to quote the remainder of this analysis, but I would \nask unanimous consent that the statement, as I submit it for the \nRecord, contain the remainder of this analysis.\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       According to a Heritage Foundation analysis:\n\n       In fact, despite Obama Administration claims to the \n     contrary, New START's counting rules and apparent lapses will \n     permit increases in Russian strategic force levels above the \n     1,700-2,200 deployed warhead limit of the Moscow Treaty. RIA \n     Novosti, an official news agency of the Russian Federation, \n     already has reported that given New START's counting rules, \n     Russia will be able to retain 2,100 strategic nuclear \n     warheads under New START, not 1,550. Russia will be able to \n     deploy even higher numbers under New START if it follows \n     through on-announced modernization programs, particularly the \n     new heavy bomber. In addition Russia could deploy strategic \n     nuclear systems that were limited or prohibited under START \n     I, but appear not to be limited whatsoever under New START.\n       If Russia exploits the legal lapses in New START, there is \n     no actual limit in the new Treaty on the number of strategic \n     nuclear warheads that can be deployed. The number of Russia's \n     strategic nuclear warheads would be limited only by the \n     financial resources it is able to devote to strategic forces, \n     not by New START warhead ceilings--which would be the case \n     without this new Treaty.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The bottom line is, there were concessions by the United \nStates. The Russian conventions are essentially strictly based on their \nfinancial situation, not by any New START warhead ceilings. So what I \nthink we should ask is why did we agree to it and what did we get in \nreturn.\n  Additionally, what will the U.S. nuclear force structure look like \nafter eliminating these 180 U.S. strategic delivery systems? I have \nalready talked about it, but I wish to explain why this is an important \nrequirement for Senators to consider before we vote on the treaty.\n  The administration has provided some initial information as a basis \nfor future planning. It could retain up to 420 ICBMs, up to 60 \nstrategic bombers, and deploy no more than 240 SLBMs at any time. We \nwill require further details about where these reductions will be made \nand how this force structure fares against our most likely prediction \nabout how the Russians will design their nuclear forces.\n  An issue of concern is that while the United States intends to deploy \nonly single-warhead ICBMs under the administration's new NPR, the \ntreaty appears to be driving the Russians to deploy multiple-warhead \nmissiles for their ICBM force. Land-based multiple-warhead missiles \nhave long been considered destabilizing because they place a premium on \nstriking first for fear of losing a large proportion of one's warheads \nby a preemptive strike by the other side. For this reason, MIRVs were \nto be banned by the START II treaty that never entered into force. Now, \n80 percent of Russia's ICBM force will be road mobile and MIRVed. In \nlight of this, it is curious to hear the administration now argue that \nNew Start will increase strategic stability.\n  Assuming the U.S. nuclear force structure is survivable, the next \nquestion is whether it is sufficient for deterrence purposes--\nespecially the more difficult mission of extending nuclear guarantees \nto allies and partners.\n  As I said, the New Start treaty limits deployed strategic delivery \nsystems to 700. A September 2008 white paper by the Defense and Energy \nDepartments suggests a force of approximately 900 delivery systems is \nnecessary for deterrence purposes, and in congressional testimony last \nsummer, Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright expressed concerns with \nforce levels below 800. How, then, can 700 be the correct number? \nAgain, Senators must see the analysis themselves to make a decision on \nthis. I don't see how a mere assurance in an unclassified committee \nhearing can be sufficient on a matter like this.\n  As to missile defense, despite being told consistently from the very \nbeginning of negotiations that missile defense will be addressed only \nin the preamble of the treaty, we now discover that article V contains \na direct restriction on U.S. missile defense activities--i.e. neither \nparty can convert ICBM or SLBM launchers into launchers for missile \ndefense interceptors. In fact, just prior to the treaty's public \nrelease, Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher said the following: \n``But there is no limit or constraint on what the United States can do \nwith its missile defense systems.'' Now, this begs two questions: 1, \ndid Ms. Tauscher not know what was in the treaty her subordinates were \nnegotiating; or 2, did whoever wrote Ms. Tauscher's talking points \nthink Senators wouldn't notice an entire article of the treaty text?\n  Some administration officials have tried to explain this away by \nsaying that, since this administration has no current plans to do so, \nit's not a constraint. That stands the English language on its head. \nThis concession to the Russian Federation will establish a dangerous \nprecedent with respect to including missile defense limitations in \nfuture offensive arms control agreements. Why did the U.S. side feel it \nnecessary to concede this point? What did we get in return? Again, this \nis why it is important to see the full negotiating record.\n  When viewed together, the treaty's preamble, the Russian unilateral \nstatement on missile defense, and remarks by senior Russian officials \nprovide the potential for Russia to essentially blackmail the U.S. \nagainst increasing its missile defense capabilities by threatening to \nwithdraw from the treaty.\n  The preamble states that ``current strategic defensive arms do not \nundermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive \narms of the parties.'' Does this suggest that moving beyond ``current'' \nsystems could provide grounds for withdrawal?\n  The Russians note in their unilateral statement that the treaty ``can \noperate and be viable only if the United States of America refrains \nfrom developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or \nqualitatively,'' and also link American missile defense capabilities to \nthe treaty's withdrawal clause. Shouldn't we read this as an attempt to \nexert political pressure to forestall continued development and \ndeployment of U.S. missile defenses? The preamble doesn't have to be \nlegally binding to be influential.\n  Even more disturbing is the administration's decision to limit U.S. \nmissile defenses to be effective only against a ``limited attack,'' \nthus exempting Russian capabilities from the reach of our missile \ndefenses. Since the U.S. unilateral statement makes quite clear that \nthe administration intends to deploy only ``limited'' missile defenses \nto deal with ``limited attack,'' the administration has left itself no \nroom to respond to strategic surprise or a disintegration of the \ncurrent strategic relationship with key nuclear powers, let alone an \naccidental launch. Let me quote from the text of the U.S. unilateral \nstatement:\n\n       The United States missile defense systems would be employed \n     to defend the United States against limited missile launches, \n     and to defend its deployed forces, allies and partners \n     against regional threats. The United States intends to \n     continue improving and deploying its missile defense systems \n     in order to defend itself against limited attack and as part \n     of our collaborative approach to strengthening stability in \n     key regions.\n\n  Here is something else that's troubling. General Jones, in a May 12, \n2010, letter to me wrote, ``Russian unilateral statement is both beyond \nthe control of the Administration and not binding or limiting in any \nway on current or planned U.S. missile defense programs.'' I will \nrepeat that because it is important: ``not binding or limiting in any \nway on current or planned U.S. missile defense programs.''\n  What about a program that is not current or planned? Our unilateral \nstatement must lead one to ask whether the Russian statement was \nanswered by the U.S. statement, in effect saying, ``you don't worry \nabout our missile defense because we won't make it effective against \nyou.'' What if a future administration decides to return to the concept \nof actually protecting America from any nuclear attack even from \nRussia?\n  The Russians will have the right to rely on these statements for at \nleast the ten years of the treaty's operation. These statements may \nbecome the new baseline in future arms control negotiations between the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation. Ronald Reagan enunciated the \nvision of U.S. missile defense, which I believe is as true today as it \nwas in 1983:\n\n       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that \n     their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. \n     retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept \n     and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached \n     our own soil or that of our allies? But isn't it worth every \n     investment necessary to free the world from the threat of \n     nuclear war? We know it is.''\n\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n\n  I am concerned that when Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov warned, on \nMarch 28, that ``the treaty and all the obligations it contains are \nvalid only within the context of the levels which are now present in \nthe sphere of strategic defensive systems,'' it means the Russians will \nthreaten to pull out of START if we deploy additional ground-based \ninterceptors in Alaska or if we deploy the SM-3 block IIB missile in \nEurope, as the administration promised.\n  There is something fundamentally disturbing about entering into a \ntreaty with the Russians when we have such a divergence in view over a \nsubstantial issue like missile defense. At the very least this likely \nsets the stage for misunderstanding and confrontation as the United \nStates continues its missile defense activities, particularly in \nEurope. Remember, the goal of the treaty was supposed to be stability \nfrom a common understanding and agreement on core principles.\n  Those who have rushed to embrace the treaty must confront this \nreality and the administration must be required to square the circle.\n  On verification, Secretary Gates testified that this treaty provides \n``a strong verification regime . . . which provides a firm basis for \nmonitoring Russia's compliance with its treaty obligations.'' I \ncertainly have a great deal respect for Secretary Gates, but I'm not \nsure how he can know that yet. Has he seen the NIE on the treaty? Or \nthe State Department verifiability assessment? And, even if treaty \nnoncompliance can be verified, what have we lost in intelligence as a \nresult of the weakening of the verification compared to the START \ntreaty?\n  Independent assessments of the treaty suggest important new gaps in \nmonitoring. For example, the treaty no longer requires on-the-ground, \ncontinuous monitoring of Russia's missile manufacturing facility and \npermits Russia to withhold telemetry of many of its missile tests, \nundermining our ability to know how many missiles are being produced \nand, perhaps, limiting our ability to understand what new capabilities \nare being developed. The administration has blamed the Bush \nadministration for this, and I have asked for the evidence in letters \nto the Secretary of State, including a December 4, 2009, letter. So far \nthe administration has been unwilling to substantiate this allegation--\nwhich it could do by responding to my letters and inquiries on the \nmatter.\n  The ability to monitor compliance with the terms of the treaty is \nimportant, but as important is whether our intelligence community can \nmonitor the status of Russian strategic nuclear forces. What new \ncapabilities is Russia developing? Is Russia building and stockpiling \nadditional missiles and warheads that could provide it a break-out \ncapability? Will we be able to maintain confidence in our assessment of \nRussian forces throughout the 10-year period of the treaty? According \nto Secretary Gates, ``And I think what you are likely to hear from them \n[the Intelligence Community] is that they have high confidence in their \nability to monitor this treaty until toward the end of the 10-year \nterm, when their confidence level will go to moderate.''\n  What is the impact of a judgment like that when we know Russia is \nincreasing its reliance on its nuclear forces, conducting war games \ninvolving simulating raids against NATO allies like Poland, and \nmodernizing almost every element of its strategic and tactical nuclear \nforces? For example, Russia is, in fact, deploying a new multipurpose \nattack submarine that can launch long range cruise missiles with \nnuclear warheads against land targets at a range of 5,000 kilometers--\njust barely missing the threshold to be considered a strategic weapon \nunder the New START treaty. Of course, a tactical nuclear weapon has a \nstrategic effect if it is detonated above a U.S. or allied city.\n  We will need the intelligence community to consider these important \nfactors before we can fully evaluate the treaty; I look forward to a \nthorough NIE that rigorously analyzes our ability to monitor Russian \nnuclear forces. And, I am sure the Intelligence Committee will hold \nnumerous hearings to flesh out these issues.\n  As to the impact the treaty has on U.S. and Russian nuclear force \nlevels, especially regarding tactical nuclear weapons, the \nadministration argues that New Start will ``increase'' or ``provide'' \nstrategic stability, but has yet to explain why the 10-1 disparity in \ntactical nuclear weapons doesn't upset that strategic stability, \nespecially at lower levels of strategic nuclear forces. As former \nSecretary of Defense James Schlesinger recently testified, ``the \nsignificance of tactical nuclear weapons rises steadily as strategic \nnuclear arms are reduced.''\n  The Strategic Posture Commission estimates Russia may have \napproximately 3,800 operational tactical nuclear warheads, and that the \ncombination of new warhead designs and precision delivery systems \n``opens up new possibilities for Russian efforts to threaten to use \nnuclear weapons to influence regional conflicts.''\n  Likewise, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Michele Flournoy, \nhas observed that the Russians are ``actually increasing their reliance \non nuclear weapons and the role of nuclear weapons in their strategy.'' \nThere is a fine line--actually, no line at all except as to how they \nare delivered--between strategic and tactical weapons.\n  If the Russians intend to use nuclear weapons to influence regional \nconflicts, then shouldn't we try to understand the impact of their \nnumbers in the context of declining U.S. strategic nuclear weapons \nrequired by the treaty? In other words, what will be the effect of \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons on strategic stability and our ability \nto extend deterrence into various regions? We should understand this \nbefore agreeing with the administration's contention that this treaty \nincreases stability.\n  The administration's retort is that they understand the importance of \ndealing with the disparity in tactical nuclear weapons, but that we \nmust first ratify New Start before getting to Russian tactical nuclear \nweapons in the next treaty. But what leverage will we have left? And \nwhy should we think a ``next treaty'' that further reduces our weapons \nwill be in our rational interest?\n  And if tactical weapons are as important as most seem to believe, why \ndidn't we make them a priority in this treaty? Because the Russians \ndidn't want to talk about them? Why was that enough to demur? How hard \ndid we push? Again, this is why Senators need to see the negotiating \nrecord, and why they shouldn't make up their minds on the treaty until \nthey do.\n  BCC--Bilateral Consultative Commission\n  One of the matters the administration will have to address before the \nSenate could consider ratification is the role of the Bilateral \nConsultative Commission in the treaty. As Ambassadors Edelman and \nJoseph observe in their May 10th National Review Online article:\n\n       A preliminary reading of the Treaty Protocol suggests that \n     the U.S. and Russian commissioners could reach secret \n     agreement on changes to ensure the `viability and \n     effectiveness' of the treaty. These changes could create \n     additional limits on missile defense that would appear to be \n     beyond the reach of the Senate's responsibility to advise and \n     consent.\n\n  Obviously, that is not acceptable. This matter will have to be \nthoroughly vetted during the hearings and presumably be dealt with in \nthe resolution of ratification. While there may have been similar \nprovisions in past treaties, the Senate should insist on a reasonable \ncheck on such an open-ended provision in the resolution of \nratification.\n  Now to the conventional prompt global strike or PGS. Although \ntactical nuclear weapons were not addressed in this treaty, the United \nStates conceded to Russian demands to place limits on our conventional \nprompt global strike capabilities by counting conventionally armed \nstrategic ballistic missiles under the limits for delivery systems. At \nthe very least, this will require a one-for-one reduction in U.S.-\ndeployed nuclear weapons for each conventional ICBM it intends to \ndeploy. This is yet another reason Senators need to see the force \nposture before they can make up their minds on the treaty.\n  The treaty also sets the stage for further limitations on U.S. \nconventional strike capabilities in the preamble by noting that the \nparties are ``mindful of the impact of conventionally armed ICBMs and \nSLBMs on strategic stability.'' Does any Senator imagine the Russians \nwill not raise objections when\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nthe United States begins the serious development of prompt global \nstrike capabilities, as called for by the Nuclear Posture Review?\n  Moreover, the administration must be candid when it testifies about \nissues such as PGS missile defense. It cannot continue to state that \nthe treaty does not limit PGS or missile defenses when it clearly does.\n  In conclusion, Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have predicated \ntheir support for the treaty on their answer to the question: Are we \nbetter off with an agreement or without it? They suggest that without \nthe agreement, we would lack the ability to limit and monitor Russian \nstrategic forces.\n  My response is twofold:\n  First, the existing 2002 Moscow Treaty already limits Russian \nwarheads. True, the Moscow Treaty relied on the now-expired START \ntreaty's verification procedures, but these could have been extended by \nmutual consent. The Russians refused or the administration did not \nbother to ask. We will not know until the administration shares the \nnegotiating record with us.\n  Second, I believe the better question is, Are we better off with this \ntreaty or a treaty that did not include any references to missile \ndefense or prompt global strike and which did contain limitations on \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons? These are issues for Senators to \nconsider when they debate the resolution of ratification and amendments \nto it, whether they be reservations or conditions or otherwise.\n  In her opening statement at the May 18 Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing on New START, Secretary Clinton asserted that ``the choice \nbefore us is between this treaty and no treaty governing our nuclear \nsecurity relationship with Russia.'' This assertion is obviously a \nfalse choice. It reflects sort of an ``our way or the highway'' \napproach, completely inconsistent with the responsibilities of the \nSenate. Since the administration did not consult the Senate for its \nadvice before making its negotiating concessions, it should not now \nargue that the Senate has only the choice of voting for the treaty that \nwe cannot amend and therefore must vote yes and that it would be \nimpossible to negotiate another agreement. After all, isn't that what \nboth sides did in walking away from the START II agreement? The Senate \nis not a rubberstamp.\n  We have the opportunity and responsibility to fully understand this \ntreaty and understand whether it furthers the security of the American \npeople. And we must consider it in the context of other considerations \nsuch as the nuclear modernization that goes hand-in-hand with \nconsideration of the treaty. The administration will have to find a \nway, for example, to ensure the necessary funding for modernization \nbefore the Senate votes on the treaty.\n  Sergei Karagonov, chairman of the Russian Council on Defense and \nForeign Policy, summarized the Russian view of the treaty saying:\n\n       In the course of the negotiations, Russia reached almost \n     all of the objectives it could possibly set.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good metric by which to evaluate the outcome \nof the treaty. Are we able to say the same thing for the United States? \nThat is a question which will need to be answered affirmatively for the \nSenate to ratify the treaty.\n  We have just begun the process of evaluation and potentially \nratification. I urge all of my colleagues to refrain from judgments \nbefore our process is complete. I do not doubt there are arguments in \nsupport of the treaty. The recitation of my concerns today should be \ntaken as just that--concerns--hopefully to make the point that there \nare reasons for us to be careful and thoughtful and not jump to \nconclusions. I look forward to an exercise worthy of the Senate in the \nconsideration of this important submission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Officer Thomas Wortham IV\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I come before this august body with a very \nheavy heart this afternoon. Last Friday night, just a few blocks from \nmy home in Chicago, a terrible act of violence claimed the life of a \nyoung police officer. Thomas Wortham IV was a distinguished Chicago \npolice officer. He was off duty on Wednesday night, so he went to visit \nhis parents in a nice neighborhood called Chatham--in which I live only \n2\\1/2\\ blocks away--to show them his new motorcycle.\n  Officer Wortham was used to putting his life on the line. In addition \nto being one of Chicago's finest, he recently served two tours in Iraq. \nHe devoted himself to his community and to his country. He exhibited \nthe same courage, valor, and selfless dedication wherever he went.\n  Thomas Wortham was a true American hero. He was the kind of person \nwho keeps us safe and makes it possible for the rest of us to go about \nour lives free from fear; the kind of person who serves as an example \nto those around him and inspires others to give back.\n  But last Wednesday night, as he sat on his brandnew motorcycle \noutside of his parents' home, this remarkable young man was violently \ntaken from us. After two tours in Iraq and endless hours patrolling the \nmean streets, Officer Wortham was struck down practically in his own \nbackyard. Several young men tried to rob him, and he was shot in the \nstruggle. His father, who is also a military veteran and retired police \nsergeant, heroically rushed to his defense and returned fire on those \nwho attacked his son. But it was too late. Gun violence had already \nclaimed Officer Wortham's life.\n  For all his heroism, for all the good he did for his community and \nhis country, in the end Thomas Wortham IV was tragically killed where \nhe should have been perfectly safe. There is no justice in this; there \nis no silver lining. This is just major outrage. It was a despicable, \nsenseless act committed by dangerous people, all of whom must suffer \nthe full consequences of the law.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning Thomas Wortham IV, \nwho was taken from us far before his time. Let us remember his selfless \ndevotion to his community and to his country. Let us celebrate his \nheroism and honor his memory by living out his values in our daily \nlives.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to his family, whose pain far exceeds \neven the deep sense of loss felt by others in the Chicago community. \nThis Nation stands with them today, just as their son stood with us in \nthe sands of Iraq and the streets of Chicago.\n  As we lay this fallen hero to rest, let us do more than remember. Let \nus take action. This tragic murder reminds us of the gun violence \npandemic that holds cities and towns across America in a vice grip. It \ncan strike anywhere at any time, and it is tearing apart families, \ncommunities, and our own sense of security.\n  It is time to reclaim our future. It is time to stop the shooting and \nstart to invest in education, violence prevention, and afterschool \nprograms so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and keep \nkids from turning down the wrong path in the first place. This means \ncreating jobs and cracking down on those who should not be able to buy \nguns. It means challenging our young people to aspire to a better life \nand giving them the tools to make the right choices so they do not end \nup on the road to violence.\n  This is not a political issue or a matter of dollars and cents. This \nis about the place where we live, work, and go to church, the places \nwhere our children play and go to school. Officer Wortham lived and \ndied for these folks, for his friends and his neighbors and his \ncountrymen. Even in a moment of tragedy, as we grieve this devastating \nloss, I believe we must summon the courage to walk in this young man's \nfootsteps, to take up his cause as our own and lift up his noble \nexample.\n  As I advised the parents when I met with them, let us take back our \nstreets, our schools, our churches, and our children's future. Where \nThomas Wortham IV fell, let us all rise in his place to confront this \nchallenge and end the scourge of gun violence once and for all. Let us \ndo that.\n  His family is also in mourning because retired Sergeant Wortham \nkilled one of the offenders and shot the second one, who is now in \ncritical condition in the hospital. Thank goodness for the Chicago \nPolice Department and good detective work because the other two \noffenders are now in custody.\n  What we must do is stand and be counted when it comes to guns and\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nyoung people with guns in their hands and no jobs and no future and no \nhope. That is what we experience. In this legislation that is before \nthis body, there is money that has to be provided for summer jobs for \nour youth.\n  Patrolman Wortham would not be the last person to expire through gun \nviolence on our streets. I ask my colleagues to look at what we are \ndoing and what we have to do and make sure we do our part to provide \nthe resources and opportunity for our youth in these urban areas to \nhave some hope, some direction, something on which to rely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Department of State and Foreign \nOperations chapter of this supplemental totals $6.17 billion, which is \nthe same as the President's request. The bulk of these funds are for \nemergency operations and programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and \nHaiti.\n  Senator Gregg and I supported most of the President's requests, but \nwe could not support them all and there were other items, like pandemic \nflu and assistance for disaster victims and refugees in other parts of \nthe world, which we could not ignore.\n  We also provide additional assistance for Mexico, where drug-related \nviolence spilling into the United States is a growing concern of many \nSenators, and for Jordan, a key ally in the Middle East.\n  We include language requiring a determination by the Secretary of \nState that the governments of Afghanistan and Haiti are taking \nnecessary steps concerning transparency and corruption. We require \nconsultation with local communities and a central role for women in \ndecisions about assistance programs.\n  The funds in the State and Foreign Operations chapter of this bill \nare for programs that are strongly supported by both the Department of \nState and the Department of Defense, in countries where the United \nStates has important national security interests.\n  I very much appreciate the way Senator Gregg and his staff worked \nwith me and my staff on our chapter of this bill. At a time when it is \npopular to complain that Washington is ``broken,'' the Appropriations \nCommittee continues to do important and necessary work in its \ntraditional, bipartisan manner and I think this bill is an example of \nthat.\n  I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran for the \nsupport they have given us during this process. I would also ask that \nif Members have amendments to the State and Foreign Operations chapter \nthat they inform Senator Gregg and me as soon as possible.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a couple of \nminutes--I know the time at 4:45 is otherwise obligated; I will be \nbriefer than that--about President Calderon's visit to the United \nStates, his joint session speech to Congress, and a border security \namendment I intend to offer, hopefully, as soon as tomorrow.\n  As you know, Mr. President, President Calderon addressed a joint \nsession of Congress, and I was fortunate enough to have a very brief \nconversation with him in the anteroom before he came to the floor of \nthe House, during which time I told him I admire his commitment to \nfight the drug cartels in Mexico.\n  During his remarks before the Congress and to the American people, \nPresident Calderon said some things I thought were very important for \nall of us to hear.\n  First of all, he said Mexico has gone ``all-in'' against the \ncartels--with increased commitments and personnel and equipment--and, \nunfortunately, is suffering significant losses and casualties in the \nfight. There have indeed been 23,000 Mexicans, approximately, since \n2006, who have lost their lives in Mexico during these drug wars.\n  President Calderon also reminded us that Mexico is one of our most \nimportant trading partners, primarily as a result of NAFTA--the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. He pointed out that Mexico has, \nnotwithstanding its other challenges, managed to keep its budget \ndeficit low relative to its GDP--a record of fiscal discipline that \nshould give us some embarrassment in Washington.\n  President Calderon acknowledged--and I think this is very important--\nthat the lack of economic opportunities available in Mexico are a \nprimary cause of illegal immigration into the United States.\n  While I admire some of the things President Calderon said, I do think \nhe crossed a line he should not have crossed when he used this \nsetting--a speech to a joint session of Congress and to the American \npeople--to lecture Americans on our own State and Federal laws. For \nexample, he criticized America's gun laws and seemed to suggest that we \nshould somehow consider relinquishing our second amendment rights in \norder to help them disarm the cartels.\n  With all due respect to President Calderon, America's second \namendment rights are not a proper subject of international negotiation \nwith Mexico or any other nation.\n  Then President Calderon went on to criticize Arizona's immigration \nlaw last week on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--at the White House \nand at the Capitol--which I also believe was inappropriate under the \ncircumstances.\n  There is no doubt there is fear and frustration all along the \nborder--fear that the border violence that is raging just to the south \nis going to spill over into the United States, and frustration that \nWashington, DC--especially Congress and the President--is not doing \nenough about it. Arizona's law was written in response to this fear and \nfrustration.\n  It is important to note--and this is a key fact that needs to be \ncorrected on the record--that the Arizona Legislature amended their law \nto make clear that ethnic and racial profiling by law enforcement \nofficials is strictly prohibited. That was a necessary and important \nchange. But it doesn't appear President Calderon or many of the \ncritics--including the President of the United States, the Attorney \nGeneral, or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security--have \nactually even read the 10-page bill, which you can read online if you \nhave access to the Internet. I have found it always helps in any \ndiscussion to actually know what you are talking about, to have \nactually read the bill so that you can have an intelligent conversation \nand perhaps then differ about policies.\n  But to misrepresent the contents of the bill, not having read it, is \nsimply inexcusable.\n  To be sure, a patchwork of State laws is not the optimal way to fix \nour broken immigration system. We need sensible reforms at the national \nlevel. I am prepared to work in good faith with anyone committed to \nimmigration laws that make sense in terms of our national security, in \nterms of the restoration of the rule of law, in terms of our economy \nand our values.\n  But some of the criticism of Arizona's law by the administration has \nbeen just simply misleading and counterproductive. Just last week we \nlearned that a State Department representative--Michael Posner--\nactually apologized to China for the Arizona law, saying: ``We brought \nit up early and often.'' Early and often in talks with one of the most \nrepressive regimes in the world? Unbelievable.\n  President Obama himself has set a bad example, repeatedly criticizing \nArizonans for taking action while his own promises for immigration \nreform have gone unfulfilled.\n  The problem raging on our southern border is that the Federal \nGovernment needs to do more to improve our border security. That is \nsomething on which we can all agree and should all agree.\n  How bad is the situation? Well, this morning the El Paso Times \nreported:\n\n       Mexican Federal police were attacked by a drive-by shooting \n     during the weekend as Juarez surpassed 1,000 homicides for \n     the year.\n\n  Ciudad Juarez--within several hundred feet of the city of El Paso in \nthe United States--has lost 1,000 people to the drug wars just this \nyear.\n  As I mentioned, it is estimated that 23,000 Mexicans have lost their \nlives in the drug wars during the last 3 years.\n  The fear is palpable on this side of the border. I must tell you, I \nhave\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nnever seen it quite this way. From Laredo, TX, to McAllen, TX, to El \nPaso--where people are accustomed to the novelty and the unique nature \nof our international border with Mexico, and they believe in \nmaintaining those ties for economic and other reasons--people along the \nborder in Texas, the longest section of the U.S.-Mexican border, are \nmore apprehensive and concerned about what lurks just beyond the \nborder. That fear ranges from cartels actively recruiting students in \nour public schools to gangs in order to help them with their drug-\nsmuggling operations.\n  The Border Patrol has developed ``Operation Detour'' to show our \nstudents how the cartels treat the young people they recruit. The \nresponse to this video presentation has reportedly been powerful.\n  For example, in McAllen, TX, in the Rio Grande Valley, a 14-year-old \ngirl made an emotional exit halfway during the presentation. She told \nthe Border Patrol her father had recently been the victim of a cross-\nborder abduction and her family was afraid to report the kidnapping to \nauthorities for fear of retaliation from the cartel that took him.\n  In Rio Grande City, TX, another city in the Rio Grande Valley, kids \nwere crying midway through the first video because the night before a \nclassmate had died while running drugs.\n  Mr. President, our children are living in fear, but the White House's \nbudget for border security shows it is living in denial. The \nPresident's budget request for fiscal year 2011 cuts the Secure Border \nInitiative by more than 25 percent, and we know the Department of \nHomeland Security is considering the elimination of the SBInet Program \nwith no alternative or replacement in place.\n  The SBInet Program is a Secure Border Initiative. This is supposed to \nbe the virtual fence that, along with boots on the ground and tactical \ninfrastructure, are designed to help us contain and control movement of \npeople across the border. Yet it has been cut by some 25 percent.\n  The President's budget also cuts the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Program--or the HIDA Program--by over 12 percent.\n  The White House even wanted to make cuts--albeit modest--to the \nBorder Patrol by about 181 agents, before those of us in Congress made \nclear this was simply unacceptable. Rather than cutting, we need to be \ngrowing the size of the Border Patrol and the boots on the ground.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I intend to offer at the first \nopportunity--hopefully, tomorrow morning--says border security is a \npriority, not an afterthought. This amendment will fix six priorities \nto improve border security.\n\n  First, it will fund additional equipment that can help protect our \nborder, including helicopters and Predator drones. We have been \nfighting with the Federal Aviation Administration to try to get them to \nquit dragging their feet in authorizing the use of unmanned aerial \nvehicles to patrol our southern border, to help the Border Patrol and \nother law enforcement officials do their job. We are just beginning to \nsee some headway, but they are incredibly undersourced with the lack of \nhelicopters and the lack of additional Predator drones.\n  Second, my amendment will fund additional personnel in several law \nenforcement agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration; \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Immigrations \nand Customs Enforcement; Custom and Border Protection; and the \nCounterdrug units of the National Guard.\n  The third thing my amendment will do will be to fund improvements for \ntask forces and fusion centers that enhance interagency cooperation.\n  Fourth, it will fund additional personnel and facilities to improve \ndetention and removal activities under Federal law.\n  And, fifth, it will create a $300 million grant program to assist \nState and local law enforcement officials who operate within 100 miles \nof the U.S.-Mexican border. Because the Federal Government simply \nhasn't done enough in terms of border security, local and State law \nenforcement have had to step up, and they need the additional help that \nthis grant program will provide to those local and State law \nenforcement agencies operating within 100 miles of the border.\n  Finally, my amendment will provide $100 million to fund \ninfrastructure improvement at our ports of entry. This amendment is \nurgently needed, and I must add that it is fully funded. The total cost \nof my amendment is roughly $2 billion. This cost is fully offset using \nunspent stimulus funds because we know the White House predictions \nabout the uses of those stimulus funds have been discredited.\n  Remember, we were told if we voted for a $787 billion unfunded--\nborrowed money--fund in order to get the economy moving again, \nunemployment would be kept to no more than 8 percent. Now, with \nunemployment at 9.9 percent, roughly, we know that stimulus program has \nbeen unsuccessful.\n  Two-thirds of the American people believe, according to Rasmussen--or \nI believe it is a Pew poll--the stimulus funds simply have not created \nor helped to retain jobs. We know during the period of time the White \nHouse predicted 3\\1/2\\ million jobs would be saved and created that 3 \nmillion jobs have been lost or destroyed by the recession.\n  This amendment represents a clear choice: a choice between funding \nthe Nation's priorities, such as border security or funding the same \nfailed stimulus strategy. It is a choice between paying for our \nNation's priorities or adding more debt to our national credit card, \nalready nearly maxed out at $13 trillion.\n  I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and help \nsend the message to our border communities and across our country that \nthe Federal Government acknowledges and accepts and embraces its \nresponsibility to help keep them and our Nation safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof H.R. 4899, the FEMA supplemental as passed by the House on March 24 \nand marked up by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, May \n13. As my colleagues may be aware, several attempts were made to \nproceed to the House-passed bill, but there were objections to \nproceeding.\n  Because of the delay in acting upon the House bill, the vice chairman \nand I agreed that we should consider all of the supplemental provisions \nin the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee that are pending \nbefore the Congress instead of just the FEMA portion as proposed by the \nHouse. The committee concurred in this recommendation and forwarded the \nbill to the full Senate by a unanimous vote of 30 to 0.\n  This bill contains $45.4 billion in discretionary spending and $13.4 \nbillion in spending on mandatory programs. This amount is the same as \nthe amount requested by the President. I want to point out to all of my \ncolleagues that the bill does not include funding for the settlements \nbetween the Federal Government and African American-farmers and Native \nAmericans.\n  While I am strongly in favor of funding these settlements, these \nitems are, in fact not in the jurisdiction of the Appropriations \nCommittee. We have been informed by the leadership that these matters \nwill be addressed elsewhere. I understand and expect that funding for \nthese two settlements will be approved by the Congress and forwarded to \nthe White House before the Memorial Day recess.\n  The recommendations that Vice Chairman Cochran and I are presenting \nto you on behalf of the appropriations Committee reflect the collective \nefforts of each of our subcommittees. The main parts of the bill \ninclude $33.5 billion in Department of Defense funding to cover the \ncost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, combat terrorism, and respond \nto the earthquake in Haiti. An additional $6.5 billion is provided for \nthe State Department and other agencies in support of these and related \nefforts.\n  The bill also includes $68 million in the first payment to cover \nFederal responsibilities resulting from the oilspill in the gulf. We \nrecognize that additional funding and new legislative authorities are \nlikely to be required in response to the oilspill. The amount we \nrecommend results from our review of the budget amendment which was \nonly submitted to the Administration the day before the committee \nmarkup. We are confident that the sums recommended are necessary but \nrecognize more action will be needed in the coming months.\n  As requested, the committee is also recommending $5.1 billion for \nFEMA'S disaster relief efforts. Everyone should be aware that the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency is out of funding for disaster \nrelief. Even this sum is below what we anticipate will be required \nbefore the end of this year. However, the recommended sum is the amount \nsought by the Administration. The committee was unable to identify \nadditional offsets to increase the total funding for FEMA.\n  In addition to these, the committee has identified rescissions and \nother savings within the Administration's request to address many \nnatural disasters for which the Administration did not request \nassistance.\n  Two weeks ago, more than 40 counties in Tennessee were underwater. \nRhode Island suffered through a once in a 500-year storm in March. A \ndisaster was declared by the President in January for fisheries in \nAlaska. Tornadoes have tormented the Midwest and South. We have dams in \nneed of emergency repair in the Northwest and an urgent requirement to \naddress mine safety, but no funds have been requested to address these \nneeds. Nothing has been offered to offset the enormous cost of clean-up \nand reconstruction for the States and communities which have suffered.\n  In total, the committee has provided more than $425 million to \naddress the disaster related shortfalls that were not requested by the \nAdministration. This is a mere pittance when compared to the $1 or $2 \nbillion that is needed now to meet these needs, but it was that we \ncould identify so late in the fiscal year to help meet these legitimate \nemergency costs.\n  Some will say, ``Well, surely there are other offsets.'' I do not \ndeny there are unobligated funds, but unobligated does not mean \nunneeded. For example, last week we identified a program with $8.3 \nbillion unobligated, the Joint Strike Fighter. The contract award for \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been delayed by months. Accordingly, \nthe funding remains unobligated. Surely those that want to cut \nunobligated balances to offset the cost of this bill do not want us to \nrescind funds for this new fighter.\n  We are told that some of our colleagues would like to send members of \nthe National Guard to the border using unobligated balances to pay that \ncost.\n  Well, I would point out that we have more than $2.6 billion in \nunobligated balances in funding that the Congress has appropriated over \nthe past 3 years to purchase additional equipment for our National \nGuard and Reserve Forces. I suppose we could reallocate funds from that \naccount to cover the cost of stationing additional National Guard \ntroops on the border, But I doubt the proponents of such an amendment \nwould support that. Moreover, like funding for the Joint Strike \nFighter, the amount provided for National Guard equipment is needed \neven if it has not yet been spent.\n  In recent months the rhetoric on Federal spending has focused solely \non how much money has been spent rather than on what was necessary and \nwhat is still required. Many Senators question why we bailed out Wall \nStreet. Others ask why we used Federal funds to ``prime the pump'' of \nour economy through the Recovery Act. I, for one, believe both were \nnecessary to forestall an economic depression. Over the past few months \nas the stock market has rebounded and we have seen the beginnings of \njob creation, I am more confident than ever that the Congress acted \nwisely.\n  But I want to inform all my colleagues that this bill is neither a \nbailout nor a stimulus. Instead, it is the minimum necessary to support \nour troops in harm's way and to meet emergency domestic and \ninternational requirements. The vice chairman and I agreed that the \nbill recommended by the committee would stay within the amounts \nrequested by the Administration, even though we know more could be \njustified for these purposes.\n  I recognize that many Senators on both sides of the aisle believe we \nsimply should not spend more, but I say to you the Nation still has \nlegitimate needs and a responsibility to act. We cannot stop investing \nin our Nation simply because of high deficits. This is a time for \nfiscal austerity but not for cutting legitimate spending needs. I can \nassure my colleagues this bill is both austere and responsible.\n  The items in this bill are all either fully offset or bona fide \nemergencies. Many items are both emergency and offset to stay within \nthe budget request. As chairman of this committee, I believe there are \nmany more items which could be justified; but, to maintain necessary \nsupport for this bill, Vice Chairman Cochran and I committed to holding \nthe line on spending. The committee met that objective.\n  I want to thank Vice Chairman Cochran and his staff for their \ndedication and cooperation. This bill has been written in a completely \nbipartisan fashion, with input from all the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of our 12 subcommittees. I thank all members of the committee \nfor their enormous contributions to this bill.\n  Let me be clear. FEMA is out of money. More than 40 States have been \ntold that they must wait for funds to cover disaster bills. Communities \nthroughout the Northeast and Southeast are waiting for funds in this \nbill to begin rebuilding after devastating floods. We have an urgent \nrequirement to respond rapidly to the devastating effects of the \noilspill in the gulf. Funding for all of these cannot wait while\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\nsome might seek to delay action on this bill.\n  But most importantly, next week, the Nation will honor those who \nsacrificed their lives in defense of our country. As I have said on \nmany occasions, my colleagues should be mindful that less than 1 \npercent of our population has volunteered to wear our country's \nuniform, to serve the rest of us. They defend our freedom, our way of \nlife. They are called upon ever more frequently to leave their families \nbehind and report to dangerous and inhospitable locations. Willingly, \nthey do so.\n  The Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and \nsacrifice. I can think of no better way to honor those who serve today \nand those who have gone before than by passing this bill expeditiously \nso that it can be forwarded to the House for action.\n  I urge all Members to work with Vice Chairman Cochran and me to \nsupport this bill and secure its quick passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, in \npresenting this supplemental appropriations bill to the Senate. The \ncentral purposes of the bill are to fund the military and diplomatic \nsurge in Afghanistan, to respond to natural disasters in this country \nand in Haiti, and to address the immediate challenges we face from the \noilspill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It has been 5 months since the President announced his strategy to \nachieve stability in Afghanistan. Central to that strategy is the \naddition of some 30,000 troops into the theater, together with a \nsignificant increase in aid and diplomatic resources to the region. \nCongress has the responsibility and the duty to carefully review and \nconsider the President's request for these supplemental appropriations \nand approve the expenditure of the funds that are necessary for a \nsuccessful outcome, one that serves the interests of the United States.\n  We must be mindful, however, that more than half of the additional \ntroops called for in the President's plan have already arrived in \nAfghanistan. Spring and summer offenses are being mounted now and in \nthe coming months will become critical to our chances for success. It \nis also important that we act on the President's request in a timely \nmanner. We should not procrastinate or drag our feet. We should not \nforce the Pentagon to juggle accounts, delay procurements, and \notherwise take actions that will detract from our efforts in the field.\n  The committee has spent several months, as the distinguished chairman \npointed out, carefully examining the supplemental request made by the \nDepartment of Defense and the State Department. Secretary Gates and \nSecretary Clinton have testified before the committee in support of \nthese requests. The committee members and staff have met with other \ngovernment officials and outside groups to refine the committee's \nrecommendations.\n  While this bill includes many of the supplemental requests made by \nthe President, some of his proposals were deemed premature, \nunwarranted, or inappropriate for inclusion in an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The committee also heard from both \nDemocratic and Republican Senators about urgent needs not addressed in \nthe President's supplemental request. The chairman and I, as well as \nthe various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, have worked to \naddress those needs. We have limited the total cost of the bill to the \namount requested by the President, and we have kept the bill focused on \nits central purposes.\n  In some parts of the country, recent natural disasters have left \ncommunities in desperate need of Federal assistance, but with flood \nwaters still receding and damage assessments not yet complete, it has \nbeen difficult to respond to all of the requests we have received. The \nchairman and I will continue to work with Senators representing those \ncommunities to see that the Federal response is appropriate and \naddresses the most critical needs.\n  For those of us who represent the gulf coast region, our States are \ndealing with a different kind of disaster. While it is not a natural \ndisaster, it is a very serious event that will have very serious \nconsequences for the natural environment as well as for local economies \nthroughout the region. We cannot predict now and we cannot now know \nwhat the long-term impacts of this spill will be. While the Federal \nGovernment is intimately involved in the response and cleanup efforts, \nclearly the parties responsible for the spill must bear the ultimate \ncost of cleanup and associated damages. The President submitted an \noilspill supplemental proposal 1 day prior to the committee's \nconsideration of this bill. The proposal contained funding requests \nprompted by the spill but not directly tied to the Deepwater Horizon \nevent. It also included broader policy proposals that would restructure \nthe oilspill liability regime currently in place. The committee has had \nvery little time to review these proposals. We have decided to \nrecommend funding only items that are within the committee's \njurisdiction that will address urgent needs.\n  We do not suggest that the committee has arrived at the perfect \nsolution. There may be other proposals that should be included in this \nlegislation. There may be recommendations included by the committee \nthat should be reconsidered based on additional analysis. I look \nforward to working with our colleagues from the gulf coast and all \nSenators to address this unfortunate event.\n  During consideration of this bill in committee, several members \nidentified additional funding needs or policy matters they intend to \nraise during floor debate. Members not on the committee will surely \nhave amendments as well, and we look forward to working with all \nSenators to improve this bill where we can. But it is clear that adding \nadditional costs to this bill will exacerbate our Nation's fiscal \nimbalance and potentially jeopardize our ability to rapidly get needed \nresources to our men and women in harm's way in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nin other parts of the world. This bill recommends $46 billion in \ndiscretionary appropriations and another $13 billion in mandatory \nfunds. No matter how important the purposes, that is a significant \namount of money. I expect amendments will be offered to offset some or \nall of these costs.\n  The disaster relief fund of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nis currently allocating funds for immediate needs only. The fund owes \nmore than $1.5 billion to States for projects already approved to \nassist communities recovering from disasters. Going into hurricane \nseason, the fund has less than $900 million available to respond to \ndisasters. One way or the other, we must take action to capitalize the \nfund.\n  We also must act with a sense of urgency to provide the resources \nneeded to succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq. We should consider those \nrequirements carefully. But I believe we will poorly serve our men and \nwomen in the field if we allow internal tactical battles to unduly \ndelay delivery of a bill to the President, or if we burden this bill \nwith other costs or legislative matters that are unrelated and \ncontroversial.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii and able members of his \nstaff for their work on this bill and moving it to this point through \nthe committee. I hope our colleagues who have amendments will contact \nus so we can help arrange for consideration of those in a timely \nmanner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n       (Purpose: To establish 3 year discretionary spending caps)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I won't discuss any further the \namendment I am going to call up. It was offered by Senator McCaskill \nand me 2 or 3 weeks ago. We reached as high as 59 votes for it, one \nshort of passage. It is an amendment that would put a statutory limit \non spending, making it more difficult to violate the limits we put by \nrequiring a two-thirds vote to break that limit except in time of war \nand emergency.\n  I ask at this time to call up amendment No. 4173.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator wish to set aside \nthe pending amendment?\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I now ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered 4173.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Acting President pro tempore \nand yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business but to extend the time to up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I would say, since I do not see a \nMember of the majority on the floor, if there is a concern with that \nlater, and somebody wishes to slip me a note, I would be happy to try \nto accommodate my schedule to the majority's schedule.\n\n\n                           New START Concerns\n\n  Mr. President, what I wish to speak to today is the START treaty \nwhich has been submitted by the administration for consideration by the \nSenate.\n  The President signed the treaty on April 8 of this year, submitted it \nto the Senate for ratification on May 13, and 2 weeks ago the Foreign \nRelations Committee began hearings on the treaty.\n  In the consideration of past treaties, the Senate has taken great \ncare to consider the entire record of relevant documents and to seek \nthe views of a wide variety of experts, and I am sure that will be done \nin this case as well.\n  According to a report from Senator Thune, who is the head of the \nRepublican Policy Committee:\n\n       [On] the original START, almost 430 days passed between the \n     time President George H.W. Bush signed it--\n\n  That was July 31, 1991--\n\n     and the U.S. Senate provided its consent to the treaty [on \n     October 1, 1992]. As for the Treaty of Moscow, which is to \n     terminate if New START is ratified, it was signed on May 24, \n     2002 and ratified by the Senate more than nine months later \n     on March 6, 2003.\n\n  That treaty, by the way, is only three pages long. So it is not \nsurprising that it takes some time. What is surprising to me is that \nsome have seemed intent on rushing the treaty that has been sent to us. \nAccording to Congressional Quarterly:\n\n       A congressional aide who briefed reporters on the treaty \n     said Thursday that Senate Foreign Relations [Committee] \n     Chairman John Kerry [of Massachusetts] intended to complete \n     hearings ``in time for the Senate to take up the treaty \n     before the August recess, if it so chooses.''\n\n  I am not aware of any similar precedent for so rushing such a treaty \nof this complexity, and I am not sure why the rush would be necessary. \nI wish to remind my colleagues, the White House assured us there would \nbe no problem when it permitted the treaty to expire by not seeking its \nextension. The reason is expressed in a Joint Statement, which said as \nfollows:\n\n       Recognizing our mutual determination to support strategic \n     stability between the United States of America and the \n     Russian Federation, we express our commitment, as a matter of \n     principle, to continue to work together in the spirit of the \n     START Treaty following its expiration, as well as our firm \n     intention to ensure that a new treaty on strategic arms enter \n     into force at the earliest possible date.\n\n  So what did these 65 words mean? Well, Deputy Secretary of Defense \nLynn told us they meant that:\n\n       In this interim period of START's expiration earlier in the \n     month, our two countries have agreed to continue observing \n     the spirit of the treaty's terms.\n\n  Spokesman Kelly said they mean that ``both sides pledged not to take \nany measures that would undermine the strategic stability that START \nhas provided during this period between the expiration of the START \ntreaty.''\n  So the idea that we are potentially disadvantaged every day the \ntreaty goes unratified seems to me to be untrue, unless the Joint \nStatement does not mean what we were told it means. Certainly, there is \nno reason the Senate should not take the time it needs to perform its \ndue diligence. The Constitution did not, after all, entrust to this \nbody the requirement to perform the process of advise and consent on \ntreaties, and did not set the extraordinarily high threshold of 67 \nvotes to achieve ratification because it intended the Senate to merely \nrubberstamp a treaty.\n  I remind my colleagues of the recommendation of Dr. James \nSchlesinger, who the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said \nin a recent hearing has been called ``the former Secretary of \nEverything.'' Dr. Schlesinger said:\n\n       First, the Senate will wish to scrutinize the Treaty \n     carefully, as it has previous arms control agreements. This \n     reflects the many changes as compared to START I.\n\n  Of course, the treaty is more than just the treaty text, protocols, \nand annexes, which we have only recently received. There are other \nthings we have not yet received. Again, quoting from Senator Thune's \nreport:\n\n       For example, the Secretary of State is required by statute \n     to submit a verifiability assessment of the treaty, and past \n     practice has been for the intelligence community to submit a \n     National Intelligence Estimate concerning the verifiability \n     of such matters. These two documents will be critical to \n     Senate evaluation of the treaty.\n       Another set of documents that will be critical to the \n     Senate's evaluation of New START, particularly the \n     verification issue, is the annual report the President is to \n     complete assessing other nations' compliance with their arms \n     control, nonproliferation, and disarmament commitments. This \n     annual report is due on April 15 of each year, with the last \n     one submitted in August 2005--meaning the White House is now \n     five reports behind.\n\n  So in this case, the verifiability assessment will be prepared by the \nAssistant Secretary for Verification, Rose Gottemoeller, who also \nhappened to be our lead negotiator on the treaty. I am not certain if \nshe will recuse herself from drafting the document, due to the obvious \nconflict of interest, but Senators must surely understand this.\n  On the matter of the NIE, Senators must carefully review the record \nof the proceedings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nwhich will file a report or submit a letter on the treaty. The NIE is \nimportant. It is not simply a statement on the verifiability of the \ntreaty or at least it should not be. To be useful, it will provide an \nanalysis of how the treaty informs our understanding of Russia's \nnuclear forces. It will analyze cheating scenarios and the likelihood \nwe will detect them. This is an important document and one that will \ntake time to put together.\n  Another document promised, but not yet sent to the Senate, is the \nnuclear force posture. Senators will, of course, want to know how the \ntriad will be composed during the 10 years of the treaty before we \nconsider it. It is not sufficient to merely trust that the 700 deployed \nlaunchers called for in the treaty will be sufficient. We need to see \nthe force posture and we need to see the analysis that supports it.\n\n  I joined with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee who \nhave requested access to the treaty negotiating record. I remind my \ncolleagues that 22 U.S.C. section 2578 requires the Secretary of State \nto maintain a negotiating record of treaties to which the United States \nis a party. Obviously, Congress did not enact this requirement merely \nfor the sake of doing it. Congress, obviously, intended to be able to \nhave access to the record.\n  There is a long history on this subject involving great disputes \nbetween the Senate, its committees, and its National Security Working \nGroup--or its predecessor, the Arms Control Observer Group--which, \nincidentally, I cochair along with Senator Byrd, and the Executive on \nthe INF and the START I treaty. I remind my colleagues of a statement \nmade by Sam Nunn, the\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nformer chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, when he was \nserving in this body in 1986:\n\n       Mr. President, in my opinion, the administration's \n     rejection of our request for Senate access threatens a basic \n     institutional interest of the U.S. Senate--its constitutional \n     role in the treaty process.\n\n  I agree with the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee that \nit is important for the Senate to have access to this negotiating \nrecord.\n  Finally, let me say, I come to this very serious process with an open \nmind. I supported the START II treaty and the Moscow Treaty. I opposed \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nNot all arms control agreements are the same. And just because they \nwere negotiated, it does not follow they are in our best interest. So \nwe need to examine the record and this treaty carefully.\n  Today, I want to identify some areas of concern I believe Senators \nwill want to focus on as they begin to consider the treaty. These are \nnot objections. They are matters of concern we will want to \ninvestigate:\n  One, the required nuclear modernization plan; two, limits on U.S. \nnuclear force levels and force structure; three, impact on U.S. missile \ndefenses; four, verification under the new treaty; five, the impact of \nthe treaty on the disparity between United States and Russian nuclear \nforce levels, especially regarding tactical nuclear weapons; six, the \nBilateral Consultative Commission; and, seven, the impact of the treaty \non prompt global strike.\n  Perhaps we should consider an eighth category and a new metric by \nwhich to evaluate the treaty. Secretary Clinton stated on March 18 \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       I am not suggesting that this treaty alone will convince \n     Iran or North Korea to change their behavior, but it does \n     demonstrate our leadership and strengthens our hand as we \n     seek to hold these and other governments accountable.\n\n  I suggest the administration may want to carefully consider whether \nit wants the Senate to evaluate the treaty on that basis. What real \nprogress has been made on nonproliferation since the President signed \nthe treaty? Is the latest Security Council resolution an indication of \nthe value of the New START?\n  While the U.N. Security Council has not adopted a resolution yet with \nrespect to Iran, the announcement by the administration on May 18 \nincluded no reference to any sanctions that would close the noose \naround the IRGC, around Iran's energy sector, especially refined \npetroleum products, and Iran's banking sector, and all the other \nrevenue streams that feed Iran's illegal nuclear weapons program and \nits terrorism apparatus.\n  Most of what is in the draft resolution--for example, references to \nthe Iranian Central Bank--are in the preamble. The administration has \ntold us that preambles are not binding. So which is it? Are preambles \nbinding or is the draft resolution a bunch of words with little effect?\n  Also very troubling is the disclosure that the resolution does not \nprohibit the sale to Iran by Russia of the S-300 antiaircraft missile \nsystem. Not including the S-300 in the draft Security Council \nresolution is unfortunate confirmation that the administration has not \n``reset'' relations with Russia in any meaningful way. In fact, the \nMoscow-based Kommersant Online reported this morning--and I quote--\n``Moreover, according to the terms of the deal, Washington is also \nlifting its objections to the sale to Iran of Russian S-300 \nantiaircraft missile systems.'' I cannot stress how important this \nissue is. Under no circumstances can the administration permit Russia \nto think the United States is not opposed to this transfer. If Russia \nproceeds with this transfer, not only will the Russian entities \ninvolved have to be sanctioned under U.S. law, but United States-Russia \nrelations will be in a grave state of crisis.\n\n  It would appear the reason Russia agreed to the weak U.N. sanctions \nresolution is it will not affect any of its ties with Tehran. At the \nsame time, it has announced it will embark on nuclear cooperation with \nSyria, as it announces, for example, the planned activation of the \nBushehr reactor next August. What is the administration's reaction? We \nhave learned it will roll back proliferation sanctions on Russian \nentities. Could this possibly be a quid pro quo for Russia's support \nfor the draft resolution? I thought the START treaty was supposed to \nensure their support. Nor has the President's ``leading by example,'' \ntouted by Secretary Clinton, affected even NATO member Turkey and \nhemispheric member Brazil. The administration was obviously blindsided \nby Brazil and Turkey, working instead with Iran on an alternative plan.\n  So it is fair to ask: What progress has been made on nonproliferation \nthat the administration can point to that suggests the START treaty is \na meaningful tool in keeping States such as Iran and North Korea from \nviolating their nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations?\n  Let me turn back directly to START and begin the seven items I \nmentioned, beginning with the first: the modernization plan. This is \nthe plan that section 1251 of last year's Defense Authorization Act \nrequired be submitted at the same time the treaty was sent to us for \nits ratification.\n  The key goal of most arms control agreements is to achieve strategic \nstability. The New START treaty was negotiated on the premise of \nnumeric stability, but there are a number of underlying factors \nrequired, a foundation upon which to base that stability. For the \nUnited States, it is the confidence provided by both the current U.S. \nnuclear warheads and delivery systems and by the weapons complex and \nits capacity to sustain and modernize those nuclear warheads. For this \nreason, 41 Senators wrote to President Obama last December, \nhighlighting the direct link between nuclear force reductions under the \ntreaty and modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex.\n  What are some of the factors that affect its strategic stability, \nbeyond the treaty numbers? Well, first, the weapons we deploy must be \nsafe, secure and, most critically, for stability they must be reliable. \nGiven the age of our current weapons, averaging close to 30 years, we \nmust be extremely diligent about monitoring those deployed weapons \nthrough our surveillance programs.\n  We also have warheads that require life extensions such as the W76, \nwhich is underway, and soon, I hope, the B61. Without life extension, \nthese weapons will soon cease to be capable of protecting our country. \nWe must be looking to the future stockpile with new approaches, \nincluding life extension, using a full spectrum of options responsive \nto future needs. To achieve this will require a strong science, \ntechnology, and engineering workforce in our national laboratories and \nmilitary complex that maintains critical skills and is resolute in its \ndetermination to solve the complicated problems at hand.\n  We must make an intense, unified push to restore a viable production \ncapacity for nuclear warheads. Herein lives the greatest chink in our \narmor. As former Secretary Schlesinger recently testified:\n\n       The Russians have a live production base. They turn over \n     their inventory of nuclear weapons every 10 years. We do not.\n\n  Finally, we cannot neglect the delivery systems that carry these \nnuclear weapons. They are also aging and they also are prey to neglect \nand loss of critical capabilities.\n  The section 1251 plan was to address the issues I have just \nhighlighted. We have received this classified report, and we are in the \nprocess of reviewing the statements of the administration to ensure \nthat modernization is, in fact, adequately addressed.\n  The administration has outlined in this report a plan to provide, \nover the next decade, $80 billion for nuclear weapon activities and \nabout $100 billion for delivery system activities. To be clear, most of \nthis money is not new. In fact, the bulk of the money covers current \nspending levels plus inflation for the decade. While this is a needed \nimprovement from the grossly inadequate fiscal year 2010 budget \nsubmission, we do not yet know how much the administration intends to \ncommit to modernization and how it will be spent.\n  It has been well advertised that there is a renewed emphasis by the \nadministration on sustaining our stockpile and modernizing the \ninfrastructure. Congress has long recognized the need for this extra \nattention, for example, calling for the Stockpile Management Program \nand the section 1251 plan requirement in the fiscal year 2010 National\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nDefense Authorization Act. But after reviewing the fiscal year 2011 \nbudget input, I am concerned the administration has not done all it \nshould.\n  The fiscal year 2011 budget weapons activities part of the budget of \n$7 billion is a 10-percent increase over fiscal year 2010, with a 26-\npercent increase in the category of Directed Stockpile Work. This looks \ngood on paper. The question is the substance. The fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2009 plans from NNSA predicted that the fiscal year 2011 budget \nshould be, on average, $7 billion--exactly what the administration \nasked for this year. What we need to know is how much in addition to \nthe $7 billion for NNSA weapon activities over the next 10 years.\n  A cursory review of the numbers recommended in the section 1251 plan \nshows the proposed funding is, in fact, barely keeping up with \ninflation. In fiscal year 2010, Congress provided roughly $6.4 billion \nfor the current nuclear weapons account at NNSA. If the fiscal year \n2010 budget is assumed as a new 10-year baseline, that would be $64 \nbillion of the $80 billion proposal for nuclear weapons activities at \nNNSA, assuming no increase for inflation or increased costs of \nmodernization. If you assume a standard rate of inflation of 3 percent \nto cover cost-of-living adjustments in salaries and increased material \ncosts using the fiscal year 2010 appropriations as the baseline, then \nholding that budget constant would require a total of $75.6 billion \nover the 10-year period. If a 2-year rate of inflation is used, then \nthe increase is about $8 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, we know the fiscal year 2010 budget is not a \nsustainable baseline. The Senate Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee noted in its committee report last year that:\n\n       The committee does not believe this level of funding is \n     adequate to support modernization of the complex including \n     critical investment in infrastructure and scientific \n     capabilities.\n\n  So our stockpile is aging, refurbishments are behind schedule, the \nCold War infrastructure is falling apart, and the critical science and \ntechnology skills that underwrite our nuclear deterrence are atrophied. \nBut rather than seeing a new commitment to this problem, the budget \nrequest and the 1251 plan seem to be based on a plan--the fiscal year \n2010 budget--that wasn't making much progress as it was.\n  It appears to me this plan was based not so much on what is needed \nbut what funding the administration was willing to make available. In \nthis case, it seems to be what funding Secretary Gates could sacrifice \nfrom his budget because that is how the additional money for this year \ncame about. Why was the administration only willing to find funding \nauthority in the DOD budget, the one department of the Federal \nGovernment engaged in fighting two wars? Secretary Gates had to \ntransfer money from his budget over to the Energy Department budget.\n  As important as the amount of money available is the freedom to \npursue all options available to ensure the safety, security, and \nreliability of our highly complex nuclear stockpile. The Nuclear \nPosture Review restricts options for modernizing existing warheads by \nstating:\n\n       In any decision to proceed to engineering development for \n     warhead LEPs--\n\n  That is, life extension projects--\n\n     the United States will give strong preference to options for \n     refurbishment or reuse. Replacement of nuclear components \n     would be undertaken only if critical Stockpile Management \n     Program goals could not otherwise be met and if specifically \n     authorized by the President and approved by Congress.\n\n  The 1251 plan tries to deal with this overly restrictive limitation \nby stating:\n\n       The Laboratory Directors will ensure that the full range of \n     life extension program approaches, including refurbishment, \n     reuse, and replacement of nuclear components are studied.\n\n  But it still reiterates that there is a ``policy preference for \nrefurbishment and reuse in decisions to proceed from study to \nengineering development.''\n  Why would our nuclear scientists spend time and limited resources and \nrisk their careers studying the full range of options if, when they \nmake their recommendations, the President requires that they prove the \nimpossible; namely, that replacement must be the only choice? Why isn't \nthe standard instead what is the best course of action?\n  The Perry-Schlesinger Commission noted the importance of flexibility \nwhen it reported to Congress last May. It stated there are:\n\n     . . . options along a spectrum . . . in between are various \n     options to utilize existing components and design solutions \n     while mixing in new components and solutions as needed. \n     Different warheads may lend themselves to different solutions \n     along this spectrum. The decision on which approach is best \n     should be made on a case-by-case basis as the existing \n     stockpile of warheads ages.\n\n  The bipartisan commission of six Republicans and six Democrats \ndetermined that:\n\n       So long as modernization proceeds within the framework of \n     existing U.S. policy, it should encounter minimum political \n     difficulty.\n\n  Well, the NPR changes that policy, and the section 1251 plan \nreiterates the NPR language after initially suggesting scientists will \nbe given complete latitude. I believe this will have a chilling effect \non the scientists' work and that this issue must be resolved.\n  Similarly, we have questions concerning the administration's \ncommitment to maintaining and modernizing nuclear delivery systems. \nWhile the administration suggests in the Nuclear Posture Review and the \n1251 plan that it will maintain a nuclear triad, there is no funding in \nthat plan for follow-on strategic systems, other than a replacement for \nour aging nuclear ballistic missile submarines. In fact, the 1251 plan \nnotes that the administration will not even make a decision regarding a \nnext generation bomber and a follow-on ICBM until 2013 and 2015, \nrespectively. Likewise, rather than commit to a new nuclear cruise \nmissile, the administration instead announces that a study is being \ndone to determine if it will be replaced. Finally, the 1251 plan is \nsilent on funding needed to develop and deploy conventional prompt \nglobal strike capabilities which, according to the Nuclear Posture \nReview, are to play a larger role in our strategic posture.\n  The notional nuclear force structure under New START suggested in the \n1251 plan lacks sufficient detail. It calls for up to 420 ICBMs, up to \n60 strategic bombers, and no more than 240 SLBMs. It would be helpful \nto know exactly how U.S. forces will be configured, how we might expect \nRussia to configure its nuclear forces, both strategical and tactical, \nand then have a net assessment to determine whether the United States \nis still capable of carrying out its deterrence missions, especially \nproviding nuclear security guarantees to allies and partners.\n  With regard to New START limitations and force structure, the New \nSTART treaty limits the number of deployed strategic delivery systems \nto 700. Since the United States today deploys approximately 800 \ndelivery systems, this will require a reduction of some 180 ICBMs, \nSLBMs, and/or strategic bombers to reach the treaty limitations--more \nif we deploy conventional global strike missiles, since, by the terms \nof the treaty, these must be counted as nuclear as well.\n  The Russians, on the other hand, are already below the 700 figure. So \nthis is the first time that at least I am aware the United States will \nagree to launcher limitations that will require the United States to \nreduce its forces but require no reductions by Russia. It is fair to \nask what the United States got for this concession.\n  Moreover, because a bomber counts as only one delivery system and one \nwarhead no matter how many bombs or cruise missiles are loaded on it, \nthe Russians are able legally to field more than 1,150 warheads limited \nby the treaty. While this may appear to advantage both sides, I do not \nfear U.S. cheating--we would not--but the Russians could, and because \nof weak verification tools in the treaty, I am not sure we will know. \nThis is another reason to await the NIE before making a decision on the \ntreaty.\n  Let me quote from the Heritage Foundation analysis on this point. It \nsays:\n\n       In fact, despite Obama administration claims to the \n     contrary, New START's counting rules and apparent lapses will \n     permit increases in Russian strategic force levels above the \n     1,700 to 2,200 deployed warhead limit of the Moscow Treaty.\n\n  I am not going to quote the remainder of this analysis, but I would \nask unanimous consent that the statement, as I submit it for the \nRecord, contain the remainder of this analysis.\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       According to a Heritage Foundation analysis:\n\n       In fact, despite Obama Administration claims to the \n     contrary, New START's counting rules and apparent lapses will \n     permit increases in Russian strategic force levels above the \n     1,700-2,200 deployed warhead limit of the Moscow Treaty. RIA \n     Novosti, an official news agency of the Russian Federation, \n     already has reported that given New START's counting rules, \n     Russia will be able to retain 2,100 strategic nuclear \n     warheads under New START, not 1,550. Russia will be able to \n     deploy even higher numbers under New START if it follows \n     through on-announced modernization programs, particularly the \n     new heavy bomber. In addition Russia could deploy strategic \n     nuclear systems that were limited or prohibited under START \n     I, but appear not to be limited whatsoever under New START.\n       If Russia exploits the legal lapses in New START, there is \n     no actual limit in the new Treaty on the number of strategic \n     nuclear warheads that can be deployed. The number of Russia's \n     strategic nuclear warheads would be limited only by the \n     financial resources it is able to devote to strategic forces, \n     not by New START warhead ceilings--which would be the case \n     without this new Treaty.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The bottom line is, there were concessions by the United \nStates. The Russian conventions are essentially strictly based on their \nfinancial situation, not by any New START warhead ceilings. So what I \nthink we should ask is why did we agree to it and what did we get in \nreturn.\n  Additionally, what will the U.S. nuclear force structure look like \nafter eliminating these 180 U.S. strategic delivery systems? I have \nalready talked about it, but I wish to explain why this is an important \nrequirement for Senators to consider before we vote on the treaty.\n  The administration has provided some initial information as a basis \nfor future planning. It could retain up to 420 ICBMs, up to 60 \nstrategic bombers, and deploy no more than 240 SLBMs at any time. We \nwill require further details about where these reductions will be made \nand how this force structure fares against our most likely prediction \nabout how the Russians will design their nuclear forces.\n  An issue of concern is that while the United States intends to deploy \nonly single-warhead ICBMs under the administration's new NPR, the \ntreaty appears to be driving the Russians to deploy multiple-warhead \nmissiles for their ICBM force. Land-based multiple-warhead missiles \nhave long been considered destabilizing because they place a premium on \nstriking first for fear of losing a large proportion of one's warheads \nby a preemptive strike by the other side. For this reason, MIRVs were \nto be banned by the START II treaty that never entered into force. Now, \n80 percent of Russia's ICBM force will be road mobile and MIRVed. In \nlight of this, it is curious to hear the administration now argue that \nNew Start will increase strategic stability.\n  Assuming the U.S. nuclear force structure is survivable, the next \nquestion is whether it is sufficient for deterrence purposes--\nespecially the more difficult mission of extending nuclear guarantees \nto allies and partners.\n  As I said, the New Start treaty limits deployed strategic delivery \nsystems to 700. A September 2008 white paper by the Defense and Energy \nDepartments suggests a force of approximately 900 delivery systems is \nnecessary for deterrence purposes, and in congressional testimony last \nsummer, Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright expressed concerns with \nforce levels below 800. How, then, can 700 be the correct number? \nAgain, Senators must see the analysis themselves to make a decision on \nthis. I don't see how a mere assurance in an unclassified committee \nhearing can be sufficient on a matter like this.\n  As to missile defense, despite being told consistently from the very \nbeginning of negotiations that missile defense will be addressed only \nin the preamble of the treaty, we now discover that article V contains \na direct restriction on U.S. missile defense activities--i.e. neither \nparty can convert ICBM or SLBM launchers into launchers for missile \ndefense interceptors. In fact, just prior to the treaty's public \nrelease, Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher said the following: \n``But there is no limit or constraint on what the United States can do \nwith its missile defense systems.'' Now, this begs two questions: 1, \ndid Ms. Tauscher not know what was in the treaty her subordinates were \nnegotiating; or 2, did whoever wrote Ms. Tauscher's talking points \nthink Senators wouldn't notice an entire article of the treaty text?\n  Some administration officials have tried to explain this away by \nsaying that, since this administration has no current plans to do so, \nit's not a constraint. That stands the English language on its head. \nThis concession to the Russian Federation will establish a dangerous \nprecedent with respect to including missile defense limitations in \nfuture offensive arms control agreements. Why did the U.S. side feel it \nnecessary to concede this point? What did we get in return? Again, this \nis why it is important to see the full negotiating record.\n  When viewed together, the treaty's preamble, the Russian unilateral \nstatement on missile defense, and remarks by senior Russian officials \nprovide the potential for Russia to essentially blackmail the U.S. \nagainst increasing its missile defense capabilities by threatening to \nwithdraw from the treaty.\n  The preamble states that ``current strategic defensive arms do not \nundermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic offensive \narms of the parties.'' Does this suggest that moving beyond ``current'' \nsystems could provide grounds for withdrawal?\n  The Russians note in their unilateral statement that the treaty ``can \noperate and be viable only if the United States of America refrains \nfrom developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or \nqualitatively,'' and also link American missile defense capabilities to \nthe treaty's withdrawal clause. Shouldn't we read this as an attempt to \nexert political pressure to forestall continued development and \ndeployment of U.S. missile defenses? The preamble doesn't have to be \nlegally binding to be influential.\n  Even more disturbing is the administration's decision to limit U.S. \nmissile defenses to be effective only against a ``limited attack,'' \nthus exempting Russian capabilities from the reach of our missile \ndefenses. Since the U.S. unilateral statement makes quite clear that \nthe administration intends to deploy only ``limited'' missile defenses \nto deal with ``limited attack,'' the administration has left itself no \nroom to respond to strategic surprise or a disintegration of the \ncurrent strategic relationship with key nuclear powers, let alone an \naccidental launch. Let me quote from the text of the U.S. unilateral \nstatement:\n\n       The United States missile defense systems would be employed \n     to defend the United States against limited missile launches, \n     and to defend its deployed forces, allies and partners \n     against regional threats. The United States intends to \n     continue improving and deploying its missile defense systems \n     in order to defend itself against limited attack and as part \n     of our collaborative approach to strengthening stability in \n     key regions.\n\n  Here is something else that's troubling. General Jones, in a May 12, \n2010, letter to me wrote, ``Russian unilateral statement is both beyond \nthe control of the Administration and not binding or limiting in any \nway on current or planned U.S. missile defense programs.'' I will \nrepeat that because it is important: ``not binding or limiting in any \nway on current or planned U.S. missile defense programs.''\n  What about a program that is not current or planned? Our unilateral \nstatement must lead one to ask whether the Russian statement was \nanswered by the U.S. statement, in effect saying, ``you don't worry \nabout our missile defense because we won't make it effective against \nyou.'' What if a future administration decides to return to the concept \nof actually protecting America from any nuclear attack even from \nRussia?\n  The Russians will have the right to rely on these statements for at \nleast the ten years of the treaty's operation. These statements may \nbecome the new baseline in future arms control negotiations between the \nUnited States and the Russian Federation. Ronald Reagan enunciated the \nvision of U.S. missile defense, which I believe is as true today as it \nwas in 1983:\n\n       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that \n     their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. \n     retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept \n     and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached \n     our own soil or that of our allies? But isn't it worth every \n     investment necessary to free the world from the threat of \n     nuclear war? We know it is.''\n\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n\n  I am concerned that when Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov warned, on \nMarch 28, that ``the treaty and all the obligations it contains are \nvalid only within the context of the levels which are now present in \nthe sphere of strategic defensive systems,'' it means the Russians will \nthreaten to pull out of START if we deploy additional ground-based \ninterceptors in Alaska or if we deploy the SM-3 block IIB missile in \nEurope, as the administration promised.\n  There is something fundamentally disturbing about entering into a \ntreaty with the Russians when we have such a divergence in view over a \nsubstantial issue like missile defense. At the very least this likely \nsets the stage for misunderstanding and confrontation as the United \nStates continues its missile defense activities, particularly in \nEurope. Remember, the goal of the treaty was supposed to be stability \nfrom a common understanding and agreement on core principles.\n  Those who have rushed to embrace the treaty must confront this \nreality and the administration must be required to square the circle.\n  On verification, Secretary Gates testified that this treaty provides \n``a strong verification regime . . . which provides a firm basis for \nmonitoring Russia's compliance with its treaty obligations.'' I \ncertainly have a great deal respect for Secretary Gates, but I'm not \nsure how he can know that yet. Has he seen the NIE on the treaty? Or \nthe State Department verifiability assessment? And, even if treaty \nnoncompliance can be verified, what have we lost in intelligence as a \nresult of the weakening of the verification compared to the START \ntreaty?\n  Independent assessments of the treaty suggest important new gaps in \nmonitoring. For example, the treaty no longer requires on-the-ground, \ncontinuous monitoring of Russia's missile manufacturing facility and \npermits Russia to withhold telemetry of many of its missile tests, \nundermining our ability to know how many missiles are being produced \nand, perhaps, limiting our ability to understand what new capabilities \nare being developed. The administration has blamed the Bush \nadministration for this, and I have asked for the evidence in letters \nto the Secretary of State, including a December 4, 2009, letter. So far \nthe administration has been unwilling to substantiate this allegation--\nwhich it could do by responding to my letters and inquiries on the \nmatter.\n  The ability to monitor compliance with the terms of the treaty is \nimportant, but as important is whether our intelligence community can \nmonitor the status of Russian strategic nuclear forces. What new \ncapabilities is Russia developing? Is Russia building and stockpiling \nadditional missiles and warheads that could provide it a break-out \ncapability? Will we be able to maintain confidence in our assessment of \nRussian forces throughout the 10-year period of the treaty? According \nto Secretary Gates, ``And I think what you are likely to hear from them \n[the Intelligence Community] is that they have high confidence in their \nability to monitor this treaty until toward the end of the 10-year \nterm, when their confidence level will go to moderate.''\n  What is the impact of a judgment like that when we know Russia is \nincreasing its reliance on its nuclear forces, conducting war games \ninvolving simulating raids against NATO allies like Poland, and \nmodernizing almost every element of its strategic and tactical nuclear \nforces? For example, Russia is, in fact, deploying a new multipurpose \nattack submarine that can launch long range cruise missiles with \nnuclear warheads against land targets at a range of 5,000 kilometers--\njust barely missing the threshold to be considered a strategic weapon \nunder the New START treaty. Of course, a tactical nuclear weapon has a \nstrategic effect if it is detonated above a U.S. or allied city.\n  We will need the intelligence community to consider these important \nfactors before we can fully evaluate the treaty; I look forward to a \nthorough NIE that rigorously analyzes our ability to monitor Russian \nnuclear forces. And, I am sure the Intelligence Committee will hold \nnumerous hearings to flesh out these issues.\n  As to the impact the treaty has on U.S. and Russian nuclear force \nlevels, especially regarding tactical nuclear weapons, the \nadministration argues that New Start will ``increase'' or ``provide'' \nstrategic stability, but has yet to explain why the 10-1 disparity in \ntactical nuclear weapons doesn't upset that strategic stability, \nespecially at lower levels of strategic nuclear forces. As former \nSecretary of Defense James Schlesinger recently testified, ``the \nsignificance of tactical nuclear weapons rises steadily as strategic \nnuclear arms are reduced.''\n  The Strategic Posture Commission estimates Russia may have \napproximately 3,800 operational tactical nuclear warheads, and that the \ncombination of new warhead designs and precision delivery systems \n``opens up new possibilities for Russian efforts to threaten to use \nnuclear weapons to influence regional conflicts.''\n  Likewise, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Michele Flournoy, \nhas observed that the Russians are ``actually increasing their reliance \non nuclear weapons and the role of nuclear weapons in their strategy.'' \nThere is a fine line--actually, no line at all except as to how they \nare delivered--between strategic and tactical weapons.\n  If the Russians intend to use nuclear weapons to influence regional \nconflicts, then shouldn't we try to understand the impact of their \nnumbers in the context of declining U.S. strategic nuclear weapons \nrequired by the treaty? In other words, what will be the effect of \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons on strategic stability and our ability \nto extend deterrence into various regions? We should understand this \nbefore agreeing with the administration's contention that this treaty \nincreases stability.\n  The administration's retort is that they understand the importance of \ndealing with the disparity in tactical nuclear weapons, but that we \nmust first ratify New Start before getting to Russian tactical nuclear \nweapons in the next treaty. But what leverage will we have left? And \nwhy should we think a ``next treaty'' that further reduces our weapons \nwill be in our rational interest?\n  And if tactical weapons are as important as most seem to believe, why \ndidn't we make them a priority in this treaty? Because the Russians \ndidn't want to talk about them? Why was that enough to demur? How hard \ndid we push? Again, this is why Senators need to see the negotiating \nrecord, and why they shouldn't make up their minds on the treaty until \nthey do.\n  BCC--Bilateral Consultative Commission\n  One of the matters the administration will have to address before the \nSenate could consider ratification is the role of the Bilateral \nConsultative Commission in the treaty. As Ambassadors Edelman and \nJoseph observe in their May 10th National Review Online article:\n\n       A preliminary reading of the Treaty Protocol suggests that \n     the U.S. and Russian commissioners could reach secret \n     agreement on changes to ensure the `viability and \n     effectiveness' of the treaty. These changes could create \n     additional limits on missile defense that would appear to be \n     beyond the reach of the Senate's responsibility to advise and \n     consent.\n\n  Obviously, that is not acceptable. This matter will have to be \nthoroughly vetted during the hearings and presumably be dealt with in \nthe resolution of ratification. While there may have been similar \nprovisions in past treaties, the Senate should insist on a reasonable \ncheck on such an open-ended provision in the resolution of \nratification.\n  Now to the conventional prompt global strike or PGS. Although \ntactical nuclear weapons were not addressed in this treaty, the United \nStates conceded to Russian demands to place limits on our conventional \nprompt global strike capabilities by counting conventionally armed \nstrategic ballistic missiles under the limits for delivery systems. At \nthe very least, this will require a one-for-one reduction in U.S.-\ndeployed nuclear weapons for each conventional ICBM it intends to \ndeploy. This is yet another reason Senators need to see the force \nposture before they can make up their minds on the treaty.\n  The treaty also sets the stage for further limitations on U.S. \nconventional strike capabilities in the preamble by noting that the \nparties are ``mindful of the impact of conventionally armed ICBMs and \nSLBMs on strategic stability.'' Does any Senator imagine the Russians \nwill not raise objections when\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nthe United States begins the serious development of prompt global \nstrike capabilities, as called for by the Nuclear Posture Review?\n  Moreover, the administration must be candid when it testifies about \nissues such as PGS missile defense. It cannot continue to state that \nthe treaty does not limit PGS or missile defenses when it clearly does.\n  In conclusion, Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have predicated \ntheir support for the treaty on their answer to the question: Are we \nbetter off with an agreement or without it? They suggest that without \nthe agreement, we would lack the ability to limit and monitor Russian \nstrategic forces.\n  My response is twofold:\n  First, the existing 2002 Moscow Treaty already limits Russian \nwarheads. True, the Moscow Treaty relied on the now-expired START \ntreaty's verification procedures, but these could have been extended by \nmutual consent. The Russians refused or the administration did not \nbother to ask. We will not know until the administration shares the \nnegotiating record with us.\n  Second, I believe the better question is, Are we better off with this \ntreaty or a treaty that did not include any references to missile \ndefense or prompt global strike and which did contain limitations on \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons? These are issues for Senators to \nconsider when they debate the resolution of ratification and amendments \nto it, whether they be reservations or conditions or otherwise.\n  In her opening statement at the May 18 Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing on New START, Secretary Clinton asserted that ``the choice \nbefore us is between this treaty and no treaty governing our nuclear \nsecurity relationship with Russia.'' This assertion is obviously a \nfalse choice. It reflects sort of an ``our way or the highway'' \napproach, completely inconsistent with the responsibilities of the \nSenate. Since the administration did not consult the Senate for its \nadvice before making its negotiating concessions, it should not now \nargue that the Senate has only the choice of voting for the treaty that \nwe cannot amend and therefore must vote yes and that it would be \nimpossible to negotiate another agreement. After all, isn't that what \nboth sides did in walking away from the START II agreement? The Senate \nis not a rubberstamp.\n  We have the opportunity and responsibility to fully understand this \ntreaty and understand whether it furthers the security of the American \npeople. And we must consider it in the context of other considerations \nsuch as the nuclear modernization that goes hand-in-hand with \nconsideration of the treaty. The administration will have to find a \nway, for example, to ensure the necessary funding for modernization \nbefore the Senate votes on the treaty.\n  Sergei Karagonov, chairman of the Russian Council on Defense and \nForeign Policy, summarized the Russian view of the treaty saying:\n\n       In the course of the negotiations, Russia reached almost \n     all of the objectives it could possibly set.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good metric by which to evaluate the outcome \nof the treaty. Are we able to say the same thing for the United States? \nThat is a question which will need to be answered affirmatively for the \nSenate to ratify the treaty.\n  We have just begun the process of evaluation and potentially \nratification. I urge all of my colleagues to refrain from judgments \nbefore our process is complete. I do not doubt there are arguments in \nsupport of the treaty. The recitation of my concerns today should be \ntaken as just that--concerns--hopefully to make the point that there \nare reasons for us to be careful and thoughtful and not jump to \nconclusions. I look forward to an exercise worthy of the Senate in the \nconsideration of this important submission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Officer Thomas Wortham IV\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I come before this august body with a very \nheavy heart this afternoon. Last Friday night, just a few blocks from \nmy home in Chicago, a terrible act of violence claimed the life of a \nyoung police officer. Thomas Wortham IV was a distinguished Chicago \npolice officer. He was off duty on Wednesday night, so he went to visit \nhis parents in a nice neighborhood called Chatham--in which I live only \n2\\1/2\\ blocks away--to show them his new motorcycle.\n  Officer Wortham was used to putting his life on the line. In addition \nto being one of Chicago's finest, he recently served two tours in Iraq. \nHe devoted himself to his community and to his country. He exhibited \nthe same courage, valor, and selfless dedication wherever he went.\n  Thomas Wortham was a true American hero. He was the kind of person \nwho keeps us safe and makes it possible for the rest of us to go about \nour lives free from fear; the kind of person who serves as an example \nto those around him and inspires others to give back.\n  But last Wednesday night, as he sat on his brandnew motorcycle \noutside of his parents' home, this remarkable young man was violently \ntaken from us. After two tours in Iraq and endless hours patrolling the \nmean streets, Officer Wortham was struck down practically in his own \nbackyard. Several young men tried to rob him, and he was shot in the \nstruggle. His father, who is also a military veteran and retired police \nsergeant, heroically rushed to his defense and returned fire on those \nwho attacked his son. But it was too late. Gun violence had already \nclaimed Officer Wortham's life.\n  For all his heroism, for all the good he did for his community and \nhis country, in the end Thomas Wortham IV was tragically killed where \nhe should have been perfectly safe. There is no justice in this; there \nis no silver lining. This is just major outrage. It was a despicable, \nsenseless act committed by dangerous people, all of whom must suffer \nthe full consequences of the law.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning Thomas Wortham IV, \nwho was taken from us far before his time. Let us remember his selfless \ndevotion to his community and to his country. Let us celebrate his \nheroism and honor his memory by living out his values in our daily \nlives.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to his family, whose pain far exceeds \neven the deep sense of loss felt by others in the Chicago community. \nThis Nation stands with them today, just as their son stood with us in \nthe sands of Iraq and the streets of Chicago.\n  As we lay this fallen hero to rest, let us do more than remember. Let \nus take action. This tragic murder reminds us of the gun violence \npandemic that holds cities and towns across America in a vice grip. It \ncan strike anywhere at any time, and it is tearing apart families, \ncommunities, and our own sense of security.\n  It is time to reclaim our future. It is time to stop the shooting and \nstart to invest in education, violence prevention, and afterschool \nprograms so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and keep \nkids from turning down the wrong path in the first place. This means \ncreating jobs and cracking down on those who should not be able to buy \nguns. It means challenging our young people to aspire to a better life \nand giving them the tools to make the right choices so they do not end \nup on the road to violence.\n  This is not a political issue or a matter of dollars and cents. This \nis about the place where we live, work, and go to church, the places \nwhere our children play and go to school. Officer Wortham lived and \ndied for these folks, for his friends and his neighbors and his \ncountrymen. Even in a moment of tragedy, as we grieve this devastating \nloss, I believe we must summon the courage to walk in this young man's \nfootsteps, to take up his cause as our own and lift up his noble \nexample.\n  As I advised the parents when I met with them, let us take back our \nstreets, our schools, our churches, and our children's future. Where \nThomas Wortham IV fell, let us all rise in his place to confront this \nchallenge and end the scourge of gun violence once and for all. Let us \ndo that.\n  His family is also in mourning because retired Sergeant Wortham \nkilled one of the offenders and shot the second one, who is now in \ncritical condition in the hospital. Thank goodness for the Chicago \nPolice Department and good detective work because the other two \noffenders are now in custody.\n  What we must do is stand and be counted when it comes to guns and\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nyoung people with guns in their hands and no jobs and no future and no \nhope. That is what we experience. In this legislation that is before \nthis body, there is money that has to be provided for summer jobs for \nour youth.\n  Patrolman Wortham would not be the last person to expire through gun \nviolence on our streets. I ask my colleagues to look at what we are \ndoing and what we have to do and make sure we do our part to provide \nthe resources and opportunity for our youth in these urban areas to \nhave some hope, some direction, something on which to rely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Department of State and Foreign \nOperations chapter of this supplemental totals $6.17 billion, which is \nthe same as the President's request. The bulk of these funds are for \nemergency operations and programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and \nHaiti.\n  Senator Gregg and I supported most of the President's requests, but \nwe could not support them all and there were other items, like pandemic \nflu and assistance for disaster victims and refugees in other parts of \nthe world, which we could not ignore.\n  We also provide additional assistance for Mexico, where drug-related \nviolence spilling into the United States is a growing concern of many \nSenators, and for Jordan, a key ally in the Middle East.\n  We include language requiring a determination by the Secretary of \nState that the governments of Afghanistan and Haiti are taking \nnecessary steps concerning transparency and corruption. We require \nconsultation with local communities and a central role for women in \ndecisions about assistance programs.\n  The funds in the State and Foreign Operations chapter of this bill \nare for programs that are strongly supported by both the Department of \nState and the Department of Defense, in countries where the United \nStates has important national security interests.\n  I very much appreciate the way Senator Gregg and his staff worked \nwith me and my staff on our chapter of this bill. At a time when it is \npopular to complain that Washington is ``broken,'' the Appropriations \nCommittee continues to do important and necessary work in its \ntraditional, bipartisan manner and I think this bill is an example of \nthat.\n  I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran for the \nsupport they have given us during this process. I would also ask that \nif Members have amendments to the State and Foreign Operations chapter \nthat they inform Senator Gregg and me as soon as possible.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a couple of \nminutes--I know the time at 4:45 is otherwise obligated; I will be \nbriefer than that--about President Calderon's visit to the United \nStates, his joint session speech to Congress, and a border security \namendment I intend to offer, hopefully, as soon as tomorrow.\n  As you know, Mr. President, President Calderon addressed a joint \nsession of Congress, and I was fortunate enough to have a very brief \nconversation with him in the anteroom before he came to the floor of \nthe House, during which time I told him I admire his commitment to \nfight the drug cartels in Mexico.\n  During his remarks before the Congress and to the American people, \nPresident Calderon said some things I thought were very important for \nall of us to hear.\n  First of all, he said Mexico has gone ``all-in'' against the \ncartels--with increased commitments and personnel and equipment--and, \nunfortunately, is suffering significant losses and casualties in the \nfight. There have indeed been 23,000 Mexicans, approximately, since \n2006, who have lost their lives in Mexico during these drug wars.\n  President Calderon also reminded us that Mexico is one of our most \nimportant trading partners, primarily as a result of NAFTA--the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. He pointed out that Mexico has, \nnotwithstanding its other challenges, managed to keep its budget \ndeficit low relative to its GDP--a record of fiscal discipline that \nshould give us some embarrassment in Washington.\n  President Calderon acknowledged--and I think this is very important--\nthat the lack of economic opportunities available in Mexico are a \nprimary cause of illegal immigration into the United States.\n  While I admire some of the things President Calderon said, I do think \nhe crossed a line he should not have crossed when he used this \nsetting--a speech to a joint session of Congress and to the American \npeople--to lecture Americans on our own State and Federal laws. For \nexample, he criticized America's gun laws and seemed to suggest that we \nshould somehow consider relinquishing our second amendment rights in \norder to help them disarm the cartels.\n  With all due respect to President Calderon, America's second \namendment rights are not a proper subject of international negotiation \nwith Mexico or any other nation.\n  Then President Calderon went on to criticize Arizona's immigration \nlaw last week on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--at the White House \nand at the Capitol--which I also believe was inappropriate under the \ncircumstances.\n  There is no doubt there is fear and frustration all along the \nborder--fear that the border violence that is raging just to the south \nis going to spill over into the United States, and frustration that \nWashington, DC--especially Congress and the President--is not doing \nenough about it. Arizona's law was written in response to this fear and \nfrustration.\n  It is important to note--and this is a key fact that needs to be \ncorrected on the record--that the Arizona Legislature amended their law \nto make clear that ethnic and racial profiling by law enforcement \nofficials is strictly prohibited. That was a necessary and important \nchange. But it doesn't appear President Calderon or many of the \ncritics--including the President of the United States, the Attorney \nGeneral, or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security--have \nactually even read the 10-page bill, which you can read online if you \nhave access to the Internet. I have found it always helps in any \ndiscussion to actually know what you are talking about, to have \nactually read the bill so that you can have an intelligent conversation \nand perhaps then differ about policies.\n  But to misrepresent the contents of the bill, not having read it, is \nsimply inexcusable.\n  To be sure, a patchwork of State laws is not the optimal way to fix \nour broken immigration system. We need sensible reforms at the national \nlevel. I am prepared to work in good faith with anyone committed to \nimmigration laws that make sense in terms of our national security, in \nterms of the restoration of the rule of law, in terms of our economy \nand our values.\n  But some of the criticism of Arizona's law by the administration has \nbeen just simply misleading and counterproductive. Just last week we \nlearned that a State Department representative--Michael Posner--\nactually apologized to China for the Arizona law, saying: ``We brought \nit up early and often.'' Early and often in talks with one of the most \nrepressive regimes in the world? Unbelievable.\n  President Obama himself has set a bad example, repeatedly criticizing \nArizonans for taking action while his own promises for immigration \nreform have gone unfulfilled.\n  The problem raging on our southern border is that the Federal \nGovernment needs to do more to improve our border security. That is \nsomething on which we can all agree and should all agree.\n  How bad is the situation? Well, this morning the El Paso Times \nreported:\n\n       Mexican Federal police were attacked by a drive-by shooting \n     during the weekend as Juarez surpassed 1,000 homicides for \n     the year.\n\n  Ciudad Juarez--within several hundred feet of the city of El Paso in \nthe United States--has lost 1,000 people to the drug wars just this \nyear.\n  As I mentioned, it is estimated that 23,000 Mexicans have lost their \nlives in the drug wars during the last 3 years.\n  The fear is palpable on this side of the border. I must tell you, I \nhave\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nnever seen it quite this way. From Laredo, TX, to McAllen, TX, to El \nPaso--where people are accustomed to the novelty and the unique nature \nof our international border with Mexico, and they believe in \nmaintaining those ties for economic and other reasons--people along the \nborder in Texas, the longest section of the U.S.-Mexican border, are \nmore apprehensive and concerned about what lurks just beyond the \nborder. That fear ranges from cartels actively recruiting students in \nour public schools to gangs in order to help them with their drug-\nsmuggling operations.\n  The Border Patrol has developed ``Operation Detour'' to show our \nstudents how the cartels treat the young people they recruit. The \nresponse to this video presentation has reportedly been powerful.\n  For example, in McAllen, TX, in the Rio Grande Valley, a 14-year-old \ngirl made an emotional exit halfway during the presentation. She told \nthe Border Patrol her father had recently been the victim of a cross-\nborder abduction and her family was afraid to report the kidnapping to \nauthorities for fear of retaliation from the cartel that took him.\n  In Rio Grande City, TX, another city in the Rio Grande Valley, kids \nwere crying midway through the first video because the night before a \nclassmate had died while running drugs.\n  Mr. President, our children are living in fear, but the White House's \nbudget for border security shows it is living in denial. The \nPresident's budget request for fiscal year 2011 cuts the Secure Border \nInitiative by more than 25 percent, and we know the Department of \nHomeland Security is considering the elimination of the SBInet Program \nwith no alternative or replacement in place.\n  The SBInet Program is a Secure Border Initiative. This is supposed to \nbe the virtual fence that, along with boots on the ground and tactical \ninfrastructure, are designed to help us contain and control movement of \npeople across the border. Yet it has been cut by some 25 percent.\n  The President's budget also cuts the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Program--or the HIDA Program--by over 12 percent.\n  The White House even wanted to make cuts--albeit modest--to the \nBorder Patrol by about 181 agents, before those of us in Congress made \nclear this was simply unacceptable. Rather than cutting, we need to be \ngrowing the size of the Border Patrol and the boots on the ground.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I intend to offer at the first \nopportunity--hopefully, tomorrow morning--says border security is a \npriority, not an afterthought. This amendment will fix six priorities \nto improve border security.\n\n  First, it will fund additional equipment that can help protect our \nborder, including helicopters and Predator drones. We have been \nfighting with the Federal Aviation Administration to try to get them to \nquit dragging their feet in authorizing the use of unmanned aerial \nvehicles to patrol our southern border, to help the Border Patrol and \nother law enforcement officials do their job. We are just beginning to \nsee some headway, but they are incredibly undersourced with the lack of \nhelicopters and the lack of additional Predator drones.\n  Second, my amendment will fund additional personnel in several law \nenforcement agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration; \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Immigrations \nand Customs Enforcement; Custom and Border Protection; and the \nCounterdrug units of the National Guard.\n  The third thing my amendment will do will be to fund improvements for \ntask forces and fusion centers that enhance interagency cooperation.\n  Fourth, it will fund additional personnel and facilities to improve \ndetention and removal activities under Federal law.\n  And, fifth, it will create a $300 million grant program to assist \nState and local law enforcement officials who operate within 100 miles \nof the U.S.-Mexican border. Because the Federal Government simply \nhasn't done enough in terms of border security, local and State law \nenforcement have had to step up, and they need the additional help that \nthis grant program will provide to those local and State law \nenforcement agencies operating within 100 miles of the border.\n  Finally, my amendment will provide $100 million to fund \ninfrastructure improvement at our ports of entry. This amendment is \nurgently needed, and I must add that it is fully funded. The total cost \nof my amendment is roughly $2 billion. This cost is fully offset using \nunspent stimulus funds because we know the White House predictions \nabout the uses of those stimulus funds have been discredited.\n  Remember, we were told if we voted for a $787 billion unfunded--\nborrowed money--fund in order to get the economy moving again, \nunemployment would be kept to no more than 8 percent. Now, with \nunemployment at 9.9 percent, roughly, we know that stimulus program has \nbeen unsuccessful.\n  Two-thirds of the American people believe, according to Rasmussen--or \nI believe it is a Pew poll--the stimulus funds simply have not created \nor helped to retain jobs. We know during the period of time the White \nHouse predicted 3\\1/2\\ million jobs would be saved and created that 3 \nmillion jobs have been lost or destroyed by the recession.\n  This amendment represents a clear choice: a choice between funding \nthe Nation's priorities, such as border security or funding the same \nfailed stimulus strategy. It is a choice between paying for our \nNation's priorities or adding more debt to our national credit card, \nalready nearly maxed out at $13 trillion.\n  I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and help \nsend the message to our border communities and across our country that \nthe Federal Government acknowledges and accepts and embraces its \nresponsibility to help keep them and our Nation safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the previous agreement, I call up \na motion to instruct conferees that I have at the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the motions with respect to H.R. 4173, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4173) to provide for financial regulatory \n     reform, to protect consumers and investors, to enhance \n     Federal understanding of insurance issues, to regulate the \n     over-the-counter derivatives markets, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to instruct.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 4173 (the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act) be instructed to \n     insist that the final conference report include the House \n     position relating to the exclusion for motor vehicle dealers \n     from the rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or other \n     authority granted to the Director of the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Agency, as such exclusion is contained in section \n     4205 of H.R. 4173, as passed by the House, and that the final \n     conference report preserves the additional provisions, \n     definitions, and protections provided to such motor vehicle \n     dealers and servicemembers and their families in Senate \n     amendment 3789, as further modified, to S. 3217.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted the clerk to read the full \nmotion to instruct conferees so my colleagues could understand the \nsimplicity and directness of this motion. It is a very simple motion to \ninstruct conferees to recede to the House position in regard to auto \ndealers in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The House \nconsidered this in committee, and two-thirds of the committee members--\nhalf the Democrats, all the Republicans--voted to exclude the retail \nauto dealers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That is the \nway they voted. It came up\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\non the House floor, and it was defeated as far as to put the auto \ndealers in the regulatory process, so it was excluded in the House--\nfull consideration at the committee; at the full House level, excluded.\n  What we are asking, now that this bill has passed, is in the motion \nto instruct our conferees, the Senate conferees, in going with the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill, to recede to the House position \nregarding the auto dealers.\n  I think this is a good motion to instruct conferees. I think it is \nsomething we ought to do. I think it is something that will be very \nhelpful. I make this simple point to my colleagues: Under the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, 100 percent of all auto loans will still \nbe covered. If you vote for the Brownback instruction, if we recede to \nthe House position, 100 percent of the auto loans will still be \ncovered. We are saying in this, and the House position says: If you \nactually loan the money--if you are GMAC, if you are some other \nfinanciers up the street, you are under the CFPB. If you are simply the \nretail storefront, which is what the auto dealers are, you are not \ncovered under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You are not \ncovered if you are just the storefront arm of this, but 100 percent of \nthe loans are covered.\n  If you are an auto dealer and you make the actual loan yourself and \nit is your money you are lending, you are covered under the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. If you are simply the storefront operation \nout here doing this, you are not covered.\n  The auto dealers are asking for this. They do not want the additional \ncost and burden of this regulation on them. They are the quintessential \nMain Street business throughout the country. There is not a single auto \ndealer on Wall Street--none of them, not one. You can go up there today \nand try to buy a car and you cannot get one.\n  These are Main Street businesses, and they took it on the chin last \nyear. We lost, last year alone, 1,700 dealerships across America \nresulting in the loss of approximately 88,000 jobs. Why would we want \nto put a duplicative set of regulations on top of them that are already \ncovered upstream and they have already had these sorts of losses and \ndifficulties in a Main Street business?\n  We need people to create 88,000 jobs, not to eliminate or lose 88,000 \njobs. Franchised auto dealers are the retail outlets. They are the \nstorefronts that process the paperwork for various well-known brands \nwith large financial arms. Under the House provision that my motion \ninstructs us to recede to, these financial arms would still be \nregulated, but the dealers who process the paperwork would not.\n  Additionally, even if my motion is agreed to, auto dealers would \nstill be regulated by the FTC and various State laws, so consumers \nwould still have protections to ensure the truth in lending still \napplies.\n  In fact, I have a couple of pages here of regs--excuse me, of \nregulatory entities that auto dealers still apply to. I ask unanimous \nconsent this list be printed at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to also point out what typically happens. This \nis a letter I am going to read from the Dale Willey auto dealership in \nKansas. Dale Willey, the auto dealership in Kansas, said this about the \nfinancing that happens. I am reading from this:\n\n       Each month we have 3 to 5 buyers who tell our financial \n     service members--\n\n  There are three to five people coming in, telling our financial \nservice managers:\n\n     if our dealership can match or beat their bank's or credit \n     union's interest rate, they will then finance through our \n     dealership. To match the buyer's offer of rate terms simply \n     provides a convenience to our buyers. To offer a better term \n     and/or at a better rate enhances the buyer's savings by doing \n     business with our dealership.\n\n  In other words, this is a competitive situation that typically people \ngo into.\n  I will read again from the letter:\n\n       We have buyers also who are unable to secure a loan through \n     their normal bank, credit union or lender, and yet we are \n     able to submit the buyer's application to several of our \n     lenders with which we have agreements, discovering that one \n     or more are willing to make these loans to this buyer. Not \n     only does this provide a convenience to the buyer, but it \n     truly allows the buyer to secure a better level and lower \n     operating cost vehicle than provided by their older current \n     vehicle.\n\n  This is a competitive situation. It also positions people so that \nsometimes they are able to get loans they could not get on their own.\n  I want to address as well another situation that has come up in this \ndebate that people have raised: that this protection is needed for \nmilitary personnel in particular. A couple of weeks ago the Senate \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Brown \nof Massachusetts that creates the Office of Service Member Affairs at \nthe CFPB.\n  My motion that we are voting on today, instructs the current \nregulatory authorities to work with this office when they detect abuses \nby auto dealers. So we are saying, if you detect an abuse by auto \ndealers, then this should be worked on particularly by the CFPB and \nthis office of servicemember affairs.\n  I recently received a letter from the Under Secretary of the Army for \nPersonnel and Readiness, Clifford Stanley. In it he writes this:\n\n       DOD would welcome and encourage CFPA protection for \n     servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices, provided such \n     protections would not limit access to legitimate products.\n\n  That is exactly what motion does. Military personnel would have \nstrong protections by the CFPB but without the adverse effect of \nlimiting their access to credit. If you want to protect the military \nand maintain all their options for buying a car, you should vote in \nfavor of this motion.\n  I point out these matters because there has been a lot of discussion \nand debate going on about the auto dealers amendment throughout the \nproceedings of this entire bill, which has gone on for some period of \ntime. This makes sense to do this the way the House did it. It makes \nsense for us to move forward with this motion to recede to the House \nposition.\n  The House has established this position. They have thought it \nthrough, and 100 percent of auto loans will still be covered. It is \njust the auto dealership will not be the one that is covered, the \nupstream financer will, unless the auto dealership is loaning their own \nmoney, and then they will be covered.\n  If you are concerned about military personnel, there is a particular \ndirection in here regarding military personnel. Again, any loans are \ncovered. It is the upstream position that is covered, and it is where \nit should be. That is the actual person or group that is making the \nloan. That is the one that should be covered.\n  Instead of putting an additional burden on dealerships that have \nalready lost lots of jobs, we are saying: No, let us recede to the \nHouse position.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I urge my colleagues to vote yes \non the Brownback motion to recede to the House position.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Legal & Regulatory Group, National Automobile Dealers \n           Association, McLean, VA.\n\n   Federal Consumer Protection Regulations Applicable to Automobile \n                     Dealers' Financial Operations\n\n       1.

Mr. President, the Restoring American Financial \nStability Act is supposed to regulate Wall Street, not Main Street. It \nis Wall Street whose greed brought us the economic crisis. That is why \nI am voting for the Brownback motion to instruct conferees to support \nthe House provision regarding the regulation of auto dealers.\n  We need a tough financial reform bill that focuses on the abuses that \nled to the economic crash. This bill is intended to primarily regulate \nmajor institutions that deal nationally and globally and to improve \ngovernment coordination to ensure that there is an early warning and an \nearly response system in place to prevent a future crisis like the one \nwe were faced with in 2008. Automobile dealers were not part of the \nproblem that led us to where we are today and therefore should not be \nsubject to this legislation.\n  We must make sure that laws that are already on the books are being \nimplemented and enforced. Under current law, car dealers are subject to \nextensive Federal regulation. Dealers' retail financing activity is \nregulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade \nCommission, and car dealers are subject to tough Federal laws, \nincluding the Truth in Lending Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. \nThose laws must be enforced. Predatory lending practices must be \nstopped, and there are tools in place to do so.\n  I believe that auto dealers are best regulated by State and local \nconsumer protection agencies. Main Street should be regulated by people \nwho are closer to its daily activities. Governors and attorneys general \nmust make sure that consumers are protected from bad actors. The \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau should focus on Wall Street, not \nMain Street, and should not be used to increase unnecessary regulations \non small businesses.\n  During debate on the Brownback amendment, it became clear that the \nmen and women of our military have been targeted by unscrupulous auto \ndealers. This is an outrage. I never want to see our military personnel \nbeing taken advantage of. Our service men and women have dedicated \ntheir lives to this country, and we have a responsibility to make sure \nthey, and their families, are treated with respect and that we do \neverything we can to reduce their increasing stress. That is why I \nvoted to create an Office of Service Member Affairs within the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to educate the men and women of our \nmilitary, and their families, to make better informed financial \ndecisions and to strengthen coordination of consumer protections for \nmembers of our military. We must crack down on those who are taking \nadvantage of our military families and communities. However, I do not \nthink we need a new regulatory structure to do so. A Washington \nregulatory agency is not the best suited to regulate outside of \nmilitary bases in Maryland or North Carolina.\n  As I said on the floor when we began debate of this bill, now is our \nopportunity to pass real financial reform that puts in place the \nstrongest consumer financial protections and ensures the greed of Wall \nStreet doesn't trump the needs of Main Street. That is why I support \nthe House provision on the regulation of auto dealers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains for my friend from \nKansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 56 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that Sam Brownback \nand I are good friends. We have a different point of view in this \nmatter. But that in no way at all should be reflected in our \nrelationship with each other, as we have served together for many \nyears. I fundamentally disagree with him about this.\n  Instructing conferees is an interesting motion in many ways. As we \nwill be going to conference with the other body, I will be delighted to \nlisten to these various ideas. But this is a matter which does deserve \nto be protected.\n  First of all, let me say that when it comes to automobile dealers, \nthey are no different than community banks or other financial \ninstitutions; the overwhelming majority are good people and do a good \njob. But we do not pass laws in this country because a majority of the \npeople commit crimes. We pass laws for the minority who can abuse their \nrelationship with customers or with people. That is no different in \nthis particular case at all.\n  So this is not about whether you like automobile dealers or do not \nlike them. The simple question is: The second largest purchase that \nmost Americans make is the purchase of an automobile. We do not buy \nstocks. We do not buy fancy institutions and so forth. We buy a home \nand we buy an automobile, and they are expensive undertakings.\n  So the question is very simply: We have established in our \nlegislation, for the first time in the history of our country, a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau that will watch out for the \naverage American citizen when it comes to financial practices. We have \na Consumer Product Safety Commission. We have the Food and Drug \nAdministration which protects you against products that you ingest, so \nyou have some ability to respond if they do you harm.\n  If you buy a lawn mower or you buy any other consumer product, we \nhave a place you can go to get a recall when that product does injury \nor could do injury to you. Yet we have no place in this country, where \nyou can be ruined by a financial product, to get you any redress.\n  So this legislation, for the first time in our Nation's history, \nestablishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to watch out for bad \nmortgages, car loans, watch out for other financial activities in which \nthe average individual may engage.\n  As I said, one of the most principal activities that people engage in \nas consumers is the purchase of an automobile. So we are trying to \nprotect people. If we are going to say to community banks and to credit \nunions and other financial institutions: You must comply with these \nrules, they will be\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nenforced at the local level. But you have a community bank on one \ncorner, a credit union on the other corner and a car dealer on the \nthird corner and all three would like to compete for that business. To \nthe credit union and the community bank we say: You have to comply with \nrules that protect consumers. But you, Mr. Auto Dealer over here, you \ndo not have to do that. You can go off and do exactly as you want.\n  That is a mistake and why we have insisted that these provisions \ninclude automobile dealers. So I rise in opposition to this proposal.\n  A lot is said in this body about our men and women who serve in \nuniform. We all believe that, just as those heroes stand for us every \nsingle day, in bodies such as this we ought to stand for them. I wish \nto focus my remarks on what happens to men and women in uniform today \nbecause it is that constituency alone that ought to be reason to defeat \nthis motion.\n  As we considered financial reform, then, we strove to heed the words \nof groups such as the Military Coalition, a consortium of over 30 \nnationally prominent military and veterans organizations, representing \nmore than 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and their \nfamilies, including such groups as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nNational Guard Association, the Military Officers Association, the \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart, and many others.\n  All these groups have written a letter in which they say, in part: \nThe most significant financial obligation for the majority of \nservicemembers is auto financing.\n  It is also the place where servicemembers are most likely to be taken \nadvantage of. Recently, the New York Times reported on one case, that \nof Matthew Garcia, a 25-year-old Army specialist who was recently \nsubjected to a trick called yo-yo financing by an unscrupulous car \ndealer, just as he was preparing to deploy for Afghanistan.\n  According to the story in the press, Specialist Garcia, stationed at \nFort Hood, TX, bought an automobile at a used car lot, signed up for a \nloan at a 19.9 percent interest rate. That would be bad enough, but \nthat is not the worst of it, the high rate of interest. The problem \ncame when Specialist Garcia drove the car home.\n  The dealer called Specialist Garcia several days later to say the \nfinancing contract had actually fallen through and demanded an \nadditional $2,500 in cash from Specialist Garcia. To make sure he paid \nup, the dealer blocked the soldier's car so no one could leave.\n  That is the way some--a few but some--auto dealers are treating our \nmen and women in uniform. It is not enough that I tell you this story \nor one story in the press account. Under Secretary of Defense Stanley--\nin fact, my good friend, Senator Brownback, quoted from the letter from \nClifford Stanley. But listen to the operative sentence in the letter \nfrom Under Secretary Stanley:\n\n       The Department's position as stated in my letter to \n     Assistant Secretary Barr remains unchanged. The Department of \n     Defense would welcome and encourage the CFPA protections for \n     Servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices provided such \n     protections would not limit access to legitimate products.\n\n  Which they do not at all. So we are hearing from Under Secretary of \nDefense Stanley, in which he says: ``Bait and switch'' financing, \nfalsification of loan applications, failure to pay off liens on trade-\nin vehicles, ``packing'' loans with items whose price bears little, if \nany, relationship to their real cost, and discriminatory lending are \nthe kinds of problems members of our Armed Forces and their families \nface when dealing with financing their cars with car dealers.\n  In fact, Secretary Stanley reports that 72 percent of military \ncounselors and attorneys surveyed had cited problems with auto dealer \nabuses in just the past 6 months alone, 72 percent cited it as a major \nproblem. The Department of Defense is telling us that our men and women \nin uniform are at risk of being ripped off, as they are every single \nday.\n  That is why, of course, we adopted, 98 to 1, by the way, the \namendment offered by Scott Brown, our colleague from Massachusetts, and \nJack Reed, our colleague from Rhode Island. That amendment said we must \nhave an office of servicemember affairs in the consumer bureau. Why did \nwe establish that office there? What is the principal obligation that \nthese service men and women get into that causes so much difficulty? It \nis automobiles sales. That is why we put it in.\n  What an irony it would be that we vote 98 to 1 to say we ought to \nestablish that office within the consumer financial bureau and then \nturn around and adopt the Brownback amendment or insist upon it in a \nconference report, which basically exempts every one of these auto \ndealers from having to comply with the consumer protection laws. That \nwould be an irony beyond ironies in a way, to on one hand say: We want \nto help you and protect you and then, on the other hand, take away the \nmajor organizations out there that do the most damage to them.\n  The Brownback motion would steal away this protection from our Armed \nForces by creating a loophole for the exact sector of the financial \nservices industry in which servicemembers are most vulnerable, and that \nis in auto sales. Let me be clear. All of us have relationships with \nauto dealers. I have a wonderful relationship with the people in my \nState of Connecticut whom I have worked closely with over the years.\n  All of us support those businesses. As I said at the outset of these \nremarks, the overwhelming majority of them do a good job and do not \nengage in unscrupulous behavior. But the laws are not written for the \nmany, they are written for the few out there who do take advantage of \nthese young men and women.\n\n  As we know from the evidence supplied by our military organizations \nand others who have written, rarely do they ever get involved in a \nmatter such as a Banking Committee matter, to have the Under Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Army, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Order of the Purple Heart, and the \nOfficers Association, all of them, 30 organizations saying: Do not do \nthis.\n  Yet we are about to turn around and undo the efforts we have made to \nsee to it that these young men and women, whom we all talk about in \nMemorial Day speeches, and so forth--what a great job they do for our \ncountry, and then turn around, in the one area they get taken to the \ncleaners on day after day, which is in this one particular area, and to \nexempt them entirely from the consideration of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  The community bankers oppose this. The credit unions oppose this as \nwell. They want a level playing field. They would like to compete for \nthat business. They have to comply with the rules. How can you turn \naround and say to that community bank or that credit union: You have to \nlive with these rules, but the guy on the other corner does not have to \ndo so. How is that fair when it comes to financing, as I said have \nsaid, the second largest purchase that anyone would make, that most \npeople make in their lives?\n  So it is unfair, it seems to me, to have two sets of rules for the \nsame product. That is what we would be doing if this amendment were \nadopted, and, of course, the conferees were required to insist upon \nsupporting language in the House bill. Military leaders such as Michael \nDonley, the Secretary of the Air Force, support this approach because, \nin his words:\n\n       Protection from unprincipled automobile lending enables our \n     Airmen to concentrate on their primary mission--to fly, fight \n     and win in air, space, and cyberspace.\n\n  Advocates such as Holly Petraeus, wife of GEN David Petraeus, the \ndirector of the Better Business program for military families, at a \npress conference, strongly supports the protections we have in this \nbill. They know the hardships military families face and believe it \nshould not be compounded by shady lenders.\n  By the way, it is not just our servicemembers who suffer from lending \nabuse in this sector as well. There is a long and sad history of racial \ndiscrimination in auto lending. For example, African-American borrowers \nwho are charged more than 2.5 times the amount in subjective rate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on the motion has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute and provide \n1 additional minute for my friend from Kansas as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me, if I can, because my friend from Kansas cited this, \nabout separating out the financing from the lenders. There was a court \ncase. Listen to what one of these witnesses, involved in that \ndistinction, had to say. Some argue that auto dealer financing \noperations are not the lenders, they are merely processing the \npaperwork.\n  According to court testimony of a former finance and insurance \nmanager from a Tennessee auto dealer:\n\n       The standard industry practice is to prepare the financing \n     documents so that the customer is not alerted in any manner \n     that the person with whom he is dealing has the ability to \n     control the customer's price of credit. This allows the \n     finance arranger to present himself as the ally of the \n     customer, which further relaxes and disarms the customer. The \n     nature of the transaction creates the perfect opportunity for \n     a dealer to obtain a large kickback from an unsuspecting \n     customer by subjectively inflating their interest rates.\n\n  This is not a time to do so much damage, in my view, to these young \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters we have from the various \nmilitary organizations in opposition to the Brownback amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                               Bankers of America',\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: On behalf of the \n     Independent Community Bankers of America and its nearly 5,000 \n     member banks, I write to oppose Sen. Brownback's amendments \n     SA 3789 and SA 3790 to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010 to exempt most automobile dealers from \n     the jurisdiction of the proposed Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n       ICBA believes the CFPB should be focused on the under-\n     regulated financial services providers rather than highly-\n     regulated community banks. When automobile dealers offer \n     financing to customers--generally as a conduit for \n     manufacturers' captive finance arms--the dealers provide \n     consumers loans and leases that are second only to home \n     mortgages in importance to most families. Yet, their \n     financing activities are not subjected to the same level of \n     regulatory scrutiny as the auto lending activities of \n     community banks. Exempting automobile dealers would create a \n     gaping loophole in the CFPB and would give automobile \n     dealers--as well as the manufacturers' captive finance arms \n     that provide financing through them--a competitive advantage \n     over community banks and reduce consumer choice in auto \n     loans.\n       I urge you to oppose exemptions to the CFPB for non-\n     depository lenders, including automobile dealers.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: The Military \n     Coalition, a consortium of nationally prominent military and \n     veterans organizations, representing more than 5.5 million \n     current and former servicemembers and their families and \n     survivors, would like to express our opposition to Senator \n     Brownback's amendment to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010. Senator Brownback's amendment would \n     exclude auto dealers and their lending practices from the \n     financial reform bill.\n       The most significant financial obligation for the majority \n     of servicemembers is auto financing. Including the auto \n     dealers financing and sales in the financial reform bill will \n     provide greater protections for our servicemembers and their \n     families.\n       Providing a ``carve-out'' for auto dealers does just the \n     opposite--it will allow unscrupulous dealers to continue to \n     take advantage of servicemembers and their families.\n       In a recent letter from the Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Personnel and Readiness (USD P) to the Department of the \n     Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions \n     (attached), Dr. Clifford Stanley states that the Department \n     of Defense would welcome protections provided to \n     servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices.\n       Additionally, Dr. Stanley highlights the extent of the \n     problem in a recent informal polling of installation \n     attorneys and personal financial managers/counselors. Of the \n     659 counselors and attorneys who responded, 72% stated that \n     they counseled servicemembers in the past six months on one \n     or more unscrupulous practices (e.g., ``bait and switch'' \n     financing, falsification of loan documents, failure to pay-\n     off liens, and ``packing loans'') when covering auto \n     financing with their client.\n       Again, the Coalition wishes to reiterate our collective \n     opposition to any ``carve-out'' of auto dealership financing \n     from the financial reform bill and we thank you for your \n     attention to this important issue impacting military members \n     and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, \n           Air Force Women Officers Associated, American Logistics \n           Association, AMVETS (American Veterans), Army Aviation \n           Association of America, Association of Military \n           Surgeons of the United States, Association of the \n           United States Army, Association of the United States \n           Navy, Chief Warrant Officer and Warrant Officer \n           Association, U.S. Coast Guard, Commissioned Officers \n           Association of the U.S. Public Health Service, Inc., \n           Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n           United States, Fleet Reserve Association, Gold Star \n           Wives of America, Inc., Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of \n           America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of \n           America, Marine Corps League, Military Chaplains \n           Association of the United States of America, Military \n           Officers Association of America, Military Order of the \n           Purple Heart, National Guard Association of the United \n           States, National Military Family Association, National \n           Order of Battlefield Commissions, Naval Enlisted \n           Reserve Association, Non Commissioned Officers \n           Association, Reserve Enlisted Association of the United \n           States, Society of Medical Consultants to the Armed \n           Forces, The Retired Enlisted Association, United States \n           Army Warrant Officers Association, United States Coast \n           Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, Veterans of \n           Foreign Wars of the United States.\n\n           \n                                  ____\n                                                     May 19, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to voice our opposition to the \n     modified version of Senator Brownback's Amendment #3789, \n     which would exempt auto dealers from the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau. The changes made to the amendment do \n     nothing to stop automobile dealers from engaging in \n     fraudulent or abusive practices. Instead, the revised \n     amendment provides financial education for military families \n     who are targeted by unscrupulous dealers with these tactics.\n       While good financial counseling can help consumers make \n     smart purchasing decisions, it is no substitute for \n     vigorously enforcing the law to prevent unfair and deceptive \n     practices. In fact, the modified Brownback Amendment #3789 \n     would shift the burden onto the military and individual \n     Service members to avoid being defrauded by car dealers, \n     rather than protecting our troops and all Americans with a \n     new consumer agency that polices auto dealer financing and \n     enforces already existing consumer protection laws.\n       Senator Brownback's modification requires the Federal \n     Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission--two agencies that \n     to date have failed to adequately protect consumers from \n     abusive auto lending practices--to work with the Office of \n     Service Member Affairs to ensure that ``Service members and \n     their families are educated and empowered to make better \n     informed decisions regarding consumer financial products and \n     services offered by motor vehicle dealers.'' However, many of \n     the scams perpetrated on our troops cannot be eliminated \n     through education, since fraud by its very nature is designed \n     to deceive and is often perpetrated without the consumer's \n     knowledge or awareness. For example, some car dealers engage \n     in ``powerbooking,'' a scam in which the victim does not have \n     access to the documents the dealer submits to the finance \n     company and therefore has no knowledge of the phantom add-ons \n     the auto dealer claims are part of the vehicle. Some dealers \n     falsify loan applications, in which case the victim does not \n     have access to the loan documents that falsifies pay stubs \n     and statements of income. In another scam, the auto dealer \n     promises to pay off the lien on the victim's trade-in at the \n     time of sale, but does not, so the consumer is unknowingly \n     left with the responsibility to pay off the new car as well \n     as the car that was traded in. There is no way for the victim \n     to know in advance that the dealer doesn't intend to pay off \n     the lien. Senator Brownback's modified amendment would do \n     nothing to stop these abuses.\n       The modified Brownback Amendment maintains the status quo \n     that has failed to adequately protect U.S. troops and the \n     American consumer from auto scams up until now. The Office of \n     Service Member Affairs would in no way have the authority to \n     actually require the Federal Reserve to issue meaningful new \n     rules and/or require the FTC to enforce the already existing \n     rules.\n       We urge the Senate to vote no on the Brownback auto dealer \n     exemption.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fleet Reserve Association.\n     Military Officers Association of America.\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     Navy Marine Corps Relief Society.\n     Center for Responsible Lending.\n     Consumer Federation of America.\n     National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n     National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n     clients).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Credit Union\n\n\n                                         National Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2010.\n     Hon.

Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: On behalf of \n     the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), I am writing in \n     opposition to the Brownback amendments (SA 3789 and SA 3790) \n     to S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act, \n     which would exempt auto dealers from the bill. CUNA is the \n     largest credit union advocacy organization in the United \n     States, representing nearly 90 percent of America's 7,800 \n     state and federally chartered credit unions and their 92 \n     million members.\n       As we have said from the beginning of this debate, \n     consumers of financial products provided by unregulated \n     entities need greater protections. One of the ways that the \n     legislation seeks to provide these greater protections is \n     through the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial \n     Protection (BCFP), which is intended to be the exclusive \n     federal rulemaking entity for laws designed to protect \n     consumers of financial products. Excluding any non-depository \n     institution provider of financial products, including auto \n     dealers, from the rules promulgated by the BCFP would defeat \n     the purpose of creating the new consumer regulator, would put \n     credit unions at a competitive disadvantage in the new \n     regulatory regime, and could cause confusion for consumers of \n     financial products.\n       We encourage the Senate to reject amendments, including the \n     Brownback amendments, which would upset the balance of the \n     consumer protection title by exempting any currently \n     unregulated providers of financial services from the Bureau's \n     rules.\n       On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you very much \n     for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Daniel A. Mica,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Secretary of the Army,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing regarding the legislation \n     before the Senate which would establish the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) and delineate the limits \n     of its authority.\n       I understand that an amendment may soon be introduced that \n     would exempt automobile dealerships from any financial \n     oversight under the CFPA. The Army would have strong concerns \n     with any such amendments.\n       Over the years, many of our Soldiers have fallen victim to \n     predatory lending practices and have entered into contracts \n     for prohibitively expensive financial products promoted by \n     some unscrupulous car dealerships and lenders. Though the \n     Army does educate our Soldiers about buying cars in our \n     normal financial education curriculum, the fact remains that \n     junior enlisted Soldiers--many of whom are drawing a regular \n     paycheck for the first time in their lives and are \n     inexperienced in financial matters--remain an easy target for \n     dishonest brokers. We owe them the protection and oversight \n     that would be afforded by the CFPA.\n       In an era of persistent conflict and multiple deployments, \n     our Soldiers and their Families are under increasing stress. \n     In surveys conducted by the Department of Defense, finances \n     rank among the primary causes of stress for most military \n     Families. As auto loans are often the most significant \n     financial obligations of our Soldiers--particularly within \n     the junior enlisted grades--we believe that greater \n     government oversight of auto financing and sales for our \n     Soldiers will help protect them and reduce unnecessary \n     financial strain on our already overburdened Army Families.\n       Soldiers who are distracted by financial issues at home are \n     not fully focused on fighting the enemy, thereby decreasing \n     mission readiness. Protection from unprincipled auto lending \n     enables our Soldiers to concentrate on their primary \n     mission--protecting our great Nation.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our Soldiers and \n     their Families.\n           Sincerely,\n     John M. McHugh.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR)--the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy \n     organization in the United States--I urge you to oppose \n     Senator Carper's (D-DE) Amendment #3949 to the ``Restoring \n     American Financial Security Act of 2010'' (S. 3217). \n     Amendment #3949 undermines sustainable and meaningful \n     consumer protection. We call on the Senate to vote for \n     ordinary families who benefit from having extra cops on the \n     beat, rather than for banks seeking to avoid enforcement for \n     violations of consumer protection, equal credit, and fair \n     lending laws.\n       Communities of color have been hit hard by predatory \n     lending in all forms. Now our families are struggling with \n     rising household debt, record-high foreclosure rates, and the \n     erosion of their financial safety net. They need a strong \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to level the \n     playing field by enforcing our nation's consumer protection \n     laws. Moreover, since individuals will not have a right to \n     enforce the CFPB rules themselves, they will need law \n     enforcement, including their state attorneys general, to \n     enforce the rules.\n       The Carper amendment raises two serious concerns:\n       1. Attorney General Enforcement--The amendment takes state \n     cops off the predatory lending beat, weakening the already \n     compromised enforcement provisions in the bill. It would \n     prevent state attorneys general from enforcing CFPB rules \n     against national banks and federal thrifts and could weaken \n     their ability to enforce other laws. Under another provision \n     of the bill, the CFPB will have no enforcement authority \n     against 98% of banks, making it that much more critical that \n     attorneys general be able to enforce the federal rules on \n     behalf of the state's residents. This amendment would leave \n     enforcement for most banks entirely up to bank regulators, \n     whose lax enforcement led to this crisis in the first place.\n       2. State Law Preemption--The amendment would prevent states \n     from addressing new bank abuses not yet covered by federal \n     protection before they spread nationally. It would remove a \n     critical provision that requires the Office of the \n     Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to consider whether a state \n     law addresses problems not covered by federal law before it \n     gives banks a free pass to ignore that law. The Senate \n     compromise provision in the bill already gives the OCC, an \n     agency with a history of open hostility to consumer \n     protection, far too much power to wipe out state consumer \n     protection laws. The provision should not be weakened \n     further.\n       States are first responders that can stop local abuses from \n     spreading to become a national problem. Their laws are most \n     important when there is a gap in federal law. Moreover, \n     before bringing an enforcement action, attorneys general \n     already must consult with the CFPB and bank regulators, and \n     the CFPB may intervene or clarify its rules, ensuring \n     consistency in enforcement standards.\n       Anyone who violates the law should be held accountable. Do \n     not give banks that violate specific CFPB rules a special \n     pass against vigilant enforcement. Should you have any \n     questions, please contact Graciela Aponte, Wealth-Building \n     Legislative Analyst.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Janet Murguia,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, well, if this motion to instruct did \nwhat Senator Dodd had suggested, I would probably vote against it as \nwell. It does not.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut, who is obviously a great \npersuader, does a great job, and whom I share a great friendship with \nand great admiration for and who has served this body very well.\n  The problem is, if we have three places sitting here--we have a \ncommunity banker, we have a credit union, and we have an auto dealer--\nall three are still covered. They are all three still covered if they \nmake the loan. If they originate, if they make the loan, they put the \nmoney out there, all three are covered.\n  What we are saying in this motion is, if it is your money that you \nare loaning, you are covered. But if you are simply writing paper or \ntrying to help someone upstream and options for the person who is \ncoming in and you are saying: We have option A, B or C, from this \ncredit union, from that bank or from GMAC, whichever it may be, they \nare not covered.\n  The authors of the bill want to put belts and suspenders on auto \nfinancing. Why would we double regulate in this particular area when we \nare already going to have the cost and the burden of doing it? And on \ntop of all that, we already have a set of regulations in this field.\n  My colleague talked about yo-yo and bait-and-switch financing. They \nare illegal at the State level now. State attorneys general are going \nafter these people now, and they should, particularly if it targets \nmilitary personnel. That person who walks into a dealership in my State \nor some other State\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nwill be covered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is \ngoing to be at an upstream location, but it is covered. One hundred \npercent of them are covered. Why would we put this extra cost and \nexpense on the retail operation that is not loaning the money? They are \nnot doing this.\n  If my colleagues are concerned about this area, do this. If they are \nconcerned about having overregulation and overreach by Washington, \nsupport my motion. The loan is still covered, and we are not having \nthis double coverage of belts and suspenders on auto loans that is \ngoing to hurt the ability of people to get loans, and it is going to \ndrive up the cost of auto financing. It is going to hurt Main Street \nbusinesses that we lost 1,700 of last year and that lost us 88,000 \njobs. I thought this bill was targeted at Wall Street, not at Main \nStreet where we didn't have this problem going on. We haven't had this \nproblem within auto loans as far as causing the financial meltdown. The \nregulation is already there. The regulation will be there. This extra \nregulation is not needed.\n  I ask my colleagues to support Main Street on this one. Support the \nlocal auto dealers out there, those who are working with the community, \ntrying to help the community thrive and survive, instead of putting a \ndouble dose of regulation on top of them that is going to hurt the \nbusiness, hurt auto sales, hurt financing opportunities.\n  I urge support for the Brownback motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. DODD. All time has expired on Brownback?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I call up the Hutchison-Hagan motion to instruct \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                      Motion to instruct conferees\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 4173 (the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act) be instructed to \n     insist that the final conference report ensure that \n     proprietary trading restrictions do not prevent insurance \n     company affiliates of depository institutions from engaging \n     in such trading as part of the ordinary business of \n     insurance, especially insurance company affiliates serving \n     military service members and their families, as such \n     restrictions would result in higher costs and significant \n     inconveniences to those sacrificing in service to our \n     country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask to be notified at the end of 5 minutes so I may \nyield the floor to Senator Hagan for the rest of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Hutchison-Hagan motion to instruct \nis trying to narrow the definition that falls under the Volcker rule \nand the underlying bill. I believe our amendment would have passed \noverwhelmingly if we had been able to get it up before cloture was \ninvoked. I appreciate there was a lot going on last week, but this is \nthe way we hope to be able to assure that our amendment is a part of \nthe final bill. The Volcker rule contained in the measure before us \nseeks to restrict or ban risky proprietary trading at depository \ninstitutions. As currently written, the rule brings about some \nunintended consequences that could be disastrous for our financial \nsystem and to a special class of customers--American service men and \nwomen. The major problem with the current language is that its reach \nextends beyond the bounds of the depository institution to a bank's \naffiliates and subsidiaries, including insurance companies. For \ndiversified financial institutions that serve as one-stop shops of \nbanking and insurance products, especially those serving our military \nservice men and women and their families, the extension of the Volcker \nrule's proprietary trading restrictions to a depository institution's \ninsurance company affiliates threatens their ability to address the \nspecial financial needs of the U.S. military community. The Hutchison-\nHagan motion to instruct conferees seeks to ensure that the Volcker \nrule's proprietary trading restrictions do not extend to the normal \noperations of insurance affiliates of insured depository institutions \nso that we can preserve convenient access to the full spectrum of \nfinancial services for the U.S. military community.\n  It is important to note that the proprietary trading that insurance \nentities engage in is significantly different from the proprietary \ntrading that is the target of the Volcker rule.\n  First, insurance companies use premiums to fund trades, not customer \ndeposits. Thus, insurers are trading their own funds, not those of \ndepositors. Insurance company trades are generally low risk, focus on \nlong-term payment of claims and profitability, and are already heavily \nregulated by State insurance regulators. Simply put: Proprietary \ntrading is essential to the life insurance and property and casualty \ninsurance business. Proprietary trading is what allows insurers to \noffer annuities and other insurance products that can protect consumers \nin the long term.\n  The motion to instruct is narrowly drafted. We have worked with the \nmajority staff as well as the minority staff of the Banking Committee \nto assure that the drafting is in line with what we all intend to do. \nIt doesn't speak to the Volcker rule's impact on depository \ninstitutions at all. It merely seeks to allow regulated insurance \nentities to continue to operate as they currently do in a manner that \nensures payment of claims and annuities for years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Hagan motion. We have \nworked on this for several weeks together. I believe this bipartisan \nmotion to instruct will be overwhelmingly approved because so many \npeople have heard from their constituents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of \nAmerica, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Naval Enlisted \nReserve Association, and the TIAA CREF, a national financial services \norganization dedicated to serving the financial needs of those who work \nin the academic, medical, and cultural fields, all in support of our \namendment and our motion to instruct.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United \n           States of America,\n                                           Selma, TX, May 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: I write on \n     behalf of the Non Commissioned Officers Association of the \n     United States of America (NCOA), representing active duty, \n     enlisted service members of all military services, the United \n     States Coast Guard, associated Guard and Reserve Forces, \n     retirees and veterans of all components. NCOA has strong \n     concerns regarding the impact of the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010's (S. 3217) ``Volcker Rule'' \n     provisions on NCOA members and for that matter, the entire \n     U.S. military community.\n       NCOA is dedicated to providing for service members and \n     their families through every stage of their military career \n     from enlistment to eventual separation, retirement and \n     continuing to provide services to veterans' surviving family \n     members. We understand and respect the achievements and \n     sacrifices made by all service members and their families and \n     are committed to ensuring that the military community has \n     access to the ``one stop shop'' providers of financial \n     services necessary to address their unique banking and \n     insurance needs. This ease of access to essential financial \n     resources is crucial to minimize the financial stresses and \n     other burdens accompanying military life.\n       S. 3217's Volcker Rule, as currently proposed, threatens \n     this essential access to one stop shop providers of financial \n     services for NCOA members and their families. Limiting thc \n     provision's proprietary trading restrictions by excluding the \n     insurance affiliates of insured depository institutions is \n     necessary to maintain access to financial products and \n     services that meet the unique needs of the military \n     community. Making this small change to the Volcker Rule \n     language will ensure that the financial stability of enlisted \n     service members and their families is not put in jeopardy. \n     Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this issue and \n     its\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n     impact on NCOA members and the entire U.S. military \n     community.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           H.

AFSA has strong concerns regarding the impact of the \n     so called ``Volcker Rule'' provisions in the American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. 3217, on AFSA members and \n     the entire enlisted military community.\n       AFSA members and their families have made many sacrifices \n     in order to invest their lives in the cause of freedom. They \n     require access to ``one stop shop'' providers of financial \n     services to address their unique banking and insurance needs. \n     Ease of access to essential financial resources is \n     particularly crucial today as our American military community \n     faces the financial stresses and other burdens accompanying \n     multiple deployments and frequent and costly relocations \n     during times of active conflict. S. 3217's Volcker Rule \n     provisions, as currently drafted, will prevent financial \n     services providers from offering both banking and insurance \n     products to AFSA members and their families tailored to their \n     specific financial needs.\n       Making a small change to the bill's current language to \n     ensure the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading restrictions \n     are not extended to the insurance affiliates of insured \n     depository institutions would allow one stop shop providers \n     of financial products and services to continue meeting the \n     unique needs of the military community. If the language is \n     not corrected, this ease of access to important financial \n     resources by American servicemen, women and their families \n     will be in jeopardy.

Keniry,\n                      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to \ninstruct offered by my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. I thank \nthe Senator from Texas for her leadership on this issue of importance \nto members of the military in our States and across the country. \nSection 619 of the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 \nbans certain activities not only at depository institutions but also at \nbank affiliates, including insurance affiliates. In doing so, section \n619 inadvertently jeopardizes access to the important financial \nresources offered by diversified financial institutions to service men \nand women and their families. Section 619 bans proprietary trading, but \nproprietary trading by insurance entities is significantly different \nthan the risk that comes with banks' proprietary trading. Insurance \ncompanies use premiums to trade funds, not the consumer deposits that \nthis provision targets. Insurance trades are generally low risk and \nfocus on long-term payment of claims and are already heavily regulated \nby State insurance regulators.\n  Servicemembers and their families rely on the ability of diversified \nfinancial service firms to provide both insurance and banking services \nunder one roof. I am concerned that section 619 may force military \nmembers to change their current financial service providers and \npossibly subject the service men and women to unnecessary cost and \nburdens. That is why Senator Hutchison and I have worked for several \nweeks to correct this oversight, and why I introduced amendment 3799 \nwith Senators Hutchison, Carper, Cornyn, Begich, Webb, Burr, and \nIsakson. Amendment 3799 was a narrow change that addressed the issue. \nTo my knowledge, it was not opposed by anyone. While amendment 3799 was \nnot voted on, Senator Hutchison's motion to instruct provides clear \nguidance to the conferees to ensure that proprietary trading \nrestrictions do not prevent insurance company affiliates of depository \ninstitutions from engaging in such trading as part of the ordinary \nbusiness of insurance.\n  It is critical that we adopt this motion so that diversified \nfinancial institutions may continue to provide low-cost and convenient \naccess to diversified financial services for those sacrificing in \nservice to our country. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this \nmotion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend both of my colleagues, Senator \nHutchison and Senator Hagan, my good friends from Texas and North \nCarolina. They have done a great job and deserve our thanks for the \nwork they have put into this proposal. I am supportive of the motion to \ninstruct. As a conferee, I will have something to say about this, I \npresume, in the conference. I thank them for their efforts. They have \nlaid this out pretty well. I don't need to take a lot of time. I have \nsome further remarks that lay out why I think this is a good proposal. \nI appreciate very much their efforts in this regard.\n  I am prepared to yield back time on this matter and urge colleagues \nto support the Hutchison-Hagan motion to the financial reform package. \nIt is a good proposal, one that deserves all of our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee. He has been supportive of this amendment from the \nbeginning. Senator Hagan and I can say that we have regularly \ncommunicated with the chairman, and maybe he would even consider that \nwe have hounded him to death. But nevertheless, I know he was helping \nus all along. We worked on the drafting to assure that the language met \nboth the minority and majority requirements. I am pleased he has worked \nwith us on this amendment. I thank Senator Hagan as well for being such \na staunch cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I yield back my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DODD. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on both motions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't see my colleague from Kansas but I know he wants \nthe yeas and nays.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Brownback motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Hutchison-Hagan motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman, when \nwe start the vote at 5:30, it will be the Brownback motion first and \nthen Hutchison-Hagan.\n  Mr. DODD. Brownback would come first and then the Hutchison-Hagan \nmotion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD.

The clerk will report the motion to instruct.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 4173 (the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act) be instructed to \n     insist that the final conference report include the House \n     position relating to the exclusion for motor vehicle dealers \n     from the rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or other \n     authority granted to the Director of the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Agency, as such exclusion is contained in section \n     4205 of H.R. 4173, as passed by the House, and that the final \n     conference report preserves the additional provisions, \n     definitions, and protections provided to such motor vehicle \n     dealers and servicemembers and their families in Senate \n     amendment 3789, as further modified, to S. 3217.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted the clerk to read the full \nmotion to instruct conferees so my colleagues could understand the \nsimplicity and directness of this motion. It is a very simple motion to \ninstruct conferees to recede to the House position in regard to auto \ndealers in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The House \nconsidered this in committee, and two-thirds of the committee members--\nhalf the Democrats, all the Republicans--voted to exclude the retail \nauto dealers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That is the \nway they voted. It came up\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\non the House floor, and it was defeated as far as to put the auto \ndealers in the regulatory process, so it was excluded in the House--\nfull consideration at the committee; at the full House level, excluded.\n  What we are asking, now that this bill has passed, is in the motion \nto instruct our conferees, the Senate conferees, in going with the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill, to recede to the House position \nregarding the auto dealers.\n  I think this is a good motion to instruct conferees. I think it is \nsomething we ought to do. I think it is something that will be very \nhelpful. I make this simple point to my colleagues: Under the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, 100 percent of all auto loans will still \nbe covered. If you vote for the Brownback instruction, if we recede to \nthe House position, 100 percent of the auto loans will still be \ncovered. We are saying in this, and the House position says: If you \nactually loan the money--if you are GMAC, if you are some other \nfinanciers up the street, you are under the CFPB. If you are simply the \nretail storefront, which is what the auto dealers are, you are not \ncovered under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You are not \ncovered if you are just the storefront arm of this, but 100 percent of \nthe loans are covered.\n  If you are an auto dealer and you make the actual loan yourself and \nit is your money you are lending, you are covered under the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. If you are simply the storefront operation \nout here doing this, you are not covered.\n  The auto dealers are asking for this. They do not want the additional \ncost and burden of this regulation on them. They are the quintessential \nMain Street business throughout the country. There is not a single auto \ndealer on Wall Street--none of them, not one. You can go up there today \nand try to buy a car and you cannot get one.\n  These are Main Street businesses, and they took it on the chin last \nyear. We lost, last year alone, 1,700 dealerships across America \nresulting in the loss of approximately 88,000 jobs. Why would we want \nto put a duplicative set of regulations on top of them that are already \ncovered upstream and they have already had these sorts of losses and \ndifficulties in a Main Street business?\n  We need people to create 88,000 jobs, not to eliminate or lose 88,000 \njobs. Franchised auto dealers are the retail outlets. They are the \nstorefronts that process the paperwork for various well-known brands \nwith large financial arms. Under the House provision that my motion \ninstructs us to recede to, these financial arms would still be \nregulated, but the dealers who process the paperwork would not.\n  Additionally, even if my motion is agreed to, auto dealers would \nstill be regulated by the FTC and various State laws, so consumers \nwould still have protections to ensure the truth in lending still \napplies.\n  In fact, I have a couple of pages here of regs--excuse me, of \nregulatory entities that auto dealers still apply to. I ask unanimous \nconsent this list be printed at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to also point out what typically happens. This \nis a letter I am going to read from the Dale Willey auto dealership in \nKansas. Dale Willey, the auto dealership in Kansas, said this about the \nfinancing that happens. I am reading from this:\n\n       Each month we have 3 to 5 buyers who tell our financial \n     service members--\n\n  There are three to five people coming in, telling our financial \nservice managers:\n\n     if our dealership can match or beat their bank's or credit \n     union's interest rate, they will then finance through our \n     dealership. To match the buyer's offer of rate terms simply \n     provides a convenience to our buyers. To offer a better term \n     and/or at a better rate enhances the buyer's savings by doing \n     business with our dealership.\n\n  In other words, this is a competitive situation that typically people \ngo into.\n  I will read again from the letter:\n\n       We have buyers also who are unable to secure a loan through \n     their normal bank, credit union or lender, and yet we are \n     able to submit the buyer's application to several of our \n     lenders with which we have agreements, discovering that one \n     or more are willing to make these loans to this buyer. Not \n     only does this provide a convenience to the buyer, but it \n     truly allows the buyer to secure a better level and lower \n     operating cost vehicle than provided by their older current \n     vehicle.\n\n  This is a competitive situation. It also positions people so that \nsometimes they are able to get loans they could not get on their own.\n  I want to address as well another situation that has come up in this \ndebate that people have raised: that this protection is needed for \nmilitary personnel in particular. A couple of weeks ago the Senate \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Brown \nof Massachusetts that creates the Office of Service Member Affairs at \nthe CFPB.\n  My motion that we are voting on today, instructs the current \nregulatory authorities to work with this office when they detect abuses \nby auto dealers. So we are saying, if you detect an abuse by auto \ndealers, then this should be worked on particularly by the CFPB and \nthis office of servicemember affairs.\n  I recently received a letter from the Under Secretary of the Army for \nPersonnel and Readiness, Clifford Stanley. In it he writes this:\n\n       DOD would welcome and encourage CFPA protection for \n     servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices, provided such \n     protections would not limit access to legitimate products.\n\n  That is exactly what motion does. Military personnel would have \nstrong protections by the CFPB but without the adverse effect of \nlimiting their access to credit. If you want to protect the military \nand maintain all their options for buying a car, you should vote in \nfavor of this motion.\n  I point out these matters because there has been a lot of discussion \nand debate going on about the auto dealers amendment throughout the \nproceedings of this entire bill, which has gone on for some period of \ntime. This makes sense to do this the way the House did it. It makes \nsense for us to move forward with this motion to recede to the House \nposition.\n  The House has established this position. They have thought it \nthrough, and 100 percent of auto loans will still be covered. It is \njust the auto dealership will not be the one that is covered, the \nupstream financer will, unless the auto dealership is loaning their own \nmoney, and then they will be covered.\n  If you are concerned about military personnel, there is a particular \ndirection in here regarding military personnel. Again, any loans are \ncovered. It is the upstream position that is covered, and it is where \nit should be. That is the actual person or group that is making the \nloan. That is the one that should be covered.\n  Instead of putting an additional burden on dealerships that have \nalready lost lots of jobs, we are saying: No, let us recede to the \nHouse position.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I urge my colleagues to vote yes \non the Brownback motion to recede to the House position.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Legal & Regulatory Group, National Automobile Dealers \n           Association, McLean, VA.\n\n   Federal Consumer Protection Regulations Applicable to Automobile \n                     Dealers' Financial Operations\n\n       1.

Mr. President, the Restoring American Financial \nStability Act is supposed to regulate Wall Street, not Main Street. It \nis Wall Street whose greed brought us the economic crisis. That is why \nI am voting for the Brownback motion to instruct conferees to support \nthe House provision regarding the regulation of auto dealers.\n  We need a tough financial reform bill that focuses on the abuses that \nled to the economic crash. This bill is intended to primarily regulate \nmajor institutions that deal nationally and globally and to improve \ngovernment coordination to ensure that there is an early warning and an \nearly response system in place to prevent a future crisis like the one \nwe were faced with in 2008. Automobile dealers were not part of the \nproblem that led us to where we are today and therefore should not be \nsubject to this legislation.\n  We must make sure that laws that are already on the books are being \nimplemented and enforced. Under current law, car dealers are subject to \nextensive Federal regulation. Dealers' retail financing activity is \nregulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade \nCommission, and car dealers are subject to tough Federal laws, \nincluding the Truth in Lending Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. \nThose laws must be enforced. Predatory lending practices must be \nstopped, and there are tools in place to do so.\n  I believe that auto dealers are best regulated by State and local \nconsumer protection agencies. Main Street should be regulated by people \nwho are closer to its daily activities. Governors and attorneys general \nmust make sure that consumers are protected from bad actors. The \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau should focus on Wall Street, not \nMain Street, and should not be used to increase unnecessary regulations \non small businesses.\n  During debate on the Brownback amendment, it became clear that the \nmen and women of our military have been targeted by unscrupulous auto \ndealers. This is an outrage. I never want to see our military personnel \nbeing taken advantage of. Our service men and women have dedicated \ntheir lives to this country, and we have a responsibility to make sure \nthey, and their families, are treated with respect and that we do \neverything we can to reduce their increasing stress. That is why I \nvoted to create an Office of Service Member Affairs within the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to educate the men and women of our \nmilitary, and their families, to make better informed financial \ndecisions and to strengthen coordination of consumer protections for \nmembers of our military. We must crack down on those who are taking \nadvantage of our military families and communities. However, I do not \nthink we need a new regulatory structure to do so. A Washington \nregulatory agency is not the best suited to regulate outside of \nmilitary bases in Maryland or North Carolina.\n  As I said on the floor when we began debate of this bill, now is our \nopportunity to pass real financial reform that puts in place the \nstrongest consumer financial protections and ensures the greed of Wall \nStreet doesn't trump the needs of Main Street. That is why I support \nthe House provision on the regulation of auto dealers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains for my friend from \nKansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 56 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that Sam Brownback \nand I are good friends. We have a different point of view in this \nmatter. But that in no way at all should be reflected in our \nrelationship with each other, as we have served together for many \nyears. I fundamentally disagree with him about this.\n  Instructing conferees is an interesting motion in many ways. As we \nwill be going to conference with the other body, I will be delighted to \nlisten to these various ideas. But this is a matter which does deserve \nto be protected.\n  First of all, let me say that when it comes to automobile dealers, \nthey are no different than community banks or other financial \ninstitutions; the overwhelming majority are good people and do a good \njob. But we do not pass laws in this country because a majority of the \npeople commit crimes. We pass laws for the minority who can abuse their \nrelationship with customers or with people. That is no different in \nthis particular case at all.\n  So this is not about whether you like automobile dealers or do not \nlike them. The simple question is: The second largest purchase that \nmost Americans make is the purchase of an automobile. We do not buy \nstocks. We do not buy fancy institutions and so forth. We buy a home \nand we buy an automobile, and they are expensive undertakings.\n  So the question is very simply: We have established in our \nlegislation, for the first time in the history of our country, a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau that will watch out for the \naverage American citizen when it comes to financial practices. We have \na Consumer Product Safety Commission. We have the Food and Drug \nAdministration which protects you against products that you ingest, so \nyou have some ability to respond if they do you harm.\n  If you buy a lawn mower or you buy any other consumer product, we \nhave a place you can go to get a recall when that product does injury \nor could do injury to you. Yet we have no place in this country, where \nyou can be ruined by a financial product, to get you any redress.\n  So this legislation, for the first time in our Nation's history, \nestablishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to watch out for bad \nmortgages, car loans, watch out for other financial activities in which \nthe average individual may engage.\n  As I said, one of the most principal activities that people engage in \nas consumers is the purchase of an automobile. So we are trying to \nprotect people. If we are going to say to community banks and to credit \nunions and other financial institutions: You must comply with these \nrules, they will be\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nenforced at the local level. But you have a community bank on one \ncorner, a credit union on the other corner and a car dealer on the \nthird corner and all three would like to compete for that business. To \nthe credit union and the community bank we say: You have to comply with \nrules that protect consumers. But you, Mr. Auto Dealer over here, you \ndo not have to do that. You can go off and do exactly as you want.\n  That is a mistake and why we have insisted that these provisions \ninclude automobile dealers. So I rise in opposition to this proposal.\n  A lot is said in this body about our men and women who serve in \nuniform. We all believe that, just as those heroes stand for us every \nsingle day, in bodies such as this we ought to stand for them. I wish \nto focus my remarks on what happens to men and women in uniform today \nbecause it is that constituency alone that ought to be reason to defeat \nthis motion.\n  As we considered financial reform, then, we strove to heed the words \nof groups such as the Military Coalition, a consortium of over 30 \nnationally prominent military and veterans organizations, representing \nmore than 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and their \nfamilies, including such groups as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nNational Guard Association, the Military Officers Association, the \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart, and many others.\n  All these groups have written a letter in which they say, in part: \nThe most significant financial obligation for the majority of \nservicemembers is auto financing.\n  It is also the place where servicemembers are most likely to be taken \nadvantage of. Recently, the New York Times reported on one case, that \nof Matthew Garcia, a 25-year-old Army specialist who was recently \nsubjected to a trick called yo-yo financing by an unscrupulous car \ndealer, just as he was preparing to deploy for Afghanistan.\n  According to the story in the press, Specialist Garcia, stationed at \nFort Hood, TX, bought an automobile at a used car lot, signed up for a \nloan at a 19.9 percent interest rate. That would be bad enough, but \nthat is not the worst of it, the high rate of interest. The problem \ncame when Specialist Garcia drove the car home.\n  The dealer called Specialist Garcia several days later to say the \nfinancing contract had actually fallen through and demanded an \nadditional $2,500 in cash from Specialist Garcia. To make sure he paid \nup, the dealer blocked the soldier's car so no one could leave.\n  That is the way some--a few but some--auto dealers are treating our \nmen and women in uniform. It is not enough that I tell you this story \nor one story in the press account. Under Secretary of Defense Stanley--\nin fact, my good friend, Senator Brownback, quoted from the letter from \nClifford Stanley. But listen to the operative sentence in the letter \nfrom Under Secretary Stanley:\n\n       The Department's position as stated in my letter to \n     Assistant Secretary Barr remains unchanged. The Department of \n     Defense would welcome and encourage the CFPA protections for \n     Servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices provided such \n     protections would not limit access to legitimate products.\n\n  Which they do not at all. So we are hearing from Under Secretary of \nDefense Stanley, in which he says: ``Bait and switch'' financing, \nfalsification of loan applications, failure to pay off liens on trade-\nin vehicles, ``packing'' loans with items whose price bears little, if \nany, relationship to their real cost, and discriminatory lending are \nthe kinds of problems members of our Armed Forces and their families \nface when dealing with financing their cars with car dealers.\n  In fact, Secretary Stanley reports that 72 percent of military \ncounselors and attorneys surveyed had cited problems with auto dealer \nabuses in just the past 6 months alone, 72 percent cited it as a major \nproblem. The Department of Defense is telling us that our men and women \nin uniform are at risk of being ripped off, as they are every single \nday.\n  That is why, of course, we adopted, 98 to 1, by the way, the \namendment offered by Scott Brown, our colleague from Massachusetts, and \nJack Reed, our colleague from Rhode Island. That amendment said we must \nhave an office of servicemember affairs in the consumer bureau. Why did \nwe establish that office there? What is the principal obligation that \nthese service men and women get into that causes so much difficulty? It \nis automobiles sales. That is why we put it in.\n  What an irony it would be that we vote 98 to 1 to say we ought to \nestablish that office within the consumer financial bureau and then \nturn around and adopt the Brownback amendment or insist upon it in a \nconference report, which basically exempts every one of these auto \ndealers from having to comply with the consumer protection laws. That \nwould be an irony beyond ironies in a way, to on one hand say: We want \nto help you and protect you and then, on the other hand, take away the \nmajor organizations out there that do the most damage to them.\n  The Brownback motion would steal away this protection from our Armed \nForces by creating a loophole for the exact sector of the financial \nservices industry in which servicemembers are most vulnerable, and that \nis in auto sales. Let me be clear. All of us have relationships with \nauto dealers. I have a wonderful relationship with the people in my \nState of Connecticut whom I have worked closely with over the years.\n  All of us support those businesses. As I said at the outset of these \nremarks, the overwhelming majority of them do a good job and do not \nengage in unscrupulous behavior. But the laws are not written for the \nmany, they are written for the few out there who do take advantage of \nthese young men and women.\n\n  As we know from the evidence supplied by our military organizations \nand others who have written, rarely do they ever get involved in a \nmatter such as a Banking Committee matter, to have the Under Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Army, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Order of the Purple Heart, and the \nOfficers Association, all of them, 30 organizations saying: Do not do \nthis.\n  Yet we are about to turn around and undo the efforts we have made to \nsee to it that these young men and women, whom we all talk about in \nMemorial Day speeches, and so forth--what a great job they do for our \ncountry, and then turn around, in the one area they get taken to the \ncleaners on day after day, which is in this one particular area, and to \nexempt them entirely from the consideration of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  The community bankers oppose this. The credit unions oppose this as \nwell. They want a level playing field. They would like to compete for \nthat business. They have to comply with the rules. How can you turn \naround and say to that community bank or that credit union: You have to \nlive with these rules, but the guy on the other corner does not have to \ndo so. How is that fair when it comes to financing, as I said have \nsaid, the second largest purchase that anyone would make, that most \npeople make in their lives?\n  So it is unfair, it seems to me, to have two sets of rules for the \nsame product. That is what we would be doing if this amendment were \nadopted, and, of course, the conferees were required to insist upon \nsupporting language in the House bill. Military leaders such as Michael \nDonley, the Secretary of the Air Force, support this approach because, \nin his words:\n\n       Protection from unprincipled automobile lending enables our \n     Airmen to concentrate on their primary mission--to fly, fight \n     and win in air, space, and cyberspace.\n\n  Advocates such as Holly Petraeus, wife of GEN David Petraeus, the \ndirector of the Better Business program for military families, at a \npress conference, strongly supports the protections we have in this \nbill. They know the hardships military families face and believe it \nshould not be compounded by shady lenders.\n  By the way, it is not just our servicemembers who suffer from lending \nabuse in this sector as well. There is a long and sad history of racial \ndiscrimination in auto lending. For example, African-American borrowers \nwho are charged more than 2.5 times the amount in subjective rate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on the motion has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute and provide \n1 additional minute for my friend from Kansas as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me, if I can, because my friend from Kansas cited this, \nabout separating out the financing from the lenders. There was a court \ncase. Listen to what one of these witnesses, involved in that \ndistinction, had to say. Some argue that auto dealer financing \noperations are not the lenders, they are merely processing the \npaperwork.\n  According to court testimony of a former finance and insurance \nmanager from a Tennessee auto dealer:\n\n       The standard industry practice is to prepare the financing \n     documents so that the customer is not alerted in any manner \n     that the person with whom he is dealing has the ability to \n     control the customer's price of credit. This allows the \n     finance arranger to present himself as the ally of the \n     customer, which further relaxes and disarms the customer. The \n     nature of the transaction creates the perfect opportunity for \n     a dealer to obtain a large kickback from an unsuspecting \n     customer by subjectively inflating their interest rates.\n\n  This is not a time to do so much damage, in my view, to these young \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters we have from the various \nmilitary organizations in opposition to the Brownback amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                               Bankers of America',\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2010.\n     Hon.

Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: On behalf of the \n     Independent Community Bankers of America and its nearly 5,000 \n     member banks, I write to oppose Sen. Brownback's amendments \n     SA 3789 and SA 3790 to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010 to exempt most automobile dealers from \n     the jurisdiction of the proposed Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n       ICBA believes the CFPB should be focused on the under-\n     regulated financial services providers rather than highly-\n     regulated community banks. When automobile dealers offer \n     financing to customers--generally as a conduit for \n     manufacturers' captive finance arms--the dealers provide \n     consumers loans and leases that are second only to home \n     mortgages in importance to most families. Yet, their \n     financing activities are not subjected to the same level of \n     regulatory scrutiny as the auto lending activities of \n     community banks. Exempting automobile dealers would create a \n     gaping loophole in the CFPB and would give automobile \n     dealers--as well as the manufacturers' captive finance arms \n     that provide financing through them--a competitive advantage \n     over community banks and reduce consumer choice in auto \n     loans.\n       I urge you to oppose exemptions to the CFPB for non-\n     depository lenders, including automobile dealers.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R.

Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: The Military \n     Coalition, a consortium of nationally prominent military and \n     veterans organizations, representing more than 5.5 million \n     current and former servicemembers and their families and \n     survivors, would like to express our opposition to Senator \n     Brownback's amendment to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010. Senator Brownback's amendment would \n     exclude auto dealers and their lending practices from the \n     financial reform bill.\n       The most significant financial obligation for the majority \n     of servicemembers is auto financing. Including the auto \n     dealers financing and sales in the financial reform bill will \n     provide greater protections for our servicemembers and their \n     families.\n       Providing a ``carve-out'' for auto dealers does just the \n     opposite--it will allow unscrupulous dealers to continue to \n     take advantage of servicemembers and their families.\n       In a recent letter from the Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Personnel and Readiness (USD P) to the Department of the \n     Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions \n     (attached), Dr. Clifford Stanley states that the Department \n     of Defense would welcome protections provided to \n     servicemembers and their families with regard to unscrupulous \n     automobile sales and financing practices.\n       Additionally, Dr. Stanley highlights the extent of the \n     problem in a recent informal polling of installation \n     attorneys and personal financial managers/counselors. Of the \n     659 counselors and attorneys who responded, 72% stated that \n     they counseled servicemembers in the past six months on one \n     or more unscrupulous practices (e.g., ``bait and switch'' \n     financing, falsification of loan documents, failure to pay-\n     off liens, and ``packing loans'') when covering auto \n     financing with their client.\n       Again, the Coalition wishes to reiterate our collective \n     opposition to any ``carve-out'' of auto dealership financing \n     from the financial reform bill and we thank you for your \n     attention to this important issue impacting military members \n     and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, \n           Air Force Women Officers Associated, American Logistics \n           Association, AMVETS (American Veterans), Army Aviation \n           Association of America, Association of Military \n           Surgeons of the United States, Association of the \n           United States Army, Association of the United States \n           Navy, Chief Warrant Officer and Warrant Officer \n           Association, U.S. Coast Guard, Commissioned Officers \n           Association of the U.S. Public Health Service, Inc., \n           Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n           United States, Fleet Reserve Association, Gold Star \n           Wives of America, Inc., Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of \n           America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of \n           America, Marine Corps League, Military Chaplains \n           Association of the United States of America, Military \n           Officers Association of America, Military Order of the \n           Purple Heart, National Guard Association of the United \n           States, National Military Family Association, National \n           Order of Battlefield Commissions, Naval Enlisted \n           Reserve Association, Non Commissioned Officers \n           Association, Reserve Enlisted Association of the United \n           States, Society of Medical Consultants to the Armed \n           Forces, The Retired Enlisted Association, United States \n           Army Warrant Officers Association, United States Coast \n           Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, Veterans of \n           Foreign Wars of the United States.\n\n           \n                                  ____\n                                                     May 19, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to voice our opposition to the \n     modified version of Senator Brownback's Amendment #3789, \n     which would exempt auto dealers from the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau. The changes made to the amendment do \n     nothing to stop automobile dealers from engaging in \n     fraudulent or abusive practices. Instead, the revised \n     amendment provides financial education for military families \n     who are targeted by unscrupulous dealers with these tactics.\n       While good financial counseling can help consumers make \n     smart purchasing decisions, it is no substitute for \n     vigorously enforcing the law to prevent unfair and deceptive \n     practices. In fact, the modified Brownback Amendment #3789 \n     would shift the burden onto the military and individual \n     Service members to avoid being defrauded by car dealers, \n     rather than protecting our troops and all Americans with a \n     new consumer agency that polices auto dealer financing and \n     enforces already existing consumer protection laws.\n       Senator Brownback's modification requires the Federal \n     Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission--two agencies that \n     to date have failed to adequately protect consumers from \n     abusive auto lending practices--to work with the Office of \n     Service Member Affairs to ensure that ``Service members and \n     their families are educated and empowered to make better \n     informed decisions regarding consumer financial products and \n     services offered by motor vehicle dealers.'' However, many of \n     the scams perpetrated on our troops cannot be eliminated \n     through education, since fraud by its very nature is designed \n     to deceive and is often perpetrated without the consumer's \n     knowledge or awareness. For example, some car dealers engage \n     in ``powerbooking,'' a scam in which the victim does not have \n     access to the documents the dealer submits to the finance \n     company and therefore has no knowledge of the phantom add-ons \n     the auto dealer claims are part of the vehicle. Some dealers \n     falsify loan applications, in which case the victim does not \n     have access to the loan documents that falsifies pay stubs \n     and statements of income. In another scam, the auto dealer \n     promises to pay off the lien on the victim's trade-in at the \n     time of sale, but does not, so the consumer is unknowingly \n     left with the responsibility to pay off the new car as well \n     as the car that was traded in. There is no way for the victim \n     to know in advance that the dealer doesn't intend to pay off \n     the lien. Senator Brownback's modified amendment would do \n     nothing to stop these abuses.\n       The modified Brownback Amendment maintains the status quo \n     that has failed to adequately protect U.S. troops and the \n     American consumer from auto scams up until now. The Office of \n     Service Member Affairs would in no way have the authority to \n     actually require the Federal Reserve to issue meaningful new \n     rules and/or require the FTC to enforce the already existing \n     rules.\n       We urge the Senate to vote no on the Brownback auto dealer \n     exemption.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fleet Reserve Association.\n     Military Officers Association of America.\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     Navy Marine Corps Relief Society.\n     Center for Responsible Lending.\n     Consumer Federation of America.\n     National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n     National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n     clients).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Credit Union\n\n\n                                         National Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2010.\n     Hon.

Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: On behalf of \n     the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), I am writing in \n     opposition to the Brownback amendments (SA 3789 and SA 3790) \n     to S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act, \n     which would exempt auto dealers from the bill. CUNA is the \n     largest credit union advocacy organization in the United \n     States, representing nearly 90 percent of America's 7,800 \n     state and federally chartered credit unions and their 92 \n     million members.\n       As we have said from the beginning of this debate, \n     consumers of financial products provided by unregulated \n     entities need greater protections. One of the ways that the \n     legislation seeks to provide these greater protections is \n     through the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial \n     Protection (BCFP), which is intended to be the exclusive \n     federal rulemaking entity for laws designed to protect \n     consumers of financial products. Excluding any non-depository \n     institution provider of financial products, including auto \n     dealers, from the rules promulgated by the BCFP would defeat \n     the purpose of creating the new consumer regulator, would put \n     credit unions at a competitive disadvantage in the new \n     regulatory regime, and could cause confusion for consumers of \n     financial products.\n       We encourage the Senate to reject amendments, including the \n     Brownback amendments, which would upset the balance of the \n     consumer protection title by exempting any currently \n     unregulated providers of financial services from the Bureau's \n     rules.\n       On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you very much \n     for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Daniel A. Mica,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Secretary of the Army,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing regarding the legislation \n     before the Senate which would establish the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) and delineate the limits \n     of its authority.\n       I understand that an amendment may soon be introduced that \n     would exempt automobile dealerships from any financial \n     oversight under the CFPA. The Army would have strong concerns \n     with any such amendments.\n       Over the years, many of our Soldiers have fallen victim to \n     predatory lending practices and have entered into contracts \n     for prohibitively expensive financial products promoted by \n     some unscrupulous car dealerships and lenders. Though the \n     Army does educate our Soldiers about buying cars in our \n     normal financial education curriculum, the fact remains that \n     junior enlisted Soldiers--many of whom are drawing a regular \n     paycheck for the first time in their lives and are \n     inexperienced in financial matters--remain an easy target for \n     dishonest brokers. We owe them the protection and oversight \n     that would be afforded by the CFPA.\n       In an era of persistent conflict and multiple deployments, \n     our Soldiers and their Families are under increasing stress. \n     In surveys conducted by the Department of Defense, finances \n     rank among the primary causes of stress for most military \n     Families. As auto loans are often the most significant \n     financial obligations of our Soldiers--particularly within \n     the junior enlisted grades--we believe that greater \n     government oversight of auto financing and sales for our \n     Soldiers will help protect them and reduce unnecessary \n     financial strain on our already overburdened Army Families.\n       Soldiers who are distracted by financial issues at home are \n     not fully focused on fighting the enemy, thereby decreasing \n     mission readiness. Protection from unprincipled auto lending \n     enables our Soldiers to concentrate on their primary \n     mission--protecting our great Nation.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our Soldiers and \n     their Families.\n           Sincerely,\n     John M. McHugh.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR)--the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy \n     organization in the United States--I urge you to oppose \n     Senator Carper's (D-DE) Amendment #3949 to the ``Restoring \n     American Financial Security Act of 2010'' (S. 3217). \n     Amendment #3949 undermines sustainable and meaningful \n     consumer protection. We call on the Senate to vote for \n     ordinary families who benefit from having extra cops on the \n     beat, rather than for banks seeking to avoid enforcement for \n     violations of consumer protection, equal credit, and fair \n     lending laws.\n       Communities of color have been hit hard by predatory \n     lending in all forms. Now our families are struggling with \n     rising household debt, record-high foreclosure rates, and the \n     erosion of their financial safety net. They need a strong \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to level the \n     playing field by enforcing our nation's consumer protection \n     laws. Moreover, since individuals will not have a right to \n     enforce the CFPB rules themselves, they will need law \n     enforcement, including their state attorneys general, to \n     enforce the rules.\n       The Carper amendment raises two serious concerns:\n       1. Attorney General Enforcement--The amendment takes state \n     cops off the predatory lending beat, weakening the already \n     compromised enforcement provisions in the bill. It would \n     prevent state attorneys general from enforcing CFPB rules \n     against national banks and federal thrifts and could weaken \n     their ability to enforce other laws. Under another provision \n     of the bill, the CFPB will have no enforcement authority \n     against 98% of banks, making it that much more critical that \n     attorneys general be able to enforce the federal rules on \n     behalf of the state's residents. This amendment would leave \n     enforcement for most banks entirely up to bank regulators, \n     whose lax enforcement led to this crisis in the first place.\n       2. State Law Preemption--The amendment would prevent states \n     from addressing new bank abuses not yet covered by federal \n     protection before they spread nationally. It would remove a \n     critical provision that requires the Office of the \n     Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to consider whether a state \n     law addresses problems not covered by federal law before it \n     gives banks a free pass to ignore that law. The Senate \n     compromise provision in the bill already gives the OCC, an \n     agency with a history of open hostility to consumer \n     protection, far too much power to wipe out state consumer \n     protection laws. The provision should not be weakened \n     further.\n       States are first responders that can stop local abuses from \n     spreading to become a national problem. Their laws are most \n     important when there is a gap in federal law. Moreover, \n     before bringing an enforcement action, attorneys general \n     already must consult with the CFPB and bank regulators, and \n     the CFPB may intervene or clarify its rules, ensuring \n     consistency in enforcement standards.\n       Anyone who violates the law should be held accountable. Do \n     not give banks that violate specific CFPB rules a special \n     pass against vigilant enforcement. Should you have any \n     questions, please contact Graciela Aponte, Wealth-Building \n     Legislative Analyst.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Janet Murguia,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, well, if this motion to instruct did \nwhat Senator Dodd had suggested, I would probably vote against it as \nwell. It does not.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut, who is obviously a great \npersuader, does a great job, and whom I share a great friendship with \nand great admiration for and who has served this body very well.\n  The problem is, if we have three places sitting here--we have a \ncommunity banker, we have a credit union, and we have an auto dealer--\nall three are still covered. They are all three still covered if they \nmake the loan. If they originate, if they make the loan, they put the \nmoney out there, all three are covered.\n  What we are saying in this motion is, if it is your money that you \nare loaning, you are covered. But if you are simply writing paper or \ntrying to help someone upstream and options for the person who is \ncoming in and you are saying: We have option A, B or C, from this \ncredit union, from that bank or from GMAC, whichever it may be, they \nare not covered.\n  The authors of the bill want to put belts and suspenders on auto \nfinancing. Why would we double regulate in this particular area when we \nare already going to have the cost and the burden of doing it? And on \ntop of all that, we already have a set of regulations in this field.\n  My colleague talked about yo-yo and bait-and-switch financing. They \nare illegal at the State level now. State attorneys general are going \nafter these people now, and they should, particularly if it targets \nmilitary personnel. That person who walks into a dealership in my State \nor some other State\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nwill be covered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is \ngoing to be at an upstream location, but it is covered. One hundred \npercent of them are covered. Why would we put this extra cost and \nexpense on the retail operation that is not loaning the money? They are \nnot doing this.\n  If my colleagues are concerned about this area, do this. If they are \nconcerned about having overregulation and overreach by Washington, \nsupport my motion. The loan is still covered, and we are not having \nthis double coverage of belts and suspenders on auto loans that is \ngoing to hurt the ability of people to get loans, and it is going to \ndrive up the cost of auto financing. It is going to hurt Main Street \nbusinesses that we lost 1,700 of last year and that lost us 88,000 \njobs. I thought this bill was targeted at Wall Street, not at Main \nStreet where we didn't have this problem going on. We haven't had this \nproblem within auto loans as far as causing the financial meltdown. The \nregulation is already there. The regulation will be there. This extra \nregulation is not needed.\n  I ask my colleagues to support Main Street on this one. Support the \nlocal auto dealers out there, those who are working with the community, \ntrying to help the community thrive and survive, instead of putting a \ndouble dose of regulation on top of them that is going to hurt the \nbusiness, hurt auto sales, hurt financing opportunities.\n  I urge support for the Brownback motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. DODD. All time has expired on Brownback?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I call up the Hutchison-Hagan motion to instruct \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                      Motion to instruct conferees\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 4173 (the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act) be instructed to \n     insist that the final conference report ensure that \n     proprietary trading restrictions do not prevent insurance \n     company affiliates of depository institutions from engaging \n     in such trading as part of the ordinary business of \n     insurance, especially insurance company affiliates serving \n     military service members and their families, as such \n     restrictions would result in higher costs and significant \n     inconveniences to those sacrificing in service to our \n     country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask to be notified at the end of 5 minutes so I may \nyield the floor to Senator Hagan for the rest of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Hutchison-Hagan motion to instruct \nis trying to narrow the definition that falls under the Volcker rule \nand the underlying bill. I believe our amendment would have passed \noverwhelmingly if we had been able to get it up before cloture was \ninvoked. I appreciate there was a lot going on last week, but this is \nthe way we hope to be able to assure that our amendment is a part of \nthe final bill. The Volcker rule contained in the measure before us \nseeks to restrict or ban risky proprietary trading at depository \ninstitutions. As currently written, the rule brings about some \nunintended consequences that could be disastrous for our financial \nsystem and to a special class of customers--American service men and \nwomen. The major problem with the current language is that its reach \nextends beyond the bounds of the depository institution to a bank's \naffiliates and subsidiaries, including insurance companies. For \ndiversified financial institutions that serve as one-stop shops of \nbanking and insurance products, especially those serving our military \nservice men and women and their families, the extension of the Volcker \nrule's proprietary trading restrictions to a depository institution's \ninsurance company affiliates threatens their ability to address the \nspecial financial needs of the U.S. military community. The Hutchison-\nHagan motion to instruct conferees seeks to ensure that the Volcker \nrule's proprietary trading restrictions do not extend to the normal \noperations of insurance affiliates of insured depository institutions \nso that we can preserve convenient access to the full spectrum of \nfinancial services for the U.S. military community.\n  It is important to note that the proprietary trading that insurance \nentities engage in is significantly different from the proprietary \ntrading that is the target of the Volcker rule.\n  First, insurance companies use premiums to fund trades, not customer \ndeposits. Thus, insurers are trading their own funds, not those of \ndepositors. Insurance company trades are generally low risk, focus on \nlong-term payment of claims and profitability, and are already heavily \nregulated by State insurance regulators. Simply put: Proprietary \ntrading is essential to the life insurance and property and casualty \ninsurance business. Proprietary trading is what allows insurers to \noffer annuities and other insurance products that can protect consumers \nin the long term.\n  The motion to instruct is narrowly drafted. We have worked with the \nmajority staff as well as the minority staff of the Banking Committee \nto assure that the drafting is in line with what we all intend to do. \nIt doesn't speak to the Volcker rule's impact on depository \ninstitutions at all. It merely seeks to allow regulated insurance \nentities to continue to operate as they currently do in a manner that \nensures payment of claims and annuities for years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Hagan motion. We have \nworked on this for several weeks together. I believe this bipartisan \nmotion to instruct will be overwhelmingly approved because so many \npeople have heard from their constituents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of \nAmerica, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Naval Enlisted \nReserve Association, and the TIAA CREF, a national financial services \norganization dedicated to serving the financial needs of those who work \nin the academic, medical, and cultural fields, all in support of our \namendment and our motion to instruct.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United \n           States of America,\n                                           Selma, TX, May 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: I write on \n     behalf of the Non Commissioned Officers Association of the \n     United States of America (NCOA), representing active duty, \n     enlisted service members of all military services, the United \n     States Coast Guard, associated Guard and Reserve Forces, \n     retirees and veterans of all components. NCOA has strong \n     concerns regarding the impact of the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010's (S. 3217) ``Volcker Rule'' \n     provisions on NCOA members and for that matter, the entire \n     U.S. military community.\n       NCOA is dedicated to providing for service members and \n     their families through every stage of their military career \n     from enlistment to eventual separation, retirement and \n     continuing to provide services to veterans' surviving family \n     members. We understand and respect the achievements and \n     sacrifices made by all service members and their families and \n     are committed to ensuring that the military community has \n     access to the ``one stop shop'' providers of financial \n     services necessary to address their unique banking and \n     insurance needs. This ease of access to essential financial \n     resources is crucial to minimize the financial stresses and \n     other burdens accompanying military life.\n       S. 3217's Volcker Rule, as currently proposed, threatens \n     this essential access to one stop shop providers of financial \n     services for NCOA members and their families. Limiting thc \n     provision's proprietary trading restrictions by excluding the \n     insurance affiliates of insured depository institutions is \n     necessary to maintain access to financial products and \n     services that meet the unique needs of the military \n     community. Making this small change to the Volcker Rule \n     language will ensure that the financial stability of enlisted \n     service members and their families is not put in jeopardy. \n     Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this issue and \n     its\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n     impact on NCOA members and the entire U.S. military \n     community.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           H.

AFSA has strong concerns regarding the impact of the \n     so called ``Volcker Rule'' provisions in the American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. 3217, on AFSA members and \n     the entire enlisted military community.\n       AFSA members and their families have made many sacrifices \n     in order to invest their lives in the cause of freedom. They \n     require access to ``one stop shop'' providers of financial \n     services to address their unique banking and insurance needs. \n     Ease of access to essential financial resources is \n     particularly crucial today as our American military community \n     faces the financial stresses and other burdens accompanying \n     multiple deployments and frequent and costly relocations \n     during times of active conflict. S. 3217's Volcker Rule \n     provisions, as currently drafted, will prevent financial \n     services providers from offering both banking and insurance \n     products to AFSA members and their families tailored to their \n     specific financial needs.\n       Making a small change to the bill's current language to \n     ensure the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading restrictions \n     are not extended to the insurance affiliates of insured \n     depository institutions would allow one stop shop providers \n     of financial products and services to continue meeting the \n     unique needs of the military community.

Keniry,\n                      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to \ninstruct offered by my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. I thank \nthe Senator from Texas for her leadership on this issue of importance \nto members of the military in our States and across the country. \nSection 619 of the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 \nbans certain activities not only at depository institutions but also at \nbank affiliates, including insurance affiliates. In doing so, section \n619 inadvertently jeopardizes access to the important financial \nresources offered by diversified financial institutions to service men \nand women and their families. Section 619 bans proprietary trading, but \nproprietary trading by insurance entities is significantly different \nthan the risk that comes with banks' proprietary trading. Insurance \ncompanies use premiums to trade funds, not the consumer deposits that \nthis provision targets. Insurance trades are generally low risk and \nfocus on long-term payment of claims and are already heavily regulated \nby State insurance regulators.\n  Servicemembers and their families rely on the ability of diversified \nfinancial service firms to provide both insurance and banking services \nunder one roof. I am concerned that section 619 may force military \nmembers to change their current financial service providers and \npossibly subject the service men and women to unnecessary cost and \nburdens. That is why Senator Hutchison and I have worked for several \nweeks to correct this oversight, and why I introduced amendment 3799 \nwith Senators Hutchison, Carper, Cornyn, Begich, Webb, Burr, and \nIsakson. Amendment 3799 was a narrow change that addressed the issue. \nTo my knowledge, it was not opposed by anyone. While amendment 3799 was \nnot voted on, Senator Hutchison's motion to instruct provides clear \nguidance to the conferees to ensure that proprietary trading \nrestrictions do not prevent insurance company affiliates of depository \ninstitutions from engaging in such trading as part of the ordinary \nbusiness of insurance.\n  It is critical that we adopt this motion so that diversified \nfinancial institutions may continue to provide low-cost and convenient \naccess to diversified financial services for those sacrificing in \nservice to our country. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this \nmotion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend both of my colleagues, Senator \nHutchison and Senator Hagan, my good friends from Texas and North \nCarolina. They have done a great job and deserve our thanks for the \nwork they have put into this proposal. I am supportive of the motion to \ninstruct. As a conferee, I will have something to say about this, I \npresume, in the conference. I thank them for their efforts. They have \nlaid this out pretty well. I don't need to take a lot of time. I have \nsome further remarks that lay out why I think this is a good proposal. \nI appreciate very much their efforts in this regard.\n  I am prepared to yield back time on this matter and urge colleagues \nto support the Hutchison-Hagan motion to the financial reform package. \nIt is a good proposal, one that deserves all of our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee. He has been supportive of this amendment from the \nbeginning. Senator Hagan and I can say that we have regularly \ncommunicated with the chairman, and maybe he would even consider that \nwe have hounded him to death. But nevertheless, I know he was helping \nus all along. We worked on the drafting to assure that the language met \nboth the minority and majority requirements. I am pleased he has worked \nwith us on this amendment.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, while I opposed the motion to instruct \noffered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, I did so with \nreluctance. The vast majority of auto dealers in Wisconsin do not \nengage in the kinds of behavior that have been held up as a reason to \noppose the Senator's motion, or the amendment he had previously offered \nto the financial regulatory reform bill. Our dealers are wonderful \ncorporate citizens, who have contributed significantly to our \ncommunities and our State.\n  Some of that excellent track record stems from Wisconsin's tough \nconsumer protection laws that not only safeguard consumers, but also \nprotect those firms that treat their customers fairly from the fly-by-\nnight operators who seek to gain a competitive advantage over honest \ndealers at the expense of the consumer. Had Wisconsin's consumer laws \nand history of vigorous enforcement been reflected in other States \nacross the Nation, there would have been a stronger argument for \ncarving out an exception in the bill for a specific set of firms, as is \nproposed by the motion to instruct.\n  Even though I opposed the motion to instruct, supporters of the \nmotion are right when they note that auto dealers, who are almost \nuniformly small businesses, should not be treated the same as the large \nfinancial institutions that are the focus of much of this bill. That is \nwhy I supported the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms.\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nSnowe, to extend the Regulatory Flexibility Act provisions to the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. That approach will not only \naddress some of the concerns of the Senator from Kansas but also other \nsmall businesses that may fall under the oversight of that new bureau.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I would like to express my support for \namendment No. 3809, which was offered by the Senator from Hawaii to the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill. His amendment would have stricken a \nprovision in the financial reform legislation that allows the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to use fee revenues to fund its own \noperations without undergoing the annual appropriations process.\n  While the President's budget request does not endorse ``self-\nfunding'' for the SEC, I understand the Commission itself supports the \nidea because it generally raises more fee revenue each year than \nCongress appropriates for the agency. Under self-funding, the SEC might \nreceive more money without the challenges of the annual appropriations \nprocess by keeping all the fees it receives in the form of offsetting \ncollections.\n  While I appreciate that the appropriations process subjects the \nCommission to competition from other government programs, it is \nprecisely that process that imposes discipline on Federal agencies and \nhelps distill needs from wants. Self-funding would effectively exempt \nthe SEC from Congressional budgetary oversight. Congress has important \nconstitutional responsibilities for directing Federal spending and \nproviding necessary oversight over the executive branch. The Commission \nhas offered no compelling evidence that it cannot perform its statutory \nfunctions under the current budget structure or that its performance \nwarrants being exempted from that structure.\n  The Appropriations Committee has consistently responded to the \nresource requests of the SEC, recognizing its important enforcement \nrole. Congress appropriated $906 million for the SEC in fiscal year \n2008, $960.1 million in fiscal year 2009 and $1.11 billion in fiscal \nyear 2010. The fiscal year 2010 appropriation level provided by \nCongress was $85 million over the President's budget request.\n  The President's appropriation request for the Commission for fiscal \nyear 2011 is $1.25 billion, an increase of $139 million over the prior \nyear's approved funding. As with all agencies, the chairman and I will \ncarefully consider this request and work with the members of the \ncommittee to ensure that the funding provided to the Commission will \nenable it to carry out its important mission.\n  If the SEC were to self-fund using fee revenues, the Securities and \nExchange Commission is on track to set fees at levels sufficient to \nraise $1.7 billion in collections in fiscal year 2011, an increase of \n$220 million over fee collections in fiscal year 2010. This change \nwould increase the SEC budget by $590 million in fiscal year 2011, when \ncompared with the appropriated funding level in fiscal year 2010. It \nalso represents an increase of $490 million over the President's \nappropriation request for the SEC for fiscal year 2011.\n  It seems to me that, now more than ever, congressional oversight is \nneeded to regulate the regulators and to hold accountable those \nregulators who fail to do their jobs correctly. The SEC made many \nmistakes during the financial crisis, including failing to bring an \nenforcement action against Stanford Financial for over 12 years after \nlearning about the Stanford scheme. Recent reports by the SEC inspector \ngeneral and others show that these problems were caused by \nmismanagement at the SEC and not by any funding shortages. Shouldn't \nCongress demand even more accountability of the SEC, rather than \nallowing the SEC to freely spend a greatly expanded budget?\n  The financial downturn and its aftermath have highlighted the need \nfor increased oversight and transparency throughout the financial \nsystem. They also have highlighted the need for increased congressional \noversight. The annual budget and appropriations process ensures that \nCongress plays an active role in the oversight of important agencies, \nsuch as the SEC.\n  Under the financial reform bill, the SEC will face new challenges as \nit takes on additional responsibilities. I am committed in my role as \nvice chairman of the Appropriations Committee to work with the \nadministration and the SEC to ensure that all resource requests receive \nappropriate consideration. The Appropriations Committee has a history \nof responding to such requests and at times has provided additional \nresources based on the committee's assessment of the agency's needs. In \naddition, if for some reason the fees that the SEC collects are \ninsufficient to support its mission, it is likely that the SEC would be \nback before the Congress, requesting additional resources.\n  While the SEC may believe that the fees it collects provide a path to \na dependable funding stream, I believe the appropriations process--\nwhich is grounded in the Constitution and subject to scrutiny not only \nby the Appropriations Committee but by extension by the entire Senate \nand the Congress--is the path to dependable funding with appropriate \nchecks and balances to ensure that funding decisions are made in the \nbest interest of the taxpayers. With our Nation's fiscal situation as \nprecarious as it is, Congress should not be putting yet another Federal \nagency on auto-pilot.\n  Even though the Senator from Hawaii's amendment was not considered \nprior to the Senate's completing action on the financial reform bill, I \nhope the managers of the bill will duly consider the views of the \namendment's sponsors and drop the SEC self-funding provision from the \nbill in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to express my \nviews on the bill overall and also to express my appreciation to an \nawful lot of people who worked very hard on this legislation over the \nlast year and a half, not just over the last 4 weeks this bill has been \nthe subject of Senate debate.\n  Last week, the Senate voted to pass this historic and comprehensive \nWall Street reform legislation. Over the weekend, the New York Times \nwrote:\n\n       With the Senate's passage of financial regulation, Congress \n     and the White House have completed 16 months of activity that \n     rival any other since the New Deal in scope or ambition.\n\n  I argue that it is not the scope of our mission that we will remember \nwhen we look back on this period in our Nation's history. Instead, I \nbelieve we will remember the scope of the challenge with which we have \nbeen confronted, the weight of the burden we have been asked to lift \noff the backs of the American people, and the difficult work we had to \ndo to get the job done.\n  Our Nation was founded on principles of religious freedom and \nrepresentative government, but our history reveals that one of the most \ntruly American principles is that of self-determination. In America, if \nyou work hard and play by the rules, there is no limit to what you can \nachieve. That idea is so central to our national character that it is \ntempting to take it for granted. We rarely think about the foundation \nupon which that promise rests, but that foundation is there. It is \nreal. It is made up of laws and rules and regulations and institutions. \nIt is the charge of human beings, and thus it can fail.\n  We all know what was lost when that foundation did fail 2 years ago--\nmillions of jobs, millions of homes, trillions in household wealth and \nretirement savings. But what we very nearly lost was that principle of \nself-determination. Small business owners who turned a good idea into a \nreal business that employs real people suddenly found that despite \nhaving done nothing wrong, they could no longer find the credit they \nneeded to survive. Homeowners who had put their backs into earning \nenough to own a piece of this country suddenly found that, despite \nhaving done nothing wrong, they had been ripped off by an unscrupulous \nlender. And people across America who got up early every day to go do a \njob that barely put enough food on the table found that they were being \nlet go, not because they had done something wrong but because of the \nmistakes of a banker they never met, a corporate hotshot who had never \nhad any trouble feeding his family.\n  Over the many months, we looked at the foundation closely, and the \ncloser we looked, the more cracks we saw. And the American people, \nnever quick to lose faith, began to doubt whether the promise of our \nfree markets and\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nabundant wealth would still hold for them and their children.\n  Our task in this institution, in writing and passing this bill, was \nnot just to restore stability to our financial system or save our \neconomy from further turmoil. Our task was to restore power to the \nuniquely American principle of self-determination. I believe that, in \nthe view of history, we will be judged to have succeeded. And that \neffort means more to me and I presume more to this body than any \npolitical consideration ever could.\n  Of course, our work is not quite finished. We must now work with our \ncolleagues in the other body in conference. In that conference, I will \nfight to make sure the strengths of the bill that came out of this \ninstitution are reflected in the legislation we will send to the \nPresident's desk.\n  At the heart of what makes our bill effective is its focus on the \nsmall business owners, investors, and consumers who are, in turn, at \nthe heart of our prosperity. There is no interest more special than the \npublic interest, and that is reflected in our legislation.\n  Our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rejects the notion that \nindividual lobbies should enjoy special protections. We took special \nprecautions to ensure that small businesses are not unnecessarily \npulled into the regulatory regime. And we listened carefully to \nconcerns about creating an unfettered bureaucracy, ensuring that the \npowers it has are matched by strong oversight. But we rejected carve-\nouts and loopholes because the only special interests whose voice \nshould be heard at this bureau is that of the American consumer. We \ntook steps to ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's \nfunding will be independent and reliable so that its mission cannot be \ncompromised by political maneuvering.\n  In conference, I will do what I can to defend these important \nprinciples. I will also fight for our bill's approach to ending too-\nbig-to-fail bailouts, an approach that is the result of hard work and \ngood, bipartisan compromise on the part of many Senators.\n  Further, our bill includes lasting and durable protections against \nmore taxpayer bailouts and the possibility of yet another widespread \neconomic crisis.\n  We have said all along that there needs to be a way for big firms to \nfail without incurring taxpayer expense or threatening the foundation \nof our economy. We have found that way, and we have ensured it will \nlast for a long time. We have also included the Volcker rule to help \nensure that the biggest firms are as stable as possible.\n  We also have found a way to bring into the sunlight an entire market \nsector that for too long has grown in the shadows. Our bill has very \nstrong protections for the derivatives market, and, like the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, we have rejected carve-outs for special \ninterests because those carve-outs would weaken protections against \neconomic instability.\n  Our bill also takes on the issue of Federal Reserve governance, \nmandating a General Accounting Office audit of the Fed's response to \nthe financial crisis, changing the president of the New York Fed to a \nPresidential appointment, and making other improvements--increasing \ntransparency at the Fed without threatening its independence or its \nability to do important work of conducting monetary policy.\n  Our bill strengthens the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nimproving whistleblower protections and empowering shareholders and \ninvestors.\n  Our bill, finally, reforms the credit rating agencies, allowing \ngreater access to information, including an agency's track record, \nmethodology, and the limitations of its ratings.\n  This is a very strong bill. If you want to call it ambitious, that is \nfine, but I think that is missing the point. Everything in this bill is \na response to the pain we have seen in our Nation and to the worry \nAmericans have that it could all happen again.\n  If the bill is comprehensive--and I believe it is--that is because \nthe challenge was also comprehensive. We can no more let the principle \nof economic self-determination crumble than we can the principles of \nreligious freedom or representative government on which our Nation has \nbeen founded and built. That is why I have fought as hard as I have, \nalong with my colleagues on the Banking Committee and so many others in \nthis Chamber--Democrats and Republicans--over the last month the \nlegislation was on the floor of this body. That is why we will continue \nto fight for this strong legislation until it is signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  As I said at the outset of these remarks, obviously those who get to \nspeak at these lecterns, to debate in this Hall, receive the notoriety \nfor good or real as a piece of legislation such as this moves through \nthe legislative process. There are literally dozens of people who work \nevery day, over the weekends, long into the evening to make sure \nlegislation is comprehensive, well thought out, balanced, and fair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \npeople on our committee staff, legislative counsels, the floor staff, \nand the Republican floor staff, and thank them for their tremendous \nwork over this last month. They do a tremendous job on behalf of the \nAmerican public every single day, seeing to it that which we conduct \nhere is done in a fair, open process that reflects well on this \ninstitution. Along with Ed Silverman, Amy Friend, Jonathan Miller, Dean \nShahinian, and Julie Chon--I hesitate to go down the whole list. I \nthank all of them for their tremendous work, and I want the record to \nreflect their names. It is the least we can do. I can literally cite \nparagraphs about every one of them, the work they conducted to bring us \nto this point in the legislative process. I am grateful to them and the \nfloor staff, Republicans and Democrats, who make this place work all \nday. The American public owes them a great debt of gratitude for what \nthey do.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Thank-You List\n\n\n                            Committee Staff\n\n       Ed Silverman, Amy Friend, Jonathan Miller, Dean Shahinian, \n     Julie Chon, Charles Yi, Marc Jarsuliq, Lynsey Graham Rea, \n     Catherine Galicia, Matthew Green, Deborah Katz, Mark \n     Jickling, Donna Nordenberg, Levon Bagramian, Brian \n     Filipowich, Drew Colbert, Misha Mintz-Roth, Lisa Frumin, \n     William Fields, Beth Cooper, Colin McGinnis, Neal Orringer, \n     Kirstin Brost, Peter Bondi, Sean Oblack, Erika Lee, Joslyn \n     Hemler, Dawn Ratliff, And all of their families.\n\n\n                          Legislative Counsels\n\n       Laura Ayoud, Rob Grant, Allison Wright, and Kim Albrecht \n     Taylor.\n\n\n                       The Democratic Floor Staff\n\n       Led by Lula Davis.\n\n\n                       The Republican Floor Staff\n\n       Led by David Schiappa.\n\n\n                          Leader Ried's Staff\n\n       Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, Mark Wetjen.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The annual budget and appropriations process ensures that \nCongress plays an active role in the oversight of important agencies, \nsuch as the SEC.\n  Under the financial reform bill, the SEC will face new challenges as \nit takes on additional responsibilities. I am committed in my role as \nvice chairman of the Appropriations Committee to work with the \nadministration and the SEC to ensure that all resource requests receive \nappropriate consideration. The Appropriations Committee has a history \nof responding to such requests and at times has provided additional \nresources based on the committee's assessment of the agency's needs. In \naddition, if for some reason the fees that the SEC collects are \ninsufficient to support its mission, it is likely that the SEC would be \nback before the Congress, requesting additional resources.\n  While the SEC may believe that the fees it collects provide a path to \na dependable funding stream, I believe the appropriations process--\nwhich is grounded in the Constitution and subject to scrutiny not only \nby the Appropriations Committee but by extension by the entire Senate \nand the Congress--is the path to dependable funding with appropriate \nchecks and balances to ensure that funding decisions are made in the \nbest interest of the taxpayers. With our Nation's fiscal situation as \nprecarious as it is, Congress should not be putting yet another Federal \nagency on auto-pilot.\n  Even though the Senator from Hawaii's amendment was not considered \nprior to the Senate's completing action on the financial reform bill, I \nhope the managers of the bill will duly consider the views of the \namendment's sponsors and drop the SEC self-funding provision from the \nbill in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to express my \nviews on the bill overall and also to express my appreciation to an \nawful lot of people who worked very hard on this legislation over the \nlast year and a half, not just over the last 4 weeks this bill has been \nthe subject of Senate debate.\n  Last week, the Senate voted to pass this historic and comprehensive \nWall Street reform legislation. Over the weekend, the New York Times \nwrote:\n\n       With the Senate's passage of financial regulation, Congress \n     and the White House have completed 16 months of activity that \n     rival any other since the New Deal in scope or ambition.\n\n  I argue that it is not the scope of our mission that we will remember \nwhen we look back on this period in our Nation's history. Instead, I \nbelieve we will remember the scope of the challenge with which we have \nbeen confronted, the weight of the burden we have been asked to lift \noff the backs of the American people, and the difficult work we had to \ndo to get the job done.\n  Our Nation was founded on principles of religious freedom and \nrepresentative government, but our history reveals that one of the most \ntruly American principles is that of self-determination. In America, if \nyou work hard and play by the rules, there is no limit to what you can \nachieve. That idea is so central to our national character that it is \ntempting to take it for granted. We rarely think about the foundation \nupon which that promise rests, but that foundation is there. It is \nreal. It is made up of laws and rules and regulations and institutions. \nIt is the charge of human beings, and thus it can fail.\n  We all know what was lost when that foundation did fail 2 years ago--\nmillions of jobs, millions of homes, trillions in household wealth and \nretirement savings. But what we very nearly lost was that principle of \nself-determination. Small business owners who turned a good idea into a \nreal business that employs real people suddenly found that despite \nhaving done nothing wrong, they could no longer find the credit they \nneeded to survive. Homeowners who had put their backs into earning \nenough to own a piece of this country suddenly found that, despite \nhaving done nothing wrong, they had been ripped off by an unscrupulous \nlender. And people across America who got up early every day to go do a \njob that barely put enough food on the table found that they were being \nlet go, not because they had done something wrong but because of the \nmistakes of a banker they never met, a corporate hotshot who had never \nhad any trouble feeding his family.\n  Over the many months, we looked at the foundation closely, and the \ncloser we looked, the more cracks we saw. And the American people, \nnever quick to lose faith, began to doubt whether the promise of our \nfree markets and\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nabundant wealth would still hold for them and their children.\n  Our task in this institution, in writing and passing this bill, was \nnot just to restore stability to our financial system or save our \neconomy from further turmoil. Our task was to restore power to the \nuniquely American principle of self-determination. I believe that, in \nthe view of history, we will be judged to have succeeded. And that \neffort means more to me and I presume more to this body than any \npolitical consideration ever could.\n  Of course, our work is not quite finished. We must now work with our \ncolleagues in the other body in conference. In that conference, I will \nfight to make sure the strengths of the bill that came out of this \ninstitution are reflected in the legislation we will send to the \nPresident's desk.\n  At the heart of what makes our bill effective is its focus on the \nsmall business owners, investors, and consumers who are, in turn, at \nthe heart of our prosperity. There is no interest more special than the \npublic interest, and that is reflected in our legislation.\n  Our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rejects the notion that \nindividual lobbies should enjoy special protections. We took special \nprecautions to ensure that small businesses are not unnecessarily \npulled into the regulatory regime. And we listened carefully to \nconcerns about creating an unfettered bureaucracy, ensuring that the \npowers it has are matched by strong oversight. But we rejected carve-\nouts and loopholes because the only special interests whose voice \nshould be heard at this bureau is that of the American consumer. We \ntook steps to ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's \nfunding will be independent and reliable so that its mission cannot be \ncompromised by political maneuvering.\n  In conference, I will do what I can to defend these important \nprinciples. I will also fight for our bill's approach to ending too-\nbig-to-fail bailouts, an approach that is the result of hard work and \ngood, bipartisan compromise on the part of many Senators.\n  Further, our bill includes lasting and durable protections against \nmore taxpayer bailouts and the possibility of yet another widespread \neconomic crisis.\n  We have said all along that there needs to be a way for big firms to \nfail without incurring taxpayer expense or threatening the foundation \nof our economy. We have found that way, and we have ensured it will \nlast for a long time. We have also included the Volcker rule to help \nensure that the biggest firms are as stable as possible.\n  We also have found a way to bring into the sunlight an entire market \nsector that for too long has grown in the shadows. Our bill has very \nstrong protections for the derivatives market, and, like the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, we have rejected carve-outs for special \ninterests because those carve-outs would weaken protections against \neconomic instability.\n  Our bill also takes on the issue of Federal Reserve governance, \nmandating a General Accounting Office audit of the Fed's response to \nthe financial crisis, changing the president of the New York Fed to a \nPresidential appointment, and making other improvements--increasing \ntransparency at the Fed without threatening its independence or its \nability to do important work of conducting monetary policy.\n  Our bill strengthens the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nimproving whistleblower protections and empowering shareholders and \ninvestors.\n  Our bill, finally, reforms the credit rating agencies, allowing \ngreater access to information, including an agency's track record, \nmethodology, and the limitations of its ratings.\n  This is a very strong bill. If you want to call it ambitious, that is \nfine, but I think that is missing the point. Everything in this bill is \na response to the pain we have seen in our Nation and to the worry \nAmericans have that it could all happen again.\n  If the bill is comprehensive--and I believe it is--that is because \nthe challenge was also comprehensive. We can no more let the principle \nof economic self-determination crumble than we can the principles of \nreligious freedom or representative government on which our Nation has \nbeen founded and built. That is why I have fought as hard as I have, \nalong with my colleagues on the Banking Committee and so many others in \nthis Chamber--Democrats and Republicans--over the last month the \nlegislation was on the floor of this body. That is why we will continue \nto fight for this strong legislation until it is signed into law by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  As I said at the outset of these remarks, obviously those who get to \nspeak at these lecterns, to debate in this Hall, receive the notoriety \nfor good or real as a piece of legislation such as this moves through \nthe legislative process. There are literally dozens of people who work \nevery day, over the weekends, long into the evening to make sure \nlegislation is comprehensive, well thought out, balanced, and fair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \npeople on our committee staff, legislative counsels, the floor staff, \nand the Republican floor staff, and thank them for their tremendous \nwork over this last month. They do a tremendous job on behalf of the \nAmerican public every single day, seeing to it that which we conduct \nhere is done in a fair, open process that reflects well on this \ninstitution. Along with Ed Silverman, Amy Friend, Jonathan Miller, Dean \nShahinian, and Julie Chon--I hesitate to go down the whole list. I \nthank all of them for their tremendous work, and I want the record to \nreflect their names. It is the least we can do. I can literally cite \nparagraphs about every one of them, the work they conducted to bring us \nto this point in the legislative process. I am grateful to them and the \nfloor staff, Republicans and Democrats, who make this place work all \nday. The American public owes them a great debt of gratitude for what \nthey do.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Thank-You List\n\n\n                            Committee Staff\n\n       Ed Silverman, Amy Friend, Jonathan Miller, Dean Shahinian, \n     Julie Chon, Charles Yi, Marc Jarsuliq, Lynsey Graham Rea, \n     Catherine Galicia, Matthew Green, Deborah Katz, Mark \n     Jickling, Donna Nordenberg, Levon Bagramian, Brian \n     Filipowich, Drew Colbert, Misha Mintz-Roth, Lisa Frumin, \n     William Fields, Beth Cooper, Colin McGinnis, Neal Orringer, \n     Kirstin Brost, Peter Bondi, Sean Oblack, Erika Lee, Joslyn \n     Hemler, Dawn Ratliff, And all of their families.\n\n\n                          Legislative Counsels\n\n       Laura Ayoud, Rob Grant, Allison Wright, and Kim Albrecht \n     Taylor.\n\n\n                       The Democratic Floor Staff\n\n       Led by Lula Davis.\n\n\n                       The Republican Floor Staff\n\n       Led by David Schiappa.\n\n\n                          Leader Ried's Staff\n\n       Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, Mark Wetjen.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, I would like to raise the important \nissue of human rights and democratic reform in our partnership with \nEgypt. I am very concerned by Egypt's recent extension of its emergency \nlaw--which has been in place continuously since 1981--yet again, for \nanother 2 years. Since 2005, President Hosni Mubarak and his government \nhave repeatedly pledged to end the use of the emergency law, but it \ncontinues to be extended. Although some changes were apparently \nannounced with the extension, these were little more than cosmetic and \nwill do nothing to improve the deeply repressive environment this law \nenables. Emergency laws, if they are ever appropriate, are intended for \nexceptional circumstances, not continuous application for decades.\n  Furthermore, numerous concerns have been raised about violations of \nhuman rights and civil liberties under Egypt's emergency law. The \nextension also comes ahead of parliamentary and Presidential elections, \nwhich may see new challenges emerge to the leadership structure. As \nAmnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North \nAfrica stated recently, ``[w]e are particularly concerned that this \nextension comes as Egypt prepares for elections this year; the \nauthorities are notorious for relying on the emergency powers to lock \nup their opponents.''\n  In a report on his visit to Egypt last year, the United Nations \nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, \nacknowledged ``the right of a State to proclaim a state of emergency as \na temporary measure determined by the exigencies of the situation'' but \nexpressed his concern that ``Egypt has been almost continuously \ngoverned by emergency law, which includes far-reaching restrictions on \nfundamental rights and freedoms, for more than 50 years.'' The dangers \ninherent in the law's continuing use are highlighted by its provisions \nand their apparent application.\n  Among other things, the law apparently allows preventive detention \nand enables individuals to be held indefinitely without being charged \nor brought to trial. Egyptian citizens do not enjoy the freedom to \nassemble or protest peacefully and, in fact, face arrest if they \nparticipate in such demonstrations. In fact, Mr. Sheinin has noted that \nspecial State Security Investigations officers ``in practice enjoy \ncarte blanche in deciding on whom to arrest'' and have used the \nemergency law to arrest and detain human rights activists, journalists \nand internet bloggers who were critical of the government.\n  Human rights and civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the \nsearch for security, nor would doing so guarantee security. On the \ncontrary, counterterrorism measures must ensure respect for political \nand civil rights and the rule of law if they are to be effective in the \nlong term. Repression only yields more resentment, more opposition, and \nmore alienation. As President Obama said during his 2009 Cairo speech, \n``Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, \nsuccessful and secure. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them \ngo away.''\n  I am pleased that the State Department and then the White House \nreleased public statements expressing regret at Egypt's extension of \nthe emergency law, but they were insufficient in recognizing how \ncritical political and democratic reform is both to security and \nstability within Egypt, as well as to the broader region. In order to \ngenuinely address the very real concerns of radicalism, Egypt must \nexpand its engagement with its citizens and provide them with greater \nopenings to voice their concerns. Stifling the public feeds rather than \nprevents the growth of radicalism. In contrast, reducing corruption, \nimproving governance, and building democratic institutions will go a \nlong way toward reducing the appeal of extremism. The historic \npartnership between the United States and Egypt means we have an active \nand critical role to play in pressing for these reforms. We should use \nevery opportunity to bring them up.\n  Egypt is an incredibly important country and a vital strategic \npartner of the United States. It is a nation of 80 million people that \nsits at the strategic crossroads between Africa and Asia. Egypt is a \nleader among Arab States and has played an important role in matters of \npeace and security in the Middle East, particularly in the area of \nArab-Israeli peace. At the same time, Egypt continues to be heavily \ninvolved in affairs in North and East Africa, not least because of its \nreliance on water resources from the Nile River, where ongoing \nnegotiations over the Nile Basin Initiative have escalated regional \ntensions between Egypt and its neighboring countries at a time when \nEgypt's own internal dynamics are fluid. Egypt's long history with \nSudan, the largest country in Africa, is also of critical importance \ngiven South Sudan's upcoming vote on self-determination set for January \n2011. Without question, successful political reform in Cairo would \nsignificantly enhance Egypt's leadership role throughout the Middle \nEast and Africa and could help ensure constructive political engagement \nin these regions for years to come.\n  For all these reasons, it is in our interest to continue to pursue a \nstrong working relationship with the Egyptian Government. But it is \nalso in our interest to ensure that relationship is sustainable and \nstrategic over the long-term. To do this, I believe we must engage more \nbroadly with the Egyptian people and support efforts in the country to \npush for human rights and democratic reform. This is especially \nimportant in the coming months as Egypt prepares to hold parliamentary \nelections, which will be followed next year by a Presidential election. \nThis period could be one of transition, possibly one of tumult. The \nObama administration should begin engaging now with the Egyptian \ngovernment and other stakeholders to make clear that we support a fair, \nfree, and peaceful process. Continuing to provide uncritical support to \nan authoritarian regime undermines our credibility as champions of \npolitical and civil rights and creates tensions, particularly in the \nMuslim world, which are ripe for exploitation. Those tensions, in turn, \nthreaten our own national security.\n  As I have noted before in this forum, we must be strong and \nconsistent in advancing human rights, good governance, and the rule of \nlaw while also addressing security and economic concerns. And we should \nmake sure that message is being reinforced by all U.S. Government \nofficials and programs in Egypt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4141-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4141-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4141-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4141-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4141-S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the President Officer laid before the Senate \nmessage from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4142-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL RELATIVE TO AN EXPEDITED PROCEDURE TO RESCIND \n   UNNECESSARY SPENDING AND TO BROADLY SCALE BACK FUNDING LEVELS IF \n          WARRANTED, TOGETHER WITH A SECTIONAL ANALYSIS--PM 57\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Budget:\n\nTo the Congress of the United Sates:\n  Today, I am pleased to submit to the Congress the enclosed \nlegislative proposal, the ``Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010,'' \nalong with a section-by-section analysis of the legislation.\n  This proposal will be another important step in restoring fiscal \ndiscipline and making sure that Washington spends taxpayer dollars \nresponsibly. It will provide a new tool to streamline Government \nprograms and operations, cut wasteful Government spending, and enhance \ntransparency and accountability to the American people. The legislation \nwill create an expedited procedure to rescind unnecessary spending and \nto broadly scale back funding levels if warranted. The legislation \nwould require the Congress to vote up or down on legislation proposed \nby the President to rescind funding. This new, enhanced rescission \nauthority will not only empower the President and the Congress to \neliminate unnecessary spending, but also discourage waste in the first \nplace.\n  Now more than ever, it's critical that taxpayer dollars are not \nwasted on programs that are ineffective, duplicative, or out-dated. In \na time when American families and small business owners are conscious \nof every dollar and make sure that they manage their budgets wisely, \nthe Federal Government can do no less. The American people expect and \ndemand that we spend their money with the same discipline. Allowing \ntaxpayer dollars to be wasted is both an irresponsible use of taxpayer \nfunds and an irresponsible abuse of the public trust.\n  Recently, the Congress has taken welcome steps to curb wasteful \nspending. In 2007, when I served in the Senate, a bipartisan group \nworked together to eliminate anonymous earmarks and brought new \nmeasures of transparency to the process so Americans can better follow \nhow their tax dollars are being spent. Consequently, we have seen \nprogress--with earmarks declining since these reforms were passed, \nincluding during this past fiscal year.\n  In addition, my administration undertook a line-by-line review of the \nBudget, and put forward approximately $20 billion of terminations, \nreductions, and savings both for Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011. While \nrecent administrations have seen between 15 to 20 percent of their \nproposed discretionary cuts approved by the Congress, for FY 2010, we \nworked with the Congress to enact 60 percent of proposed cuts.\n  Despite the progress we have made to reduce earmarks and other \nunnecessary spending, there is still more work to be done. The \nlegislation I am sending to you today provides an important tool. The \nlegislation allows the President to target spending policies that do \nnot have a legitimate and worthy public purpose by providing the \nPresident with an additional authority to propose the elimination of \nwasteful or excessive funding. These proposals then receive expedited \nconsideration in the Congress and a guaranteed up-or-down vote. This \nlegislation would also allow the President to delay funding for these \nprojects until the Congress has had the chance to consider the changes. \nIn addition, this proposal has been crafted to preserve the \nconstitutional balance of power between the President and the Congress.\n  Overall, the ``Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010'' provides a \nnew way for the Congress and the President to manage taxpayer dollars \nwisely. That is why I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of \nthis proposal, and look forward to working with the Congress on this \nmatter in the coming weeks.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 24, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4142-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1177.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging local, state, and federal governmental \n     agencies to work in close coordination, in order to minimize \n     damage to Louisiana's natural resources caused by the \n     Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and to utilize all available \n     resources to protect and support Louisiana residents and \n     businesses affected by the spill; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 61\n\n       Whereas, on April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling \n     rig exploded and later sank in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the accident was reported to have been caused by a \n     blowout, an uncontrolled release of gas or oil that forces \n     its way up a well pipe and catches fire; and\n       Whereas, with fire still burning days later, Coast Guard \n     officials continued the search for eleven missing crew \n     members; and\n       Whereas, of the one hundred and fifteen crew members who \n     were accounted for, seventeen suffered injuries that included \n     burns, smoke inhalation, and broken bones; and\n       Whereas, since the explosion, approximately forty-two \n     thousand gallons of oil per day have been leaking from the \n     site into the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the oil spill is moving closer and closer to \n     environmentally sensitive coastal areas; and\n       Whereas, President Obama's administration has launched a \n     full investigation into the oil rig explosion, with Homeland \n     Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary \n     Ken Salazar indicating devotion and every available resource \n     to a comprehensive investigation of the explosion with \n     assistance to be given by the U.S. Coast Guard and the \n     Minerals Management Service which share in jurisdiction for \n     the investigation; and\n       Whereas, British Petroleum, which owns the oil rig operated \n     by the Swiss drilling company Transocean, dispatched more \n     than thirty ships, capable of skimming in excess of one \n     hundred and seventy thousand barrels of oil per day; and\n       Whereas, several oceanographers have claimed that the \n     magnitude of the oil spill is huge and could have an impact \n     on marine life and oyster beds; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard is keeping a watchful eye on \n     underwater activity from the sunken rig; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard has prepared to set fire to \n     portions of the growing oil slick to keep the crude away from \n     sensitive ecological areas; and\n       Whereas, without prompt and carefully coordinated action, \n     the oil spill has the potential to become one of the worst in \n     U.S. history, as it is up to forty-two miles by eighty miles \n     wide, and ranges in thickness from a couple of molecules to \n     the equivalent of layers of paint; and\n       Whereas, with the Louisiana shrimp season due to open in \n     less than a month, geologists say the oil spill has the \n     potential to delay or affect the 2010 season; and\n       Whereas, Governor Jindal has authorized state agencies to \n     continue monitoring the oil spill, while the federal \n     government begins work to protect the Pass-A-Loutre Wildlife \n     Management and Breton National Wildlife Refuge areas; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries \n     is working closely with state and federal agencies and \n     British Petroleum to mitigate fish and wildlife resource \n     impacts; and\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\n       Whereas, partners in the oil spill response effort include \n     but are not limited to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the Louisiana Department of Environmental \n     Quality, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the \n     Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Louisiana \n     Oil Spill Coordinators Office, the Governor's Office of \n     Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Coastal \n     Protection and Restoration Authority, and the Oiled Wildlife \n     Care Network;

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nestablish within the Department of Energy a Supply Star program to \nidentify and promote practices, companies, and products that use highly \nefficient supply chains in a manner that conserves energy, water, and \nother resources; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Supply Star \nAct of 2010 to drive widespread improvements in supply chain energy \nefficiency.\n  Companies today are facing pressure on many fronts--from customers, \nstockholders, business partners, and regulators--to improve their \nenergy performance in hopes of maximizing profit, minimizing \nenvironmental impact, and shielding themselves against the price \nvolatility of fuels. Nearly 90 percent of a company's energy use can \ncome from its supply chains, making supply chain energy efficiency--\nencompassing raw materials, manufacturing, packaging, transport, use, \nand disposal of goods--of significant importance in the transition to a \nmore energy efficient marketplace.\n  For these reasons, many: corporations are examining supply chain \nefficiency, not only in hopes of being better corporate citizens, but \nbecause it makes good business sense. Decreasing energy use in the \nsupply chain can lead to significant cost reductions and increase \ncompetitiveness. However, these efforts face hurdles--especially in \nsmall companies--that limit their widespread implementation. Earlier \nthis year, I attended the MIT Energy Conference in Boston, where these \nhurdles were discussed in some detail by an expert panel. The hurdles \ninclude a lack of information and analysis tools for important parts of \nfar-flung supply chains, which often lie far upstream or downstream, \nand therefore out of sight, of a particular firm, as well as a lack of \nleverage with which to rive global suppliers toward more efficient \npractices. Overcoming these challenges requires significant resources \nand access to global information that is often not available to any one \nsingle firm. I was persuaded that efforts to address these challenges \nwould have significant benefit to the country.\n  The Supply Star Act of 2010 would establish a Supply Star Program \nwithin the Department of Energy that builds on the Energy Star Program, \nas well as existing best practices in industry and the U.S. and \ninternational research communities to give companies access to the \nresources and information they need to successfully drive supply chain \nefficiency improvements.\n  The Supply Star Program would provide all companies, particularly \nsmall and medium sized businesses, with financing, technical support, \ntraining, and sector-wide networks to help significantly improve their \nsupply chain efficiency. The program would also provide public \nrecognition to those businesses that achieve the highest supply chain \nefficiency standards, rewarding them with a tangible and credible tool \nto use in external communications about all of their good work and \ngiving consumers and businesses an easy way of seeking out good actors \nas they make purchasing decisions.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and work to \nimprove the energy efficiency of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity credit to certain recently discharged veterans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sacrifice of the \nthousands of men and women serving in harm's way overseas and to \nintroduce legislation that will help these brave men and women when \nthey return home.\n  I recently led a congressional delegation to Afghanistan. During my \nvisit, I was deeply impressed by the service and dedication of our \nbrave troops. These men and women work under the most difficult \nconditions.\n  They serve every day. Weekends, holidays, anniversaries, and \nbirthdays. They serve 24 hours a days, seven days a week.\n  Our troops are some of the hardest working Americans. They patrol the \nmountains, fix trucks and fire artillery. They are not only warriors, \nbut diplomats as well. They organize meetings known as shuras with \nlocal leaders and village elders. I was awestruck by our troops' \nprofessionalism, courage and tenacity.\n  Many of these troops are from Montana. Montanans volunteer for duty \nat among the highest rate in the country. Montana's military recruiting \nrates are roughly 50 percent higher than the national average. \nTragically, Montana has the highest per capita rate of service members \nkilled or injured fighting overseas since 9/11.\n  While in Afghanistan I met a young Army captain named Casey Thoreen. \nCasey commands an infantry company that is working to improve security \nin the Maiwand district of Kandahar Province.\n  A reporter recently wrote a piece about Casey that described him as \nthe ``King of Maiwand'' because of his important efforts to improve the \nlives of those that live there.\n  Casey has developed close working relationships with the local \ndistrict leader and other important power brokers. We couldn't dream of \nsucceeding in Afghanistan without dedicated talented officers like this \nyoung man. Skilled efforts such as his are the lynchpin of our mission \nin Afghanistan.\n  My congressional colleagues and I have worked hard to give our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines all the tools necessary to \nsucceed in combat. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we give \nour troops the tools to succeed upon their return home.\n  President George Washington once said ``The willingness with which \nour young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how \njustified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the \nveterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their \nnation.''\n  President Washington's words are a serious reminder of our obligation \nto Casey and all of the brave men and women serving our country \noverseas. We have a solemn obligation to our veterans when they return \nhome. And recent suicide statistics and veteran unemployment data make \nit clear that we have a long way to go.\n\n  For veterans between the ages of 20 and 24, the suicide rate is \nroughly two to four times higher than non-veterans the same age.\n  A recent survey found that only 13 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans ``strongly agreed'' that their transition home was going well. \nAnd just 9 percent ``strongly agreed'' the needs of their family were \nbeing met.\n  The unemployment rate among veterans who have served in the military \nsince September 2001 far exceeds that of their peers. According to the \nAmerican Legion, nearly 15 percent of post \n9/11 veterans are unemployed.\n  The rate of unemployment for veterans aged 18 to 24 is over 30 \npercent--nearly double the rate for non-veterans the same age. These \nnumbers are unacceptable.\n  I want to applaud my friend and colleague, Senator Patty Murray, for \nthe important work she has done to address this problem. She recently \nintroduced the Comprehensive Veterans Employment Act of 2010.\n  The bill seeks to allow the GI Bill to pay for on-the-job training \nand apprenticeships. I strongly support her efforts.\n  Senator Murray held a roundtable discussion on veterans' employment \nearlier this year. During the discussion she learned that some veterans \nwere deliberately taking their military service off their resumes when \napplying for work. These veterans feared employers might think they \nsuffered from post-traumatic stress due to time in combat.\n  This discussion is a telling sign that we need to do a better job of \nwelcoming our troops home from war. I can't think of anything more \nimportant to readjusting to life back home than having meaningful \nemployment.\n  Our veterans are national assets. The skills veterans have learned in \nthe military are valuable in the civilian workplace and in communities \nacross America.\n  History has proven this to be true. Just look to the boom years in \nthe late 1940s and 1950s. America welcomed back millions of World War \nTwo veterans into the workforce. The leadership and strength of our \nveterans fueled the unprecedented growth and strength of our Nation. I \nexpect nothing less from this generation of veterans as well.\n  That is why Senator Grassley and I are introducing the Veteran \nEmployment Transition Act of 2010. This legislation will reward \nemployers that hire any veteran who has recently completed their \nservice in the military with up to a $6,000 tax credit.\n  The bill simplifies the administrative process that currently exists \nfor the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for hiring a recently discharged \nveteran. Any recently discharged veteran with discharge paperwork is \neligible. This includes those men and women who were activated by their \nstates as members of the National Guard.\n  Enacting this legislation is just first step. I want to ensure all \nveterans understand the benefits of this tax credit. That is I am \nworking with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and other Veteran Service Organizations to help veterans \nuse this tax benefit as a tool to find good paying jobs.\n  The day after this bill becomes law, the VFW will notify their \nmembers on how to use the credit. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica will post a webcast to their members to explain how best to \ntake advantage of this benefit.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America will also publish a \ndocument online that a veteran can print and hand in with a resume when \napplying for a job. This document will explain to employers how they \ncan take advantage of the credit if they hire the veteran.\n  Briefly, I want to thank my first Defenders of Freedom Fellow, Iraq \nveteran and Montana-native Charlie Cromwell. As a legislative fellow in \nmy office, Charlie worked hard to create and advance this bill.\n  I created the Defenders of Freedom Fellowship so that Montana \nveterans could work on legislation that helps their fellow veterans. \nThe legislation I am introducing today is the perfect example of what \nthis fellowship was intended to accomplish.\n  I encourage all interested Montana veterans to contact my office for \nmore information. It will take this kind of team work to provide the \nsupport our veterans need when they come home from war. It is an honor \nto introduce\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nthis legislation and I look forward to its quick passage in the weeks \nto come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 3399. A bill to remove the limit on the anticipated award price \nfor contracts awarded under the procurement program for women-owned \nsmall business concerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, during National Small \nBusiness Week, along with my colleague Senator Gillibrand, to introduce \nthe Fairness in Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Act. This vital \npiece of legislation builds upon a bill I introduced last summer, the \nSmall Business Contracting Programs Parity Act, S. 1489. The purpose of \nthe bill is to remove the inequities involved in the women-owned small \nbusiness contracting program.\n  As former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long been a champion of \nwomen entrepreneurs and have urged both past and present \nadministrations to implement the woman-owned small business, WOSB, \nFederal contracting program, which was enacted into law ten years ago. \nOn March 4, 2010, the Small Business Administration, SBA, finally \nproposed a workable rule to implement the women's procurement program.\n  The SBA's new proposed rule clarifies that individual Federal \nagencies do not have to certify that they have engaged in past \ndiscrimination against women in order for their contracting officials \nto reserve contracts for WOSBs. The proposed rule also identifies 83 \neligible industries under the program as those in which women-owned \nsmall businesses are underrepresented or substantially \nunderrepresented. These initiatives will help increase opportunities \nand access by women to Federal procurement.\n  Although it is anticipated that the SBA will publish the final \nversion of the women's procurement program by the end of the calendar \nyear, the program will lack critical elements that the SBA's 8(a), \nhistorically underutilized business zones, and the service-disabled \nveteran-owned government contracting programs include. To remedy this, \nour bill will help provide tools women need to compete fairly in the \nfederal contracting arena by allowing for receipt of non-competitive \ncontracts, when circumstances allow. Moreover, the legislation would \neliminate a restriction on the dollar amount of a contract that a WOSB \ncan compete for, thus putting them on a level playing field with the \nother socioeconomic contracting programs.\n  Women-owned small businesses have yet to receive their fair share of \nthe Federal marketplace. As I have stated many times, I am dismayed \nthat our Nation has repeatedly failed to meet all but one of its \nstatutory small business contracting goals. In fiscal year 2008, the \nFederal Government missed meeting its overall goal for small business \ncontracting by almost 2 percent. But not only did the Federal \nGovernment miss its overall small business goal, depriving small \nbusinesses of over $10 billion, it has never achieved its goal of 5 \npercent for WOSB, achieving only 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2008. Our \nbill would greatly assist Federal agencies in achieving the small \nbusiness goaling requirement for WOSBs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity credit to certain recently discharged veterans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sacrifice of the \nthousands of men and women serving in harm's way overseas and to \nintroduce legislation that will help these brave men and women when \nthey return home.\n  I recently led a congressional delegation to Afghanistan. During my \nvisit, I was deeply impressed by the service and dedication of our \nbrave troops. These men and women work under the most difficult \nconditions.\n  They serve every day. Weekends, holidays, anniversaries, and \nbirthdays. They serve 24 hours a days, seven days a week.\n  Our troops are some of the hardest working Americans. They patrol the \nmountains, fix trucks and fire artillery. They are not only warriors, \nbut diplomats as well. They organize meetings known as shuras with \nlocal leaders and village elders. I was awestruck by our troops' \nprofessionalism, courage and tenacity.\n  Many of these troops are from Montana. Montanans volunteer for duty \nat among the highest rate in the country. Montana's military recruiting \nrates are roughly 50 percent higher than the national average. \nTragically, Montana has the highest per capita rate of service members \nkilled or injured fighting overseas since 9/11.\n  While in Afghanistan I met a young Army captain named Casey Thoreen. \nCasey commands an infantry company that is working to improve security \nin the Maiwand district of Kandahar Province.\n  A reporter recently wrote a piece about Casey that described him as \nthe ``King of Maiwand'' because of his important efforts to improve the \nlives of those that live there.\n  Casey has developed close working relationships with the local \ndistrict leader and other important power brokers. We couldn't dream of \nsucceeding in Afghanistan without dedicated talented officers like this \nyoung man. Skilled efforts such as his are the lynchpin of our mission \nin Afghanistan.\n  My congressional colleagues and I have worked hard to give our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines all the tools necessary to \nsucceed in combat. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we give \nour troops the tools to succeed upon their return home.\n  President George Washington once said ``The willingness with which \nour young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how \njustified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the \nveterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their \nnation.''\n  President Washington's words are a serious reminder of our obligation \nto Casey and all of the brave men and women serving our country \noverseas. We have a solemn obligation to our veterans when they return \nhome. And recent suicide statistics and veteran unemployment data make \nit clear that we have a long way to go.\n\n  For veterans between the ages of 20 and 24, the suicide rate is \nroughly two to four times higher than non-veterans the same age.\n  A recent survey found that only 13 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans ``strongly agreed'' that their transition home was going well. \nAnd just 9 percent ``strongly agreed'' the needs of their family were \nbeing met.\n  The unemployment rate among veterans who have served in the military \nsince September 2001 far exceeds that of their peers. According to the \nAmerican Legion, nearly 15 percent of post \n9/11 veterans are unemployed.\n  The rate of unemployment for veterans aged 18 to 24 is over 30 \npercent--nearly double the rate for non-veterans the same age. These \nnumbers are unacceptable.\n  I want to applaud my friend and colleague, Senator Patty Murray, for \nthe important work she has done to address this problem. She recently \nintroduced the Comprehensive Veterans Employment Act of 2010.\n  The bill seeks to allow the GI Bill to pay for on-the-job training \nand apprenticeships. I strongly support her efforts.\n  Senator Murray held a roundtable discussion on veterans' employment \nearlier this year. During the discussion she learned that some veterans \nwere deliberately taking their military service off their resumes when \napplying for work. These veterans feared employers might think they \nsuffered from post-traumatic stress due to time in combat.\n  This discussion is a telling sign that we need to do a better job of \nwelcoming our troops home from war. I can't think of anything more \nimportant to readjusting to life back home than having meaningful \nemployment.\n  Our veterans are national assets. The skills veterans have learned in \nthe military are valuable in the civilian workplace and in communities \nacross America.\n  History has proven this to be true. Just look to the boom years in \nthe late 1940s and 1950s. America welcomed back millions of World War \nTwo veterans into the workforce. The leadership and strength of our \nveterans fueled the unprecedented growth and strength of our Nation. I \nexpect nothing less from this generation of veterans as well.\n  That is why Senator Grassley and I are introducing the Veteran \nEmployment Transition Act of 2010. This legislation will reward \nemployers that hire any veteran who has recently completed their \nservice in the military with up to a $6,000 tax credit.\n  The bill simplifies the administrative process that currently exists \nfor the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for hiring a recently discharged \nveteran. Any recently discharged veteran with discharge paperwork is \neligible. This includes those men and women who were activated by their \nstates as members of the National Guard.\n  Enacting this legislation is just first step. I want to ensure all \nveterans understand the benefits of this tax credit. That is I am \nworking with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and other Veteran Service Organizations to help veterans \nuse this tax benefit as a tool to find good paying jobs.\n  The day after this bill becomes law, the VFW will notify their \nmembers on how to use the credit. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica will post a webcast to their members to explain how best to \ntake advantage of this benefit.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America will also publish a \ndocument online that a veteran can print and hand in with a resume when \napplying for a job. This document will explain to employers how they \ncan take advantage of the credit if they hire the veteran.\n  Briefly, I want to thank my first Defenders of Freedom Fellow, Iraq \nveteran and Montana-native Charlie Cromwell. As a legislative fellow in \nmy office, Charlie worked hard to create and advance this bill.\n  I created the Defenders of Freedom Fellowship so that Montana \nveterans could work on legislation that helps their fellow veterans. \nThe legislation I am introducing today is the perfect example of what \nthis fellowship was intended to accomplish.\n  I encourage all interested Montana veterans to contact my office for \nmore information. It will take this kind of team work to provide the \nsupport our veterans need when they come home from war. It is an honor \nto introduce\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nthis legislation and I look forward to its quick passage in the weeks \nto come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 3399. A bill to remove the limit on the anticipated award price \nfor contracts awarded under the procurement program for women-owned \nsmall business concerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, during National Small \nBusiness Week, along with my colleague Senator Gillibrand, to introduce \nthe Fairness in Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Act. This vital \npiece of legislation builds upon a bill I introduced last summer, the \nSmall Business Contracting Programs Parity Act, S. 1489. The purpose of \nthe bill is to remove the inequities involved in the women-owned small \nbusiness contracting program.\n  As former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long been a champion of \nwomen entrepreneurs and have urged both past and present \nadministrations to implement the woman-owned small business, WOSB, \nFederal contracting program, which was enacted into law ten years ago. \nOn March 4, 2010, the Small Business Administration, SBA, finally \nproposed a workable rule to implement the women's procurement program.\n  The SBA's new proposed rule clarifies that individual Federal \nagencies do not have to certify that they have engaged in past \ndiscrimination against women in order for their contracting officials \nto reserve contracts for WOSBs. The proposed rule also identifies 83 \neligible industries under the program as those in which women-owned \nsmall businesses are underrepresented or substantially \nunderrepresented. These initiatives will help increase opportunities \nand access by women to Federal procurement.\n  Although it is anticipated that the SBA will publish the final \nversion of the women's procurement program by the end of the calendar \nyear, the program will lack critical elements that the SBA's 8(a), \nhistorically underutilized business zones, and the service-disabled \nveteran-owned government contracting programs include. To remedy this, \nour bill will help provide tools women need to compete fairly in the \nfederal contracting arena by allowing for receipt of non-competitive \ncontracts, when circumstances allow. Moreover, the legislation would \neliminate a restriction on the dollar amount of a contract that a WOSB \ncan compete for, thus putting them on a level playing field with the \nother socioeconomic contracting programs.\n  Women-owned small businesses have yet to receive their fair share of \nthe Federal marketplace. As I have stated many times, I am dismayed \nthat our Nation has repeatedly failed to meet all but one of its \nstatutory small business contracting goals. In fiscal year 2008, the \nFederal Government missed meeting its overall goal for small business \ncontracting by almost 2 percent. But not only did the Federal \nGovernment miss its overall small business goal, depriving small \nbusinesses of over $10 billion, it has never achieved its goal of 5 \npercent for WOSB, achieving only 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2008. Our \nbill would greatly assist Federal agencies in achieving the small \nbusiness goaling requirement for WOSBs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Treatment is further \ncomplicated by the location of these tumors and other obstacles to \ntheir treatment or complete surgical removal.\n  While important advances have been made in understanding brain \ntumors, daunting obstacles remain to the development of new treatments. \nMoreover, there currently are no strategies for the screening or early \ndetection of brain tumors.\n  Designation of the month of May 2010 as National Brain Tumor \nAwareness Month will help to increase awareness of the prevalence and \nnature of brain tumors and will also help to encourage efforts to \ndevelop better treatments that will improve the qualify of life and \nlong-term prognosis for those individuals who are affected. It also \ngives us the opportunity to show support for all those individuals who \nmay be battling a brain tumor, as well as for their families, friends \nand caregivers. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4148-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 538--AFFIRMING THE SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR A \n                STRONG AND VITAL ALLIANCE WITH THAILAND\n\n  Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Durbin) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. REID proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 4899, making \nemergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and summer \njobs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n   TITLE IV--PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2009\n\n     SECTION 4001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 4002. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n       (5) Many States and localities already provide public \n     safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable \n     to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth \n     in this title, and such State and local laws should be \n     respected.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

Mr. REID proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 4899, making \nemergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and summer \njobs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n   TITLE IV--PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2009\n\n     SECTION 4001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 4002. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n       (5) Many States and localities already provide public \n     safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable \n     to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth \n     in this title, and such State and local laws should be \n     respected.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 539, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 539) designating May 24, 2010, as \n     ``Prescription Drug Disposal Awareness Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today I submitted a resolution \ndesignating May 24, 2010, as ``Prescription Drug Disposal Awareness \nDay.'' May 24 would be Timothy Michael Strain's birthday. Timmy, as his \nfamily called him, died last year when he was given two painkillers \nthat had not been prescribed for him. Through their grief, his parents \nBernie and Beverly Strain have taken up the cause of safe drug disposal \nto make sure what happened to their son does not happen to others.\n  In recent years, recreational prescription drug use has grown at an \nalarming rate. In 2008, approximately 15,200,000 Americans 12 years of \nage and older reported having taken a prescription drug that had not \nbeen prescribed to them for recreational purposes in the previous year. \nOur children are finding these drugs in our medicine cabinets and the \nresults can be deadly.\n  Apart from the tragic impact on our children, the lack of a safe \nplace to dispose of prescription drugs is harming the environment and \ninfiltrating our water sources. Without a place to turn in prescription \ndrugs people are washing them down the drain where they end up in our \nrivers and in our drinking water.\n  We must work to find a safe way to dispose of prescription drugs and \nhelp make sure that what happened to Timmy Strain does not happen to \nany other child. I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Kohl for joining \nme in introducing this resolution and I encourage all my colleagues to \nwork to ensure safe methods of prescription drug disposal are available \nin their States.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Casey and Senator Kohl, in submitting a resolution to designate \nMay 24, 2010 as the ``Prescription Drug Disposal Awareness Day.''\n  The abuse of prescription narcotics such as pain relievers, \ntranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives is currently the fastest \ngrowing drug abuse trend in the country. According to the most recent \nNational Survey of Drug Use and Health, NSDUH, nearly 7 million people \nhave admitted to using controlled substances without a doctor's \nprescription. People between the ages of 12 and 25 are the most common \ngroup to abuse these drugs. However, more and more people are dying \nbecause of this abuse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nreport that the unintentional deaths involving prescription narcotics \nincreased 117 percent from the years 2001 to 2005. These are statistics \nthat can no longer be ignored and tolerated.\n  Regretfully, we read about children dying as a result of prescription \nand over-the-counter drug abuse. An article from February 2009 in the \nDes Moines Register reports on the death of a 14-year-old Brody Middle \nSchool Student who was found dead at his home from an apparent overdose \nof prescription drugs. The same article reports that 85 percent of drug \nand alcohol overdoses at the children's emergency center at Mercy \nMedical Center in Des Moines are from prescription or over-the-counter \nmedicines.\n  Millions of Americans are prescribed controlled substances every year \nto treat a variety of symptoms due to injury, depression, insomnia, and \nother conditions. Many legitimate users of these drugs often do not \nfinish their prescriptions. As a result, these drugs remain in the \nfamily medicine cabinet for months or years because people forget about \nthem or do not know how to properly dispose of them. However, these \ndrugs, when not properly used or administered, are just as addictive \nand deadly as street drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine.\n  According to the NSDUH, more than half of the people who abuse \nprescription narcotics reported that they obtained controlled \nsubstances from a friend or relative or from the family medicine \ncabinet. As a result, most community antidrug coalitions, public health \nofficials, and law enforcement officials have been encouraging people \nwithin their communities to dispose of old or unused medications in an \neffort to combat this growing trend.\n  This is also why I have cosponsored the Secure and Responsible Drug \nDisposal Act of 2010. This legislation will enable the Attorney General \nof the United States to issue guidelines to help States and communities \nestablish prescription drug take-back programs. Current law makes \nefforts to establish these programs difficult and time consuming. \nHowever, efforts to get old and unwanted medicines out of the home have \nshown signs of great promise to be successful if widely adopted. For \nexample, the town of Clinton, IA, has held an annual ``Clean Out Your \nMedicine Cabinet'' day that has collected over 300 pounds of old or \nunwanted medicine from the community. This is medicine that will not \nfall into the hands of a child or stranger or cause potential harm to \nany user.\n  It is important that we encourage people to dispose of their old or \nunwanted medicines so that they will not fall into the wrong hands. \nThis is why I am pleased to be submitting this resolution and why I \nencourage all my colleagues to join us in raising public awareness of \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 539) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 539\n\n       Whereas in 2008, pharmacies in the United States filled \n     3,649,468,866 retail drug prescriptions;\n       Whereas in 2008, approximately 15,200,000 Americans 12 \n     years of age and older reported having taken a prescription \n     drug that had not been prescribed to them for recreational \n     purposes in the previous year;\n       Whereas in 2006, approximately 26,400 deaths occurred in \n     the United States from an unintentional drug overdose;\n       Whereas prescription drugs are involved in more overdose \n     deaths annually than illegal drugs;\n       Whereas in 2007 and 2008, 55.9 percent of individuals 12 \n     years of age and older who used pain relievers nonmedically \n     in the past year had obtained the pain relievers from a \n     friend or relative for free;\n       Whereas in 2007 and 2008, of the individuals 12 years of \n     age and older who obtained nonmedical pain relievers from a \n     friend or relative for free--\n       (1) 81.7 percent indicated that the friend or relative had \n     obtained the drugs from just 1 doctor; and\n       (2) 1.6 percent reported that the friend or relative had \n     bought the drugs from a drug dealer or other stranger;\n       Whereas the improper disposal of prescription drugs may \n     result in chemicals contaminating the environment and water \n     supply; and\n       Whereas collection programs may reduce the supply of \n     unused, unwanted prescription drugs in the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 24, 2010, as ``Prescription Drug \n     Disposal Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of prescription drug disposal \n     programs to reduce the supply of unused, unwanted \n     prescription drugs in the United States; and\n       (3) encourages each State to establish and promote a \n     prescription drug collection program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/24/senate-section/article/S4162-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4162-S4163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 25, 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
