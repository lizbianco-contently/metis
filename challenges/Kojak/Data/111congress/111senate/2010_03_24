The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 19 million American families will be \ninterested in this motion because it will reduce the cost of student \nloans which 19 million Americans have. This is the season of the year \nwhen a great many students have been admitted to a college or a \ncommunity college and are making plans and looking for where they are \ngoing to get their money. This motion is aimed at reducing the interest \nrate on 19 million student loans from 6.8 percent to 5.3 percent. For \nthe average student loan debt of about $25,000, it would save that \nstudent $1,700 or $1,800 over their ten-year loan. More specifically, \nit would not only help the student, but it would prevent the Federal \nGovernment from overcharging 19 million American college students on \ntheir student loans to help pay for the health care bill and other \ngovernment programs.\n  One may say: Wait a minute, I thought we were debating the health \ncare bill. How did we get to student loans? That is a very good \nquestion because it just came up over the weekend. Of course, we have \ntalked about student loans. There have been proposals, but there have \nbeen no hearings in the Senate, no consideration in the Senate \ncommittee of which I am a member. Yet over the weekend, the Democratic \nmajority said: Well, look, while we are at it, let's have another \nWashington takeover. Let's take over the Federal student loan program. \nLet's take a program which is working very well, in which 15 million \nAmerican students have voted with their feet to say they would prefer \nto get a regular student loan backed by the government, which they get \nat their college campuses, through their community bank, through a \nnonprofit institution. Even though they do have an option for a \ngovernment loan, three out of four students have said they prefer the \nstudent loan through the private lender. Yet over the weekend, the \nDemocratic majority has said: While we are at it, let's take over the \nFederal student loan program.\n\n  That means that starting July 1, students have no choice. They go to \nthe Federal Government to get their student loan, all 19 million of \nthem, which is a new experience for 15 of the 19 million.\n  The way they are going to do it--and this is all going to be set up \nin a very short period of time--is they are now going to have to go to \nfour Federal call centers. So instead of going to their local lender or \nto their nonprofit institution, that can help them with their \napplication form and see what their options are and encourage them as \nthey make their plans for college, welcome to the new government loan \nprogram. They have no choice. That is what they are going to do.\n  What are the other aspects of this? Well, other than denying choice \nto 19 million students on more than 2,000 campuses who prefer the \nFederal loan program, the Federal Government is going to have to borrow \nanother $\\1/2\\ trillion in order to make these loans. Let's think about \nthis for a moment. What is the No. 1 issue that most Americans worry \nabout today? It is that we have too much debt. So what did this weekend \ntakeover do? It adds about $\\1/2\\ trillion to the Federal debt in order \nto make student loans, at the rate of about $90 billion or $100 billion \na year for 4 or 5 years.\n  So we take away choice, we add to the debt, and we also put 31,000 \npeople out of their jobs. These are a lot of loans, and so we have a \nlot of people in these organizations, such as Edsouth in my State, a \nnonprofit organization that helps students get their loans. So all \nthese lenders are out of business and we have one big bank--the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Education Secretary is the new banker of the year. He is a very \ngood Education Secretary, but I don't know how good a banker he is \ngoing to be.\n  But here is the rub, and this is what my motion is about. The Federal \nGovernment is going to be borrowing money at 2.8 percent and loaning it \nto students at 6.8 percent and taking the difference and spending it on \nnew government programs, including the health care bill. So we are \ngoing to be overcharging 19 million students to help pay for the health \ncare bill. And, according to the most recent Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates, about $8.7 billion of the overcharged money is going \nto go to pay for the health care bill.\n  My friends on the other side have already spent the money, of course. \nThey have announced to everybody that we are going to spend it on this \nand on that and on this, but what they do not tell you is, where they \nget the money. Where they get the money is overcharging students--\novercharging students.\n  These aren't Wall Street financiers we are overcharging. This might \nbe a single mom going to a community college in Tennessee who has a job \nbut who wants a better job and so she borrows some money to go to the \ncommunity college and the Federal Government is going to overcharge her \nto pay for some government program. She might not like that.\n  In fact, I think there will be about 19 million student loan holders \nacross the country who will go to school next year and say: Wait a \nminute here. You mean you are overcharging me on my student loan to pay \nfor this health care bill and to pay for other government programs? The \nanswer will be: Yes, that is what we are doing, unless my colleagues \nsupport this motion.\n  The estimate by our friends on the other side is that their Federal \ntakeover of the Federal student loan enterprise will save $61 billion. \nIf they are correct, let's give it to the students. Let's reduce their \ninterest rate. I mean, $1,700 or $1,800 per student in interest over 10 \nyears is the average amount of savings, and that is a lot of money. It \nmay not seem like a lot of money to Congressmen and Senators in \nWashington, but to the single mom going to the community college who is \nborrowing the money to go to school in order to get a better job, \n$1,700 or $1,800 is a lot of money.\n  So in addition to the higher premium numbers, the higher taxes, the \nMedicare cuts, and the new cost to States, we are going to be \novercharging on student loans. Let me use a specific example from \nTennessee, if I may. I was at the University of Tennessee earlier this \nweek. This is the University of which I used to be president. The \nUniversity of Tennessee has 30,000 students, and 37 percent of them--or \n11,251--have Federal private loans today. The average student debt is \nabout $20,000. After July 1, all 11,000 students at the University of \nTennessee, with these Federal loans from private lenders, are going to \nhave to switch to the government loans, and the government is going to \novercharge 11,000 students who go to the University of Tennessee at \nKnoxville and use that overcharged money to pay for new government \nprograms, including the health care bill.\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\n  They are going to do the same thing to the University of Tennessee at \nMartin. There they choose to use the private loan program. They like it \nbetter than the government loan program. They think it is more \nconvenient for the students. They have chosen--3,600 students at UT \nMartin--have chosen Federal private loans. They are going to be out of \nthose loans by July 1. They are going to have government loans, and the \ngovernment is going to overcharge them to help pay for the health care \nprogram.\n  Maryville College--I will be there Saturday night to help dedicate \ntheir arts center. There, 824 students have Federal loans today. They \nare going to have government loans. They are going to switch from \nprivate to government loans. They will have no choice after July 1. I \nknow a lot of these students. They come from modest families, in most \ncases. They are not going to be very happy to learn that when they \nswitch to a government loan after July 1, and if they have an average-\nsize loan, which is about $25,000, that over 10 years they are going to \npay $1,700 or $1,800 to help pay for the health care program or other \nnew government programs.\n  In Carson-Newman College, it is 1,259 students. In East Tennessee \nState University, it is 8,187 students. In all of Tennessee, it is \n200,000 students who have student loans who are going to be overcharged \nan average of $1,700 or $1,800 a year to help pay for the health care \nprogram or some other government program, and this amendment would say: \nNo, we are not. If we are going to take over the student loan program, \nat least we are not going to overcharge the students and use it for the \nhealth care program. We are going to give the money back to the \nstudents.\n  The point of my amendment is very simple. We are going to reduce the \ninterest rate we charge on 19 million student loans from 6.8 percent to \n5.3 percent and let the students have the savings instead of letting \nthe government have the savings. That is what the other side has not \ntold people about the student loans.\n  If we had an ample opportunity to debate this in the Senate, if we \nhad a committee hearing on it, if we had taken it through the regular \nprocess, maybe we could have pointed this out, but no, we do it over \nthe weekend, put it in the House bill, send it over here, jam it \nthrough with great breast beating and protestations: Look what we have \ndone for the country. I am accustomed to that. I used to be a Governor. \nI remember lots of Members of Congress who would say I did a great \nthing in Washington and then send the bill to me to pay. And then, as \nGovernor--in this case the health care bill will do the same thing. It \nwill send to the Governors and to the States new costs. Our Governor \nestimates it is $1.1 billion over 5 years, to $1.5 billion. That is \nabout $300 million a year new costs that State taxpayers will have to \npay.\n  As the Medicaid cost goes up, we will get the second blow to the \nstudents of Tennessee because either the State is going to have to \nreduce funding for public higher education--which I believe this health \ncare bill will help permanently damage--or they are going to have to \nraise taxes, or they are going to have to raise tuition, or they are \ngoing to have to do all three. If I am a student at Maryville College, \nCarson-Newman, or the University of Tennessee, first this health care \nbill is going to overcharge me on my student loan to help pay for it; \nsecond, it is going to send such big new costs to the government that \nthe Governor is going to have to reduce funding to my college or \nuniversity and my tuition is going to go up.\n  All those students in California who are protesting a 34-percent \nincrease in tuition probably do not realize the reason for that \nhappening. The main reason is that over the years the Federal \nGovernment has so regulated the Medicaid program that the States pay \nabout a third of, that the State budgets have grown and grown and the \nGovernors, such as Governor Schwarzenegger in California, have had no \nchoice except to cut, knowing that when you get down through the budget \nprocess you have had no choice except to cut other programs. Governors \nknow when you get down through the budget process in the State, it \nusually comes down to Medicaid or higher education. So a great \nuniversity such as the University of California is on its knees, and if \nit even hoped to keep its quality, it raises tuition 34 percent.\n  My amendment will not help that problem. The law the President signed \nyesterday already will transfer to States these huge new costs that are \ngoing to permanently damage higher education and raise tuition. But \nwhat my amendment will do is say we are not going to overcharge 200,000 \nstudents in Tennessee for their student loans and use $8.7 billion to \nhelp pay for health care.\n  Sometimes I think the motto of the Obama administration is: If you \ncan find it in the Yellow Pages, the government ought to be doing it.\n  This is breathtaking. While we are taking over cars, banks, insurance \ncompanies, while we are taking over more of health care, we will also \ntake over the student loan program, add $\\1/2\\ trillion to the Federal \ndebt, overcharge 19 million students, cause 31,000 people to lose their \njobs and say ``all in a day's work.'' That is what happened last \nweekend. Over the weekend that is the decision they made. Then over \nhere bragging about how much we are going to do for everybody. We are \ngoing to do a little more for everybody if we have a chance to vote on \nthis amendment because when we go home we will have a chance to say \neither I cut the interest rate on your student loan from 6.8 to 5.3 \npercent and give you the savings, or I voted to overcharge you $1,700 \nor $1,800 a year and give the money to the government to help pay for \nthe health care bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a few communications I received from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Here is a letter from Vanderbilt University to \nCongressman Cooper from the Chancellor which says:\n\n       Our overarching concern with [this proposal] is that the \n     legislation forces institutions, including Vanderbilt, to \n     switch to direct lending.\n\n  Here is a distinguished university, one of the top research \nuniversities in the world. They have chosen--they believe it is best \nfor their students and for their campus to use the private banks and \nnon-profits. We know better, of course, than Vanderbilt University, \nwhat is best for the campus and best for the students. We say no, July \n1, only the government.\n  In their letter they continue:\n\n       Vanderbilt opposes the elimination of the FFEL program. We \n     encourage Congress to carefully study the many alternate \n     proposals. . . . In addition to our concerns about the \n     elimination of choice, competition, and the high level of \n     services, products and debt management we believe would come \n     with this switch, we are very concerned that the proposed \n     timeframe for this mandated conversion is unreasonable.\n\n  So Vanderbilt opposes that. So does the Baptist College of Health \nSciences, so does Maryville College, so does the Middle Tennessee \nSchool of Anesthesia, so does Dyersburg State Community College.\n  I ask to have these remarks printed in the Record and an article I \nwrote in the Washington Post that was published on Sunday, March 7, \nabout the student loan takeover.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                        Vanderbilt University,\n\n                                               September 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Jim Cooper,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Cooper: The House of Representatives will \n     soon consider H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal \n     Responsibility Act which would fundamentally restructure the \n     federal student aid system and funnel the projected savings \n     into a variety of higher education and K-12 programs as well \n     as deficit reduction. While Vanderbilt supports efforts to \n     restructure and expand federal student aid programs, we have \n     serious reservations about this legislation.\n       As you know, one proposed change has to do with the Direct \n     Loan (DL) program, in which the government acts as the \n     lender, and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, \n     in which lending institutions provide loans to students. \n     Vanderbilt has a long and successful history of participation \n     in the FFEL program which has provided our students with \n     superior loan products, service, and choice in their federal \n     loans for many years.\n       Earlier this year, the administration proposed eliminating \n     the FFEL program, requiring all institutions to participate \n     in DL and using the projected $87 billion in savings over 10 \n     years from this switch to fund a mandatory Pell Grant and \n     expand the Perkins\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n     Loan program. [Other estimates have put the ten-year savings \n     figure at closer to $47 billion.] H.R. 3221 seeks to \n     implement those proposals. Unfortunately, the legislation has \n     attracted a host of other education-related provisions which, \n     while perhaps meritorious in their own right, we believe \n     should not be attached to federal student aid legislation.\n       We applaud and strongly support a number of provisions of \n     H.R. 3221:\n       Modest increases to Pell Grants. Any increase in Pell \n     Grants is deeply appreciated and will benefit undergraduate \n     students. Although the bill does not create the mandatory \n     Pell Grant proposed by the administration, it calls for $40 \n     billion of the projected savings to be invested in the Pell \n     Grant program, moving it toward a $6,900 maximum grant by \n     2019.\n       Converts Stafford Loan interest rates from fixed to \n     variable. The bill provides $3.25 billion to change the fixed \n     interest rates on subsidized loans to a variable rate capped \n     at 6.8 percent.\n       Simplifies the FAFSA. We support reasonable efforts \n     included in the bill to simplify the FAFSA for federal \n     student aid programs.\n\n\n                      Eliminating the FFEL Program\n\n       Our overarching concern with H.R. 3221 is that the \n     legislation forces institutions, including Vanderbilt, to \n     switch to Direct Lending. Of additional concern is the fact \n     that the proposed legislation does not then direct all of the \n     savings from this federal mandate back into federal aid \n     programs. Vanderbilt opposes the elimination of the FFEL \n     program. We encourage Congress to carefully study the many \n     alternate proposals to a mandatory conversion to DL. In \n     addition to our concerns about the elimination of choice, \n     competition, and the high level of services, products and \n     debt management that we believe would come with this switch, \n     we are very concerned that the proposed timeframe for this \n     mandated conversion is unreasonable. Institutions will need \n     sufficient time to make changes to their IT systems and \n     update their printed and on-line recruitment materials. \n     Completing this by the proposed July 1, 2010 deadline is \n     simply not feasible. In fact, Vanderbilt has already printed \n     many of its recruitment materials and launched its 2010-2011 \n     admissions and financial aid efforts. We would advise that, \n     if a mandated conversion to DL is implemented, the earliest \n     effective date be July 1, 2011.\n\n\n                       A New Perkins Loan Program\n\n       The bill restructures the Perkins Loan program into \n     essentially a second DL program that is campus-based, with an \n     additional $5 billion. The legislation proposes a complex \n     institutional allocation formula based on holding past \n     participants, such as Vanderbilt, harmless, while \n     significantly expanding participation based on low tuition \n     and improved Pell recipient graduation rates. We believe that \n     a Perkins program allocation formula should be based on the \n     aggregate need of an institution's students relative to the \n     aggregate need of all students at institutions participating \n     in the program nationally, subject to and including the hold \n     harmless provisions.\n       While Vanderbilt supports expanding participation in the \n     Perkins Loan program as well as the provisions that would \n     hold harmless existing participants, we are troubled by \n     proposals to eliminate the in-school interest subsidy and \n     loan forgiveness programs. These features have made Perkins \n     Loans uniquely attractive for many of our students. \n     Vanderbilt also opposes proposals to require institutions to \n     pay the accrued interest while students are still enrolled in \n     school. This would impose significant costs on our financial \n     aid budget and could jeopardize our participation in the \n     program. H.R. 3221 is also not clear as to whether \n     institutional matching funds will be required or how that \n     determination would be made.\n\n\n       Creates Access, Completion, and Persistence Grant Programs\n\n       Included in the bill is $3 billion for the College Access \n     Challenge Grant program. These funds would be allocated \n     primarily to states and guaranty agencies with a small \n     portion retained for a national competition. While Vanderbilt \n     supports the goals of this program, and is proud of our 95 \n     percent freshman retention and 92 percent six-year graduation \n     rates, we are concerned that diverting up to 75 percent of \n     the funding to the states could severely restrict the ability \n     of private institutions to compete for the funding and could \n     inappropriately increase state oversight of private \n     institutions. We also believe that any savings generated from \n     the switch to DL should remain in the existing federal \n     student aid programs.\n       In addition to these, there are several other provisions of \n     the legislation that are troubling to us:\n       Family Asset Cap. Students with family assets of more than \n     $150,000 would be ineligible for any need-based federal aid. \n     While the value of a family's house, farm, business, or \n     employee pension benefit plan would be excluded, we believe \n     this cap should be increased to at least $250,000, geographic \n     factors should be applied, and an option established for \n     financial aid administrators to be able to use their \n     professional judgment such that students and parents in \n     unique circumstances can be held harmless by this provision.\n       Beyond Student Aid. H.R. 3221 goes far beyond federal \n     student aid to include funding for other higher education \n     programs as well as K-12 school construction and early \n     childhood education. We believe that all savings generated \n     from the student aid programs should remain in these \n     programs. These initiatives, while potentially meritorious, \n     should be funded through avenues other than student aid \n     programs' savings.\n       H.R. 3221 truly is a mixed hag. While Vanderbilt supports \n     the significant new investment in the Pell Grant program, we \n     are concerned that allocations to other initiatives have \n     significantly reduced the possible level of support for the \n     Pell Grant program. We remain strongly opposed to the \n     elimination of the FFEL program. And, although it could bring \n     low-cost Perkins Loans to millions of new students, we are \n     troubled by proposals to eliminate the in-school interest \n     subsidy and other changes to that program.\n       Vanderbilt remains committed to the federal student aid \n     programs, which provide a foundation to our aid packages for \n     both undergraduate and graduate students. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you to ensure that all capable and \n     eligible students, regardless of financial circumstances, are \n     able to access and complete post-secondary education. If you \n     have any questions or if I can provide any additional \n     information, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christina D. West,\n     Director of Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         Tennessee Association of Student Financial Aid \n           Administrators,\n                                                November 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: On behalf of the Executive Board of \n     the Tennessee Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators (TASFAA), I want to communicate to you our \n     collective concerns regarding the Federal Student Loan \n     Program (Stafford and PLUS).\n       TASFAA represents financial aid officers from 106 \n     postsecondary institutions in Tennessee. The Tennessee \n     postsecondary institutions serve several thousand students, \n     many who are student loan borrowers. While our membership and \n     schools are located within Tennessee, we have students from \n     every state in the Union. We seek your support of our \n     requests, which are made on behalf of the students and \n     parents we serve. These students and parents have been well \n     served by not only the institutions and individual \n     professionals, but by the Federal Direct Lending Program \n     (FDSLP) through the Department of Education and by private \n     sector lenders within the Federal Family Education Loan \n     Program (FFELP) also. Importantly, our students and parents \n     have benefitted by the opportunity to seek out lenders who \n     offer loans with savings and service that aid the borrowers \n     throughout repayment.\n       TASFAA is an advocate for choice within the respective loan \n     programs. As President Obama stated in his address to a Joint \n     Session of Congress, ``Consumers do better when there is \n     choice and competition.'' We also want to focus on the timing \n     of all schools currently participating in the FFELP having to \n     switch to the Federal Direct Student Loan Program should the \n     Senate version of H.R. 3221 be enacted. Recent information \n     from the Department of Education showed that 1,990 of the \n     5,455 schools that participate in federal student loan \n     programs are currently participating in the Direct Loan \n     Program. Therefore, 3,465 colleges and universities across \n     the country, that serve millions of students, are not yet \n     participating in the FDSLP.\n       Many elected officials have expressed their concerns \n     regarding the timing of such a transition. Most Tennessee \n     institutions will begin awarding financial aid packages to \n     traditional students in early spring. In addition to the \n     traditional calendar, some institutions have non-traditional \n     students in year-round programs who borrow student loans \n     throughout the year in what is known as the Borrower-Based \n     Academic Year (BBAY). For these students, loans will be \n     packaged in approximately four weeks, and the precarious \n     status of the legislation may greatly harm these student \n     borrowers. The Secretary's assistant has noted it will take \n     3-4 months for schools to convert their programs. Due to the \n     issues related to the transition to a new program (shortage \n     of staff members, new software systems, lack of training, \n     financial issues at small schools, etc.), we ask that you \n     consider the dilemma that these students face by the timing \n     of such an action and at the very least, delay the \n     implementation of full conversion to FDSLP to July 1, 2011.\n       If you choose to support the Senate version of H.R. 3221 \n     and move forward with full conversion to FDSLP but allow for \n     the delayed implementation date, we implore you to support S. \n     2796 to extend the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans \n     Act (ECASLA). ECASLA has assured that students have been able \n     to obtain the loan(s) necessary to ensure their educational \n     goals and dreams. This action will ensure that every \n     educational loan borrower will be able to continue to secure \n     the respective loan with no interrupted service.\n       As of the date of this letter, the Senate committee of \n     jurisdiction has not acted on this proposed legislation, as \n     well as the entire Senate or any conferees. This is of major \n     concern to us as the timing of the possible conversion to, \n     and implementation of, 100 percent FDSLP is further delayed. \n     The Senate had noted it would vote on H.R. 3221 by\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n     October 15, 2009, but as of the date of this letter, proposed \n     legislation still has not reached the Senate for a vote.\n       With all of the above taken into consideration, the \n     Executive Board of TASFAA, on behalf of our entire \n     membership, urges you to support ``choice and competition.'' \n     But if not, we ask you to implement a reasonable timeframe \n     for transition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Marian Malone Huffman,\n     President, TASFAA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Baptist College\n\n\n                                           of Health Sciences,\n\n                                   Memphis, TN, November 24, 2009.\n       Members of Congress: I ask that you support H.R. 4103 and \n     S. 2796 to ensure uninterrupted FFELP funding of Federal \n     Student Loans for students and parents attending colleges and \n     universities across the country.\n       I have worked in the student financial aid profession since \n     1982, ALWAYS at FFELP schools. In my many years of \n     experience, I have witnessed tens of thousands of students \n     being well served by the FFELP system. The idea of the \n     Federal Direct Student Loan Programs certainly contributed to \n     needed improvements to FFELP, and the two programs have \n     served to keep each other ``on their toes.'' To shift now to \n     a federal monopoly in the student loan business could prove \n     to be a monumental mistake.\n       Schools have had plenty of time to choose between FFELP and \n     Direct Lending. It is clear that FFELP works better for some \n     schools and Direct Lending for other schools. And most \n     importantly, BOTH programs do a good job of serving needy \n     students attend college. Let's please keep it that way.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Janet Bonney-Baker,\n\n                         Financial Aid Supervisor, Baptist College\n     of Health Sciences.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Office of Financial Aid,\n\n\n                             Dyersburg State Community College\n\n                                  Dyersburg, TN, November 25, 2009\n       As a student financial aid administrator for over thirty-\n     five years, I have concerns regarding students receiving \n     needed funds to attend post-secondary institutions in the \n     2010-2011 academic year. Regardless of our stance on direct \n     lending, we all have one common bond, and that is helping the \n     students we serve.\n       All schools are planning for the 2010-2011 academic year, \n     and we feel trapped. I implore you to consider extending the \n     Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act (ECASLA) as \n     quickly as possible, so that the students in this country \n     will not suffer with the uncertainties accompanying delays in \n     implementation of new programs. Timing is critical for higher \n     education in this country.\n       Please consider choice as the loan option for the students \n     of this country. Competition and choice is a foundation of \n     our economy. As President Obama stated in his address to a \n     Joint Session of Congress, ``consumers do better when there \n     is choice and competition''.\n       The Secretary's assistant has noted that it will take 3-4 \n     months for schools to convert their programs. Due to the \n     issues related to the transition to a new program (shortage \n     of staff members, new software systems, lack of training, \n     financial issues at small schools, etc.), please consider \n     delaying the implementation of full conversion of the Federal \n     Direct Student Loan Program to July 1, 2011, at the earliest \n     which will provide us with a reasonable timeframe for \n     transition, if choice is not an option for us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sandra Rockett,\n     Director of Financial Aid.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Middle Tennessee\n\n\n                                         School of Anesthesia,\n\n                                                November 24, 2009.\n       Members of Congress: I ask you to support H.R. 4103 and S. \n     2796 to ensure uninterrupted FFELP funding of Federal Student \n     Loans for students and parents attending colleges and \n     universities across the country.\n       I am the sole worker in Financial Aid at Middle Tennessee \n     School of Anesthesia, (MTSA) and we like the FFELP program. \n     The students here at MTSA DO NOT want to use Direct Lending. \n     The decision to end the FFELP program takes away the right to \n     choose. The advent of the Federal Direct Student Loan \n     Programs certainly contributed to needed improvements to \n     FFELP, and the two programs have served to keep each other \n     ``on their toes.'' To shift now to a federal monopoly in the \n     student loan business could prove to be a monumental mistake. \n     Having the ability to use both programs gives the Financial \n     Aid Industry a healthy competition.\n       Schools should have the ability to talk to different \n     lenders and choose between FFELP and Direct Lending. It is \n     clear that FFELP works better for some schools and Direct \n     Lending for other schools. And most importantly, BOTH \n     programs do a good job of serving needy students attending \n     college.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          M.

As a financial aid \n     professional, I know firsthand the importance of these funds \n     in meeting students' educational expenses. I believe that \n     competition breeds excellence and I am in favor of keeping \n     both the FFEL and Direct programs in place. To eliminate FFEL \n     especially during this particular time in history, would be a \n     mistake that would cost institutions and students time and \n     money that we simply can't afford.\n       An interruption in the delivery of these funds would create \n     a hardship for many students and make the neediest among them \n     unable to attend college. This bill will ensure that \n     sufficient funds will be available for students in the 2010-\n     2011 academic year.\n       Please Vote YES to H.R. 4103 and S. 2796! Thank you for \n     your understanding and support of our students!\n           Most Sincerely,\n                                                   Ashley Bianchi,\n     Acting Director of Financial Aid.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    And Now for Students, Big Lender\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       While health-care reform occupies the spotlight, the Obama \n     administration is pushing for another Washington takeover--\n     this time of the student loan system. Last month, U.S. \n     Education Secretary Arne Duncan made the administration's \n     latest pitch on this page.\n       Here is what the administration and congressional Democrats \n     have told us about this latest attempt: Starting in July, all \n     19 million students who want government-backed loans will \n     line up at offices designated by the U.S. Education \n     Department. Gone will be the days when students and their \n     colleges picked the lender that best fit their needs; \n     instead, a federal bureaucrat will make that choice for every \n     student in America based on still-unclear guidelines. They \n     say that this will save taxpayers up to $87 billion in \n     subsidies that now go to ``greedy'' banks. In gleeful \n     anticipation, members of Congress have lined up to spend \n     those billions on Pell Grants and almost a dozen other \n     programs. Banks are punished. Students are helped. Members of \n     Congress look good.\n       Here is what they haven't told us: The Education Department \n     will borrow money at 2.8 percent from the Treasury, lend it \n     to you at 6.8 percent and spend the difference on new \n     programs. So you'll work longer to pay off your student loan \n     to help pay for someone else's education--and to help your \n     U.S. representative's reelection.\n       And there are some other things the government should tell \n     you: The estimated $87 billion in savings isn't real. \n     According to a July 2009 letter from the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) to Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), the savings are \n     closer to $47 billion including administration costs, if we \n     use the same ``scoring'' (i.e., cost analysis) method that \n     Congress required the CBO to use when it scored the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program last year because the method would more \n     accurately calculate the cost to taxpayers.\n       Finally, the government should disclose that getting your \n     student loan will become about as enjoyable as going to the \n     Department of Motor Vehicles.\n       Today, roughly 2,000 lenders offer government-backed \n     student loans on more than 4,000 campuses. One lender, \n     Edsouth, offers Tennessee students college and career \n     counselors, financial-aid training, and college-admissions \n     assistance; performs hundreds of presentations at Tennessee \n     schools; and works with 12,000 Tennessee students to improve \n     their understanding of the college-admissions and financial-\n     aid process.\n       Nonprofit lenders such as Edsouth use the revenue generated \n     under the student-loan system to operate and provide these \n     valuable benefits--but of course, these services cost money. \n     If--under this latest Washington takeover--Edsouth and other \n     nonprofit lenders are prevented from making the number of \n     loans they make today, they will no longer be able to provide \n     these services, depriving students of real choices in \n     lending.\n       The student loan ``Banker of the Year'' will be the only \n     student loan banker left calling the shots; the education \n     secretary in Washington. Imagine trying to get all Edsouth's \n     services from a federal call center.\n       I was education secretary for President George H.W. Bush \n     when, in 1991, Congress offered students a choice for borrow \n     from a local lender or the Education Department. In 2008, 15 \n     million students voted with their feet and chose \n     nongovernment lenders--and only 4 million students chose to \n     get their loans from Washington.\n       Congress has reduced subsidies paid to lenders twice in the \n     past four years, investing the savings in Pell Grants and \n     other programs. But if there really is $47 billion in savings \n     to be found, Congress should return it to students as lower \n     interest rates, not trick students by overcharging them so \n     Washington can create more government programs.\n       Seven-eighths of students who applied for federal aid using \n     the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) had an \n     average loan debt of $24,651. Assuming a standard 10-year \n     repayment at 6.8 percent, those students would pay roughly \n     $9,400 in interest. If we really want to have students money, \n     why not just reduce the interest rate by 1.5 percentage \n     points, to 5.3 percent, saving students $2,240 in interest?\n       If this Washington takeover happens, I propose that all 19 \n     million-plus student loans made by the government carry this \n     warning label:\n       ``Beware: Your federal government is overcharging you so \n     your representative can\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n     take credit for starting new government programs. Enjoy the \n     extra hours you work to pay off your student loan.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am recognized, correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent at this time to withdraw the \namendment of the Senator from--on behalf of the Senator from Tennessee, \nI ask to withdraw his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I regret, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I withdraw my motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I yield such time as he may \ntake off the bill to Senator Alexander to discuss his amendment, which \nhe is not offering at this time, while retaining the right to the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is the \nparliamentary situation at the moment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a Grassley amendment \npending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire has \nyielded time off the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee has been \nrecognized.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire cannot reserve his right to the floor.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I ask who has the floor?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, would you let me know when 10 more \nminutes has expired, please?\n  I have a little history with the student loan program. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah is here. When he was the ranking \nRepublican on the Senate Health and Education Committee 20 years ago, I \nwas the U.S. Education Secretary. He even helped me in my confirmation \nprocess, for which I have always been deeply grateful. But he and I \nworked together during that time when the question of having a \ngovernment loan program or a direct loan program came up. It was widely \ndiscussed. We had a Republican President then and a Democratic \nCongress. We came to a compromise. The compromise was to say let's have \nboth. We will give students the option and help them stay on and keep \nthe organizations on their toes. So if you are a student at the \nUniversity of Tennessee, University of Utah, you have a choice. You can \neither say I don't want to fool with all these private lenders or the \nlocal bank or the nonprofit organizations in my State or Edsouth or \nothers or the State organization, I want to go straight to the \ngovernment. All institutions have that choice. That is 6,000 colleges \nand universities and 19 million students. Only one-fourth of them \nchoose the government direct lending program.\n  In the United States of America where choice and competition is an \nimportant part of our culture, that usually teaches us a lesson. That \nwould suggest to us that most campuses, most students, by overwhelming \nmajorities prefer being in the private market to lining up to go to the \ngovernment. Otherwise we would have the government grocery store, we \nwould have the government car company. Actually we are beginning to \nsound like that in this country. We would have the government insurance \ncompany and all banks would be government banks. Everything would be in \nthe government.\n  They used to have a system like that in the Soviet Union. Ours did a \nlittle better over time. Generally, our motto has been if you can find \nit in the Yellow Pages the government should not be doing it. What is \nhappening with this administration and this Congress is the reverse. If \nyou can find it in the Yellow Pages, the government should be doing it.\n  Here is the situation that developed over the last 20 years. There \nare roughly 6,000 institutions of higher education in this country. \nMany people say all higher education is like the University of \nTennessee or Harvard or University of California, but there are many \nkinds of colleges and universities--for-profit, nonprofit, private, \npublic, historically Black colleges, many different kinds of \ninstitutions. The genius of our system is that we let Federal dollars, \neither through Pell grants or through loans, follow the student to the \ninstitution of their choice. Choice and competition in our system of \nhigher education has given us by far the best system of higher \neducation in the world.\n  Of those 6,000 institutions, last year, 2008, 4,421 schools chose to \nuse the regular student loan program. That is three out of four. About \none out of four used the government loan, the direct loan program, the \none that everybody is going to be made to use now. Currently there are \njust under 2,000 lenders who participate in the student loan program. \nThey are banks and they are nonprofit institutions such as Edsouth in \nTennessee.\n  Last year nearly $100 billion in student loans was made. Let's keep \nin mind as the government takes this over we go from a system where we \nhave government-backed loans, which cost the taxpayers very little, to \ngovernment loans at the rate of $100 billion a year which means we are \ngoing to have to run up a half trillion more in debt at a time when our \ndebt is ridiculously out of control. That is this weekend's newest \nWashington takeover that just occurred.\n  There is not definitive evidence to suggest that the Federal \nGovernment can make these loans better than lenders can make these \nloans. I don't think the Department of Education has the manpower to do \nit. I think that by July 1 there is going to be consternation all over \nthe country from families who have applied for student loans and are \napplying through their Federal call center or through the Internet.\n  Edsouth, a nonprofit provider in Tennessee, for example, has five \nregional outreach counselors who canvas Tennessee and provide career \ntraining. They made 443 presentations to Tennessee schools to help \nstudents understand--remember, we have 200,000 of these students in \nTennessee--to help them understand their options. They worked with \n12,000 students to help them understand what they could do. They worked \nwith 1,000 school counselors.\n  The U.S. Department of Education will soon be providing all of these \nservices.\n  Senator Gregg earlier had written the Congressional Budget Office \nasking how much money this Federal takeover would save. They came back \nwith an explanation that it is not $67 billion or $61 billion, which is \nthe current number being used today, but more like $47 billion. My own \nsuspicion, and I cannot prove it, but my own suspicion, having been a \nuniversity president, having been Secretary of Education and having \nwatched this program for 20 years, is that in the real world the \nFederal Government is not going to make these 19 million loans more \nconvenient for students. It is not going to be able to do it any \ncheaper. It is just going to deny people choice, run up the debt, throw \n31,000 people out of jobs, and the icing on the cake, and it is a sour-\ntasting icing, is that the 19 million students who have student loans \nafter July 1 are going to be overcharged by the Federal Government, \nwhich will be borrowing money at 2.8 percent, loaning it at 6.8 \npercent, and using the money to help pay for the health care bill and \nother programs.\n  Our friends on the other side, they will be saying--they like to \nblame everything on the bankers or the lenders--well, the lenders are \ncharging too much money. Well, if they are charging too much money, \nreduce what they get.\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nYou are saying there are $61 billion in savings, much of which comes \nfrom the fact that the Federal Government can borrow money more cheaply \nthan private lenders can.\n  But then you are saying, we are going to take the savings and we are \ngoing to spend it. We are going to overcharge these students. I can't \nbelieve the brazenness of this, and I believe neither will 19 million \nstudents understand it.\n  So I am glad to come to the floor today and talk about my motion, \nwhich I will be glad to introduce at the appropriate time. No Senate \nbill has been introduced. Our committee has held no hearings. We have \nnot had a markup of this bill. This is a wondrous Washington takeover \nover the weekend.\n  We stick into the health care bill another Washington takeover, this \ntime of 19 million student loans. On top of it: Congratulations, Mr. \nand Mrs. Working Student, you are going to get to be overcharged on \nyour loan to help pay for the health care bill and other government \nprograms.\n  I hope my friends in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, will see \nthe injustice of this and say: OK, you are right, Senator Alexander. If \nwe are going to take it over, and if we are going to create $61 billion \nin savings, at least let's give the students the savings. Let's not \ngive it to the government. Let's not overcharge the students, on an \naverage $25,000 student debt, $1,700 or $1,800 over 10 years.\n  I think we need to have a truth-and-lending stamp that goes on every \nsingle student loan starting July 1 that says: Warning. Your government \nis overcharging you in order to help pay for other government programs.\n  We will let the single mom who has a job, who is going to school to \nhelp improve her circumstances, see what she thinks about the idea of \nher being overcharged to help pay for other government programs.\n  So my motion, when it is voted on, will do a very simple thing. It \nwill say to the 19 million students in the country: We are going to \nreduce your interest rate on your student loan from a typical 6.8 \npercent to 5.3 percent. That is going to save you $1,700 or $1,800 on \nan average loan over ten years. It says: We are not going to overcharge \n19 million students to help pay for the health care bill.\n  Before I yield the floor, I see my friend from New Hampshire is \nengaged in conversation. I wonder if I could address the Senator from \nNew Hampshire through the Chair. Before I yield the floor, I wished to \nask, through the Chair, whether that is what I should do.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I would like to ask the Senator from Tennessee a \nquestion on the substance of his proposal.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be glad to take the Senator's question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Because I do think it is an important proposal. As I \nunderstand it, what the Senator is saying is that they put this baggage \non the train, which is the nationalization of all student loans in this \ncountry, the government is going to take them all over, which will be \nthe fourth major nationalization event this administration has \nundertaken.\n  First, they nationalized the auto industry. Now, they are in the \nprocess of quasi-nationalizing the health care industry. Now they are \ngoing to nationalize the educational industry. If the House final \nreform bill passes, they will essentially be nationalizing the \nfinancial industry--or having the capacity to--because they can break \nup any company, whether they are healthy or not, under the Kanjorski \namendment.\n  So my question is: They threw this proposal on the train, \nnationalizing the student loan industry, in order to use student loan \nmoney to finance the health care bill because this bill would have \nviolated the budget rules if it did not have the student loan money \nbasically paying for it?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am afraid the Senator from New \nHampshire is exactly right. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice's updated estimate, $8.7 billion of this money that is being \novercharged to students will be used to help pay for the health care \nbill.\n  The other money, except for a small part, will be used for other \ngovernment programs. So you are right on both counts--one Washington \ntakeover after another. That is why I am saying, I think we ought to \nhide the Yellow Pages from these fellows because if they find something \nin there that is being done in the private sector, they are going to \nsay: Oh, we can cut out the profit, we can cut out the business; why \ndoes not the government do it?\n  Then, second, I mean this is astonishing to me. These are not Wall \nStreet financiers going to community colleges in New Hampshire and \nTennessee, these are people with jobs who are trying to improve their \nlot. Their student loan levels are already too high. We are worried \nabout that. So we are going to take another $1,700 or $1,800 on a \n$25,000 average loan over 10 years. We are just going to say: Well, we \nwill overcharge you. We are going to use that in government. The answer \nis, yes, to your question, Senator; $8.7 billion of the money taken \nfrom students by overcharging them on their student loans will go to \nhelp pay for the health care bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I can ask a further question of the Senator. If they \ndid not have that $8.7 billion of student loan money being used to \nfinance the health care bill, this reconciliation bill would fall; \nwould it not? Because it would not meet the budget instructions of \nhaving $1 billion of savings.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator had a further question about whether the floor \ncould be yielded. We are in the process of seeking a unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was going to ask the Senator from Tennessee a question.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be glad to have a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is it not true that the Congressional Budget Office \nstated in a letter, dated March 20, commented on the bill in a letter \nto the Speaker on page 13, where it states: The title as a whole--that \nis referring to the education title--states that the title as a whole \nwould reduce budget deficits in both the 10-year projection period and \nin subsequent years.\n  Is it not true that the Congressional Budget Office reached that \nconclusion and so states in their letter of March 20?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I do not have that letter in front of \nme, and I do not know what that has to do with my amendment.\n  What I am saying is, the Democratic majority is deliberately \novercharging 19 million students to help pay for the health care bill. \nThose are the Congressional Budget Office's figures, not mine.\n  I would ask, through the Chair, to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwhether I should at this point yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Tennessee's courtesy. At \nthis time, we are ready to go forward with a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will propose a unanimous consent. \nFollowing that, I will state my intention on the order of votes, which \nI have yet to clear with the leader's office.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the total time on the bill be divided \nequally between the majority and minority leaders or their designees \nand that the offering of amendments not add additional claims to the \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I would simply note that \nthe next amendment on our side would be offered by Senator Hatch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask further unanimous consent----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to finish up that business. It is \nsomething, I think, the Senator will appreciate.\n  It is my intention--I am not asking for a unanimous consent \nagreement, but it is my intention that the order of amendments would \nbe, beginning with the Gregg amendment, Medicare; McCain, target \nprovisions; then the Crapo amendment on taxes; then the Enzi motion to \ncommit, regarding employer mandates; the Barrasso amendment regarding \npremiums; and then,\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nnext, the Grassley amendment regarding executive personnel should be in \nthe exchange.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand what the Senator is asking, is that the \nvoting order be in the order they were offered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. I am not asking consent. That is my \nintention, but there is no unanimous consent request at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from----\n  Mr. GREGG. May I make a point? Mr. President, I spoke \ninappropriately. I believe the Senator from Tennessee will want to \nsubmit his amendment back for the Record. He had withdrawn it. Can we \ndo that?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be the Senator \nfrom Tennessee's amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I might ask if the \nunderstanding be that the motion, as on the earlier amendments, that \nthis motion be set aside until a time to be determined by the leaders.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we do that on every amendment we offer so we do \nnot have to do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Alexander motion is pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, under the motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the debate which will come to a close this \nweek has, in one sense, been going on for a year. But in another sense, \nit has been going on for a century.\n  In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt campaigned on the promise of a national \nhealth insurance program. Workers, Roosevelt said, are entitled to a \nbasic standard of protection from injury and illness.\n\n       Wherever such standards are not met by given \n     establishments, by given industries, are unprovided for by a \n     Legislature, or are balked by unenlightened courts, the \n     workers are in jeopardy, the progressive employer is \n     penalized, and the community pays a heavy cost in lessened \n     efficiency and in misery.\n\n  Well, since Teddy Roosevelt said that, Presidents and Members of \nCongress from both parties, seeing the same costs Theodore Roosevelt \nsaw in the failure to assure health care for all, have grappled with \nthis issue.\n  These attempts at reform have largely fallen short. They have \nfoundered for many reasons: Health care is personal and complex. The \ntiming was wrong or the politics were difficult. Leaders on all sides \nfailed to find the compromises that would have enabled them to move \nforward. But the recurring theme is that time and again, reformers have \nfailed to overcome the enormous obstacles that those who profit from \nthe status quo have been able to erect. Because we have fallen short in \nthe past, Americans today face a health care system that costs too much \nand too often delivers too little.\n  In our United States today, mothers and fathers wonder what else they \ncan cut from the family budget to afford yet another increase in their \nhealth care premiums. Parents file for bankruptcy because their \ninsurance fell thousands of dollars short in providing for a child's \nlifesaving treatment. Nearly two-thirds of bankruptcies in this country \ninvolve medical costs, and more than half of those involve people who \nhad insurance.\n  Small business owners eliminate health coverage for employees because \nthey cannot afford another year of massive premium increases. Thousands \nof Americans who woke this morning with health care insurance will go \nto bed tonight without it.\n  Despite those tragic facts, entrenched interests have sought again to \nprevent reform to consign our Nation to an unsustainable status quo \nbecause what is good for the American people will not necessarily \nprofit some company.\n  The health insurance industry has dominated health care decisions in \nthis country for too long. How often have our constituents come to us \nwith stories of insurance companies that deny them coverage of \nnecessary treatment? How often have our constituents told us of \ninsurance companies that deny coverage because of preexisting \nconditions or canceled coverage because of minor inaccuracies the \ncompany conveniently discovered just after diagnosis of a serious and \ncostly illness?\n  It is time to end the unhealthy dominance of the health insurance \nindustry. So I will cast my vote again against those entrenched \ninterests and my vote will be for health care reform. I hope our \ncolleagues will do the same.\n  We have the opportunity to finish the task of overcoming the \nentrenched opposition to do what so many Presidents and so many Members \nof this body have fought for decades to accomplish.\n  The months of debate have been difficult. They have too often been \nfilled with too much heat and too little light, with exaggeration, with \nhalf-truth, with untruth, with innuendo designed to obscure rather than \nto inform.\n  That is no different in many ways from some previous debates on major \nreforms. When Congress approved Social Security in 1935, one Republican \nSenator warned that it would ``end the progress of a great country.'' \nWhen Medicare was debated in 1965, one critic charged that cooperating \nwith the plan would be ``complicit in evil.'' Scare tactics of the past \nproved absurd, but they worked.\n  Now we get more scare tactics. A number of our Republican colleagues \ncontinue to claim this is a big government takeover of health care. The \nAmerican Medical Association supports this health care plan. Surely the \nAmerican Medical Association is not a supporter of a government \ntakeover of health care. Then we are told this will hurt Medicare. Yet \nthe association that represents more seniors than any other, AARP, \nendorses this health care plan.\n  The scare tactics are coming at it again, but there is a difference. \nWhile scare tactics were able to derail health care reform in the past, \nscare tactics are just not working this time. The American people have \nexpressed their disapproval of wild, inaccurate claims in many ways, \nincluding personal conversations with most of us.\n  It is true that because health care is so complex, because changes \nmust be phased in and transition periods are often necessary, many of \nthe benefits of this bill will not take effect for some time. But \nimprovements in health care for millions of Americans will take place \nalmost immediately.\n  After President Obama signed this bill into law, small businesses \nimmediately got a tax cut to help defray the cost of providing \ninsurance to their employees. Within 3 months of the signing yesterday, \nthe bill will allow people with preexisting conditions to access a \nspecial fund to help cover the gap until insurance exchanges, where \nthey can obtain coverage, become operational. And retiree health plans \nwill qualify for a reinsurance program to help lower cost. In October, \nthe Federal Government will begin helping States set up agencies to \nhelp consumers choose new health plans or to challenge unfair decisions \nby their current insurance plan. Eventually, those agencies will help \nconsumers enroll in insurance exchanges that will help millions of \npeople find dependable coverage that meets minimum quality standards at \na price they are more likely to afford. Within 6 months of the \nPresident's signature yesterday, insurance reforms will begin to take \nhold. New health plans will be required to let women see an OB/GYN \nwithout seeking insurance company approval. They will be prohibited \nfrom denying coverage to children based on preexisting conditions and \nrequired to allow children to remain on their parents' policies until \nage 26. Insurance companies will have to provide preventive care \nwithout copays or deductibles, and they will be barred from setting \nlifetime coverage limits. Those historic improvements in our health \ncare system will take place within the first 6 months after enactment \nof this legislation.\n  More sweeping changes will come with full implementation of this \nbill's provisions. We will protect Americans of all ages from denial of \ncoverage based on preexisting conditions, from annual limits on \ntreatment, from exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, and from confusing and \nopaque language that disguises the cost or the scope of coverage. We \nwill even require insurers to give customers a rebate if those insurers \ndon't spend enough revenue on patient care. We will fill the Medicare\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\ndoughnut hole that hurts many seniors.\n  At its heart, this bill and its improvements in this reconciliation \neffort aim to tackle the central problems of our health care system--\nrising costs and the insecurity many Americans rightly feel about the \nlack of dependability of their insurance.\n  The cost of health care already exceeds the ability of many American \nfamilies to pay, will price more and more families out of the system if \nit continues to rise, and will present enormous problems for the \nFederal budget if not contained. We can and we will make the health \ninsurance system work for those who already have coverage by holding \ndown those unsustainable increases in premiums. In ways large and \nsmall, we attempt to tame this beast that threatens to swallow family \nbudgets and our Federal budget.\n  How are we going to do this?\n  I ask the Chair how many minutes I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, even though health care experts believe these measures \nare going to help lower costs for families and the government, the CBO \nis not even taking into account the savings which will come into \nexistence by ending wasteful subsidies to insurance companies using \nMedicare Advantage, by requiring Medicare Advantage to spend at least \n85 percent of revenue on benefits, and by other kinds of savings. Some \nof those savings cannot be figured out precisely by the Congressional \nBudget Office. So they are prudent. They don't even take those savings \ninto account. But what they do, obviously, take into account and do \ncount are savings which will lead to $140 billion for the Federal \nbudget in the first 10 years and $1 trillion over the next decade. \nThose savings are real savings. Those are savings which they can figure \nout and cost.\n  We are going to subject investment income of the Nation's wealthiest \nfamilies with incomes over $250,000 to the Medicare tax. We are going \nto impose a moderate Medicare tax increase on those who have that kind \nof earned income, over $\\1/4\\ million.\n  This bill cracks down on artificial financial structures. I commend \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Baucus and his colleagues. They are \ncracking down on artificial financial structures with no economic \nsubstance whose only purpose is to allow their users to avoid taxes. \nThe Finance Committee has struggled with that issue for years. They \nhave been trying to do this for years. They have succeeded. We pick up \nan awful lot of revenue that is owed to Uncle Sam by ending this kind \nof loophole which has allowed wealthy individuals to avoid paying taxes \nthrough the use of artificial financial structures that have no \neconomic substance, whose only purpose is to avoid paying income taxes.\n  We will take an enormous step with the passage of this reconciliation \nbill, joined with the bill the President signed yesterday. Leaders of \nour country--from Franklin Roosevelt to Harry Truman, Richard Nixon to \nTed Kennedy--have fought so hard for these kinds of reforms. We are \nfinally going to provide health insurance to millions of Americans who \ndo not now have it, and we are going to protect those workers who Teddy \nRoosevelt warned nearly 100 years ago were in jeopardy unless every \nAmerican had health insurance.\n  Opponents of reform are vocal. They are strident. We are going to \nhear amendment after amendment being offered in an attempt to derail \nthis effort. I hope our colleagues will answer history's call and make \nthe real and lasting changes these bills provide, which will improve \nthe lives of our citizens in ways we have been struggling to do in this \nSenate for decades and long before many of us got here.\n  To those who continue to oppose reform, let me ask some questions. \nIsn't it long overdue to end discrimination based on preexisting \nconditions? The American people believe we should. So do I. Isn't it \nlong overdue to end the insurance industry practice of rescissions, the \ndenial of coverage to those who paid for it? The American people \nbelieve we should, and so do I. Should we not do something about the \nthousands of Americans who are forced into bankruptcy because of health \nexpenses even though they have insurance they thought would protect \nthem? The American people believe we should, and so do I. Should we not \ntake strong steps to rein in enormous, ever-growing health care \nexpenses, expenses that threaten to put health care out of reach for \nmore and more Americans and to bankrupt our Nation? The American people \nbelieve we should. So do I. And should we not clear the way for 32 \nmillion Americans who do not now have health insurance to obtain it? \nThe American people believe we should, and so do I.\n  I hope we will join together this week and do what so many before us \nhave tried and been unable to do--to reform a system that leaves so \nmany of our fellow citizens in jeopardy. I urge approval of this bill, \nthis essential reconciliation bill, passed by the House as part of a \npackage of historic legislation to finish the task of bringing landmark \nchange to American health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nWarner, Begich, Burris, Tom Udall, Mark Udall, Shaheen, and Merkley be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we approach the end of this long \njourney, at least the end of the first step of this long journey, I and \na number of my colleagues are going to come one more time to the floor \nto engage in a conversation for a few moments about what this health \ncare bill will mean to our constituents and to the people of the United \nStates. We are going to talk about some of the causes of how we got \nhere and some of the consequences of what would happen if we don't act. \nAt the end, I will add some comments about how we make sure we \nimplement this bill in the appropriate fashion.\n  Recognizing that the hour is late and colleagues have other business, \nI first ask my good friend, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Burris, if \nhe would like to give a brief recap of why he has been such a firm \nsupporter of this legislation and why he thinks this bill is so \nimportant, not only to the people of Illinois but to the people of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner. I compliment him \nfor his leadership in getting the freshmen engaged and involved in \nmaking sure we are getting the message out to the American people.\n  This piece of legislation, which was signed yesterday by President \nObama, is historic. I am proud and appreciative that I had the \nopportunity to play a part. As you know, my position was for a very \nstrong public option. But as to the issues that are in it, we deal with \ncost and accountability for the insurance companies. Therefore, it is a \nmajor piece of legislation which we want the public to understand.\n  We want the public to understand that for some people this law takes \neffect immediately. Small businesses benefit in that they will get a \ntax credit right away. These tax credits can total as much as 35 \npercent of total premiums. Secondly, for children there will be no \nelimination for preexisting conditions. Within the next 90 days, these \nprovisions will kick in on behalf of children. So there are a lot of \nthings in this bill that will benefit all of us.\n  We have been trying to do this for over 97 years.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, the reconciliation bill is \nimportant to make some corrections. The battle they are waging, not \nfrom the standpoint of policy but certainly from the standpoint of \npolitics, seeking to make a failure out of this issue, is not really \nfair to the American people. The misinformation that has been going out \nabout this legislation is not fair.\n  Not only are we going to see immediate benefits, but the long-term \nbenefits of this legislation are also helpful. Situations dealing with \npreexisting conditions--in 2014, that will kick in. I remember when my \ndaughter was changing jobs, she needed to get insurance because she had \na headache problem. They wouldn't insure her. I had to\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nbattle to get insurance for my daughter.\n  This is good legislation. It is history. I want the American people \nto know that it is on the books, and we are going to make necessary \ncorrections. The people will go forward.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Senator Burris for his comments. I know how hard \nhe fought for this legislation, since day one.\n  This legislation is going to have wide-ranging effects for people \nfrom all across the Nation.\n  I now know my colleague, the Senator from North Carolina, wishes to \nspeak. North Carolina and Virginia are neighbors. We both share a \nnumber of small businesses. We have a vibrant entrepreneurial flavor in \nVirginia and North Carolina. I know Senator Hagan has been concerned \nnot only on the overall aspects of health care but particularly how \nthis health care bill is going to affect small business in her State.\n  I wish to now ask Senator Hagan to tell us how this bill will affect \npeople in North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Senator Warner. I too appreciate the time for us \nto come down here and talk about the need for health care reform. The \nbill that was signed into law yesterday is getting us on that track.\n  The new and historic law, combined with the bill we are now \nconsidering in the Senate, is going to reform our health care system to \nreduce costs and improve patient care for those families in North \nCarolina and in Virginia and families across America.\n  In 1996, the average premium in North Carolina for a family of four \nwas $6,000. Today it is $12,000. It is projected, in 2016, to be \n24,000. People cannot afford that. That is why we need to have change.\n  After decades of working to fix a broken health care system, this law \ncontrols exploding costs, increases access to health care, and reduces \nour long-term deficit, which I know we are very concerned about, by as \nmuch as $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years.\n  But in addition to containing costs, health care reform will improve \naccess and quality of health care for millions of Americans. Right now, \nin North Carolina, we have 1.7 million people without insurance. They \nwill now have access to a family doctor.\n  This bill provides immediate benefits to small businesses, middle-\nclass families, and seniors in North Carolina. The small business \nowners whom I talk to want to provide coverage for their employees, but \nthe costs are prohibitive.\n  This month, I received an e-mail from a small chiropractic practice \nin eastern North Carolina that had to drop its health plan for its \nemployees because the rates doubled over the last 2 years. But starting \ntoday, 112,000 North Carolinian small businesses will be eligible for \ntax credits to provide health care to their employees.\n  Within the next 6 months, hard-working, middle-class families will be \nable to add their children up to the age of 26 on their health care \nplans. This will benefit about 870,000 young adults in my State.\n  This year, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny \ncoverage to a child for a preexisting condition, such as asthma or \ndiabetes. And it means insurance companies will no longer be able to \ndrop your coverage because you get sick or because you file too many \nclaims.\n  In North Carolina, 1.4 million seniors will receive preventive \nservices with no additional costs, and 250,000 seniors will have their \ndrug costs in the doughnut hole immediately reduced and eventually \neliminated.\n  I am proud of these immediate benefits and our efforts to reform the \nhealth care system over the long term. The health care reform effort \nwould not have been possible without the work of tenacious Capitol Hill \nstaffers. I personally want to thank two incredible health care \nstaffers on my team, Michelle Adams and Tracy Zvenyach, who worked \ncountless hours for reform in our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Senator Hagan. I appreciate her leadership on \nthis issue. Again, I also appreciate her recognition of not only the \nMembers who have been struggling with the bill for almost a year, but \nthe staff members who help us put together the facts, put together the \ncase studies, who help us crunch the numbers, as we try to make sure we \nget this right.\n  I now want to call on my friend, the Senator from Alaska. One of the \nthings the freshmen have always said, as we have come to the floor over \nthese months--as we have pointed out--is that the price of doing \nnothing is extraordinarily high to our economy, to our families, to our \nbusinesses, and that the status quo is not sustainable.\n  I know this has been a theme Senator Begich has echoed repeatedly on \nthe floor. As we come to the closing hours of this debate, if you could \nshare with us one more time why you think the status quo is \nunacceptable. What is the price of doing nothing? How would that affect \nthe people and businesses in the great State of Alaska?\n  Senator Begich.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator. Thank you again for your leadership, \nand especially as the freshmen group worked on the cost containment \npiece of this legislation. That was an important part we will see for \nmany years to come.\n  Over the next few days we are focusing on making a good bill a little \nbit better. Yesterday, the President signed the landmark legislation \nmoving health care reform into law. So over the next few days, again, \nwe are going to work on making that bill a little bit better. You are \ngoing to see clearly the differences. You are going to see our side of \nthe equation has worked hard on this legislation. Those who voted for \nhealth care reform are on the side of American families, not on the \nside of the insurance industry. We are on the side of seniors who will \nsee lower prescription drug costs--because reform is going to work in \nthat direction--not on the side of big drug companies. We are on the \nside of American small business--not business as usual.\n  I was truly proud to vote for and help pass that legislation last \nDecember. But as mentioned already this morning, there are many \nbenefits that occur right now, this year. This year, for example, there \nis help for small businesses. As you just heard, immediately, firms \nwith fewer than 10 workers get a tax credit worth 35 percent of what \nthey will spend now on health insurance. It will eventually ramp up to \na 50-percent tax credit, and firms with up to 25 workers will get a \npartial credit. For small businesses--truly the backbone of the Alaska \nbusiness community and this country's business community--that is an \nimmediate benefit.\n  Coverage for preexisting conditions: Within 3 months, people with \npreexisting conditions and no insurance will get help. A $5 billion \nfund is being set up to provide them with affordable coverage.\n  Coverage for dependent children: Within 6 months, parents will be \nable to extend their policies to cover their dependent children up to \nthe age of 26.\n  Some of these points you have already heard, as I said, this morning, \nbut it is important to repeat them because I think in the noise over \nthe last year and a half a lot of it got lost.\n  Another--a very important one--free preventive care: Within 6 months, \nall insurance plans must provide free checkups. This includes seniors \non Medicare. And there is much, much more when you look at this \nlegislation.\n  For my own State, the bill addresses many specific concerns I have \nheard in Alaska. It includes several of my amendments, including a \npanel to improve Federal health care in Alaska, increased loan \nforgiveness for thousands of new primary care providers, and added \nfunding for community hospitals.\n  We also, as a team of freshmen, wrote a cost containment amendment \nthat cuts prices for consumers, increases value and innovation in the \nhealth care system and, as mentioned earlier--let's not forget--it is a \ndeficit reducer: in the first 10 years, $143 billion, and in the next \n10 years, $1.3 trillion in deficit reduction.\n  This bill is paid for--paid for. These are many of the improvements. \nAgain, these improvements will save lives; add 32 million people, those \nuninsured--making sure they have coverage--save seniors on prescription \ndrug costs by closing the doughnut hole; save families, by providing \ntax relief to help them afford health care; and crack down on waste and \nfraud.\n  It has been an enormous time in this last year and a half working on \nthis. But I also want to say, the next 3 days\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\nwill also be tedious and confusing to the public because what you will \nsee on the other side is every imaginable amendment we would love to \nsee--many of them we probably would love to vote for. I am not voting \nfor any of them because the whole tactic is to delay the delivery, to \nensure that people who want a family doctor will not get one, to \nprotect the insurance companies instead of what we are trying to do to \nmake sure people get a fair shake from their companies. So you are \ngoing to see that over the next 3 days.\n  I think what is important for us is to remind Americans--Alaskans in \nmy State--why this bill is important. It helps small business, \nfamilies, seniors. It does it now. It is important. It is important for \nus to get it done. But do not be fooled by the next 3 days on what goes \non this floor.\n  We have passed health care reform. All we are doing now is making a \ngood bill better.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. Thank you for your comments. Thank \nyou for your leadership, particularly on a series of freshmen \namendments that dealt with cost containment. And if time exists after \nmy colleagues speak, I am going to go back to that issue.\n  But I now want to ask my good friend from Oregon a question. No one \nhas come to this body with more passion about making sure working \nfamilies get a fair break, not only in health care but in the world of \nfinancial reform and issues that cut across the spectrum. I know one of \nthe issues Senator Merkley has worked on tirelessly throughout this \nwhole conversation is how to make sure the Oregon families get that \nfair break, get that fair shot, how to make sure health care is \naffordable.\n  I would like you to share with our colleagues and those Americans who \nare at home watching what this health care bill does to help those \nmiddle-class Americans, middle-class Oregonians to make sure they get \nthat fair shot, fair break in health care reform.\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator so much. It is a pleasure to come \nhere with my colleagues on the floor.\n  I know when all of my colleagues go home, they hear stories from \ntheir constituents about our broken health care system. That certainly \nis what I hear. I hear it in my townhalls. I hear it on the street, as \npeople stop me and share their story. And I certainly hear it in my \nmail.\n  I have in my hand a few of the stories citizens in Oregon have sent \nto me. To give you a sense of the type of frustration we are hearing, \nDon writes:\n\n       Last year my premium went up 65 percent even though I've \n     made no significant claims against my policy.\n\n  Or we can turn to Jane, who says:\n\n       . . . we are subject to being turned down for health \n     insurance [because] I have a chronic illness. . . .\n\n  Or we can turn to Adrienne, who observes:\n\n       The medical debt was crushing, and we were forced to file \n     for bankruptcy.\n\n  Or we can turn to Amanda, who says:\n\n       My daughter cut her finger. I took her to emergency, the \n     hospital is a network provider. The ER Physician said she \n     needed surgery. Okay, what do I know, they are the experts. \n     It turns out that the Surgeon is not a network provider. She \n     bills [me] over $9,000.00. . . .\n       . . . I have little hope. Do I file [for] bankruptcy?\n\n  Or we can turn to Art, who says:\n\n       In less than 5 years, I had to change my health insurance 5 \n     times. It was never a matter of choice; I simply had to take \n     whatever plan my employer decided to offer.\n\n  Or Dagne, who observes: When I started to fill out my insurance form, \nI had ``Questions such as `Have you ever had . . . ' ''--for instance, \nI had asthma.\n  And he goes on to describe his challenges. And the list goes on and \non and on. That is why we are in this health care dialog. Because we \nneed to fix our health care system that is broken for working \nAmericans.\n  The bill we have passed and the President has signed has three \nterrific provisions. It creates State-based markets for health care \npolicies, where consumers can shop for the best policy. These markets \nwill increase choice and competition. Second, the bill ends insurance \ncompany practices that victimize our working families--practices such \nas turning people down for preexisting conditions or dumping them off \nof their policies when they are injured or when they have a disease. \nAnd, third, it invests in our provider workforce to counter the rapid \nretirement of baby boomers. Out in Oregon, we are going to lose 20 \npercent of our primary care physicians in the next 5 years, while many \nof us, as baby boomers ourselves, are going to need more health care.\n  So those things are huge challenges. This bill takes a stride that is \nvery significant, and this week we will work to pass--with an up-or-\ndown vote--a bill that will make further improvements to the bill the \nPresident signed yesterday.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in this fight to repair a broken \nhealth care system that is not working for our working citizens.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Senator Merkley. Thank you for sharing those \nstories from real folks who are dealing with the current broken health \ncare system. There are enormous stress, challenges, and burdens that \nour current system places on those families. I think we are taking a \ngiant step forward. The President already has by signing into law the \nbill yesterday. We will continue that step with passing this \nreconciliation bill later this week.\n  I now wish to call on another one of my colleagues, Senator Tom Udall \nof New Mexico. Senator Udall has, again, along with all the other \nfreshmen colleagues, been a leader in this fight. He has particularly \ntaken on the issue of prevention and the fact that we have a health \ncare system in this country that is more a sick care system than it is \na wellness and prevention system. I want to hear from Senator Udall \nabout how the bill is going to affect the good folks of New Mexico.\n  Senator Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for \nleading us and pulling us together in this freshman effort. It has been \na pleasure to work with all of my fellow freshman Senators on the floor \nagain and to join them right now. Last fall, we gathered right here in \nthis Chamber to fight for health care reform. As a group, we helped \nlead the charge to make quality, affordable health care accessible to \nall Americans. Yesterday, the change we have been fighting for became a \nreality. With President Obama's signature, health care reform is now \nthe law of the land.\n  This moment has been a long time coming. Teddy Roosevelt first called \nfor health care reform nearly a century ago. His banner was taken up by \na long and distinguished list of men and women who advocated for \nchange. For too many years, New Mexicans, like Americans across the \ncountry, have struggled to find or afford health insurance. They have \nstruggled to hang on to policies that get more and more expensive and \nmore and more restrictive every day. With this reform, all of that \nbegins to change.\n  No longer will insurance companies be able to discriminate based on \npreexisting conditions. No longer will they be able to dramatically \nincrease rates without public scrutiny. No longer will 32 million \nAmericans worry every day about what would happen to their families if \nthey get sick or are in an accident. I am proud to have fought for and \nvoted in favor of this historic legislation.\n  This reform will benefit all Americans, including our country's First \nAmericans, the 1.9 million American Indian and Alaska Natives who have \nspent too many years suffering because the federal government hasn't \nlived up to its promise to them.\n  With this reform, we begin meeting our obligations to Native \nAmericans by reforming the Indian health care system and permanently \nreauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. This law, which \nprovides a framework under which health care programs for Native \nAmericans are delivered, hasn't been reauthorized in more than 10 \nyears. As a result, American Indian and Alaska Natives are three times \nas likely as whites to be uninsured, and almost half of low-income \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives lack health coverage.\n  With this reform, no longer will Native Americans be forced to suffer \nneedlessly. No longer will they have to go without treatment for \nchronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\nNo longer will they have to put off basic care like colonoscopies or \ncholesterol screenings.\n  I say again, today is a new day for health care in America. I am \nproud to have fought for, and voted in favor of, this historic \nlegislation.\n  Yesterday, we began taking back control of our own health care. \nToday, the journey continues. I pledge to continue fighting every day \nto ensure New Mexican families and small businesses have the security \nand stability that comes with access to quality, affordable health \ncare.\n  The reason I have fought so hard for reform is simple. For my \nconstituents, the status quo is not an option. So it is the people of \nNew Mexico I wish to talk about today. They are the reason I stand up \nevery day and fight for comprehensive reform.\n  People such as Katheryn Whitesides--Katheryn lives in Clayton, NM. We \nmet last year when she attended one of my health care townhalls. \nKatheryn worked hard all her life. She had affordable insurance through \nher employer. But since she retired, Katheryn's health insurance \npremiums have risen dramatically from $110 a month when she was \nworking, to more than $800 a month today. Katheryn's insurer recently \ndenied a claim for a treatment she received. Now, on top of \nskyrocketing monthly premiums, she also owes about $4,000 in medical \nbills. That is more money than she receives from 5 months of pension \npayments.\n  As Katheryn herself said:\n\n       It's unsustainable for me. And I know I'm not the only one. \n     I'm just looking for some relief--not just for me, but for \n     all those people coming behind me.\n\n  To folks such as Katheryn, I say: Relief is coming. This reform will \nmake health insurance more affordable by placing caps on out-of-pocket \nmedical expenses. It will make it more affordable by providing premium \nassistance through tax credits for low- and moderate-income families.\n  I am fighting for New Mexicans such as Katheryn, and I am also \nfighting for New Mexico's small business and for entrepreneurs such as \nArvind Raichur. Arvind has owned a small business in Albuquerque for \nmore than a decade. As the boss, he has made it a priority to provide \nhis employees with good benefits. For years, he paid 100 percent of his \nemployees' health care premiums, but he is not sure how much longer he \nwill be able to do that and stay afloat. You see, for the past few \nyears, Arvind's insurer has increased his company's health care \npremiums by between 30 and 40 percent every year, and there is nothing \nArvind can do about it.\n  As Arvind said:\n\n       We've got no bargaining power. We've got no leverage. I'm \n     insuring maybe a dozen people at my company here. It's very \n     hard. The insurance companies give you a 30 or 40\n     percent increase and that's what you get. . . . It's too big \n     a bite.\n\n  To small business owners such as Arvind and their employees, I say: \nRelief is coming.\n  This reform will help small businesses by making it more affordable \nfor them to offer coverage for their employees. We do this by providing \ntax credits for up to 50 percent of premiums and by creating small \nbusiness health exchanges to build a larger employee pool.\n  In New Mexico, the vast majority of our insured are employed, but \nthey and their employers can't afford coverage. These new tax credits \nwill help our small businesses provide insurance for their employees at \na cost they can afford.\n  For hardworking New Mexicans like Katheryn and for small business \nowners like Arvind, health care reform can't come fast enough. Katheryn \nand Arvind can't afford the health care status quo. Katheryn and Arvind \nare the reason I stand here today. To my friends on both sides of the \naisle I say: Let's get this done.\n  I am proud to be part of this body as we cast our final votes in \nfavor of this landmark reform. With this final vote, we will finish \nthis leg of the race. I look forward to building on this solid \nfoundation in the coming months and years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Senator Udall. I know our time is running out; \njust a final comment I wish to make.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I had the honor of serving as Governor \nof Virginia before becoming a Senator. I think one of the differences \nbetween an executive and a legislator is, as a former executive I \nrealize that passing the bill is just the first step. What happens is \ngoing to be in the implementation afterwards.\n  The appeal I would make, particularly to my colleagues on the other \nside, is, I agree with some of their points that we don't go far enough \non cost containment, but there are a lot of things in this bill where \nwe grant the Secretary the ability to start experimental programs--on \ncost containment, on bundling of payments. How this bill is implemented \nis going to be where the rubber hits the road. I, for one, believe \nthere is more we can do around this issue of cost containment, and I \nhope in the coming weeks and months, rather than being for repeal, they \nwould join with us in finding that common ground to make this \nlegislation even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to let Senators know that we intend \nto alternate blocks of time, roughly a half hour on each side. So I ask \nunanimous consent that the next half hour be under the control of the \nRepublicans and the half hour thereafter be under the control of the \nmajority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3586\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending motions and amendments so that I may offer an \namendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. LeMieux] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3586.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To enroll Members of Congress in the Medicaid program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1207. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REQUIRED TO HAVE COVERAGE \n                   UNDER MEDICAID INSTEAD OF THROUGH FEHBP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, title XIX of the Social Security Act, or \n     any provision of this Act, effective on the date of enactment \n     of this Act--\n       (1) each Member of Congress shall be eligible for medical \n     assistance under the Medicaid plan of the State in which the \n     Member resides; and\n       (2) any employer contribution under chapter 89 of title 5 \n     of such Code on behalf of the Member may be paid only to the \n     State agency responsible for administering the Medicaid plan \n     in which the Member enrolls and not to the offeror of a plan \n     offered through the Federal employees health benefit program \n     under such chapter.\n       (b) Payments by Federal Government.--The Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Director \n     of the Office of Personnel Management, shall establish \n     procedures under which the employer contributions that would \n     otherwise be made on behalf of a Member of Congress if the \n     Member were enrolled in a plan offered through the Federal \n     employees health benefit program may be made directly to the \n     State agencies described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Ineligible for FEHBP.--Effective on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, no Member of Congress shall be \n     eligible to obtain health insurance coverage under the \n     program chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Member of \n     Congress'' means any member of the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment I am \noffering today.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Virginia who asked us to think \nabout the practical aspects of this health care reform. I just listened \nto my freshman colleagues on the Democratic side talk about all of the \ngood things, in their opinion, this bill is going to do. There is one \nthing I didn't hear them speak about. I didn't hear them speak about \nthe fact that half of the new people who are going to be covered by \nhealth care in this country--some 16 million of the 30-some million who\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nhave the opportunity for health care under this law--are going into \nMedicaid.\n  The practical impact my friend from Virginia asked us to think about \nis that our States right now are finding themselves in bankruptcy, \nrealistically, because of the obligations of Medicaid. Our States, \nunlike the Federal Government, have to balance their budgets. Medicaid \nis a program that the States pay some 50 percent of, and they can't \nmake it work. We are finding out in Florida right now that this \nprogram--this new law--will cost Florida $1 billion in the next 10 \nyears. Because they balance their budget and because they can't print \nmoney, that means the dollars will go away from teachers, away from \nstudents, and away from police.\n  The point I wish to make today and the amendment I am offering is \nthis: Several times, as I have been on the floor and heard from my \nDemocratic colleagues, they have made this point: Why shouldn't the \nAmerican people have the same health care that we in the Congress \nenjoy? Why shouldn't they, as do all Federal employees, be able to pick \nfrom a comprehensive and rich plan of benefits in order to take care of \ntheir health and the health of their families?\n  That is a good point, but what is going to happen to these 16 million \nnew Americans? They are going to go on Medicaid. That is not the plan \nwe have. That is not the rich benefits the Members of Congress enjoy. \nMedicaid--health care for the poor, which will now have some 50 million \nAmericans in it after these 16 million join it--is a program in crisis. \nIt is a program that is failing.\n  Let me give my colleagues some real examples. Right now we know \npatients on Medicaid can't find doctors who will treat them. We know in \nCalifornia, for example, 49 percent of family physicians do not \nparticipate in Medicaid.\n  I entered this document into the Record last week. On March 17 the \nSeattle Times reported that Walgreens will no longer take new Medicaid \npatients in the city of Seattle. On March 15, the New York Times \nreported about Mrs. Vliet. She is in Flint, MI. She has cancer. For 2 \nyears she has been receiving treatment, but now her doctor is dropping \nher from Medicaid. He says:\n\n       But after a while you realize that we're really losing \n     money on seeing those patients, not even breaking even. We \n     are starting to lose more and more money, month after month.\n\n  All across America, health care providers are dumping Medicaid, and \nwe are about to add 16 million new people. So I wish to take a page \nfrom my friends on the other side because they say the American people \nshould have the same rich benefits we have.\n  What I am proposing today with this amendment is that 535 Members of \nCongress should have the same benefits as these 16 million new people \nand these 50 million Americans. Under this amendment, the Members of \nCongress will go into Medicaid. If it is good enough for 50 million \nAmericans, it should be good enough for us.\n  So I have offered amendment No. 3586. It will require that the \nbenefits that are paid for health care by the Federal Government for \nthe 535 Members of Congress go to the State Medicaid agencies, and then \nwe can all enjoy this program that 50 million people in America are \nstruggling with. If it is good enough for 50 million Americans, it is \ngood enough for Members of Congress.\n  I wish to call upon my distinguished colleague from Arizona whom I \nknow wishes to speak on this issue as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Oklahoma, the Senator from Florida, and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment. Let me \nalso just for a moment point out where we are.\n  Where are we now that all the champagne has been drunk and all the \ncelebration has gone on; the inside-the-beltway excitement has subsided \nalong with the adoring media? Here we are: We have a budget deficit \nthat is still $1.4 trillion. We still have 9.7 percent unemployment. \nBeginning right away we have $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of Medicare cuts \nthat will take place over the next 10 years--$\\1/2\\ trillion beginning \nright away, $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of tax increases over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Beginning in 4 years, $2.5 trillion in new health care entitlements \nspending begin. The plan still puts government in control. It still \nmandates that every American must purchase a government designed and \napproved health policy. It still mandates that employers have to \nprovide health insurance or pay a fee, and 330,000 Medicare Advantage \nmembers in my State are going to be exposed to drastic cuts.\n  Fortunately, we took out one of the sweetheart deals so that now, at \nleast the 800,000 who were carved out before in Florida will be subject \nto the same cuts. No one, no one, no one believes--the so-called doc \nfix--that the 21-percent cut in physicians payments for treatment of \nMedicare patients is going to happen.\n  You can put lipstick on a pig, but this is still a pig. I noticed the \nSenator from Illinois came to the floor this morning and said how great \nthis is and how there is going to be real reductions in the deficit as \na result of this legislation. I wonder what his response has been to \none of the biggest corporations in the State of Illinois, Caterpillar, \nwho sent him a letter saying:\n\n       In our fragile economy, we can ill afford increases that \n     place us at a disadvantage versus global competitors that are \n     not similarly burdened.\n\n  They state:\n\n       Elements of the legislation would drive up Caterpillar's \n     health care costs by more than 20 percent, over $100 million.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois is sponsoring legislation that increases \ncosts for one of the largest manufacturers and exporters in America \nthat is going to increase their cost by $100 million. I wonder when he \nis going to go out and visit headquarters out there in Peoria. I hope \nit is soon.\n  The fact is, there are things in this legislation that are wrong, and \nthere are things that are left out of this legislation that are wrong, \nincluding $100 billion a year that could be saved by medical \nmalpractice reform. Is there anything in those 2,073 pages that have \nanything to do with medical malpractice reform? That is the dirty \nlittle secret. The dirty little secret in this body is that trial \nlawyers control the agenda, certainly as far as this legislation is \nconcerned.\n  The State of Texas has reduced costs, has reduced premiums, and has \nincreased the number of people who have been able to--lawsuit filings \nare down from defensive medicine increases for annual costs by 10 \npercent. Physician recruitment is up. The largest malpractice insurance \ncompany in the State has sliced its premiums by 35 percent, saving \ndoctors some $217 million over 4 years in the State of Texas. And I \nwould like to ask my friend from Oklahoma why in the world we would not \nenact medical malpractice reform if we are truly interested in reducing \nthe cost of health care in America.\n\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and our other doctor in the Senate, Senator \nBarrasso from Wyoming, can testify because of their experience of the \nrequirement to practice defensive medicine, which could be as much as \n$100 billion a year. So here we are, looking at dramatic increases in \ncost, and the President is going around the country saying that \ninsurance premiums will go down. Individual premiums will go up between \n10 and 13 percent. You know, facts are stubborn things.\n  So I would ask my friend from Oklahoma if he might talk a little bit \nabout not only what is in this bill but what is not in this bill, and \nmedical malpractice reform is certainly something that anyone would \nlogically assume would be part of any real reform if you are interested \nin reducing cost.\n  If you are interested in increasing government bureaucracy, I hear \nthis bill could mean the employment or hiring of some 16,500 new IRS \nagents. We are trying to track down the facts behind that. So we are \nnow embarked on one of the greatest expansions of government in the \nhistory of this country.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his question. If you look at \nThomson Reuters and several others who have studied the health care \nfield, the estimate for defensive medicine costs is $250 billion a \nyear. It is not just that we order tests that protect us from frivolous \nlawsuits, but those tests have consequences. Some of those tests \nactually hurt patients or expose them to radiation or, in fact, limit \nour ability\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nto do what is best for the patient because we are more interested in \nprotecting ourselves.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the opinion of the Senator from Oklahoma as to \nwhy he thinks there is no address of medical malpractice reform \nwhatsoever in this legislation that has the slightest impact on \nreducing health care costs?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think there are two reasons. One is because there is \nlarge support of those who wrote this legislation by those who benefit \nfrom suing doctors. That is pretty straightforward. And the doctor's \nonly defense is to order tests which they need but which the patient \ndoesn't necessarily need. The second is because they couldn't get--or \nwouldn't put it in the bill because they knew it would pass and the \nAmerican people would agree with it. You know, it is beyond me.\n  But let me go to the point of this current amendment. I have \ndelivered somewhere over 4,000 babies, and 2,000 of those were Medicaid \nbabies. Over half the babies I have delivered in my life I have cared \nfor through Medicaid. The State of Oklahoma just cut, in February or \nMarch, Medicaid reimbursements 3 percent. They are going to cut it \nanother 8 percent. Forty percent of the primary care doctors don't see \nMedicaid patients because the price that is paid for the coverage \ndoesn't cover the cost, let alone any margin. It doesn't cover the cost \nof nurses, the rent, the malpractice, and everything else.\n  The second point is, of the specialists who are available, 65 percent \nof the specialists in this country won't see Medicaid patients. So when \nI am taking care of Medicaid patients, I have trouble finding somebody \nbetter than me in a specialized area to care for my patients.\n  What is the other thing we know about Medicaid? Even if you normalize \nfor social factors, their outcomes are worse. The cost in terms of the \nnumber of procedures, the failure of therapeutics--all are worse.\n  So why is this a good idea? It is not just a political stunt. If \nMembers of Congress are enrolled in Medicaid, the first thing that is \ngoing to happen is Medicaid and reimbursements are going to go up so \nthat the availability of the finest and the best and the brightest in \nthis country is available to Members of Congress. So it is not just a \nstunt to say we put our membership in Medicaid; it is a very important \nulterior motive to improve Medicaid.\n  Think about it. If you are one of the 16 million people who are going \nto get health care under Medicaid, supposedly, in this bill--and I \ndoubt that seriously, simply because we are going to see a marked \ndecrease of 50 or 60 percent of doctors who won't see them--think about \nwhat is going to happen: You are not going to be able to find a doctor. \nYou may have coverage, but you won't be able to get anybody to care for \nyou. Is that coverage? Is that care? Is that prevention? Is that \nmanagement of chronic disease? No. None of that will happen.\n  So the whole idea of placing us in a leadership position into \nMedicaid is so that we will lead and fix it and make it what it should \nbe. There is only one health care system worse in America than \nMedicaid, and that is the Indian Health Service. That is the only one \nthat is worse. Everything else outside of those two programs is better. \nSo why would we consign 16 million Americans to a health care program \nthat is failing today? So the way to fix that is to put us into it. And \nI guarantee you, the self-interests of the Members of Congress will fix \nMedicaid and make it what it should be.\n  With that, I yield back to the original author of the amendment.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank my friend and colleague from Oklahoma.\n  How could anyone in this body not vote for this amendment? Why should \nwe have better health care than the 16 million people whom we are going \nto put into Medicaid, and now will be 50 million Americans? Why should \nwe have it better? Why should we have a gold-plated premium health care \nplan?\n  Look, I have a family of five. We are going to have a baby any day--\ncould be today--so it will be a family of six. I pay $400 a month on \nthe government program--$5,000 a year. Could I get that in the \nmarketplace? Of course I couldn't. There is a doctor here in the \nCapitol, a whole staff of them, anytime I want to see a doctor. I get \nfantastic health care as a Member of Congress.\n  Why shouldn't we have the same health care we are subjecting 15 \nmillion new Americans to and 50 million Americans in total? As my \nfriend from Oklahoma says, certainly won't that make the point to us \nthat this health care system is failing? What will happen when a Member \nof Congress tries to find a doctor and can't find a doctor who will \ntake him? What is going to happen when he tries to find a specialist \nand no specialist will take him? You don't hear our friends on the \nother side talking about the fact that half of the people getting \ncoverage under this legislation are going into a failing system. That \nis not one of their talking points, but it is the truth. So I challenge \nmy friends who say that they should walk among the least of us to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I want to turn again to my colleague from Arizona. He and I have \nexpressed our distress about this bill for lots of reasons, but a \nspecific reason is that we both represent States with lots of seniors.\n  We have this Medicare Advantage Program that is going to get $200 \nbillion cut out of it. That will really affect our two States. So I \nwonder--and I would ask my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, to speak on this issue--how is this going to affect seniors in \nArizona when we are raiding Medicare to start this new program?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Florida. The fact is, Medicare \nAdvantage is a program that provides seniors with choices. That is one \nof the reasons it is a major target of the other side--because it \ndoesn't fit in, then, with the government mandates this whole bill \nembodies. So I am worried about the 11 million Americans who have the \nMedicare Advantage Program.\n  I would like to refer my colleagues to an article--I know the Senator \nfrom Utah is waiting, if he would just give me another minute or so \nhere--today in the Wall Street Journal titled ``Now, Can We Have \nHealth-Care Reform?'' And I want to quote from part of it, as follows:\n\n       Health insurers, and indeed Corporate America as a whole, \n     are like monkeys who are caught by staking a glass jar to the \n     ground with a shiny trinket inside. They won't let go so they \n     can't get their hands out of the jar. That trinket is the \n     ruinous and regressive $250 billion-a-year tax benefit for \n     employer-provided insurance.\n\n  That is the elephant in the room, my friends.\n\n       Corporate America isn't brave enough to argue against a \n     direct subsidy to its employment costs, no matter how \n     perverse its impact in insulating consumers from the true \n     cost of their health care choices. Insurers are not brave \n     enough to say: Give us a tax code that lets us go back to \n     being insurers rather than a tax laundromat for the middle \n     class's health care spending.\n       Almost any bill would have been worth having that \n     fundamentally fixed this tax distortion, regardless of its \n     other elements.\n       We say this because any bill, including the one signed by \n     the President yesterday, will be revisited many times in the \n     future. Millions of pages of rules will be written by \n     regulators before we see how it really works. Congress itself \n     will return in predictable ways: It will reverse the proposed \n     Medicare cuts that created ObamaCare's illusion of fiscal \n     probity. It will tighten the mandate that requires insurers \n     to cover the sick at favorable prices. It will not tighten \n     the requirement that the young and healthy buy insurance at \n     prices that subsidize the old and unhealthy.\n       More and more tax money will have to be found to keep the \n     jalopy on the road. More and more administrative controls on \n     medicine will attempt vainly to keep the jalopy from \n     bankrupting the Nation.\n       Under the law just signed, employers have even more \n     incentive than they did yesterday to lavish excessive health \n     insurance on their high-end employees.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis entire Wall Street Journal article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 24, 2010]\n\n                  Now, Can We Have Health-Care Reform?\n\n                      (By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.)\n\n       A certain kind of person--we get emails from them all the \n     time--understands exactly nothing about the health-care \n     debate, but thinks they know who the villain is: the \n     insurance industry.\n       Barack Obama is not one of them. In the desperate hours he \n     played to public ignorance. But from the beginning, the \n     industry was his ally because he set out to solve its\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\n     biggest problem--which is not the same as America's biggest \n     problem.\n       We'll let Angela Braly, CEO of insurer WellPoint, take the \n     story from here. She was recently hauled before Congress to \n     justify her company's proposed 39% rate hike in California. \n     She explained the source was two-fold: rising medical costs \n     and healthier customers dropping their coverage, forcing the \n     sick to pick up the tab.\n       Now this sounds like two problems, but for WellPoint and \n     other insurers it's really only one problem. Once everyone is \n     required by government mandate to buy insurance, the \n     industry's survival is no longer threatened: It can just pass \n     its skyrocketing costs along to customers. Once customers can \n     no longer refuse to buy the industry's product, the problem \n     of costs won't be fixed, but it no longer is the insurance \n     industry's problem.\n       There, in that one sentence, we give you the failure of \n     ObamaCare, the failure of the congressional health-care \n     debate, the failure of health-care politics in this country.\n       Health insurers, and indeed Corporate America as a whole, \n     are like monkeys who are caught by staking a glass jar to the \n     ground with a shiny trinket inside. They won't let go so they \n     can't get their hands out of the jar. That trinket is the \n     ruinous and regressive $250 billion-a-year tax benefit for \n     employer-provided insurance.\n       Corporate America isn't brave enough to argue against a \n     direct subsidy to its employment costs, no matter how \n     perverse its impact in insulating consumers from the true \n     cost of their health care choices. Insurers are not brave \n     enough to say: Give us a tax code that lets us go back to \n     being insurers rather than a tax laundromat for the middle \n     class's health-care spending.\n       Almost any bill would have been worth having that \n     fundamentally fixed this tax distortion, regardless of its \n     other elements.\n       We say this because any bill, including the one signed by \n     the president yesterday, will be revisited many times in the \n     future. Millions of pages of rules will be written by \n     regulators before we see how it really works. Congress itself \n     will return in predictable ways: It will reverse the proposed \n     Medicare cuts that created ObamaCare's illusion of fiscal \n     probity. It will tighten the mandate that requires insurers \n     to cover the sick at favorable prices. It will not tighten \n     the requirement that the young and healthy buy insurance at \n     prices that subsidize the old and unhealthy.\n       More and more tax money will have to be found to keep the \n     jalopy on the road. More and more administrative controls on \n     medicine will attempt vainly to keep the jalopy from \n     bankrupting the nation.\n       Under the law just signed, employers have even more \n     incentive than they did yesterday to lavish excessive health \n     insurance on their high-end employees. They have less \n     incentive to cover low-end workers, or even hire them.\n       For the young, healthy or anyone not stumbling into a giant \n     tax handout, buying insurance at the inflated prices \n     available in the marketplace would be an even crazier \n     financial decision today than it was yesterday--because now \n     you can wait and buy it when you're sick.\n       For insurers, the check is in the mail: So watered down is \n     the individual mandate that it must accelerate the industry's \n     death spiral if not for the massive subsidies the government \n     now has obliged itself to provide to keep the industry afloat \n     and allow insurers to continue scalping their 15% off the top \n     for serving as gatekeeper to a tax loophole.\n       When all is said and done, with unerring accuracy, \n     ObamaCare has ended up doubling down on the system's existing \n     perversities. The one thing it doesn't do (though it would be \n     perfectly consistent with the Democratic goal of universal \n     access) is incentivize a health-care marketplace based on \n     competition in price and quality.\n       A world-class hospital in India does heart surgery the \n     equal of any heart surgery in America, but does so at one-\n     tenth the cost (and increasingly attracts a world-wide \n     clientele). The reason is not what you think: low-paid \n     doctors and nurses. The reason is that competition works in \n     medicine as it does in everything else when the patient cares \n     about getting value for money. This is the great low-hanging \n     fruit of health-care reform. It continues to hang.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for his \nindulgence.\n  The other side is going around the country right now telling the \nAmerican people things that simply are not correct, including the fact \nthat these budget projections we know are patently false, not because \nCBO gave us false numbers but because the assumptions were wrong. One \nof the biggest assumptions--and we will be talking about this more--is \nthe so-called doc fix. Is there anyone who believes we are going to \nhave a 21-percent cut in Medicare physician payments this fall?\n  I would ask my friend, the Senator from Utah, who is very familiar \nwith this issue--I know he has an amendment, but this is one of the \nreasons Americans are so angry. They know they are not going to cut \ndoctors' payments from Medicare by 21 percent, and that is a \nfundamental part of the assessments as to the cost by CBO. It is a sham \nperpetrated on the American people.\n  So I would say to my friend from Florida and my friend from Utah, we \nwill be back on the floor probably this fall sometime or early next \nyear, and we will be talking about the fact that this doc fix--the \ndoctor payments provision of health care for Medicare enrollees--was \nnot cut 21 percent, as the other side is telling the American people \nthat it will be. It is not fair to the American people, I would say to \nmy friend from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with my friend from Arizona, no question.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending motion to offer a motion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] moves to commit the bill \n     H.R. 4872 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate within 1 day with changes \n     to strike all cuts to the Medicare Advantage program and add \n     an offset if the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     actuary certifies that 1,000,000 or more Medicare Advantage \n     beneficiaries, American seniors, and disabled individuals, \n     will lose their current Medicare Advantage coverage or plan \n     benefits.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before I discuss my motion to commit to \nprotect the Medicare Advantage Program for more than 10 million \nseniors, I would like to take a few moments to discuss the broader \nissue of health care reform.\n  To be honest, we have never seen anything like the issues facing our \ncountry right now. We are at a pivotal point as a Nation. The line \nbetween private businesses and public government has never been so \nblurred. Government effectively owns several of our Nation's financial \ninstitutions, insurance companies, and auto manufacturers. CEOs have \nbeen fired by government bureaucrats, and Washington is now in the \nbusiness of running our health care system more than ever before.\n  Our fiscal outlook is bleaker than ever. According to the recent 10-\nyear outlook by the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, the current \nadministration's policies would add $8.5 trillion to our already record \nnational debt. The report also confirmed that we would be facing a \nrecord deficit of $1.5 trillion this year, along with a dire prediction \nof our deficits only getting worse after 2015 and beyond.\n  Let me put this in perspective. Our deficit this year is the largest \nyearly deficit since 1945. It is 10 percent of our entire economy. Our \nnational debt is on a path to double in the next 5 years and triple in \nthe next 10 years. According to CBO, our national debt will explode to \n$20.3 trillion by 2020 or 90 percent of our GDP. We are literally \ndrowning the future of this Nation and the future of our kids and \ngrandkids in a sea of red ink.\n  I deliver these remarks with a heavy heart because what could have \nbeen a strong bipartisan bill reflecting our collective and genuine \ndesire for responsible health care reform turned out to be an extremely \npartisan exercise resulting in one of the largest big-government \nspending bills being signed into law yesterday. We are jamming through \nanother 153-page addition of new taxes and spending.\n\n  Recent polls show that a majority of Americans remain concerned and \nskeptical about all the promises of reduced deficits and lower costs \nunder this legislation. Why? Because they know there is no such thing \nas a free lunch, especially when Washington is the one inviting you \nover.\n  According to the administration's own Actuary at the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, the health care bill signed by \nPresident Obama yesterday will actually raise our total health care \nspending by $222 billion over the next 10 years. That does not even \ninclude the doc fix the distinguished Senator from Arizona was talking \nabout, which is as much as $371 billion more.\n  But the most cynical joke played by Washington on the American people \nin this entire exercise has been the promise of this $2.5 trillion tax-\nand-spend bill actually reducing our deficit. Nobody believes that.\n  The biggest bait and switch on the American people about the bill's \nimpact on the deficit is a simple math\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\ntrick. If something is too expensive to do for a full 10-year period, \njust do it for 5 or 6 years. Most of the major spending provisions of \nthe bill do not go into effect until 2014 or later--coincidentally \nafter the 2012 Presidential elections. So what we are seeing is not a \nfull 10-year score but rather a 6-year score. According to the Senate \nBudget Committee, the full 10-year score of the Senate bill would \napproach $2.5 trillion. We are already spending $2.4 trillion.\n  More importantly, let me also clarify what the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said on the nearly $500 billion in Medicare cuts which my \nfriends on the other side argue will magically not only extend Medicare \nsolvency but also pay for a large part of this bill. This is like \ntelling American families that they can spend the same magical dollar \nto not only pay their mortgage but also their credit cards. It is \nnonsensical. Here is what the experts at CBO said:\n\n       The key point is that the savings to Medicare trust fund . \n     . . would be received by government only once, so they cannot \n     be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at \n     the same time, pay for current spending on other parts of \n     the legislation or on other programs.\n\n  By the way, did I mention that at a time when major government \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid are already on a path to fiscal \ninsolvency, it is interesting to note that more than half of the newly \ncovered lives, 16 million out of the 32 million, are simply being \npushed into the Medicaid Program. And if anyone thinks that States, \nthat are facing more than $200 billion in deficits, will not be left \nholding the bag in the future, then I have a bridge to sell to you.\n  I have said all along that this is not a fight between Republicans \nand Democrats, but a fight between the Democrats and a majority of \nAmericans who did not want this bill. In townhall after townhall and \npoll after poll and election after election, Americans begged \nWashington to listen to their voices. But Washington ignored them and \nused every means necessary--from backroom deals to procedural \ntrickery--to get this bill passed.\n  We need to remember the real implications of these policies--not \nsimply in terms of political legacies and ideological holy grails--but \nin terms of its impact on the future of our children and grandchildren. \nWe need to ensure that they have the same opportunities to prosper that \nwe have all been blessed with.\n  I would now like to speak for a few minutes about a motion to \ncommit that I will be offering. My motion to commit states that if the \nActuary of the Department of Health and Human Services certifies that 1 \nmillion Medicare Advantage beneficiaries lose their coverage or \nbenefits, the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program will not go into \neffect. It is that simple.\n\n  It is important to point out that the bill the President signed into \nlaw yesterday would slash $120 billion from the Medicare Advantage \nprogram. This reconciliation bill would cut the program by an \nadditional $66 billion for a grand total of $202 billion.\n  Before the health care reform bill was signed into law, CBO projected \nthat Medicare Advantage enrollment would have increased from 10.9 \nmillion in 2010 to 13.9 million in 2019. Now, Medicare Advantage \nenrollment will be 4.8 million less in 2019 due to the passage of the \nnew health bill or almost 2 million less than today.\n  CBO also projected that rebates for additional benefits and reduced \ncost- sharing offered through Medicare Advantage would be reduced by 50 \npercent from $135 per member per month to $67 per member per month in \n2019. These lost benefits include lower premiums, lower copayments, and \nlower deductibles. It will also impact everything from hearing aids to \ndental and vision benefits. Most importantly, it would violate \nPresident Obama's own pledge ``if you like what you have, you may keep \nit.''\n  Medicare Advantage works. Every Medicare beneficiary has access to a \nMedicare Advantage plan. Almost 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nparticipating in the program are satisfied with their health coverage. \nIt is time for us to stand up for more than 10 million seniors and \nensure that this program is not used as a piggy-bank to finance \nWashington's big government plans.\n  I appreciate my colleagues allowing me to go maybe a minute longer \nthan I should have, but I urge my colleagues to support my motion to \ncommit this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, have Republicans used up their time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't mean to be picky, but I assume they will yield \nback that minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield back the minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is indeed a great day because we \nare passing real health care reform for American families, for American \nworkers, for American small business, for seniors, and our communities. \nHealth care reform will save lives. No longer will dreams and lives be \nendangered because people lost their health care insurance when they \ngot sick, lost a job or had an accident.\n  I listened to the other side which says they listen to the people. \nYou heard the old saying, ``Men are from Mars, women are from Venus.'' \nI think that party is from Mars and we are from planet Earth. I think \nthey have been out in orbit. The planet Earth that I am on tells me to \npass health insurance reform.\n  One of the reasons I am voting for this bill, the main reason I am \nvoting for this bill, is the stories I heard from my constituents in \nMaryland--roundtables, townhalls, hearings, lots of letters, phone \ncalls, e-mails. They told me about the situation in their lives, where \nthey were terrified that one big health care incident could lead them \ninto bankruptcy. They were terrified that if they had changed a job to \none in our new high-tech communities that would have offered great \nopportunity for them--they didn't take it because they were not going \nto have health insurance.\n  When I listen to people, I think about the lady in Cumberland who \nworks full time, but her employer does not provide health insurance and \nshe is terrified that she is one sickness away from a catastrophic \nsituation, or from Karen, in Kensington, whose father had to quit work \nbecause he had Crohn's disease. He was making payments on his \ninsurance. He was two payments short, and they canceled his insurance. \nIt took him 6 months to try to get it back. He lost his coverage, and \nhe was only 59 years old when he passed away.\n  Then there were the breast cancer survivors, the wonderful women and \nthe men they love who are out there raising money for the cure. But \neven in a prosperous community such as Annapolis, a woman told me how \nshe lost her job and with it her family's health insurance, and when \nher insurance ran out, she was terrified she would lose her cancer \ntreatment.\n  Walking around the diners--and I love diners. I see myself as a diner \nDemocrat. In every diner it is usually multigenerational people. What \ndo they tell me? Barb, don't forget the old people. Senator Barb, no \nmatter what, keep Medicare stable. If you are 50 years old, you are \nterrified your parents can lose their Medicare and it is going to fall \non you. The sandwiches they are eating are eaten by the sandwich \ngeneration, worried about the oldtimers' health care, worried about \nkeeping their own, and then trying to figure out how they were going to \npay for college. Medicare has multigenerational implications.\n  This is why in this bill I am so proud of the fact that we are going \nto stabilize Medicare for another 10 years and do very important \nreforms in Medicare.\n  I am also pleased to respond to the people who said no matter what, \nmake health care available and affordable. For every parent who has \never worried about covering a child with a chronic illness, whether \nautism or cerebral palsy or juvenile diabetes, they will always be able \nto get health insurance. The small business owner, such as my own \nfather who once had a grocery store or my grandmother who had the best \nbakery shop, worried about how they were going to provide individual\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nhealth care for themselves--this generation will not have to worry \nabout that.\n  This bill is an exceptional one. We save Medicare, expand its \nsolvency for another nearly a decade. We end the punitive practices of \ninsurance companies. We expand uniform access, and we pay for it with \nan emphasis on wellness and quality, saying goodbye to quantity \nmedicine and emphasizing quality medicine; goodbye to volume medicine \nand getting value for our dollar.\n  For our seniors, one of the most important things we will do is close \nthat doughnut hole. The doughnut hole has been hard to swallow ever \nsince this bill was passed. We are going to provide a $250 rebate for \nseniors who hit the gap in the prescription drug benefit and also offer \na better discount on prescription drugs.\n  I am also very excited and honored because of the role I played in \nmaking sure we ended the punitive practices of insurance companies \ntoward women. For too long, in too many ways, they treated simply being \na woman as a preexisting condition. First of all, they charged us 30 \npercent to 40 percent more just simply to be able to get insurance. \nThen they would have the punitive practices of denying us health \ninsurance for a preexisting condition. In eight States, domestic \nviolence was viewed as a preexisting condition. You talk about being \nabused--you were abused by your husband, then you were abused by your \ninsurance company. We are not going to be battered anymore by these \ncompanies. We ended that in this bill.\n  Then there was the hearing that shocked and chilled me, a hearing on \ngender discrimination in insurance. A woman told a compelling story, \nPeggy from Colorado, that after she had a C-section and a premature \nbaby, the costs were high. She lost her health insurance and when she \nwent to apply they told her in order to get health insurance, because \nshe had a premature baby, because she had a C-section, they would not \ngive her health insurance unless she was sterilized.\n  I couldn't believe it. That is what fascist countries do. That is \nwhat authoritarian regimes do. It was not the Taliban in Afghanistan, \nit was an insurance company in Colorado. We took up that fight and \nended those abusive practices in this bill. Never again will a woman be \nable to be denied health insurance because of any preexisting \ncondition. We ended gender discrimination in charging women more.\n  But as the debate went forward, they wanted to take the mammograms \naway from us and they didn't want to put mammogram and preventive \nservices for women in the bill. They said it costs too much money.\n  I didn't want to hear that. I asked the women to suit up and come to \nthe floor and we offered an amendment. The good men of the Senate also \njoined us. Many remember we wore pink that day. Today we are in the \npink as well. We offered our amendment to ensure preventive services \nfor women so that if your doctor says you need a mammogram, you are \ngoing to get one. If you need screening for cervical cancer or a Pap \nsmear, you are going to get one and you are not going to have to pay a \ncopay and a deductible. But like the old song ``Bread and Roses,'' we \nfight not only for women, but we fight for men too. Because for us it \nis not gender, it is about the agenda, and the biggest agenda is to \nmake sure we provide health care to as many Americans as we can in the \nmost affordable way, with value, quality, and prevention as their \nunderpinnings.\n  We were able to make significant changes in this bill. But \naffordability is an issue. I believe we dealt with that by emphasizing \nquality. At Senator Kennedy's request, I led the quality task force. \nBecause of proven ways that we are going to be able to offer in these \ninitiatives, we are going to be able to increase the affordability of \nthis bill to make people healthier. We want to prevent disease and \nmanage chronic disease. By the emphasis on the management of chronic \ndisease, we are going to save lives and save money.\n  First of all, we are getting more value for the dollar. Yes, we will \nbe looking at comparative effectiveness, so when you go for a treatment \nor you buy a drug, you know we are getting value for the dollar.\n  The other is, we are going to emphasize the reduction of medical \nerrors and also medical infections in hospitals by introducing quality \ninitiatives that reward hospitals for being able to do that. But I also \nlisten to the providers. I represent iconic international institutions \nsuch as Johns Hopkins medical institution and the University of \nMaryland.\n  I listen to my primary care doctors as well. They said: Senator Barb, \nplease reduce the hassle factor; too much paperwork and not enough time \nto be with patients; too many contradictory rules from the insurance \ncompanies and not enough of a clear path on what we can do to be able \nto help people.\n  So we made sure we are going to save money by reducing the hassle \nfactor by simplifying administrative costs, by emphasizing medical \nhealth information technology. We are going to promote evidence-based \nmedicine through this comparative effectiveness research. We are going \nto also reward, following the recommendations of the Finance Committee, \nthe encouragement of medical homes in order to be able to manage \nchronic disease.\n  These are the many reforms that are in this bill and that I am very \nproud of. I am also, as the daughter of a small business owner, excited \nabout how we are going to be able to help small business be able to \nprovide health care to their employees. The fact that we are going to \noffer tax breaks for small business and be able to have health \nexchanges where they can buy those health care policies at a better \ncost is indeed important.\n  So, again, the other party might be Mars, but I am glad my feet were \nplanted in planet Earth, by listening to the people I represent, by \nlistening to their concerns and then listening to the excellent ideas \nthat came from both the people themselves and, I must say, the people \nwho are the providers who could help us lead the way.\n  I am going to vote for this bill. I know there is much to reform in \nit in the years ahead. But this is more than a beginning, this is a \nleap into the future. It is a leap we can take with confidence that \nwhen this bill passes with reconciliation, we will have won a major \nhistoric advance for the American people.\n  Our job is about creating opportunity and opportunity to have health \ncare is one of the greatest benefits we can provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the half hour under the majority's control, at about \nroughly 11:21, the Republicans control the next half hour and the \nmajority control the half hour after that, starting at about 11:51.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple moments to \nspeak on two amendments, one offered by, I think, Senator Hatch, with \nrespect to Medicare Advantage. Off the topic, it is important to \nremember that health care reform will reduce excessive overpayments to \nMedicare Advantage plans, while at the same time rewarding high-\nquality, efficient plans for providing care to seniors.\n  Medicare Advantage plans that achieve high-quality rankings under \nthis legislation, let's say, for regular checkups for blood pressure, \ndiabetes, will receive an increase in payments. That is very important \nbecause, today, Medicare Advantage plans are paid the same amount \nregardless of the quality of care they provide.\n  For the first time, under this legislation, payments to plans would \nbe based on performance. I think that is something all seniors would \nprefer. That makes this Medicare Advantage plan more fair, more \nreasonable. This will enable plans to participate everywhere in the \ncountry, both urban and rural, while eliminating overpayments that \nplans receive today.\n  According to MedPAC--MedPAC is that bipartisan commission that \nadvises Congress on Medicare payments--that organization says Medicare \nAdvantage plans are paid 13 percent more than traditional fee-for-\nservice plans, on average, and in some parts of the country overpayment \nis as high as 20 percent. They strongly recommend that we reduce that \noverpayment because it causes great inefficiencies.\n  I might also say that, today, because of the overpayments, all \nseniors on\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nMedicare--I am talking now especially about seniors who take fee for \nservice--all seniors on Medicare pay for these overpayments, even if \nthey are not in Medicare Advantage plans. How? Well, it is basically \nbecause every senior pays $3 more per month in Part B premiums, that \ntotals about $80, on average. So seniors in traditional fee for service \nare paying for the overpayments for Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Medicare Advantage overpayments drain resources for the Medicare \ntrust fund. If they are overpaid, that means they are draining \nexcessive resources from the Medicare trust fund. In fact, the \ngovernment estimates that Medicare Advantage overpayments speed up \ninsolvency of the Medicare trust fund by about 18 months.\n  After that, there is no evidence that overpayments to Medicare \nAdvantage plans--do not forget these are private insurance plans--even \nthough they say Medicare, they are private insurance plans. There is no \nevidence that overpayments to them lead to better quality for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  In fact, seniors can end up spending more out-of-pocket dollars under \nMedicare Advantage plans than under traditional Medicare, even if they \nhave certain conditions. The bill eliminates these overpayments by \ndecreasing the statutory rates in place today and giving quality \nperformance payment increases to high-ranking plans. We are paying more \nthan we do today to high-ranking plans.\n  No senior in Medicare Advantage will lose access to any of their \nMedicare benefits under this proposal. We hear all these false claims \nacross the aisle that these cuts, which cause more efficiency, prevent \nwaste, prevent overpayments, are going to cut beneficiaries, Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries' payments. That is not true. It is misleading.\n  Plans will not be allowed to lower or drop their basic Medicare \nbenefits that seniors are entitled to under the Medicare Program. So \nthere are no cuts in basic Medicare benefits. In fact, they are \nguaranteed. The reforms in this bill will ensure that the dollars for \nthe Medicare trust fund go toward improving the quality of care for \nseniors, rather than to support the operations of private insurers. I \nthink that is something the vast majority of seniors would prefer. I \nwish to make that clear because some of the statements made on the \nother side of the aisle are quite misleading, which leads me to another \npoint.\n  Americans probably are a little confused about what is in health care \nreform because they hear all kinds of claims, both sides. Well, now \nhealth care reform has passed. The President signed the bill yesterday. \nThis is sort of to help, a fixer-upper around the edges a little bit. \nAmericans can look for themselves as to who is telling the truth. They \nwill want to look more closely than they have in the past because now \nit is law. Now it affects people.\n  Some people are going to ask: Gee, how does it affect me? I better \nfind out. When people start to find out, they are going to learn--I say \nthis somewhat presumptuously, but I believe it very strongly--they are \ngoing to find out that those who are claiming all the bad things that \nare going to happen, all the bad things about this bill, are basically \nnot true.\n  They are also going to start to realize that all the good things in \nthis bill, that a lot of proponents have been mentioning, from the \nPresident on down, they are pretty much true, the good things are \npretty much true. I think once people start thinking closely, \nseparating the wheat from the chaff, they will start to realize that \nnot only are the Medicare Advantage charges false, but a lot of the \nother charges that some make about why the bill is so bad are also \nfalse. Again, I say, somewhat presumptuously, the prevention \nprovisions, I think are very good and help seniors, are basically \naccurate.\n  One small, final point. The Senator from Florida offered an amendment \nbasically requiring all Members of Congress to enroll in Medicaid. Now \nI ask you, that clearly is not a serious amendment. Medicaid is a very \nvital program for vulnerable Americans. It should be treated very \nseriously and should not be used for political games.\n  I now yield the remainder of our time in this half hour to the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. First, I wish to begin by recognizing the extraordinary \nleadership of majority leader Harry Reid, Chairman Baucus, Chairman \nDodd, and Chairman Harkin to get us to this point.\n  Commonsense and cost-effective health care reform is now the law of \nthe land. The question before the Senate now is whether we will make \nsome important improvements to that reform or whether we will respond \nto the wishes of the insurance industry and others who want to preserve \na broken status quo of higher premiums and dwindling coverage for \nmiddle-class families.\n  Yesterday, President Obama signed into law a health insurance reform \nbill that will cut the deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years, \nensure that health insurance companies actually provide Americans with \nthe coverage that they pay for, and preserve Medicare for our senior \ncitizens. That is no small achievement, and it would be a tragedy if \nthe other side of the aisle persists in its effort to defeat health \ncare reform by seeking to delay and up-end the package of improvements \nin the bill that we are now debating.\n  It sometimes gets lost in the heated rhetoric of the other side, but \nunder the status quo, the healthy are faced with ever-increasing costs \nand the ill are denied care, dropped from coverage, and prevented from \npurchasing coverage. The new health insurance reforms will provide \nrelief for every American. Indeed, under the law just signed by \nPresident Obama, these five reforms will take place by the fall of next \nyear:\n  No child will be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  Small businesses will receive a 35-percent tax credit to purchase \ninsurance for their employees.\n  Seniors on Medicare who confront the doughnut hole will receive \nadditional assistance.\n  Health insurers will be required to spend more of their premium \nrevenues on clinical services, with less going to administrative costs \nand profits, or else they must pay a rebate to policy holders.\n  And our State's Community Health Centers will receive a boost in \nFederal resources.\n  Rhode Islanders will particularly welcome this relief. Just last \nweek, Rhode Islanders learned that health insurance premiums in the \nState will go up 10 percent this year. In the same week, they also \nreceived news that as many as 21 percent of individuals in the State \nwill be without insurance sometime during this year. This is double the \nrate of uninsured just 10 years ago.\n  In Rhode Island, these two headlines, coupled with an unemployment \nrate of nearly 13 percent, have caused a perfect storm.\n  As the economy took jobs away from Rhode Islanders, it also took away \ntheir health insurance. The healthy hoped not to get sick, the sick \nstarted showing up in hospital emergency rooms, and those who still had \naccess to insurance stopped being able to afford it.\n  Hospitals in Rhode Island can no longer shoulder the burden of the \nuninsured. Community health centers in Rhode Island can no longer \nshoulder the burden of the uninsured. Indeed, the economy can no longer \nshoulder the burden of the uninsured.\n  Today we are considering a bill that makes further improvements to \nthe health insurance reform law. Indeed, these are changes that \nAmericans have consistently said they want, and that is why we should \nsupport this bill. It is also why I intend to oppose the legislative \nmaneuvers from the other side of the aisle. They are interested in \noverturning the reform of our health care system, reforms which have \nreplaced the costly status quo with a system based on more competitive \nmarkets. They are in favor of a system where the whim of insurance \ncompanies rule. They are in favor of a health care system in which \ncosts continue to rise at astronomical rates each year for families and \nfor businesses.\n  It may be politically heartening for the other side to try and slow \ndown reform through a series of repetitive amendments, but I think \nRhode Islanders and all Americans want us to pass the bill because it \ncontains straightforward proposals.\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\n  First, this reconciliation bill, as it is known, would eliminate the \nso-called Corn-Husker kickback, which would have created an entirely \ninappropriate Medicaid reimbursement system exclusively for one State. \nGone too are other provisions that would have unfairly supported some \nStates and not others.\n  Second, this bill begins the process of closing the Medicare \nprescription drug coverage gap, also known as the doughnut hole, which \nrequires seniors to pay more for their medications than they ordinarily \nwould. This year seniors would receive $250 when they enter the \ndoughnut hole and pay less for drugs they purchase once they enter this \ncoverage gap.\n  Third, at a time when so many of us are worried about government \nspending, this bill does more to reduce the budget deficit so that we \ncan save up to $1.3 trillion in the next two decades. Those are real \nsavings. I find it ironic that some on the other side oppose them.\n  Fourth, the bill makes sure the so-called Cadillac tax, which was \nintended to affect the most expensive health care plans, is reduced by \n80 percent so that it hits its intended targets, not middle-class \nfamilies.\n  Fifth, the bill recognizes that we should do even more to help \nstruggling families afford health insurance, and so it provides new tax \nbreaks to help make coverage more affordable.\n  As I said, in the next few days my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are expected to file and attempt to offer numerous amendments \nto this bill. These are tactics that are purely dilatory. That is, \nagain, another reason I will oppose the amendments. Some of these \namendments may seem as though they are common sense, but each one is \ndesigned for the purpose of derailing this legislation, of sending it \nback to the House, of undercutting the most significant reform of \nhealth care in the last several decades.\n  But there is another aspect to this legislation which is vitally \nimportant; that is, the improvement to the student support system for \nhigher education. It is the dream of every parent that their child will \nhave a better life, and a big part of that dream is that they will have \nthe opportunity to go on to college or even an advanced degree. This \nbill ends the student aid system that gives away billions of Federal \nsubsidies to private banks, including some that helped create the 2008 \nfinancial meltdown, and instead puts those taxpayer dollars directly \ninto the hands of students to pay for their education.\n  During this economic downturn, paying for college has become all the \nmore difficult for many families in Rhode Island and across the Nation. \nLike health care, one of the top concerns of families as they sit \naround their kitchen tables during these difficult times is how they \nwill pay for their child's education. The key to ensuring our Nation's \neconomic stability and progress is also providing access to education. \nIt is the engine that moves people forward. It is what expands our \ncapacity and our capabilities in a complex world.\n  Now we have the opportunity so that we can, in fact, provide \nadditional assistance through Pell grants, and we can do it by saving \nmoney from bank subsidies and reinvesting that in Pell grants. \nApproximately $42 billion will be freed up; over $35 billion will be \ncommitted to Pell grants. It will be expanded to additional recipients, \nand the maximum grant will increase to nearly $6,000. We will also \nprovide in Rhode Island $7.5 million for information so that families \nand students can locate the best arrangements for their college \neducation, for their financial aid. It will also invest $2 billion in \ncommunity colleges, which have become a central part of our educational \nsystem, particularly for those people who are transitioning into the \nworkforce or through the workforce.\n  One final point: It is particularly fitting that we are investing in \nthe Pell grant, named after my predecessor Senator Claiborne Pell. His \nvision to give people the opportunity to higher education and then to \nstand back and watch them do great things has been legitimized and \nvindicated over 30 years. I don't think Senator Pell foresaw the \nInternet. I don't know how much he used it even when it arrived. But he \nknew if we gave people the skills and talents, they would do great \nthings. They have done great things.\n  With this legislation, they will do even more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the majority have on their half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a couple comments need to be responded to \nbecause they are so patently inconsistent with the facts that they \nshould be clearly rejected. It is almost as if somebody spent too much \ntime at the movie ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The idea that by their own \nscore, when you cut Medicare by $521 billion--$\\1/2\\ trillion cut out \nof Medicare by their own score, which is inaccurate, of course, because \nit doesn't count the full 10 years--if you count the full 10 years, it \nis $1 trillion taken out of Medicare--the idea that seniors are not \ngoing to be affected by that type of a cut is absurd on its face.\n  The claim is, we don't affect senior benefits. That is nice. That is \nlike telling somebody they can have a car, but there is no engine in \nit. I mean, the simple fact is, when you cut the providers of seniors \nby as much as this bill cuts them, clearly it is going to be harder for \na senior citizen to see a provider, a doctor, a hospital group. Or when \nyou reduce the spending on Medicare Advantage, which is an insurance \nprogram that many seniors appreciate--CBO scores the reduction as being \nso large that over 11 million seniors will be thrown off that system--\nthat affects seniors.\n  If they genuinely believe their language, ``we don't do anything \nabout Medicare; we don't do anything about seniors,'' even though the \nscore says they cut Medicare by $500 billion, their own score, and the \nCBO has said over 11 million people will be knocked off of Medicare \nAdvantage--if they believe that, if they believe their language, then \nthey have to vote for my amendment. They have to vote for my amendment \nwhich makes it clear that we protect Medicare.\n  Then there was some other comment made that somebody was going to \nvote against our amendments, not because they don't make sense but \nbecause they are dilatory. This is from a leadership on the other side \nof the aisle that produced the largest piece of social engineering in \nour history: 2,500 pages, $2.6 trillion of spending, $1 trillion of \ncuts in Medicare when fully implemented. They produced that bill in a \nclosed room behind a secret door somewhere on that side of the Capitol, \nnever open to the public, brought it to the floor of the Senate on a \nSaturday afternoon, filled up the tree, wouldn't allow any amendments, \nand within 3 days forced us to vote on it on Christmas Eve. Then they \ntook it over to the House, where they rewrote this trailer bill, again, \nin a secret room, behind a closed door, and brought that bill to the \nfloor and didn't allow anybody to amend that. But amendments are \ndilatory.\n  Why have an opposition party? Maybe we should just go with the Cuban \nsystem. That seems to be the attitude of the other side of the aisle. \nThe American people are an unfortunate inconvenience. The fact that \nthey have elected a Republican membership to this Senate and to the \nHouse, they are an unfortunate inconvenience that should be ignored and \nnot allowed to participate in the process.\n  When they come up with ideas such as protecting the Medicare system \nor such as taking out the sweetheart deals or such as suggesting that \nthe President and his people and the staff of the majority leader \nshould be under the laws we are about to pass or suggest that we should \nlive by the terms of the rhetoric which is, if your premiums go up, you \nwon't be impacted by this bill, or that says that there won't be any \ntaxes on people under $200,000 of income, amendments which just fulfill \nthe statements of the other side of the aisle on issues--they are going \nto keep the bill clean, they are not going to tax people under $200,000 \nof incomes, people's premiums won't go up, Medicare won't be affected, \nand everybody will be subject to this new law of the land, including \nthe President of the United States and his people and the staff of the \nmajority leader--when we offer amendments like that, they are dilatory. \nThey are an inconvenience. They\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nshould not be allowed. They should not be voted on, not because they \ndon't make sense but get rid of them; they are the opposition.\n  They are the American people speaking through their elected \nrepresentatives and they ought to have a voice and they ought to be \nvoted on and they ought to be given a vote based on the substance of \nthe amendments, not on the fact that the other side of the aisle \ndoesn't like opposition.\n  It is so arrogant, this attitude which pervades Washington now that \nsays: The American people, we know better than you do how to live your \nlives. Why do you get in our way? We in Washington know how you should \nlive. Just stand back. Let us make your decisions as to what you should \ndo with your life, especially relative to health care. We will do a \nmuch better job. Certainly, don't countenance any opposition. Don't \ncountenance any dissent, and, certainly, don't hold us to our word, for \nexample, when we say people with incomes under $200,000 won't be taxed \nor when we say premiums won't go up or when we say everybody will be \ncovered by the bill or when we say Medicare recipients won't be \nimpacted. Don't make us hold to those words by voting on amendments \nbecause those amendments are dilatory.\n  The arrogance is palpable and inexcusable.\n  Now we will hear from the Senator from Oklahoma who has another \namendment that I am sure the other side will say is dilatory and \ninappropriate, even though it makes a heck of a lot of sense to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3556\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  As I contemplate what is happening at 62 years of age and looking \nback through my life, this is undoubtedly the greatest assault on \nliberty this country has ever had. It is not direct; it is indirect. \nBut it is what the Senator from New Hampshire talked about: we are \ngoing to decide for you what you get.\n  What the American people still don't understand is there are three \nareas in this bill that in the next 5 years will put the government in \ncharge of everybody's health care--what you can have, what you can't \nhave, and who can give it to you. That is what is coming. So if you are \na caregiver or you are a patient, you might think long and hard about \nthe three provisions in this bill that are going to do that: a Medicare \nadvisory commission, the cost-effectiveness comparative effectiveness \npanel, and the U.S. preventative task force panel. All of those are \ngoing to carry the force of law, and it will not just apply to \ngovernment-run plans. If you have private insurance with your employer \ntoday, you are going to be told what treatments you can have because \nsome group of bureaucracies in Washington are going to decide that. \nThat is what is in this bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned several claims that have \nbeen made.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the pending motions \nand amendments so I may offer an amendment which is at the desk, No. \n3556.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3556.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription \n drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of \nViagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce \n                               abortion)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1306. REDUCING HEALTH CARE COSTS BY ELIMINATING PAYMENTS \n                   FOR FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND PROHIBITING COVERAGE \n                   FOR ABORTION DRUGS AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION \n                   DRUGS FOR RAPISTS AND CHILD MOLESTERS.\n\n       (a) Eliminating Fraudulent Payments for Prescription \n     Drugs.--The Secretary shall establish a fraud prevention \n     system and issue guidance to--\n       (1) prevent the processing of claims of prescribing \n     providers and dispensing pharmacies debarred from Federal \n     contracts or excluded from the Medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) or \n     the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396 et seq.);\n       (2) ensure that drug utilization reviews and restricted \n     recipient program requirements adequately identify and \n     prevent doctor shopping and other abuses of controlled \n     substances;\n       (3) develop a claims processing system to identify \n     duplicate enrollments and deaths of Medicaid beneficiaries \n     and prevent the approval of fraudulent claims; and\n       (4) develop a claims processing systems to identify deaths \n     of Medicaid providers and prevent the approval of fraudulent \n     claims filed using the identity of such providers.\n       (b) Prohibiting Coverage of Certain Prescription Drugs.--\n       (1) In general.--Health programs administered by the \n     Federal Government and American Health Benefit Exchanges (as \n     described in section 1311 of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act) shall not provide coverage or \n     reimbursement for--\n       (A) prescription drugs to treat erectile dysfunction for \n     individuals convicted of child molestation, rape, or other \n     forms of sexual assault; or\n       (B) drugs prescribed with the intent of inducing an \n     abortion for reasons other than as described in paragraph \n     (2).\n       (2) Exceptions.--The limitation under paragraph (1)(B) \n     shall not apply to an abortion--\n       (A) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as \n     certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death \n     unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering \n     physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy \n     itself; or\n       (B) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of forcible \n     rape or incest.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a constructive amendment that saves millions and \nmillions of dollars in Medicaid. The fraud in Medicaid prescriptions is \nout of this world. It can be fixed. This amendment will prohibit \nprescriptions for recreational drugs for rapists and child molesters. \nNobody can disagree with that. It is not in the bill. It is the current \nstate. But if this bill goes through without this amendment, your tax \ndollars are going to be paying for Viagra for child molesters. That is \nwhat is going to happen. There is an Executive order that this will \noverride. The bill overrides the Executive order. So there is no \nprohibition in the bill for this at this time.\n  A Government Accountability Office audit of Medicaid found 65,000 \ninstances of improper prescriptions costing $65 million over the last 2 \nyears, including thousands of prescriptions written for dead patients \nby people prescribing and posing as doctors. The audit focused on 10 \ntypes of frequently abused prescription drugs in just 5 States, which \nmeans this audit, which is just over 5 States, multiply by at least 10, \nand you get $650 million worth of fraud in prescriptions in Medicaid \nalone. We are not going to address that.\n\n  Sixty-five doctors or pharmacists were banned from Medicaid for \nwriting or filling prescriptions or illegally selling drugs--but just \nin those five States.\n  About 1,800 prescriptions were written for dead patients and 1,200 \nprescriptions were ``written'' by dead doctors--just in those five \nStates.\n  This amendment would direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices to enact the GAO recommendations to prevent and eliminate \nthese fraudulent prescriptions. Specifically, it would direct CMS to \nestablish a fraud prevention system for the Medicaid Program and issue \nguidance for States to prevent the processing of claims of all \nprescribing providers and dispensing pharmacies debarred from Federal \ncontracts or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs; ensure \nthat drug utilization review and restricted recipient program \nrequirements adequately identify and prevent doctor ``shopping'' and \nother abuses of controlled substances; develop a claims processing \nsystem to identify both duplicate enrollments and deaths of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and prevent the approval of fraudulent claims.\n  For years, the Federal Government had required States to provide \nprescriptions for Viagra and other impotence drugs to Medicaid \npatients, including to convicted sex offenders, child molesters, and \nrapists. States had provided the coverage based on a 1998 letter from \nthe Clinton administration. As a result of that, an Executive order was \nissued in 2005, which this bill, if\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\nunamended, will reverse. Mr. President, 800 convicted sex offenders in \n14 States received Medicaid-funded prescription drugs for erectile \ndysfunction. That is according to a 2005 survey.\n  The predators' victims have been as young as 2 years old. So we have \nconvicted sex offenders, rapists, and child molesters who were taking \nFederal tax dollars and buying a drug so they can act again.\n  In Florida, 218 cases; New York, 198 cases; Texas, 191 cases, and it \ngoes down the list.\n  This amendment would prohibit the new health care exchanges from \nproviding coverage of ED drugs to convicted child molesters and \nconvicted rapists. It is pretty simple.\n  The claims that are made on this bill are outlandish. As somebody who \nhas practiced medicine for 27 years, 50 percent of my patients were \nMedicaid patients. What you are going to do if you do not fix some of \nthe things in this bill is destroy the best doctor-patient \nrelationships in the world. That is what you are going to do.\n  You are going to put 16 million people into a failing Medicaid system \nthat the States cannot afford. Almost every State is cutting Medicaid \nreimbursement. At this time, only 40 percent of the doctors in the \nspecialties will see Medicaid patients. It is going to go to 20 \npercent. So we are going to put 16 million people in a system, and then \nthey are not going to be able to find a doctor. Because of the costs, \nin my own State, we are going to have an 11-percent net reduction in \nMedicaid reimbursements, which is only 75 percent of Medicare.\n  What do you think is going to happen in all the States in the country \nwhen the Medicaid reimbursement goes down and we add 16 million new \npeople to Medicaid? You are going to call it care. You are going to rub \nyour shoulder, rub that medal on your shoulder, and say: Oh, we fixed \nhealth care. You are going to promise them they are going to have care, \nbut they are not going to have care. They are going to have a card, but \nthey will have no care. We are going to have Indian Health Service-type \ncare in Medicaid because nobody is going to be there to care for them.\n  The claims under this bill keep me sleepless at night--not because of \nWashington but because of those 10,000 Medicaid patients I have taken \ncare of through my career for whom I know you are going to destroy what \ncare is left for them. You can claim otherwise, but the facts are going \nto prove you wrong. We are seeing it in every State in the country \nright now--the cuts to Medicaid reimbursements.\n  So at least you ought to help save $650 million a year by getting rid \nof fraudulent prescriptions, eliminating prescriptions for convicted \nchild molesters for erectile dysfunction, and recreational uses with \ndrugs such as Viagra. The American people do not want to pay for that.\n  To vote against this amendment, to not fix something that is very \nobvious, is criminal--it is not just not right, it is an active aid to \nhelp those who would hurt our children.\n  I yield to the minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say, we are fortunate to have a real \ndoctor, a physician, Dr. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, as one of our \ncolleagues in the Senate to talk about the real impact of legislation \nlike this as he sees it when he treats his patients. I think his words \ndeserve a lot of attention.\n  I just want to briefly address this morning a couple of the claims my \nDemocratic colleagues are making about this new legislation, claims \nthat are simply false.\n  The first one: There is a big tax cut. One of my colleagues said this \nis the biggest tax cut we have ever had. There is no tax cut for \ntaxpayers in this bill. What they are touting as a tax cut is, rather, \na direct payment to insurance companies. I find it very odd that is \ncalled a tax cut. When I think of a tax cut, I think of money remaining \nin the pockets of taxpayers so they do not have to pay taxes they have \nbeen paying in the past. That is not what is in this bill.\n  What the bill does is to provide a subsidy to insurance companies to \ndispense government-mandated insurance. It is not a tax cut for \ntaxpayers. Instead, most of the so-called tax relief goes directly to \nthe insurance companies. It never touches--you never touch the money--\nit never touches an American family's pocket.\n  These premium subsidies are delivered straight from the U.S. Treasury \nto help insurance companies, as I said, to purchase this government-\nmandated, government-approved insurance. They are not extra dollars in \npeople's pockets, as the chairman of the Finance Committee argued. They \nare, rather, advanceable, refundable tax credits, which is code for a \nnew tax entitlement. In fact, that is exactly the way it is recorded in \nthe Federal budget. It is recorded as a spending program, the reason \nbeing that the people receiving these so-called refundable credits paid \nvery little if any taxes. These are folks who do not pay taxes, so they \nget what is called a refundable tax credit. But even then the money \ngoes directly to the insurance company, not to them. I always thought \nyou had to pay taxes to get a tax cut, but not in the rubric of this \nlegislation.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, only about 8 percent of \nall taxpayers making under $200,000 a year would actually benefit from \nthis government subsidy for health insurance. The remaining 92 percent \nwould receive no tax benefit under the bill.\n  I have to say, when we are talking about tax cuts, we have to at \nleast put in a little word about the tax increases in the bill because \nthat is where the bill focuses, on taxes. It taxes many of those who \nhave health insurance and taxes people if they do not have health \ninsurance.\n  The taxes in the bill hit families. They hit seniors and the \nchronically ill, small businesses, those who have flexible spending \naccounts, and those who use medical devices. All of those things create \na tax people pay. The vast majority of the people who pay these taxes \nare not high earners. As the Congressional Budget Office has said, \nwhenever there is a tax on some other entity that delivers health \nservices, that tax flows directly through to the taxpayers in virtually \nthe same amount of money.\n  In fact, in order to collect all of these taxes, and especially the \ntax that is imposed on people if they do not buy this insurance, the \nInternal Revenue Service estimates it is going to have to have between \n$5 billion and $10 billion more just in order to collect the taxes. It \nhas been estimated this would require 16,500 new IRS agents. Welcome to \nyour friendly new health care bill.\n  The second aspect my colleagues have been talking a lot about in the \nlast 48 hours: The elimination of the problem of preexisting conditions \nin acquiring health insurance. The implication is that Republicans have \nnot supported help for people who have preexisting conditions. That is \nnot true. We have made that point clear. We made that point clear in \nthe meeting we had with the President at Blair House. The argument is \nabout the best way to do it.\n  As you will see in just a moment, it turns out this bill has not done \nit very well. Republicans have suggested there are a lot of different \nways to get to this problem--State reforms, risk pools, more \ncompetition, some subsidization. All of these things can help us with \nthis problem. But for all of the Democrats' central planning in this \nbill, it looks as though the problems are already arising as a result \nof their specific provision to deal with this problem.\n  According to a brand new Associated Press story of March 24, \nPresident Obama's claims about preexisting coverage for children are \nnot what they seem. The article notes that ``the letter of the law''--\nwhich Democrats took upon themselves to write behind closed doors--\n``provided a less-than-complete guarantee that kids with health \nproblems would not be shut out of coverage.''\n  In your rush to do these things--behind closed doors, without proper \nvetting, always voting no on any attempts to correct it--you end up \nwith problems like this, and they are going to have to somehow go back \nand try to fix this. If this blunder is discovered on the first day \nthis law takes effect, how many more errors will be discovered in the \nnext days and weeks, as people pour over the 2,733 pages of this new \nhealth care law, and the 150 pages of the reconciliation bill that is \non the floor right now?\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\n  If you cannot draft a bill properly to protect children with \npreexisting conditions--which is a centerpiece of the bill's so-called \nimmediate deliverables--then how are you going to be able to \nsuccessfully make one-sixth of the economy work through this new \ngovernment-operated system?\n  Finally, I have talked about two things our Democratic friends are \ncrowing about, neither one of which, it turns out, I think are worth \ncrowing about. How about the things they are not talking about, the \nthings Americans are very concerned about?\n  Democrats love to talk about people who are allegedly helped by the \nlegislation. How about those who are hurt by the bill? How about \ntalking about seniors whose care is going to be jeopardized as a result \nof this bill? Seniors in my State of Arizona are very worried about the \nMedicare cuts. There are over $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts in this \nbill.\n  Well, our Democratic friends do not like to talk about that. But it \nis a reality. It is in the bill. The reconciliation bill slashes more \nthan $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare and contains a whopping $202 billion \nreduction in Medicare Advantage. That is more than in the bill the \nSenate passed last December. But you do not hear about that. Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries in my State like the health care they have \nright now, and it is simply not true if they like their health care \nthey get to keep it. It is false. This bill takes health care benefits \naway from seniors who are on Medicare Advantage. That is the truth. It \nmay be an inconvenient truth for our colleagues who like to stress what \nthey think is good about the bill but conveniently ignore things that \nare going to hurt their constituents and certainly going to hurt my \nconstituents.\n  My senior citizens in Arizona do not want the government taking away \ntheir health care, and they are very concerned as a result. A \nconstituent from Tucson--I will just close with this--wrote me a very \nshort, a very direct letter, but it summarizes the point a lot of \npeople feel.\n\n       I am a senior citizen, age 83. If I lose my Medicare \n     Advantage coverage, I'll also lose my primary care physician \n     of 18 years because he does not accept Medicare Direct. \n     Senator Kyl, do not let them take away my Medicare Advantage.\n\n  Well, all of us know physicians who are no longer taking new Medicare \npatients. They cannot afford to because we do not pay them enough. Mayo \nClinic in Arizona has already said it is not going to accept any more \nMedicare patients at several of its facilities in the Phoenix \nmetropolitan area.\n  This health care bill is asking a lot of the American people, a lot \nin terms of tax collection, and a lot in terms of future debt that our \nchildren and grandchildren are going to have to pay.\n  But just one group that ought to be very concerned--and is--are our \nsenior citizens who face nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. Taxes \nand premiums are going to be increased on all Americans. Small \nbusinesses will be hit with a litany of onerous new taxes and mandates \nand regulations. Probably worst of all from my perspective, just as \nthese costs inevitably escalate, as time goes on, just as in the \nEuropean countries that have had to deal with these same kind of health \ncare issues, this legislation will ultimately lead to the rationing of \nhealth care. That is the cruelest result of all.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nan op-ed piece by Mr. Bob Robb who writes for the Arizona Republic. It \nis dated March 24. The last two sentences of this op-ed I think \nsummarize the point I made very well. He says:\n\n       But it is impossible to treat health care as a public good \n     without rate regulation and rationing. And those are the \n     inevitable next steps down the health care road the Democrats \n     have taken the country.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 24, 2010]\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       Democrats tend to discount the influence of economic \n     incentives on human behavior. They had better hope they are \n     right because the incentives in the health-care bill point \n     toward an explosion in costs.\n       The health-care bill is built upon a fundamental tradeoff. \n     Health-insurance companies will be treated as public \n     utilities, having to take all customers irrespective of \n     health status with sharp limitations on pricing and \n     underwriting. To pay for this increase in costs, everyone \n     will be required to purchase health insurance.\n       This is an attempt to force the young and healthy to \n     subsidize the health care of the acutely or chronically sick \n     through the premium mechanism. But, as finally passed, the \n     incentives and timing are badly misaligned.\n       The basic problem is that the penalty for not purchasing \n     insurance is substantially less than the cost of the \n     insurance. Even with the generous subsidies the bill \n     provides, young singles making more than $25,000 a year will \n     be money ahead paying the penalty rather than buying \n     insurance.\n       Doing so would be risk-free for them. If necessary, they \n     can purchase insurance after they get sick and know that they \n     need it. The implementation timetable for the bill \n     accentuates the misaligned incentives.\n       Insurance companies are saddled with additional costs right \n     away.\n       They will have to accept children with pre-existing \n     conditions and carry children on their parents' policies up \n     to age 26. They can't impose lifetime benefit limits. Any new \n     policies have to cover preventive services without co-pays or \n     deductibles. But the individual mandate, the source of new \n     revenue to cover the additional costs, doesn't kick in until \n     2014.\n       Moreover, the penalties start very low, only $95 in 2014, \n     while the requirement to accept all comers irrespective of \n     pre-existing conditions applies fully that year. So, the \n     additional costs are added full bore, while the additional \n     revenue is phased in slowly.\n       This misalignment of incentives in the individual market is \n     compounded by a similar misalignment in the group market.\n       The penalty for employers (with more than 50 employees) not \n     providing health insurance is $2,000 per employee. Employers \n     pay on average two to four times that to provide health \n     insurance.\n       Employers do it now to compete for employees, since the \n     current individual market isn't an attractive alternative. \n     But, under the bill, the federal government is setting up and \n     heavily subsidizing an individual market with generous \n     benefits.\n       So, the incentive will be for employers to drop health-\n     insurance coverage, pay the fine and allow their employees to \n     go shopping in the subsidized exchanges.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8 million to \n     9 million Americans will lose employer-provided health \n     insurance. I think that's a gross underestimate.\n       Moving people into the individual market could be a good \n     thing for cost control, if individual health insurance \n     operated like other individual insurance products, where \n     people pick up the cost of small stuff and insure against big \n     stuff. But the individual market mandated by the bill \n     requires first-dollar coverage and sharply limits deductibles \n     and co-pays.\n       So, the bill gives incentives to move people into an \n     individual market with even less cost-control incentives than \n     the existing system, where at least employers worry about the \n     final tab. It also gives many people an incentive not to \n     participate in the new system until they are actually sick.\n       If incentives matter, there are likely to be sharp \n     insurance-rate increases and insurance-company bankruptcies.\n       Contrary to the rhetoric on the right, it is possible to \n     treat health care as a public good without being a socialist \n     country. And it is possible to treat health care as a public \n     good without having it delivered through government agencies.\n       But it is impossible to treat health care as a public good \n     without rate regulation and rationing. And those are the \n     inevitable next steps down the health-care road the Democrats \n     have taken the country.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3608\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending motions and amendments so that I may offer an \namendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Enzi, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3608.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the right of States to opt out of a Federal health \n                             care takeover)\n\n       At the end of section 1002, insert the following:\n       (c) Right of States to Opt Out of Federal Health Care \n     Takeover.--Section 1321(d) of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Nothing'' and inserting:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     nothing''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Exception for opt out of health care reform.--The \n     provisions of, and the\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n     amendments made by, this Act shall not preempt any State law \n     enacted after the date of enactment of this Act that exempts \n     the State from such provisions or amendments, including, but \n     not limited to, provisions and amendments relating to the \n     individual mandate, the employer mandate, taxes on \n     prescription drugs, taxes on medical devices, taxes on high \n     value health plans, Medicare cuts, and the unfunded expansion \n     of Medicaid.''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is to \nallow States to opt out of this health care bill. If ever there was an \nencroachment on the tenth amendment, this bill is it.\n  We are hearing from State leaders all across the country asking \nCongress to abandon this bill. It is an unconstitutional preemption of \nState innovation, State prerogative, and States rights they are \nguaranteed in the Constitution by the tenth amendment. Thirteen States \nhave now filed suit against this legislation because the leaders in \nthose States know the detrimental impact this broad, one-size-fits-all \nsolution will have on their unique situations. States are the most well \nequipped to design and approve governmental programs to address the \nneeds of their citizens. My amendment would restore the tenth amendment \nrights reserved for the States by allowing State legislatures to pass \nlegislation that would allow them to opt out of this bill and the \nFederal takeover of their health care system with its mandates, many of \nwhich are unfunded.\n  Let's walk through the harmful provisions in this bill from which the \nStates could opt out.\n  Taxes, the job-killing taxes. The bill imposes 10 years of taxes, \nabout $\\1/2\\ trillion, on individuals and businesses as well as \npharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and medical device \nmanufacturers. Some of these taxes will start almost immediately. More \nthan $100 billion in taxes on prescription drug companies, medical \ndevice manufacturers, and insurance companies will begin to take effect \nbefore the actual supposed benefits of this bill would come into play. \nStudies show these taxes will be passed on to consumers. There is no \ndoubt about it. Of course they are going to be passed on to consumers. \nThey are going to be collected for years before there are any supposed \nbenefits. Then there are the taxes on those who can't afford insurance: \nthe higher of $695 per individual or 2.5 percent of household income. \nEmployers will be hit with new taxes. The penalty could be as high as \n$2,000 or $3,000 per employee.\n  What is this going to do to the small businesses of our country, \nwhich create 70 percent of the jobs? At a time when families are \nstruggling, at a time when our businesses are struggling, at a time \nwhen our economy is at an all-time low--not all-time low, but almost \nall-time low; certainly bad--businesses aren't hiring. Why aren't they \nhiring? They aren't because they have a fear of the future. They don't \nknow what to expect going forward. They are not going to start hiring \npeople until there is a comfort level that the economy has stabilized \nand that we are in a real recovery mode. Yet, when people feel that way \nand when small businesses feel that way, what is the biggest deterrent \nto them being able to say, OK, things are getting better and I can hire \nnew people? More taxes and more mandates and more burdens. That is what \nis going to keep them from taking that leap to hire more people. So it \nis like a revolving situation we are not going to get out of as long as \nwe are continuing to put on more taxes, more expenses, and more \nmandates.\n  We know premiums are going to go up. Premiums are already going up. \nOur purpose in this bill should be to bring premiums down by lowering \nthe cost of health care, not by increasing the cost. That is so \ncounterintuitive. It could only be thought of in Washington, DC.\n  Cuts to Medicare. The Senate bill includes over $\\1/2\\ trillion in \ncuts to Medicare. About $135 billion of those are in cuts to hospitals.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, the Medicare Program is unsustainable. \nThe Chief Actuary of Medicare has said that as much as 20 percent of \nMedicare's providers will either go out of business or will stop seeing \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Millions of seniors, including those who have chosen Medicare \nAdvantage, will lose the coverage they now enjoy. Medicare is being \nused as a piggy bank and it needs every penny that has been deposited.\n  We cannot pay for reform on the backs of our seniors. Cuts to \nhospitals will threaten access to care for seniors in our States.\n  Third, this bill imposes on States an unfunded mandate to expand the \nMedicaid Program. Putting millions of individuals in to Medicaid is a \nfast way to quickly reduce the number of uninsured.\n  Yet by doing so, the Federal Government is sending a very large check \nto the States, $20 billion to be exact, with a note that says ``We \ndecide--you pay.''\n  At a time when so many States are struggling to balance their \nbudgets, pay their teachers, improve transportation, maintain services, \nthis bill imposes more costs.\n  How much more are we going to ask of our States?\n  States are in the best position to determine what is right for their \ncitizens. Yet this bill will take away their right to innovate and \ndetermine fiscally responsible and effective ways to offer affordable \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  In big government style, this bill manipulates that idea into a one-\nsize-fits all solution for every single State.\n  Plus, states should have the option of implementing tort reform as we \nhave done in Texas. Yet under this bill States are actually punished \nfor implementing tort reform. Tort reform is essential to bring down \nthe cost of health care. This bill stiffles the ability to achieve this \ncommonsense option.\n  Why not level the playing field for taxpayers by offering tax \nincentives to encourage the purchase of health insurance at the State \nlevel. Let citizens in each State decide which health insurance plan \nbest fits their needs--a decision that should be free from interference \nby the Federal Government.\n  Senator DeMint and I have a bill which would offer a voucher of \n$2,000 to individuals and $5,000 to families so they can purchase \nhealth insurance that is portable and not tied to their employer.\n  These are the right steps to achieving reform and these steps empower \nthe States rather than violate their rights and impose a heavy handed \nFederal approach to reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which is cosponsored \nby Senators Enzi, Coburn, Burr and Brown of Massachusetts.\n  The bottom line is I hope my colleagues will vote to support the \nStates rights so that we will be able to address high unemployment as \nwell as high uninsured rates in a way that will lower the costs and \ngive more options.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now wish to yield to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  I have already said we are going to divide the time in half-hour \nsegments back and forth.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, on which I am proud to serve, for yielding time, as well as \nfor the great work he has done. I wish to commend Senators Dodd and \nHarkin for the great work they have done in the HELP Committee and all \nthe members of the HELP Committee, as well as the Finance Committee \nand, of course, Majority Leader Reid, who has been as solid as a rock \nand steadfast in his own quiet way. He is more responsible for this \nbill passing than just about anybody else. So I thank our leadership \nfor that.\n  I rise today to talk about this historic accomplishment of health \ncare reform. I congratulate all of my colleagues for their hard work \nand dedication. I congratulate the President. He, too, was like a rock. \nHe never budged. The day after the Massachusetts election, when so many \nothers were saying we can't get this done and to trim back, he was \nsteadfast. I saw him and his steadfastness. His internal gyroscope got \nus over the goal line.\n  I wish to address where the future is in this bill in terms of \naverage Americans. We all know the American people are still trying to \ndigest the health care legislation we have just passed. That is \nunderstandable. It is a large and complex piece of legislation and, of \ncourse, there has been a tremendous\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\namount of misinformation out there about what it does and what it does \nnot do. To tell the average American that this is truly historic \nlegislation doesn't get to them. They want to know how it is going to \naffect them.\n  I fervently believe that the more the American people learn about \nthis bill, the more they will like it. I believe this for two reasons. \nFirst: People very quickly come to see that the myths and lies that \nsome have put forward about this bill will not come true, because they \nare not in reality, and now we are in reality--we are in health care \nreality--because the first part of the bill has passed, the major part, \nand we will pass the second.\n  Second: There are so many good things in this bill that people like \nand need. As people learn the truth as to what those things are, many \nof which will improve their lives--some immediately and some in a few \nyears--I am confident they will not only like health care reform but \nembrace it. When the crime bill was passed in 1994, at first the same \nthing happened. There was a parade of horribles. But over the years, we \nsaw that it reduced crime and made America a better place, and it \nbecame a very popular piece of legislation. I believe the same thing \nwill occur with this health care bill.\n  So today I wish to take the rest of my time to describe to average \nAmericans how this bill will affect them. The No. 1 group, the largest \ngroup of average Americans, is those who are covered by their employer \nplan. First, you will keep your coverage. For people who have been \nscared into thinking they might lose their health coverage or have the \ngovernment telling them what to do or what treatments they could or \ncould not receive, they are going to discover there is very little \nchange for them. I had a firefighter employed by the city of New York \non Long Island last week say to me: Don't pass the bill. I will lose my \nbenefits. That firefighter will see his benefits will stay as good and \nas strong as they are now. In fact, it will get better for those folks \nwho are already covered, because premiums to their employer won't go up \nand up and up, and their employer will not continue to ask them, as \nthey have now, to pay so much more and to get so much less back.\n  We cannot claim premiums won't go up at all, but we know they will go \nup much less. The likelihood of the employer calling a person, the \naverage person, a worker in their company and saying: Jim, Mary, you \nare a great worker. I love you. I want you to stay in my company, but I \nam eliminating your health care benefits or I am greatly cutting them \nback, will be greatly reduced over the years as this bill becomes law \nand works its way.\n  Beneficiaries, those on private health care, won't pay higher \nMedicare taxes. Their benefits will not change. Their choice of doctors \nwill not change. They will be much better off, and they will learn \nthat.\n  Second: To small business owners who are trying to do the right thing \nand provide health insurance coverage to their workers and now find \nthat costs are increasing, which makes it more and more difficult every \nyear to keep those employees on health care, they are going to find \nthis year that there is a generous tax credit to make it more \naffordable to provide coverage for their employees. The average small \nbusinessperson is going to like this bill because the average small \nbusiness owner wants their employees to have good health care coverage, \nbut they can't do it alone. Now they are going to get some help.\n  What about to the small business owner who aches because he or she \ncan't supply insurance because the employee has a preexisting condition \nor just because it is too expensive? They are going to find they will \nnow be able to provide insurance for those folks.\n  What about all of those families with kids who are now in college and \nthey worry, once the kid gets out of college, they are not going to \nhave health care? They are going to find that they are covered up until \ntheir 26th birthday on their parents' plan. They have to be. That is \ngoing to start this year. What a relief to millions of American \nfamilies and millions of American students. I know this personally. My \ndaughter is graduating from law school. When the bill passed at 1 a.m., \nshe called me. She was watching when the House bill passed and said: \nDad, I have been worried what I am going to do about health insurance \nnext year. She is out in the job market. Now I don't have to worry. \nThat phone call will be repeated by hundreds of thousands and millions \nof students to their parents in the next while. So it is great for \nthem.\n  What about retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare, the person \nwho fears that because they don't have their job or they are retiring \nat age 60 or 62, 61, what are they going to do? This bill will provide \nmore assistance to bring down premiums. It will provide more choices to \nthese retirees who right now have either no health insurance or a \npolicy that is so expensive they can't afford it.\n  What about average Americans who worry because say they have early \nstages of diabetes and their health care doesn't cover prevention? \nAverage American families--and I see the Senator from Iowa is here, who \nhas been a leader in the fight for prevention--will now get prevention \nin their benefits. For the average American who has recently gotten \nsick or who might in the future, they don't have to worry that their \ninsurance company will take away their benefits. They will not be able \nto do that the way they do now. We won't have to hear stories anymore \nof health insurers looking for any excuse to cut sick people off from \ntheir insurance.\n  What about those tens of millions on Medicare who, again, have been \nscared and worried that Medicare will change? Yes, Medicare will \nchange. It will get stronger and still preserve the exact same benefit \nto every person on Medicare.\n  Before this bill was signed into law, Medicare was going to go broke \nin 7 years. It has been given an extra decade. That should be a huge \nload off the shoulders of people who worry about Medicare.\n  In addition, the doughnut hole will be closed, so all those Medicare \nrecipients on prescription drugs will get relief--more relief.\n  For the average senior citizen, as they learn about this bill, they \nare going to like this bill. They are going to say this was a great \nthing. It kept Medicare as is, surviving much longer than previously \npredicted. If we had done nothing and Medicare was about to go broke, \nguess who would have paid the price. Those senior citizens on it.\n  What about young women looking for health insurance? Health reform \nmeans she will not be charged a premium 150 percent more than a young \nman's. Health reform ends that gender discrimination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in conclusion, I will just say this: In \nNovember, this bill will be a positive--a strong positive for those who \nsupported it. Those who were in favor of it will benefit. Those who \nopposed it will come to regret their opposition as America learns about \nwhat is in and what is not in this bill. It is not just a triumph for \nhistory; it is a triumph for the average American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee--I yield to another distinguished chairman, this one not of \nthe HELP Committee but the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus. I congratulate him on his leadership \non this issue for many months.\n  I rise in strong support of the reconciliation bill that is before \nus. It is a historic time for our Nation. I am very glad that after \ndecades of effort, national health reform has become law and that we \nare considering this set of changes to the law through this \nreconciliation bill.\n  There is considerable confusion about what health reform, in fact, \nwill accomplish. It is not surprising that there is confusion when one \nconsiders all of the nefarious charges that have been made and claims \nof nefarious provisions within the legislation. I am glad to see that \nmost Americans, according to polling, believe the actual provisions \nthat are described to them that are contained in the bill are \nmeritorious and deserve support.\n  Simply stated, the law has four main goals. It reforms health \ninsurance markets to ensure Americans have access\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nto affordable care that meets their needs. Second, the bill improves \nthe efficiency and quality of health care and does it in a way that \nhelps contain rapidly rising costs. Third, the bill improves access to \nprimary care and preventive services. Fourth, the bill significantly \nreduces the Federal deficit over the coming decades.\n  I think we need to focus on what the effect of the legislation will \nbe on particular individuals and families in our States.\n  I look at our circumstance in New Mexico, which I am proud to \nrepresent. Let me pick out a few examples.\n  First, there are families there who are very happy with their current \ncoverage. For these folks, reform ensures they can keep that coverage. \nThey do not have to purchase any new coverage offered through health \ninsurance exchanges. The reform will help protect their coverage and \nintroduces important policies to put downward pressure on the cost of \npremiums, requirements that the coverage continue to be meaningful, and \nsignificant improvements in the overall quality of and their access to \nhealth care.\n  Small business owners or the people who work for small businesses--a \nthird of the people in my home State fall into that category. For those \nwho do offer coverage, we know that without reform, they have \ndifficulty affording and keeping meaningful and affordable coverage for \ntheir employees. Premiums are rising quickly. These costs threaten the \nfinancial stability of these small businesses.\n  CBO tells us that for small businesses, the impact of reform will be \nvery significant. First, the businesses would have the option to come \nto the new health insurance exchanges and would have a guaranteed \nsource of meaningful coverage for themselves and their employees. In \naddition, these small businesses may qualify for tax credits for up to \n50 percent of the cost of coverage. For businesses receiving tax \ncredits, their employees' premiums would decrease by 8 to 11 percent \ncompared to their costs under current law. Small businesses and their \nemployees do well.\n  What about individuals purchasing coverage in the individual market? \nThis is particularly important in my home State, for over half of the \nworkers in my State are not offered employer-sponsored coverage. We \nhave the highest percentage of workers without coverage of any State in \nthe Union.\n  Like small businesses, individuals today have great difficulty in \nnavigating insurance policies, securing affordable and meaningful \ncoverage. This reform will provide these individuals with the options \nto come to new health insurance exchanges and have a guaranteed source \nof meaningful coverage for themselves and their families. The \nCongressional Budget Office predicts that the subsidies enrollees would \npay would reduce the premiums they otherwise would have to pay by 50 to \n60 percent.\n  Among higher income enrollees in the individual market who would not \nreceive new subsidies--only about one-fifth of new enrollees--average \npremiums would increase by 10 to 13 percent.\n  This is consistent with estimates of the impact in my home State of \nNew Mexico, where average families may see a decrease in premiums of as \nmuch as 60 percent as compared to the premiums they would pay without \nreform. In addition, about two-thirds of New Mexicans could potentially \nqualify for subsidies or Medicaid.\n  This reconciliation bill also contains important provisions to help \nAmericans obtain a quality education. The higher education provisions \nof this bill will help put college within reach for more Americans. By \neliminating subsidies to private student lenders, the bill supports \nlarge Pell grant increases for low-income college students, grants to \nStates to help low-income students enter and succeed in college, and \nmajor new investments in minority-serving colleges and universities. \nAnd it does this without raising taxes; in fact, the CBO estimates that \nthese student loan reforms will reduce the deficit by over $10 billion \nover 10 years.\n  In challenging economic times, we can no longer afford to subsidize \nprivate lenders at the expense of college students and their families. \nIn my home State of New Mexico, this bill will provide almost $240 \nmillion in new Pell grant funding and an estimated $95 million for \nHispanic-serving institutions and tribal colleges over the next 10 \nyears. In supporting economically disadvantaged college students \nthrough this bill, we help them to achieve the American dream. We also \nstrengthen our economy by ensuring that we continue to have the \nsmartest, most competitive workforce in the world.\n  It is clear that the legislation before us and the new health reform \nlaw signed by President Obama yesterday are important steps forward for \nour country. Once we get beyond the rhetoric and discuss the specific \nreforms in this legislation--it becomes clear that this bill is vital \nto our Nation. It protects the aspects of our health care system that \nare working well while fixing those things that are broken including \noutlawing the nefarious games that health insurance companies play. It \nimproves health care quality and it reduces costs; reforms the student \nloan system and expands important programs to help all America's \nchildren access a higher education--and it does all this while \nsubstantially reducing the Federal deficit.\n  I hope we can join our colleagues in the House and move swiftly to \npass this reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will conclude by complimenting my \nother committee chair who is on the Senate floor, Senator Harkin, who \nhas worked tirelessly to get this legislation through the HELP \nCommittee. He deserves great credit for his leadership on this bill, as \ndoes Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, that is a good introduction to the next \nspeaker, the distinguished chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico for his \nkind words, and I thank him for the great work he did on getting us to \nthis point.\n  I have a limited amount of time. I want to respond to the motion to \ncommit made by the Senator from Tennessee yesterday that would reduce \nour investment in Pell grants and replace them with lower student \ninterest rates.\n  We all want lower student interest rates. I am, quite frankly, \nsurprised. I do not remember my colleague from Tennessee or other \ncolleagues on that side of the aisle raising much cane around here when \nthe private bankers and Sallie Mae were charging students over 20 \npercent interest. I did not hear a peep out of the other side.\n  We have capped all of those interest rates now, and we are changing \nthis program to a direct loan program to get the middlemen out. By \ncutting out the middlemen, by cutting out the huge subsidies to the \nbankers, we are able to save over $61 billion over the next 10 years, \nwhich we are using, again, to put into the Pell Grant Program to help \nour students.\n  I said yesterday, and I repeat, think about the present status quo \nwith this indirect guaranteed student loan program. Think about how \nbizarre it really is. The Federal Government pays fees to private banks \nto make entirely risk-free loans using taxpayer dollars. The loans, \nwhich are already guaranteed by the Federal Government, are then sold \nback to the Federal Government. The banks then pocket tens of billions \nof dollars, taxpayers' dollars, in fees and easy profits at absolutely \nno risk to them whatsoever. This has been going on for far too long. \nWhat this bill does is it ends that. It takes all those savings that \notherwise would go to Sallie Mae and to the bankers and puts them into \nPell grants.\n  While I would agree that our students have too much debt--way too \nmuch debt; 73 percent of 4-year college graduates in my State of Iowa \ngraduated with debt that averaged over $28,000. The national average is \n$23,200 for a student graduating from college. My Iowa students have \nthe second highest debt loads in the Nation. We are taking charge of \nthat.\n  Three years ago, in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of \n2007, we created the Income-Based Repayment program. What that bill \nsaid is that a borrower's payment would be capped at 15 percent of \ntheir net income after adjustments are made for living expenses\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nand provided total loan forgiveness after 25 years. We targeted that \nassistance to people who had the most difficult time repaying their \nloan.\n  More can be done. Here is what we did in this bill. Starting in 2014, \na new borrower's monthly payment will be capped at 10 percent of their \nnet income. They will be eligible for total loan forgiveness after 20 \nyears. This is going to make college much more affordable for students \neven after they graduate.\n  If my friend from Tennessee wants to look at ways of reducing \ninterest rates, I am all for it. Some of the biggest users of credit \ncards are kids in college, and look what they are being charged under \ncredit cards--well over 20 percent, 30 percent sometimes on their \ncredit cards. And they need that for immediate needs. If you are a \nparent with a kid in college, you know what I am talking about.\n  If you really want to help students, how about capping the interest \nrates they can charge on credit cards. I advocated that 20 years ago. \nWe cap it at 12, 15 percent. They cannot charge any more than that. But \nI do not hear my friend from the other side talking about that. That \nwould do more to help our students than just about anything else.\n  Three years ago when we cut the interest rates on student loans, we \nwere criticized by the Republicans for not doing enough to increase \nPell grants. Now we are being criticized for doing too much on Pell \ngrants and not enough on interest rates for students. We see what this \nis. It is just another attempt to try to kill this reconciliation bill. \nThat is all it is. Of course I am for lower interest rates. Who \nwouldn't be? Of course we are all for making the interest rates lower. \nWhen this reconciliation bill is through, I intend to come to the floor \non some bill that probably will be coming up--maybe a financial bill or \nsomething like that--and I will be proposing at that time that we have \nlower interest rates. I ask my friend from Tennessee to join us in that \neffort at that time. But now is not the time and this is not the bill \non which to do this.\n  We have to get our reconciliation bill through. Every amendment being \noffered by the Republicans is no more than an attempt to stop and kill \nthis reconciliation bill, and we cannot allow that to happen.\n  We are going to have an education bill this year. We are going to \nhave an elementary and secondary education bill I hope sometime this \nyear. Higher Education Act changes are in this reconciliation bill. We \nare going to make sure the students have the money to go to college and \nPell grants for the lowest income students. And, yes, we have capped \ninterest rates at 6.8 percent. Could they be lower? I invite my friend, \nwhen we have another bill up that addresses this, let's see if we can \nget lower interest rates. I would be glad to work on that issue at that \ntime. But right now, let's put the savings, the $61 billion that we are \nsaving--let's do what this bill does: put it into better Pell grants so \nthe kids can get into college in the first place.\n  We also put $2.5 billion into something we have neglected for far too \nlong; that is, our Historically Black Colleges and Universities and \nother Minority-serving Institutions. So a big chunk of that money goes \nin there so they can also get a good education.\n\n  So this bill was carefully crafted. We put the money in there in the \nPell grants. Let's keep them there and let's address the issue of the \ninterest rates later on. I invite my Republican friends to join with us \nin doing that, especially on credit cards when that issue comes up down \nthe pike.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, when the vote comes up, to defeat the \nAlexander motion to commit and to keep the money in there for Pell \ngrants.\n  I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about how much \nthis underlying legislation helps small business. We hear a lot of \nclaims to the contrary, and I wish to set the record straight.\n  Essentially, small business people in America today spend about 18 \npercent more than the large businesses for the same health care \ncoverage. Why is that? Because of high broker fees--small businesses \nhave to buy insurance through brokers--because administrative costs are \nhigher for them compared to big businesses, and adverse selection hurts \nthem much more than big business. There are a lot of reasons why small \nbusinesses pay 18 percent more for health care than big business.\n  This legislation contains $37 billion in small business tax credits--\n$37 billion in small business tax credits--most of which go into effect \nthis year, not later but this year, tax credits for a businessperson \nwho wants to offer health insurance for his or her employees. Add to \nthat insurance reforms, which are very much going to help small \nbusiness. What are they? Preventing insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against small employees based on preexisting conditions, \npreventing discrimination on the basis of older or sicker employees, \ndiscrimination based on the size of the plan or discrimination against \nthose whose employees work in dangerous industries.\n  All these insurance reforms are going to help small business. I might \nsay the Congressional Budget Office also estimates the Senate bill will \nlower premium costs by nearly 7 percent for small businesses--lower \npremium costs, not increase them, as has been suggested, but lower \npremium costs for small business.\n  The bill also provides for State-based exchanges. That is going to \nhelp small business because that will require more competition among \ninsurance companies. That will help give better rates and better \nquality insurance to small businesses.\n  I might say this as well. The legislation exempts small businesses--\nthat is a business with 50 or fewer employees--from the requirement \nthat employers that do not sponsor health care insurance pay a fee for \ntheir employees receiving premium tax credits. That is an exemption for \nsmall businesses with fewer than 50 employees from paying any penalty \nif they do not provide insurance.\n  So I wished to make it very clear that this bill very much helps \nsmall business--and I repeat--with $37 billion in small business tax \ncredits, along with the other reasons I gave.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't know if Senator McCaskill is in \nthe Chamber. I doubt she wants to take 1\\1/2\\ minutes. If not, I will \nyield back the 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I understand Senator McCaskill is here now and wishes to speak, so I \nwill try to find a way to squeeze in as much time as I can.\n  You are on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized, and \nshe has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am confused about why the hearing we \nhad scheduled this afternoon cannot go forward. The subject matter of \nthis hearing is oversight of the contract that is engaged in police \ntraining in Afghanistan in the Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight. \nThis is a hearing that is getting to the heart of the matter; that we \nhave a real problem with the mission part in Afghanistan on police \ntraining because of problems with these contracts--problems with \noversight at the State Department.\n  We have now canceled the hearing because we have been told we can't \nhave it. The witness from the State Department has been canceled, the \nwitness from the Defense Department has been canceled, and the \ninspectors general who were coming to testify about a GAO report that \njust came out last week that was damning in its criticism in the \noversight of these contracts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I don't get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is there an order providing for the next \nhalf hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the Republican side control \nthe next half hour and that the majority control the half hour \nfollowing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, that would be a half hour \noff, so\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nwe should have the half hour after that because you got the first half \nhour.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We won't worry about that yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine is about to take the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire very much for his leadership and for consideration of the \ntime today.\n  As consideration of health care reform draws to a close in the Senate \nwith the pending reconciliation bill, I cannot help but arrive at this \nmoment with a sense of profound disappointment in considering what \nmight have been, rather than what has actually occurred with respect to \none of the foremost domestic matters of our time.\n  As I stated as a member of the Senate Finance Committee at the \nconclusion of our markup of health reform legislation last October, \nthis is one of the most complex set of issues ever placed before us. At \nthe same time, I have said the reality that crafting the right approach \nis arduous in no way obviates our responsibility to make it happen, \ngiven the enormous implications of reordering more than $33 trillion in \nhealth care expenditures over the next 10 years, representing one-sixth \nof our economy and affecting every American.\n  Well, if there is one thing I have learned, it is that the only way \nto allay people's fears is by systematically working through the \nconcerns, the issues, and the policy alternatives from all sides. When \nwe hear proponents portraying the passage of health care reform as the \nequivalent of landmark legislation of the past, what they fail to note \nis, those efforts were all bipartisan. Regrettably, part of the history \nwe made this week is that, for the first time, a truly watershed bill \nbecame law purely along partisan lines.\n  As I mentioned on the floor last November, it is almost impossible to \nimagine how transformational legislation over the last nearly 100 \nyears, such as Social Security, Medicare, and civil rights could have \nbeen as strongly woven into the fabric of our Nation had they forsaken \nbipartisanship.\n  We could have extended that bipartisan legacy. The majority had 60 \nvotes for health care reform, so they had a choice. They could have \nworked collaboratively to develop a more balanced, effective, and \ncredible approach that--even if it ultimately failed to attract many \nRepublican votes--could have resulted in legislation more widely \nembraced by the American people because, in the final analysis, no one \nparty or person has a monopoly on good ideas.\n\n  That is precisely the reality that originally brought six of us \ntogether in the Senate Finance Committee in the so-called Gang of 6, to \nthe credit of Chairman Baucus, who convened a meeting last summer, \nalong with Ranking Member Grassley, and that the chairman and ranking \nmember referenced earlier in the debate on the floor. I commend them \nfor what was the only bipartisan effort in any committee of the House \nand Senate. Certainly, that has been true and indicative of their \ncollaborative, cooperative relationship. As the chairman pointed out, \nwe met 31 times, week after week, for over 4 months, to debate policy \nand not politics because we were attempting to reach bipartisan \nconsensus on reform legislation.\n  While we ultimately did not reach an agreement, given our discussions \nwere ended prematurely by an artificially imposed deadline, our efforts \ndid, in many ways, form the foundation for the subsequent Finance \nCommittee legislation that, while far from perfect, produced bipartisan \nreforms, including banning the egregious practices by the insurance \ncompanies that have been discussed so often. We tried to navigate the \nideologies on both ends of the political spectrum.\n  At the same time, as I stated at the conclusion of the Finance \nCommittee markup, the issue of affordability remained one of my \nparamount concerns. I further expressed that we could not create vast, \nnew bureaucracies and governmental intrusions. Finally, I said my vote \nto report the bill out of the committee was to continue to work to \nimprove the legislation and, therefore, it would be imperative moving \nforward that the majority in the Senate give deference to the scope and \nthe complexity of this issue, earn broader support, and resist the \nimpulse to retreat into partisanship.\n  Yet regrettably, since the Finance Committee vote on October 13, the \nwheels essentially came off. The process went behind closed doors, with \nonly one party represented. Long gone was the transparency of the \nFinance Committee debate, and what came to the Senate floor was a \n2,400-page bill--900 pages longer than the Finance Committee bill--that \nwe were forced to complete by Christmas Day, after a mere 21 days on \nthe floor. In looking at a relative equivalence in terms of benchmark \nlegislation, the Senate debated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for 57 \ndays. In the FAA bill that we just considered--that we just voted on \nthis past Monday--we disposed of 45 amendments. That is 17 more than we \naddressed in the amendment process on health care reform legislation in \nDecember. What exactly were people afraid of?\n  Think what we could have been celebrating today if we would have had \nthe open amendment process we had been promised or even if we had had, \nas I urged, that bipartisan summit last October instead of just last \nmonth. If it was a good idea now, it would have been a good idea then. \nImagine if everyone had the opportunity to sit down with the actual \nlegislative language and work through all the issues, determining what \nworks and what doesn't work. We could have crafted a better product. \nBut now we will never know. We could have, instead, developed something \npractical, rolled out in phases--something all the more critical, given \nwe are already in treacherous economic and fiscal waters.\n  It is not as though we lacked the time. After all, the major \nprovisions of this initiative do not even take effect until 2014. In \nfact, CBO has said that with the majority of the reform measures not \nscheduled to commence until then--4 years from now, by year 2013--there \nwill still be 50 million uninsured Americans, exactly the same number \nas today.\n  There are those who will argue that the Senate-passed legislation was \nbasically the same bill that emerged from the Finance Committee. But \nthe facts tell a story of a different bill that, far from improving \nupon the finance measure, as I had indicated would be critical, instead \nwent precisely in the opposite direction from what Americans wanted--\nwith greater bureaucracy, more taxes, and ill-conceived measures that \nwill cost our Nation jobs rather than help to create them.\n  Look at this chart, with respect to the employer mandate, to cite \nsome examples. Something of critical importance to me, as ranking \nmember of the Senate Small Business Committee, the Finance Committee \nproposal contained no employer mandate per se, forcing firms to offer \nhealth insurance. Rather, it specified that if a firm chose not to \noffer insurance and any of its workers received subsidized coverage in \nthe exchange, the firm would pay a penalty equal to the lesser of an \naverage credit amount that the employee received in the exchange or a \nflat $400 fee for all its workers.\n  While I would have preferred a zero penalty, the Senate-passed bill \nactually got worse, as you can see with this chart. First, penalties \nnearly doubled from those in the Finance Committee package to $750 per \nemployee. Then it greatly expanded the instances in which penalties \nwould be applied, requiring employers with more than 50 full-time \nemployees who don't at least offer coverage and have even one full-time \nemployee receiving a subsidy through the exchange to pay $750 for each \nof its full-time workers.\n  Under the reconciliation package that is pending before the Senate, \nfirms with more than 50 workers would have to pay $2,000 per employee \nwith just the first 30 employees exempted. That is a 167-percent \nincrease over the $750 in the bill that was just signed into law. So we \nhave gone from $400 to $750 and now to $2,000.\n  If that is not enough, part-time workers and seasonal workers will \nnow be counted in determining whether the mandate will apply. That will \nbe devastating. It will be devastating to\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nsmall firms, middle-sized firms, restaurants, retailers, and seasonal \nindustries, such as those in my State of Maine, that will be subject to \nthis mandate, which now produces $52 billion in revenue, up from the \n$27 billion in the bill that just became law.\n  Exactly how is this going to help our Nation's greatest job \ngenerators--our small businesses--that we are depending on to lead us \nout of this downturn?\n  Now let's look at the Medicare taxes, the second chart. The finance \nbill did not contain any form of Medicare taxes. We did not increase \nMedicare taxes. The Senate bill that just now became law, signed by the \nPresident yesterday, included $87 billion in Medicare taxes. That \ndisproportionately affects small businesses because they apply to the \nincome those businesses would normally reinvest.\n  Plain and simple, this .9 percentage point increase in Medicare \npayroll taxes is a job killer as it essentially takes away 1 additional \npercentage point of capital from the very small business owners we are \ndepending on to create jobs, who are more than likely to employ between \n20 and 250 employees, all at a moment when we should be looking for \nways to help bring capital into small businesses.\n  If that were not bad enough, here we have reconciliation that is \npending before the Senate that compounds the mistake with a 3.8-percent \nMedicare tax that is unprecedented because it is imposing a payroll tax \non investment income. When combined with a capital gains tax increase \nthe majority is planning for the end of this year, this 3.8 percent tax \nwill raise the capital gains tax rate to an astonishing 23.8 percent, \nwhich is a 67-percent increase in taxes on investment during these \nprecarious times.\n  Taken together, it is a grand total of $210 billion in Medicare \ntaxes. So we went from the Finance Committee at zero to the Senate-\npassed bill that became law yesterday at $87 billion, and now in the \nbill pending before the Senate, we have a grand total of $210 billion \nin Medicare taxes.\n  It is a hidden tax, by the way. It is not indexed for inflation, so \nit will be similar to the alternative minimum tax that is going to \ncontinue to ensnare more and more people in this tax. It is a major tax \nincrease on individuals, small businesses, on capital, at a time when \nwe desperately need that capital to be reinvested to create more jobs.\n  Again, we have gone from zero to $210 billion in new taxes in \nMedicare. Do we seriously believe this is the time we should be \ninstituting these breathtaking and job-killing increases, not to \nmention the unprecedented shift because not one dollar gets reinvested \nin Medicare--not one dollar--not to mention it does not address the \nphysician problem with a 21-percent reduction in provider reimbursement \nthat we have to extend this week for another month because it is a \nmonth-to-month problem. We need a 10-year fix. That will be over $200 \nbillion but, rather, we are taxing it for other purposes rather than \ninto Medicare. But unfortunately, that's what becomes of a broken \nprocess.\n  Look at what two of the largest organizations representing small \nbusiness in America stated upon passage of the finance bill. The \nNational Federation of Independent Business said at the time the \nfinance bill passed on October 13:\n\n       NFIB appreciates the many provisions in this package that \n     reflect small businesses' needs, which are rooted in \n     approaches that aim to lower costs, increasing coverage \n     options, and provide real competition in the private \n     marketplace.\n\n  Fast forward to the Senate-passed bill in December that now became \nlaw as a result of the President signing it yesterday. Now what does \nNFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business, have to say?\n\n       The impact from these new taxes, a rich benefit package \n     that is more costly than what they can afford today . . . \n     [and] a hard employer mandate--\n\n  The one I referred to earlier--\n\n     equals disaster for small businesses.\n\n  On March 21, they said:\n\n       We couldn't have been clearer how damaging this bill will \n     be to America's small businesses and the economic recovery of \n     this country.\n\n  Particularly in these precarious economic times, shouldn't that make \nus all deeply concerned?\n  Now consider what the National Small Business Association released \nthis weekend. I have that on a chart as well.\n\n       We have continued to work positively for needed changes . . \n     . but it is now clear that most of these recommendations have \n     not been accepted. . . .We understand that it is impossible \n     to create a significant reform such as this one without some \n     objections from nearly every constituency. But our objections \n     to this bill go beyond those reasonable expectations. \n     Congress can do better.\n\n  To which I add, I could not agree more. They say they oppose the \nhealth care reform bill with regret but they base it on all the \nsignificant issues that have been incorporated in this legislation that \nwill be damaging to small businesses. I could not agree more.\n  Furthermore, I am deeply troubled by the manner in which the Medicare \ntax increases in this bill are to be utilized--$210 billion. According \nto CBO, and this is their exact words:\n\n       To describe the full amount of the [Medicare] trust fund \n     savings as both improving the government's ability to pay \n     future Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside \n     of Medicare would essentially double count a large share of \n     those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  So, No. 1, talking about the fact of the reduction of deficit, it is \nnot going to improve that; and No. 2, whether or not it can be plowed \nback into Medicare, obviously it is not going to affect Medicare's \ninsolvency issue because it is going to go to other purposes and is not \nintended for the Medicare trust fund. How are we going to strengthen \nMedicare when these new tax dollars are being diverted from their \noriginal intended purpose of actually paying for Medicare benefits?\n  Another major difference in the legislation we passed in the Senate \nFinance Committee on October 13 and in the pending reconciliation bill, \nis the so-called CLASS Act. While proponents point to estimates that \nthis provision would raise $72 billion over the first 10 years, that \nsavings only occurs as a result of a fiscal shell game of using funds \npromised to pay beneficiaries later to lower the deficit today. As CBO \nsays, ``The program would pay out far less in benefits than it would \nreceive in premiums over the 10-year budget window,'' raising $70 \nbillion in premiums that will fund benefits outside the window, and as \na result, CBO further concluded that ``in the decade following 2029, \nthe CLASS program will begin to increase the deficit.'' Again, this is \nexactly the wrong direction for America.\n\n  Perhaps most disturbingly, we don't even have answers from CBO to \nmany of the most fundamental questions in the minds of Americans, the \nminds of small businesses--what will be the true impact? Those were \nquestions I posed to CBO on December 3 to which I still don't have the \nanswers. What provisions in the legislation would justify and \nfacilitate premium increases, and to what extent would other provisions \nlimit their outcome? What would go up and what would go down? We need \nto know what is going to drive up premium costs and what is going to \nlower premium costs. Indeed, the headline on Tuesday in my home State \nnewspaper the Portland Press Herald was ``Mainers Wait and Wonder: How \nWill Reform Affect Us?''\n  That is why I also requested from CBO specific state-by-state \nanalysis of reform's effects on premiums, because while we do have from \nCBO a national average for premiums, what they would be for minimum \ncredible coverage under the new law, the reality is that cost will vary \nwidely from State to State. That is why I proposed and I asked CBO what \nthe impact would be of opening up the legislation to extend the ``young \ninvincibles'' plan, that catastrophic coverage for young people, to all \nAmericans and extend those subsidies to that coverage as well so \neveryone at least has one affordable option to purchase health \ninsurance. Why? Because the Federal Government is requiring for the \nfirst time that individuals purchase health insurance--that is, first, \nindividual mandates; second, it sets new standards in the plan and the \nexchanges that could drive up premium costs for certain individuals and \nsmall businesses. So shouldn't we have the certainty that affordable \nchoices are available? Yet we do not even have substantiation whether \nprovisions of this reform will make health care costs higher or lower. \nIn fact,\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\nthere is actually a presumption in the legislation that costs may well \ngo up.\n  I find it telling that the excise tax on high-cost insurance in this \nreconciliation contains a fail-safe provision, referred to as a health \ncost adjustment percentage, that automatically raises the threshold to \nhigher numbers. That was described in the House Democratic summary of \nreconciliation. They put it this way:\n\n       CBO is wrong in its forecast of the premium inflation rate \n     between now and 2018.\n\n  Maine is a high-cost State, regrettably, because it is not a \ncompetitive market. We have high-cost plans, along with 16 other \nStates. But given that the bill already provides for thresholds as high \nas $13,900 for individuals and $36,450 excluding vision and dental \nbenefits before triggering the excise tax, those thresholds are \nsignificantly higher than those that were passed in the Senate-passed \nbill yesterday. Now they will be raised even higher under the pending \nreconciliation.\n  The question is, Why exactly would we still require a medical \ninflation adjusted for 2018, 8 years from now, that raises those \nthresholds even higher? What does that say about the performance \nconfidence in reining in medical costs as a result of this legislation \nthat was signed into law and the pending reconciliation? It says they \nsimply do not know. The fail-safe automatic increase in the threshold \nclearly assumes this legislation still may not address runaway costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, these are the thresholds. Eight years \nfrom now--the legislation suggests that because of inflation for \nmedical costs that outpaces inflation two to three times, they are \nsaying that 8 years from now, we will not have controlled medical costs \neven with the passage of this legislation having taken effect as a \nresult of yesterday. It is precisely because of this uncertainty that I \nwill be offering amendments to address these very issues.\n  Somehow, the high worth of legislating, of deliberating, of ironing \nout our differences has been cast aside in favor of either/or \npropositions when we could have instead risen to the monumental \nchallenge with the best possible solution to strengthen America's \nhealth care today and for generations to come. I profoundly regret that \nthis process has provided far too few opportunities to forge \nlegislation that would stand not just the test of our time but for all \ntime. We could have done better and we should have done better.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the NSBA statement of March 19, 2010; the NFIB statement of \nNovember 19, 2009; and the Portland Press Herald article of March 23, \n2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the National Small Business Association, Mar. 19, 2010]\n\n           NSBA Opposes Health Care Reform Bill, With Regret\n\n       Despite the extraordinary need of small businesses for \n     health care reform, the National Small Business Association \n     cannot support the reform bill currently pending before \n     Congress. This bill will place significant new pressures on \n     small businesses to both offer and pay for employee health \n     insurance, starting in the earliest stages of reform. \n     However, the provider-level reforms that could contain costs \n     and enable small businesses to afford this commitment will \n     not be fully effective for many years--if at all. We \n     justifiably expect that small companies caught between these \n     twin pressures will see their ability to grow, prosper, and \n     create jobs greatly diminished.\n       As long-time advocates of fundamental reform of the health \n     care system, we had high hopes for a reform measure that \n     could be more broadly embraced and that we could support. \n     Indeed, the current bill has many positive features that NSBA \n     supports: repair of the dysfunctional individual and small \n     group insurance markets; focus on individual needs and \n     responsibilities, rather than all-encompassing employer \n     mandates; and a start on transforming the delivery system \n     incentives that have driven health care costs to \n     unsustainable levels.\n       The shortcomings, though, also are significant.\n       Small business health premiums will continue to increase \n     sharply, as even the Congressional Budget Office has \n     determined.\n       The legislation does nothing to encourage cost-conscious \n     consumer behavior, aside from the unnecessarily blunt \n     ``Cadillac tax,'' which will not begin to have an effect \n     until at least 2018, and which is insufficiently transparent \n     and imposes unintended administrative burdens on small \n     businesses.\n       The previously mentioned delivery system reforms are \n     positive, but are too back-loaded, giving powerful vested \n     interests years to water them down or remove them entirely. \n     Even if implemented, they are not likely to have a \n     significant effect on costs for a decade or more. Malpractice \n     reform, absent from the current legislation, would make these \n     reforms much more effective.\n       Though currently excluding most small companies, the large \n     increases in ``free-rider fees'' are troubling. If there was \n     once a distinction between an employer mandate and a free-\n     rider provision, it seems to have been lost.\n       The very large tax increases on both earned and unearned \n     income could have a significant effect on many small business \n     owners and their ability to reinvest in their companies' \n     growth. These increases are in addition to the \n     administration's current budget proposal which calls for \n     significant income tax increases on the same individuals. \n     Together, these taxes will create a steep increase in \n     marginal tax rates on the very entrepreneurs we need to be \n     investing and creating jobs.\n       NSBA has stood apart from many other business groups during \n     deliberations on health care reform, preferring to be a \n     nonpartisan, thoughtful, and member-driven organization. We \n     have continued to work positively for needed changes to the \n     legislation, but it is now clear that most of those \n     recommendations have not been accepted and that the bill is \n     in its final form. We understand that it is impossible to \n     create a significant reform such as this without some \n     objections from nearly every constituency. But our objections \n     to this bill go beyond those reasonable expectations. \n     Congress can do better. A sense of urgency on cost \n     containment is the place to start.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   NFIB Statement: Senate Health Bill\n\n       Washington, DC, Nov. 19, 2009.--Susan Eckerly, senior vice \n     president of the National Federation of Independent Business, \n     the nation's leading small business association, issued the \n     following statement in reaction to the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act:\n       ``Small business can't support a proposal that does not \n     address their No. 1 problem: the unsustainable cost of \n     healthcare. With unemployment at a 26-year high and small \n     business owners struggling to simply keep their doors open, \n     this kind of reform is not what we need to encourage small \n     businesses to thrive.\n       ``We oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     due to the amount of new taxes, the creation of new mandates, \n     and the establishment of new entitlement programs. There is \n     no doubt all these burdens will be paid for on the backs of \n     small business. It's clear to us that, at the end of the day, \n     the costs to small business more than outweigh the benefits \n     they may have realized.\n       ``Small businesses have been clear about their needs in \n     health reform; they have been working for solutions for more \n     than two decades. They have a unique place in this debate \n     because of the exceptional challenges they face. They \n     experience the most volatile premium increases, are the most \n     cost-shifted market, see the most tax increases and have the \n     least competitive marketplace. For all these reasons, they \n     especially need reform, but these reforms can't add to their \n     cost of doing business. The impact from these new taxes, a \n     rich benefit package that is more costly than what they can \n     afford today, a new government entitlement program, and a \n     hard employer mandate equals disaster for small business.\n       ``We are disappointed that, after so many months of \n     discussion, small business could be left with the status quo \n     or something even worse. Unless extreme measures are taken to \n     reverse the course Congress is on, small business will have \n     no choice but to hope for another chance at real reform down \n     the road.\n       ``Congress is running out of opportunities to prove to \n     small business that they are serious about helping our \n     nation's job creators. We are hopeful that a robust \n     bipartisan debate will produce a bill that small businesses \n     see as a solution and not another government burden.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Portland Press Herald, Mar. 23, 2010]\n\n          Mainers Wait and Wonder: How Will Reform Affect Us?\n\n                          (By John Richardson)\n\n       Terri Grover of Portland watched from her home Sunday night \n     as Congress finally passed health-care reform legislation.\n       She didn't realize that her 22-year-old daughter, a senior \n     at Bates College, was glued to the television, too.\n       ``My daughter called from college last night at 10:45 and \n     said, `They passed it, they passed it! Does that mean I'm \n     going to get insurance?' '' Grover said.\n       Grover is pretty sure the answer to that question is \n     ``yes.''\n       The legislation, which still needs to be signed by \n     President Obama and then amended by the U.S. Senate, says \n     dependents will be eligible to stay on their parents' \n     policies until they turn 26.\n       However, Grover is still nervous about all of the details \n     in the complex reform package, some of which have yet to be \n     finalized.\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\n       Some Mainers, including Grover, said Monday that they're \n     excited about the legislation.\n       Others said they fear that the added costs and regulation \n     will just make matters worse.\n       All agreed, however, that there is much uncertainty and \n     confusion about how it will ultimately affect their health \n     care costs, their jobs and their businesses.\n       ``We all want to know,'' Barbara Thorso of South Portland \n     said Monday afternoon between bingo games at the city's \n     community center.\n       Thorso, 87, is president of the Three Score Plus Club, \n     which hosts the weekly gathering.\n       ``We're the general public. This bill is going to cover \n     us,'' Thorso said. ``I would like to have an understanding of \n     what's in the package. I don't have a clue.''\n       The 10-year, $938 billion bill will eventually extend \n     coverage to 32 million uninsured Americans, prohibit \n     insurance companies from denying coverage to sick people, and \n     create insurance marketplaces, called ``exchanges,'' intended \n     to make coverage more affordable.\n       Other changes will be more immediate, such as subsidies to \n     help senior citizens pay for drugs and the requirement to let \n     dependent children remain on their parents' health insurance \n     plans until age 26.\n       ``It's really too soon to know how all of this is going to \n     unfold. Some of the provisions of the bill don't go into \n     effect until 2014, and some after that,'' said Katherine \n     Pelletreau, director of the Maine Association of Health \n     Plans, an association of health insurance companies.\n       ``In truth, I'm trying to understand it, to dissect it so \n     we can know what the impacts and (employers') \n     responsibilities are, and that's going to take some time,'' \n     said Dana Connors, president of the Maine State Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n       ``The big question is . . . does it reduce costs or does it \n     add costs?''\n       Parker Williams of South Portland believes that the \n     legislation will hurt businesses and cost jobs. ``Where are \n     they going to get the money to pay for it?'' said Williams. \n     ``It will take 10 years before it will start to save money.''\n       Anne LaForgia of South Portland said she has more faith in \n     President Obama.\n       ``Most of the people our age are very concerned,'' said \n     LaForgia, who is 84. ``I'm really hopeful . . . I don't think \n     it will hurt (seniors covered through Medicare). I'm more \n     worried about the younger people.''\n       Toni Fizell and Sharon Haskell, both of South Portland, \n     could be directly affected by the legislation. Fizell, who is \n     59, has no health insurance.\n       Haskell, who is 63, expects that she will be uninsured, \n     too, after her rate goes up in June.\n       Both are more nervous about the bill than optimistic.\n       ``It's scary to listen to (the debate),'' Fizell said. \n     ``Everybody has to have insurance. . . . How are they going \n     to enforce that?''\n       The bill will eventually require people to buy insurance or \n     pay fees, and it includes subsidies to help people who can't \n     afford it.\n       Haskell, who lost her job and her employer insurance last \n     year, said she doesn't expect any help from the legislation \n     before she turns 65 and is eligible for Medicare. ``I'm just \n     going to look for something part time and pray that I stay \n     healthy,'' she said.\n       Grover, who celebrated on the phone with her daughter, is \n     confident that the legislation will be an improvement, \n     despite all the details.\n       ``Young people will be able to search for the right career \n     for them rather than search for any job that will give them \n     health insurance,'' she said. ``I wish the whole thing went \n     into effect faster.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Chair please notify me when I am down to 1.\n  I will also offer an amendment tonight, and the purpose is very \nclear: it is to protect the health care of our Nation's servicemembers, \nveterans, and their widows, orphans, and dependents. The problem is, \nsince the debate on health care reform began, our veterans and their \nfamilies have asked for just one thing: Protect our health care \nbenefit. The President even promised. He said that ``one thing that \nreform will not change is veterans health care. No one is going to take \naway your benefits--that is the plain and simple truth.''\n  Unfortunately, the Patients Protection and Affordable Care Act does \nnot explicitly protect the health care of our Nation's servicemembers, \nveterans, their widows, orphans, or dependents. Let me explain why.\n  Under this health care bill, it requires a minimal essential coverage \nof any health care plan. The requirements for that health care do not \nclearly include TRICARE, which is the Active-Duty family members of our \ntroops; the VA's spina bifida program for children under our Agent \nOrange veterans under chapter 18 of title 38; and CHAMPVA, a program \nrun out of the Veterans Administration for spouses and dependent \nchildren of veterans who died or are profoundly disabled as a result of \nmilitary service; and possibly VA's vocational rehabilitation program. \nAs a result, these beneficiaries could be forced to pay additional \ninsurance or to pay punitive fees because the threshold of coverage \ndoes not meet the threshold defined in this bill.\n  Apparently, the authors were so preoccupied with the sweetheart deals \nand backroom negotiations that they forgot to uphold their promises, \nthey forgot about the policy part of this health care bill.\n  Both the House and Senate have acknowledged the oversight I am here \nto correct. As soon as the issue was identified, the House rushed \nthrough on Saturday to pass a bill to put a technical correction on the \nDepartment of Defense piece. The bill passed with overwhelming \nsupport--403 to 0. The problem is, the only piece that the DOD \ntechnical corrections piece fixes is, in fact, TRICARE.\n  It does not fix spina bifida for the children of Agent Orange \nsurvivors. It does not fix CHAMPVA, which is the program for spouses, \ndependent children of veterans who are profoundly disabled as a result \nof military service.\n  Now, identical legislation was introduced in the Senate, and some \nclaim, well, we just need to pass that. Well, you need to pass that if, \nin fact, you do not want to extend CHAMPVA and spina bifida.\n  I have to commend that Secretaries Shinseki and Gates have tried to \nalleviate the concerns. I certainly appreciate their reassurances. \nHowever, the greatest assurance you can provide is to be unambiguous \nabout the issue. We owe it to our Nation's veterans, to their families, \nto leave uncertainty outside and to spell it out in the legislation \nthat these items meet the threshold. Therefore those families, those \nservicemembers, are not obligated in the future for additional \npenalties and/or fees to participate.\n  It is time we started to listen to the American people, especially \nwhen it relates to our Nation's veterans and their families. My \namendment maintains the integrity of the health care system of VA and \nDOD. It ensures that the authority of the Secretary of the Department \nof Defense and the Secretary of Veterans' Administration would not be \nchallenged or obstructed by any provision in the Patient Protection and \nAffordability Care Act.\n  My amendment will ensure that nothing in the Democrats' health care \nbill should be construed as affecting benefits provided under TRICARE \nor any VA health care program.\n  Finally, my amendment ensures that the minimal essential coverage--\nkey words, ``minimum essential coverage''--under this Democratic health \ncare bill includes TRICARE and all health care provided by the VA.\n  I think it is important to remind my colleagues that over the weekend \nthe veterans service organizations have expressed their deep concern, \nand more than one VSO, Veterans of Foreign Wars, said this:\n\n       Bill language is important, and that's why the VFW remains \n     adamant to expeditiously fixing the new law. All of DOD's \n     programs should have been in the original bill, as well as \n     all of Title 38, not just one part of one chapter. This is \n     not playing politics, this is protecting the hard earned \n     health care coverage our veterans, servicemembers, and their \n     families deserve.\n\n  Some might come to the Senate floor later and say, well, this is not \nthe appropriate place to fix it. The reconciliation bill has been \nbilled as ``the bill to fix everything'' that is wrong in the original \nhealth care bill. That is how it was sold to House Members: Vote for \nthe Senate bill, and we will fix all of those things that you find as \nproblems in the reconciliation bill.\n  We have before us the reconciliation bill, and some will argue that \nfixing it for our Nation's veterans, their spouses, their family \nmembers, that this is not the appropriate place to do it. I agree. We \nshould have gotten it right the first time. We should not have to have \na fix-it bill. But when we do not bring sunlight to it, when we exclude \npeople who are focused on policy, this is what we get. We get a bill \nthat does not fulfill the promise the President made.\n  Let me just state again exactly what they were. The President said:\n\n       One thing that reform won't change is veterans health care.\n\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       No one is going to take away your benefits, that is plain \n     and simple truth.\n\n  Well, if it is plain and simple truth, then this body has no choice \ntonight but to take my amendment, to pass my amendment, to incorporate \nit in the health care fix bill, the reconciliation bill, and to make \nsure that when we finish our business, whether that is tomorrow or the \nnext day, that, in fact, it is very clear in the health care bill who \nis covered. It is not just TRICARE for Life, it is TRICARE; it is spina \nbifida for the children of Agent Orange exposure; it is the CHAMPVA \nprogram, which covers spouses, children, and the severely disabled of \nthose killed in action.\n  My hope is that all of my colleagues will see the wisdom in \nsupporting this bill, that they will not look for another avenue to do \nit in, that they will put it in the fix bill, and they will not leave \nit up to Secretaries to give us the assurance when we have set up so \nmany outside panels to interpret for the American people what their \ncoverage is going to be in the future.\n  I think sometimes we can forget the complicated maze this bill \ncreates, where we will actually have nonproviders determining whether \nyour coverage is sufficient that you constructed or that your employer \nprovided for you or that you went out as an independent and bought, and \nif it does not meet the standard of minimum essential coverage, then \nyou could open----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Chair.\n  Then you could be exposed to a fine because a government bureaucrat \nhas determined that the coverage, the health care coverage you bought, \nthat you were given, is not sufficient enough to meet the minimal \nessential coverage this bill crafted.\n  Well, very simply, there are veterans around the country who know \nthey have been left out--their spouses, their family members, their \nkids with disease. Tonight we can assure them they are included by, in \nthe health care fix bill, actually fixing that one piece and making \nsure that we extend the coverage the President promised and that we owe \nto these veterans and their families.\n  When I introduce that bill, I hope all 100 Senators support it like \nthe House has. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think the half hour has now turned to \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from Michigan for a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan\n\n\n                     Request for Committees to Meet\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I make this request as chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I would note that this unanimous \nconsent request is supported by my ranking member, Senator McCain.\n  We have three commanders scheduled to testify this afternoon. They \nhave been scheduled for a long time. They have come a long distance. \nOne of them has come from Korea; one of them has come from Hawaii. I \nwould therefore ask unanimous consent that the previously scheduled, \ncurrently scheduled hearing of the Committee on Armed Services, be \nallowed to proceed and that we be authorized to meet during the session \nof the Senate on Wednesday, March 24, 2010, at 2:30 in open and closed \nsession to receive testimony from ADM Robert Willard, U.S. Navy, \nCommander U.S. Pacific Command; from GEN Kevin P. Chilton, U.S. Air \nForce, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command; and from GEN Walter \nSharp, U.S. Army, Commander U.S. Forces Korea, in review of the defense \nauthorization request for fiscal year 2011, and the future years \ndefense programs.\n  Senator McCain supports this request. I understand it is not likely \nthere will be any votes on the floor until 5:30 this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. As a member of the committee, and I side myself with the \nchair and the ranking member that I have no personal objection to \ncontinuing. There is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I \nwould have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished senior \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished manager of the bill for his \nwork on this which has been prodigious, long, and, I hope, not too \nexhausting.\n  I want to speak rather personally about health care reform, why I \nsupport the bill that has been signed by the President, why I support \nthe reconciliation bill, and why I will oppose any amendment no matter \nhow good that amendment may appear to be.\n  I am a doctor's daughter, and I am a former doctor's wife. So I have \nlived most of my life in a medical family. I have had very good health \ncare. My father, who was chief of surgery at the University of \nCalifornia Medical Center, never operated on anyone he did not make a \nhouse call on. He was well respected by his students and a great \nsurgeon.\n  My husband who died was a neurosurgeon, and his practice was spent in \nstereotactic surgery with respect to people who had abnormal movements \nand could not control their movements. So I came to believe that we had \nthe best medical system in the United States of America.\n  It was only in the last few years that I began to see how much \nmedicine had changed in America. We walked into a doctor's office, and \nit was not like one secretary in my father's office; it was a bank of \nfiles and pressure and lines waiting to be seen. I realized that there \nwere so many people who did not have good health care, who worried \nabout losing their health care, and, in fact, were losing their health \ncare; that this kind of reform suddenly was open to me.\n  Then I looked at some statistics because I thought, America is \nspending all of this money, spending nearly 15 percent of our GDP on \nhealth care, we must be getting substantial bang for the buck. And here \nis what I found instead.\n  According to the World Health Organization, the top health care \nsystems in the world begin with France, No. 1, Italy, and it goes on. \nThe United States is ranked 37.\n  So let's go on. Infant mortality: I think infant mortality is a good \ncriteria of care because we know with good medical care we save babies. \nI thought surely America is going to be No. 1 in terms of infant \nmortality. No, we are No. 22. It is, in fact, Japan at the top with 3 \ndeaths per 1,000 births.\n  So let's look a little further. Avoidable mortality rate: This is \ndeaths that you can avoid with good medical care. Well, we have great \nmedical institutions. You would expect that we would rank very high. \nAgain, France is No. 1, and the United States is not 2, 3, 4 or 5 but \nNo. 15. And the source of that is the Commonwealth Fund.\n  Well, I then began to think more deeply about it and to realize that \nwe have all of these people in this country growing who are uncovered. \nIn fact, in California, my State, a State of nearly 40 million people, \nin the last 2 years, each year the uninsured have gained 1 million \npeople. So over the past 2 years, California has lost insurance for 2 \nmillion people, bringing the total of people up to 8 million who have \nno insurance whatsoever.\n  Then you see companies, when the people get sick with HIV, with full-\nblown AIDS, will just simply cancel their policies and throw them out. \nThen you learn that there is such a thing as a preexisting condition. \nWe all come with certain preexisting conditions, or probably at one \ntime in our life we will have one.\n  We find there are companies that will not grant insurance if you have \na preexisting condition. In my 17 years in the Senate, 18 years in the \nSenate, we have had numerous people write and say: I have been denied \nthis treatment, or, I have been denied that treatment. Would you please \ntry and help me? And we do. Sometimes we win, and we get a procedure \nfor them that they had been denied by their insurance company. So it is \nso important to know what this bill will do; that it will essentially \ncover 32 million or 95 percent of the people of this country with some \nform of insurance.\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n  When the exchanges are functioning, they will have real choice if \nthey wish it. Their insurance will not be taken away from them. Right \naway, this year, yesterday, those of us who were at the White House \nheard the President say that immediate gains will take place. For \nexample, $5 billion for a high-risk pool, helping to provide coverage \nfor those who are uninsured because they have been denied coverage by \none of the big medical insurance companies.\n  Also, children with preexisting conditions can no longer be \ndiscriminated against. So the family with the juvenile diabetic who \ncannot get insurance because the child is a juvenile diabetic will be \nable to get that insurance.\n  That is important. We have learned that the notorious doughnut hole \nwhich takes place when you spend a certain amount on your \npharmaceuticals--there is a hole in the middle at which point there is \nno help, and each person in that situation would receive $250 to help \nthem through that time.\n  A child can remain on a parent's policy until the age of 26. These \nare some of the things that happen right away.\n  Now, I know people do not like this plan, some of them. But the \nquestion comes: Do we keep doing what we are doing, spending more and \nmore of our gross domestic product and not improving our overall \nperformance, not improving our infant mortality, not improving our \nlongevity, the way good practical medicine should?\n  I wish to talk about one thing that isn't in any bill about which I \nam very worried. A while ago, I introduced legislation for a medical \ninsurance rate authority. We have about nine very large for-profit \nmedical insurance companies in the United States. As a product of an \nearlier action, they are the only industry, other than major league \nbaseball, that has an antitrust exemption. What they have been doing is \nmerging and acquiring companies so that they can control markets. In \nLos Angeles, for example, today two of these companies control 51 \npercent of all of the premiums. Once you have this market share and \ncontrol, you can raise premiums with abandon. Earlier this year, a \ncompany, a subsidiary of WellPoint, sent out notices to 800,000 \nCalifornians and said: We are raising your premiums. Premiums went up \n39 percent for those not in a group policy but who held individual \npolicies. Can you imagine getting a notice that your insurance has gone \nup 40 percent? To add insult to injury, they then said: We may come \nback in the middle of the year and ask for another.\n  That company came in. I asked the CEO what her salary was. Nine \nmillion a year. And you realize that these companies also have a \nsubstantial percentage that they spend on rent of your premium dollar, \non the salaries of their executives in the millions of your premium \ndollar, on transportation, on conventions. Generally this can go to 20 \nto 30 percent of the premium dollar. We begin to bring it down to 15 \npercent of the premium dollar.\n  What is missing and what the President put in the reconciliation bill \nwas my legislation to give the Secretary of Health the ability to see \nthat medical insurance premiums are reasonable and would establish a \nrate authority of people who have expertise in the arena that she could \nconsult with in levying this authority. That is not in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. These rate increases go into place May 1. So it is \nvital that we take some action before May 1, or all throughout the \nUnited States there are going to be substantial premium increases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Webb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, being an eternal optimist, I rise to \nexpress my hope that once the process of voting over the next 2 days is \ncompleted, we can find a way to move forward with our colleagues across \nthe aisle to fix other provisions in this legislation and make it truly \nthe kind of bill they say they wish to see as well. I will support this \nreconciliation bill. At the same time, as my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle know well, I worked very hard to narrow and improve this \nlegislation as it was passed last December, including voting, as I \nrecall, eight different times with my Republican colleagues, which \ndidn't make my chairman very happy, on a few occasions to make changes \nin the bill. In the end I voted in favor of this legislation despite \nserious misgivings with portions of it, because it does represent a \ntrue step forward in terms of quality, accessibility, and affordability \nof health care for most Americans.\n  The important point for us to remember today and tomorrow, as we go \nthrough the process, is that the bill is now law. The question before \nus now is how best to implement that law so that the benefits can be \nput into place and the many detriments I was worried about can be \naddressed. There are a number of strong points in this bill. Many of my \ncolleagues have laid them out. As we know, insurance companies will be \nprohibited from denying health care coverage to children with \npreexisting conditions. Young adults will be able to stay on their \nparents' insurance plans until they are 26. Uninsured Americans with \npreexisting conditions will have access to affordable insurance \noptions. Insurance companies won't be able to drop people from coverage \nwhen they get sick, and they will be banned from implementing lifetime \ncaps on coverage. Seniors who hit the Medicare Part D doughnut hole gap \nin coverage will get a $250 check to help with the cost of \nprescriptions and the doughnut hole will be completely closed by 2020.\n  Access to insurance over the next couple years will be expanded to 95 \npercent of Americans. It will implement reforms designed to slow \nskyrocketing health care costs. Working families will not have to worry \nabout losing health insurance or facing bankruptcy because of a job \nloss or because of illness. Insurance companies will be required to \nspend the majority of their money on patient care.\n  The law will also provide tax credits to help make health insurance \navailable for individuals, expand access to Medicaid, create a \nregulated marketplace where people can shop for the health insurance \nplan that best meets their needs, and will prohibit insurance companies \nfrom refusing to sell or renew policies due to an individual's health \nstatus. These are just some of the positive points of the law.\n  In fairness--and I understand and appreciate some of the frustration \non the other side--there are serious problems in this bill. I don't \nlike the dramatic cuts in Medicare this law proposes. In fact, I voted \nagainst them. I share the concerns by my Democratic colleague, \nCongressman Rick Boucher of southwest Virginia, regarding the potential \nnegative impact these cuts could have on rural areas, particularly the \npopulation of southwest Virginia. This legislation proposes to cut \napproximately $450 billion from Medicare spending over the next 10 \nyears at a time when Medicare is already mired in debt and, as we know, \na bow wave of baby boomers is going to start hitting the Medicare \nsystem immediately. Medicare Advantage, which provides better benefits \nthan traditional Medicare, is a valuable tool in rural and underserved \nareas, and that may decrease. This law does little to address the \nhistoric disparity in Medicare funding between urban and rural areas.\n  I am also concerned about the cost and spending projections of this \nlegislation. There is a great deal of debate going on right now about \nthe real cost of this bill. Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin \nestimated, in an article in the New York Times recently, that the bill \nmay increase the Federal deficit by $562 billion over 10 years because \nof some of these areas I discussed. The official score maintains that \nthe bill would lower the deficit by $143 billion over that same period, \nbut it includes a number of unlikely assumptions, Medicare being one of \nthem. The system for reimbursing Medicare doctors, called the \nsustainable growth rate, is widely agreed to be broken, but we have not \ntried to fix it. That is a $250 billion ticket. Many, including myself, \nbelieve the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, the \nCLASS Act, is structurally unsound. I voted against that as we were \nconsidering the bill.\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\n  In addition, as my colleague Congressman Glenn Nye from the Norfolk-\nVirginia Beach area pointed out, there is a great deal of concern among \nfamilies and small businesses regarding the impact of this bill.\n  Again, the point is, the bill is now law. The question is how to make \nthe law a better law. The process that got us here has been ugly. It \nhas diminished the trust and respect some citizens hold for our own \ngovernment. We need to restore that trust through a genuine and \ntransparent effort on both sides of the aisle to fix the problems in \nthe law. We also need to start working together again across the aisle, \non this and other issues that confront us, in a bipartisan sense and a \nsense of shared responsibility about the many problems facing the \ncountry. We are now preparing to begin a series of votes through the \nreconciliation process that ultimately, quite frankly, is going to mean \nlittle or nothing in terms of the outcome of this legislation. They are \nnot going to seriously address the problems in it. I understand the \nconcerns on the other side. I respect them. These votes in many cases \nare politically necessary for the other side. But I call on my \nRepublican friends to begin to work with some of us over here on this \nside to address the inequities that we are concerned about, to \nimplement cost controls, to work together for the good of the country \nonce this next couple of days is done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I gather I have at least 7 minutes \nassigned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remains.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask that the Chair inform me if I am not finished \nwhen there is 1 minute remaining on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so inform.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, a good friend once wisely said to me \nthat it is only a very short road that has no turns. The road that \nhealth care reform has traveled to get to the Senate has been very long \nand has had many turns. Its path to us might well be described as \ntortuous, with all that word has come to mean. As I said when I \nexplained in December why I was voting for the Senate health care \nreform bill, any piece of legislation this big, this complicated, and \nthis transformational is unlikely to be perfectly pleasing to anyone. \nThat is true for me. In the end, each of us has to ask ourselves, do \nthe positives in this legislation outweigh the negatives? Does what \npleases us in it outweigh what worries us? Let me begin with the \nmeasure before us now.\n  The reconciliation act that is before us preserves most but not all \nof the health care reform the Senate adopted and I voted for in \nDecember. I concluded then and repeat now that together these measures \nachieve real change in the three big areas in which our health care \nsystem needs to be changed: reforming health care delivery to put a \nbrake on the skyrocketing costs of care for individuals, families, \nbusinesses, and our government; better regulating health insurance \ncompanies to protect consumers, including those with preexisting \nconditions; and helping millions of middle-income Americans who cannot \nafford health insurance now to buy it.\n  For me it is particularly noteworthy that the Senate bill, plus the \nreconciliation act, achieves all that progress without a government \ntakeover of health care or health insurance. That would have been a \nvery costly deficit-exploding mistake and would have fundamentally and \nadversely altered the traditional American balance of power between the \npublic and private sectors that has worked so well over our history to \ncreate economic growth and opportunity and to build the American middle \nclass. That is why I opposed the so-called public option so strenuously \nand why I am so grateful it is not in the reconciliation act the House \nhas sent us. Those are the big and good things I appreciate in this \nhealth care reform package.\n  What worries me about it? First, the size of this proposal concerns \nme, particularly at this time of national fiscal indebtedness and \neconomic stress. I wish we had chosen to achieve health care reform \nstep by step, beginning with delivery reforms that would lower health \ncosts and then moving on to expand middle-class access to affordable \nhealth insurance and then more aggressively regulating health insurance \ncompanies. But there was never enough bipartisan support for such step-\nby-step reform. I know because I tried to find it. So now, along with \neach of my colleagues, I must vote on the proposal before us, not on \none I wish we had before us.\n\n  My biggest concerns about this proposal are its prospective fiscal \nconsequences. I worry that the savings this bill achieves in Medicare \nand the revenue it raises from new Medicare taxes to help pay for \nhealth care reform will soon be urgently needed to save Medicare itself \nfrom running out of money it needs to pay the bills for seniors' health \ncare. Most of all, I worry that the bottom line consequences of this \nhealth care reform will be to increase our already ominous national \ndebt.\n  I am, of course, greatly encouraged by the conclusion of the \nindependent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that this health \ncare reform legislation will not only not increase the debt but \nactually decrease it by more than a trillion dollars over the next two \ndecades, and that its savings in Medicare will not only pay for part of \nhealth care reform but actually extend the solvency of the Medicare \nHospital Trust Fund.\n  According to the Chief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, the solvency of the trust fund will be extended by \n10 years as a result of the Senate health care reform bill that is now \nlaw.\n  However, for those good and significant things to happen, future \nCongresses will have to be very disciplined and keep the promises that \nare made in this legislation to reform health care delivery to cut \ncosts. Most of those reforms will over time be opposed by providers and \nbeneficiaries. The record of Congress in resisting such pressure to \nstick with the costly status quo is not encouraging.\n  So in the end, I have weighed the pluses and minuses, and I have \ndecided to vote for this health care reform package, choosing its real \nchange over the broken status quo, raising my hopes above my fears, and \nadding, if I may, a personal prayer that future Congresses and \nPresidents do not weaken the reforms in this bill that will stop the \nconstant increases in health care and health insurance costs and help \nreduce our national debt.\n  That will happen best if we can achieve the bipartisanship in \noverseeing the implementation of this historic health care reform \nlegislation that we, unfortunately, were not able to achieve in its \npassage.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nextraordinary effort that produced this admirable result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his very thoughtful endorsement of this legislation. He \nis one of the more thoughtful Members of this Chamber, and I want to \nvery much compliment him on his process and his conclusion.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I do not think I have much time \nremaining--3 minutes. Thank you very much.\n  The Senator from Maine raised the issue of Medicare solvency. I want \nto remind my colleagues that health care reform extends the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund. Whether it is 9 years or 10 years, I am not \nsure exactly, but the Medicare trust fund is extended for at least that \nperiod of time, which I am sure gives great comfort to seniors and near \nseniors. Health care reform is exactly what the doctor ordered for \nMedicare's long-term health.\n  The Senator also mentioned a letter from an outside group raising \nconcerns with health care reform. Let me add for the record three of \nthe many letters of endorsement that health care reform has received. \nThe first is from the American Medical Association. I will read one \nsentence:\n\n       After careful review and consideration, the Board of \n     Trustees of the American Medical Association supports passage \n     of the health\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n     system reform legislation under consideration . . . as a step \n     forward in the journey to provide health care for all \n     Americans.\n\n  In addition, I have a letter from the Federation of American \nHospitals:\n\n       On behalf of the Federation of American Hospitals and our \n     more than 1,000 hospitals throughout the United States, I \n     express our strong support for health reform and the \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010. This legislation is long overdue, \n     and we urge all Senators to seize this historic opportunity. \n     . . .\n\n  It is signed by Charles Kahn of the Federation of American Hospitals.\n  I also have a statement here from the AARP, the association of \nretired folks. Basically it states:\n\n       After a thorough analysis of the reform package, we believe \n     this legislation brings us so much closer to helping millions \n     of older Americans get quality, affordable health care.\n\n  Again, that is from the AARP.\n  So there are many letters of endorsement, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat these three letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 19, 2010.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi: After careful review and \n     consideration, the Board of Trustees of the American Medical \n     Association (AMA) supports passage of the health system \n     reform legislation under consideration in the House as a step \n     forward in the journey to provide health care coverage for \n     all Americans.\n       When H.R. 3590 was being considered in the Senate, the AMA \n     supported its passage while expressing opposition to certain \n     provisions that we believed could be resolved in the \n     conference committee process. Working with the \n     Administration, congressional leaders and their very \n     dedicated staff, significant progress was made toward \n     resolving many of our most serious concerns. Unfortunately, \n     there are issues in H.R. 3590 that cannot be addressed \n     through the current reconciliation process and so will still \n     need to be addressed by Congress and the Administration.\n       This forced us to weigh very carefully whether the \n     legislation, on balance, will enhance patient care and the \n     fundamental patient-physician relationship. By extending \n     coverage to the vast majority of the uninsured, improving \n     competition and choice in the insurance marketplace, \n     promoting prevention and wellness, reducing administrative \n     burdens, and promoting clinical comparative effectiveness \n     research, we believe that H.R. 3590 does, in fact, improve \n     the ability of patients and their physicians to achieve \n     better health outcomes.\n       The pending bill is an imperfect product. Congress needs to \n     act very soon to preserve access to care for seniors and \n     military families by permanently repealing the Medicare \n     sustainable growth rate formula that will trigger physician \n     payment cuts of over 21 percent next month. House and Senate \n     leaders must also move immediately to correct problems with \n     the proposed Independent Payment Advisory Board. Other \n     provisions that must be promptly addressed in a subsequent \n     corrections bill include the cost-quality value index and \n     safeguards for data release and public reporting activities. \n     The health care system will be further improved by reining in \n     unnecessary costs through enactment of effective medical \n     liability reforms.\n       The AMA will be relentless in our pursuit of these \n     important policy adjustments.\n       Passage of H.R. 3590 marks an important step toward \n     improving the health of the American people, but our work \n     here is far from done. Additional congressional action is \n     needed to address outstanding issues. We look forward to \n     working with you on the next steps to strengthen our health \n     care system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  J.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: On behalf of the Federation of \n     American Hospitals (FAH) and our more than 1,000 hospitals \n     throughout the United States, I express our strong support \n     for health reform and the Reconciliation Act of 2010. This \n     legislation is long overdue, and we urge all Senators to \n     seize this historic opportunity by supporting the \n     reconciliation package as it was reported out of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       The hundreds of thousands of Americans who treat patients \n     in our hospitals understand the plight of the uninsured and \n     the need to provide health security for all Americans. The \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010, together with the recently \n     enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, advance \n     this shared goal by expanding health care coverage to 32 \n     million Americans.\n       Equally vital, they provide a framework for health care \n     delivery reform that will improve health care for Americans, \n     and, by extension, strengthen our economy and global \n     competitiveness by reducing costs and increasing efficiency.\n       That is why hospitals will forgo $155 billion in Medicare \n     and Medicaid payments over 10 years as part of a shared \n     sacrifice to bring about the benefits that health reform will \n     deliver to all Americans.\n       It is no exaggeration to say this is the last opportunity \n     in our generation to bring about durable reform that will \n     make a real difference in the lives of all of us. The time \n     for action has come, and the FAH urges all Senators to \n     support the budget reconciliation package without amendment.\n       Thank you for your strong and unwavering leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles N. Kahn III,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              (From the AARP Press Center, Mar. 19, 2010)\n\n       AARP Statement on Historic Health Insurance Reform Package\n\n       Washington.--Today, AARP Board Chair Bonnie M. Cramer, \n     M.S.W., announced the Association's support for health \n     insurance reform legislation containing key reform provisions \n     that will improve health care for older Americans and their \n     families. For more than two years, AARP has fought for health \n     insurance reform that helps Americans 50-plus get the care \n     and medications they need at a price they can afford. \n     Cramer's statement follows:\n       ``After a thorough analysis of the reform package, we \n     believe this legislation brings us so much closer to helping \n     millions of older Americans get quality, affordable health \n     care. For too long, our members and others have faced \n     spiraling prescription drug costs, discriminatory practices \n     by insurance companies and a Medicare system awash in fraud, \n     waste and abuse.\n       ``The legislative package cracks down on insurance company \n     abuses and protects and strengthens guaranteed benefits in \n     Medicare, the program millions of our members depend on and \n     in which millions more will soon enroll. It closes the \n     dreaded Medicare Part D `doughnut hole,' a gap in \n     prescription drug coverage that is life threatening for many. \n     The package stops insurance companies from pricing people out \n     of coverage because they have an existing health problem or \n     arbitrarily limiting the amount of care someone can receive. \n     It also limits insurance companies' ability to charge higher \n     premiums based solely on age. And it improves efforts to \n     crack down on fraud and waste in Medicare, strengthening the \n     program for today's seniors and future generations.\n       ``For every American who has struggled without access to \n     health insurance--and for all those at risk of losing their \n     current coverage with the next job loss, illness or premium \n     hike--this package presents the best hope to offer health \n     security for them and their families. We understand that \n     significant work remains even after this package becomes law, \n     but we cannot lose the opportunity looking for a `next time' \n     that is doomed to be `too late.'\n       ``We urge Congress to seize this opportunity to improve \n     health care so older Americans and their families get the \n     care they need.''\n       Also today, AARP CEO A. Barry Rand sent a letter to every \n     member of the House of Representatives, urging them to put \n     the health of Americans age 50-plus first and vote ``yes'' on \n     the legislative package.\n       AARP members can see how their representatives voted on the \n     health insurance reform package by going to www.aarp.org/\n governmentwatch. AARP's Government Watch is a one-stop online \n     portal that will be tracking and publicizing every designated \n     key vote on issues facing Americans age 50-plus.

Madam President, I now ask for 1 hour of debate evenly \ndivided, a half hour on the Republican side and a half hour on the \nmajority side. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed in that respect.\n  I note that the next half hour will be under the control of the \nRepublicans and, as I said earlier, the next half hour is to be \ncontrolled by the majority. I note that thereafter the Republicans will \nbe due an amount of time greater than half an hour, and I propose that \nwe balance that out in the next consent.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the bill by waiving the $40,000 penalty on hiring \n                   previously unemployed individuals)\n\n       At the end of section 1003, add the following:\n       (e) Unemployed Individual Not Taken Into Account.--\n     Paragraph (5) of section 4980H(d) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986, as added by the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Exception for previously unemployed individuals.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `full-time employee' shall not \n     include any individual who certifies by signed affidavit, \n     under penalties of perjury, that such individual has not been \n     employed from more than 40 hours during the 60-day period \n     ending on the date such individual begins such employment.\n       ``(ii) Exception for replacement workers.--Clause (i) shall \n     not apply to an individual who is employed by the employer to \n     replace another employee of such employer unless such other \n     employee separated from employment voluntarily or for \n     cause.''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \namendment I have offered which would waive the job-killing fines in the \nreconciliation bill in cases where an employer hires an unemployed \nworker.\n  I think these penalties will come as a surprise to most Americans. \nWith unemployment at 9.7 percent, and a real concern that we may be on \nthe brink of a double-dip recession, most Americans will be shocked to \nlearn that Washington wants to slap fines on small businesses that \nchoose to hire more workers. But the new health care law does exactly \nthat.\n  Incredibly, this reconciliation package makes this problem even \nworse. Here is how. In the reconciliation package, small businesses \nthat cannot afford to provide health insurance to their employees would \nbe fined $2,000 for each worker on their payroll. The way the formula \nworks, the fines kick in at $40,000 when a small business reaches 50 \nemployees. After that, they go up at a rate of $2,000 for each new \nworker.\n  Imagine what this will do to job growth. Our country relies on small \nbusinesses to create new jobs. In fact, time and time again, you will \nhear on the Senate floor that small businesses are the engine of the \nAmerican economy. I certainly agree with that. But this reconciliation \nbill creates a wall--40,000 dollars high--around any small business \nthat wants to grow past 49 workers.\n  Think what these job-killing penalties will mean to the unemployed. \nMore than 8 million Americans have lost their jobs since 2007. More \nthan 6 million have been unemployed longer than 27 weeks. But beyond \neven these grim statistics, the true picture of unemployment in this \ncountry is actually far worse. Broader measures of unemployment show \nthat 16 percent of the American people are without jobs or cannot find \nfull-time work.\n  I recognize some in this body will argue we should not be bothered \nwith these penalties now because they do not become effective right \naway. But those who would say such a thing simply do not understand how \nsmall businesses work. We are not talking about big multinational \nconglomerates here. We are talking about Main Street businesses that \nare already struggling. Many of them are family-owned enterprises. They \ndo not look at their employees as interchangeable parts, and they do \nnot make hiring decisions to ``get rich quick.'' When they bring a new \nemployee on board, they are choosing someone who they know will become \npart of their team and the face of their business to the community they \nserve.\n  Having these fines on the books will discourage job growth now, no \nmatter when they become effective, because small businesses will not \nhire and train workers today just to fire them tomorrow when these \npenalties go into effect.\n  Ironically, less than a week ago, the President signed into law the \nso-called HIRE Act. It contains a provision authored by Senators \nSchumer and Hatch to provide a temporary tax credit to encourage \ncompanies to hire unemployed workers. That is a creative idea, and I \nsupported it. But for the life of me, I do not understand how a week \nlater we could vote for a bill that imposes fines that will hit small \nbusinesses when they hire new workers.\n  This makes no sense to me, and it is completely contrary to the \npolicy we passed a week ago when we gave tax credits to encourage \nbusinesses to hire workers who are unemployed. With this bill, we are \ngoing to fine them if they hire workers who are unemployed if they \ncannot afford to provide them with health insurance. That is why I am \noffering this commonsense amendment. It would waive the fines, the \nonerous fines that are in the reconciliation bill when small businesses \nand medium-size businesses hire workers who were previously unemployed.\n  The mechanism to determine which workers qualify is exactly the same \none we adopted in the jobs bill passed by this body last week. It is \nthe height of irony that we would even consider imposing penalties and \nfines on businesses that are hiring more workers, particularly during \nthis difficult economic time.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3639\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, 3639 and 3640--one dealing with student \nloans, the other dealing with striking the CLASS Act from the \nunderlying bill.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in speaking to both these amendments \ntoday, I wish to make a couple of observations about the reconciliation \nbill that is before the Senate. Of course, it does make amendments and \nmodifications to the Senate-passed health care bill that went through \nthe House last week and the House adopted many of these changes. I \nthink the thing that perhaps didn't get discussed as much as it should \nhave throughout the course of the debate is the impact this is going to \nhave down the road on future generations.\n  Obviously, the other side, of course, talked about the additional \nexpansions of coverage that are in the bill. Folks on our side talked \nabout the impact it is going to have in the form of higher taxes on \nsmall businesses, the Medicare cuts that are going to impact seniors \nacross this country, the higher premiums many Americans are going to be \nfaced with. Those are all still fundamental features of this bill. In \nfact, many have gotten worse through this reconciliation process \nbecause the tax increases are now $50 billion higher than they were \nbefore. So now we are raising taxes even $50 billion more than we were \npreviously, which is $\\1/2\\ trillion. The Medicare cuts have now gone \nfrom $465 billion over the 10 years in the bill that left the Senate in \nDecember, and the Medicare cuts now have been increased by $66 billion. \nSo we are raising taxes more, cutting Medicare even deeper, and at the \nsame time adding gimmicks that I think understate the true cost of this \nbill.\n  We have all talked about this throughout the course of this debate. \nThe other side has said it is $1 trillion or $900-some billion over 10 \nyears, but when you look at the way it is scored, there are 10 years of \nrevenues, 10 years of tax increases, and only 6 years of spending, so \nthat understates the cost over 10 years.\n  We have a number of other budget gimmicks, some of which I will speak \nto in a few moments. But when you look at it when it is fully \nimplemented--and I think that is the number the American people need to \nfocus on--when this is fully implemented, it is $2.5 trillion of \nexpansion of health care in this country, and it is going to be greater \nintervention than we have ever seen before by the Federal Government in \nthe delivery of health care in this country.\n  I wish to speak for a moment--because one of my amendments deals with \nthis issue--on how the cost of this is being understated because of the \nvarious gimmicks and tricks being used. The CLASS Act is a program that \nis created in the bill. It is a program where there is an assumption \nthat there is $70 billion available in the CLASS Act to pay for this \nnew health care entitlement. What it does is it creates a new \nentitlement. As if the existing entitlement programs we have that are \nalready on the way to bankruptcy aren't enough, we now have to add \nanother one to it. So the CLASS Act is a long-term care entitlement \nprogram, which in and of itself perhaps isn't a bad idea if it were \nstructured correctly and if the premiums that are going to be paid by \npeople for long-term care insurance were actually going to go into the \npayment of benefits.\n  What this does is it assumes $70 billion from this new CLASS Act \nprogram, the proceeds from which would be used to pay for this new \nhealth care entitlement program. So it overstates the amount of revenue \nthat is coming in by $70 billion. Here is why. At some point, if you \nare an elderly person or perhaps even a younger person today who wants \nto buy into this new CLASS Act long-term care program, you would pay \npremiums. Those premiums, allegedly, would go into a fund that would \nthen be available to pay benefits when the time came to pay benefits. \nThat is not going to happen because you are taking that $70 billion and \nyou are spending it on this new health care entitlement. So at some \npoint in the future, when those people who have gone into this program \nthinking they are paying these premiums so they can derive a benefit at \nsome time in the future if they need to, when the time comes to pay out \nthat benefit, there will not be any money. So what happens? It is \nborrowed. It is added to the debt. So you have another $70 billion that \ngoes on the backs of our children and grandchildren to pay for this new \nentitlement program, which, again, understates the cost of this bill.\n  That is the CLASS Act bill, and my amendment would strike that from \nthe underlying bill. By the way, I offered that during the debate on \nthe Senate floor during the health care discussion we had the first \ntime around, and I got 51 votes for it. There were 12 Democrats who \nvoted with me in support of taking the CLASS Act out of the bill. One \nof the reasons I think there is so much bipartisan opposition to it is \nbecause everybody recognizes what a sham this is. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, said: This is a \nPonzi scheme of the highest order, something that Bernie Madoff would \nbe proud of. That is what he said about the CLASS Act. Even the \nWashington Post went so far as to make the statement that the CLASS Act \nis a gimmick designed to pretend that health care is fully paid for. \nThat is what the Washington Post editorialized about the CLASS Act--a \ngimmick designed to pretend that health care is fully paid for.\n  So you take that $70 billion off the overall revenues that come in \nunder the bill and you are already creating a $70 billion hole. You add \nto that the $29 billion in Social Security payroll taxes that are \nassumed are going to come in as people who get hit--the employers that \nget hit with the high-end Cadillac tax, currently paying out to their \nemployees in the form of health care benefits that are tax free, start \nshifting to cash compensation which would be taxable; therefore, \npayroll taxes would apply. That would generate another $29 billion in \nSocial Security payroll taxes. But, there again, those are payroll \ntaxes that at some point are going to have to pay benefits, but we \ndon't assume that here. We assume it is going to go on to fund this new \nhealth care entitlement program. So it is another $29 billion that at \nsome point in the future, when somebody decides: I want to draw my \nSocial Security benefits, they are not going to be there. Therefore, we \nput it back on the debt. More borrowing.\n  So we have $79 billion, $29 billion, and then we have the \nimplementation cost of this, which CBO has not fully given us because \nthey don't know what it is going to cost in the outyears. But based \nupon what they have given us of what it is going to cost in the near \nterm, we have extrapolated that it will cost about $114 billion to \nimplement this new health care extravaganza run out of Washington, DC. \nWhen you add that onto the cost, none of which is accounted for in the \nunderlying bill, you have another $114 billion in cost of this thing \nnot paid for.\n  Then, we take the Medicare double counting, which is interesting, \nbecause you have these cuts that are going to occur in Medicare; you \nhave these payroll tax increases that are supposed to occur in Medicare \nthat are going to generate, collectively, $529 billion in additional \nrevenue. But, here again, what is wrong with this picture? The \nassumption is, these are Medicare payroll taxes that are going to go \ninto a\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nMedicare fund that, at some point in the future, will pay Medicare \nbenefits. Yet, at the same time, we are saying these Medicare revenues \nare going to be used to finance this new health care expansion.\n  So what are you doing? You are double counting. You cannot spend that \nmoney twice. We are taking $529 billion in Medicare cuts, in Medicare \npayroll tax increases that supposedly would go into a Medicare trust \nfund to pay benefits at some point in the future to beneficiaries, \nrecipients of those funds, but, no, we are going to spend that on this \nnew health care entitlement.\n  What happens then? Someday in the future that Medicare recipient is \ngoing to say: OK, it is time to pay out these Medicare benefits. I have \nreached the appropriate age, I am eligible, and I want to get into the \nMedicare Program, and all that money that was supposed to have been in \nthe program to pay for those benefits isn't there. Why? Because it was \nspent on this new health care entitlement program. So what happens? To \npay those benefits, the Federal Government will then have to borrow--\nmore debt that goes on the backs of our children and grandchildren--\nanother $529 billion.\n  So the last point I will make is--because I have another amendment \nthat addresses this issue--this reconciliation bill did something that \nobviously was not included in the health care bill that passed the \nSenate the first time; that is, this takeover of the student loan \nprogram in this country. It is something that has been proposed around \nhere for some time. The way student loans are distributed across the \ncountry today is we have 2,000 lenders out there who make these loans. \nStudents can go there and get these loans. What this will do is \neliminate that model, will draw all these student loans into \nWashington, DC. There will be four Federal call centers where students \nwill go to get their loans. What does that do? Well, first off, it \nkills a lot of jobs. I have 1,200 jobs in South Dakota that are related \nto the student lending business, and those are all now going to be \nbureaucratic jobs in Washington, DC. There are 31,000 jobs across the \ncountry where you have people who are working in the student loan \nbusiness. Those jobs are in jeopardy because that is all going to be \ndrawn into Washington DC. I don't think the American people have \neffectively focused on what is being done in this reconciliation bill \nabove and beyond the bad stuff that is related to health care.\n  So we have this student loan program which is coming back into the \nFederal Government and a lot of the revenues now are being earmarked \nfor other things. They are being earmarked for the health care bill: $9 \nbillion is being used to pay for the health care expansion; $10 billion \nis going toward ``deficit reduction,'' but we have another $19 billion \ncoming out of the student loan program. Who is going to pay for that? \nStudents are. Students are going to pay for it in the form of higher \ninterest rates on their loans. Essentially, we are now not only taxing \nsmall businesses, cutting Medicare recipients, but we are also taxing \nstudents to pay for this expansion of health care.\n  We have another $19 billion which, at some point in the future--of \ncourse, this is all going to have to be paid for again by our children \nand grandchildren, but we have all this double counting that is going \non and all these gimmicks that are being used to understate the cost of \nthis bill. When you add it all up, $143 billion so-called budget \nsavings ends up in a $618 billion cost. In other words, instead of \nrunning, as the other side has said, a $143 billion budget surplus \nbecause of this health care expansion, if you take out all the \ngimmicks--the CLASS Act, the revenues, the Social Security payroll tax \nrevenues which are double counting, the Medicare double counting, and \nthe student loan program--we have a real deficit of $618 billion in the \nfirst 10 years. If you extrapolate that out into the second 10 years, \nit is $1.8 trillion that will have to be borrowed under this bill to \npay for the costs of it. That is the cost that we know today. That is \nall going to be passed on to future generations, to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The dirty little story that hasn't been told in this whole debate is \nhow much this is going to cost future generations because of the \nenormous debt we are piling up and all the games and the gimmicks and \nthe tricks and the chicanery that are being used to understate the true \ncost of this: $183 billion ``savings'' in this bill. When you take out \nall the double counting, all the gimmicks, we end up with a $618 \nbillion deficit in the first 10 years. That is tragic.\n\n  That is why I am offering this amendment to strike this CLASS Act. We \nshouldn't be creating another new entitlement program when we can't pay \nfor the entitlement programs we have. They are all going bankrupt, and \nwe are going to create yet another one, which is going to lay more debt \non the backs of our children and grandchildren.\n  The other thing I wish to mention just briefly in closing speaks to \nthe other amendment. The other amendment, as I said, because of this \ntakeover of the student loan business in this country, there are lots \nof States that are going to lose significant numbers of jobs. My State \nhas over 1,200 jobs related to student lending; Minnesota, 675; Iowa, \n526; Nebraska, 891. There are lots of places around this country where \nstudent lending creates jobs, private sector jobs. We are going to do \naway with those and bring all those jobs back to Washington, DC, and \nmake students come to Washington to get their student loans, as it \nturns out, at a higher cost because we are using some of the proceeds \nof that program to pay for the cost of a new health care program.\n  What my amendment essentially would do is say the Department of \nEducation has to certify that there will be no jobs lost across the \ncountry associated with this takeover of the student lending business \nand bringing all that power and consolidating it all in Washington, DC.\n  So those are the two amendments I offer. I hope my colleagues will \nvote for those. This is bad policy in so many ways, but in taking over \nyet another industry in this country that is creating a lot of jobs and \ntherefore killing a lot of jobs is the wrong way to move forward when \nyou are trying to pull an economy out of a recession.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending motions and amendments so I may offer a motion to \ncommit, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 4872 to the Committee on Finance with instructions \n     to report the same back to the Senate within 3 days with \n     changes to strike the 3.8 percent tax on net investment \n     income.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, my amendment is a motion to commit the \nreconciliation bill back to the Finance Committee to report the bill \nback without a brandnew tax on savings and investment for certain \ntaxpayers. This is an additional 3.8-percent tax on savings, which \nincludes dividends, capital gains, ordinary savings for many consumers, \nmany Americans who have not had to pay before but which this bill \nimposes. This is a $123 billion tax hike on those categories of income.\n  This is a mistake for a lot of reasons. One, it will discourage the \nvery thing we need to be doing more of, which is saving. It will reduce \nproductivity, and it depresses wages and the standard of living for \nmillions of Americans. Simply put, increasing taxes, particularly \nduring a recession, on the very sectors of the economy that we want to \ninvest and to create jobs is a terrible mistake.\n  According to forecasts by the Institute for Research on the Economics \nof Taxation, a 2.9-percent tax increase--not 3.8 percent but a 2.9-\npercent previously proposed--would depress economic growth by 1.3 \npercent and reduce capital formation by 3.4 percent.\n  The damage to jobs and economic growth during a recession when \nunemployment is at 9.7 percent would be even greater under the current \nproposal because we are talking about a 3.8-percent tax, not a 2.9-\npercent tax, which was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article and \nthis report from the Institute for Research on the Economics of \nTaxation.\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\n  Not only will this motion protect jobs and the investment security of \ntaxpayers, it will also make sure the reconciliation bill does not \nbreak yet another one of President Obama's promises. This is just \nanother one of the President's promises that have been broken by this \nbill when he said, talking about this bill:\n\n       Everyone in America--everyone--will pay lower taxes than \n     they would under the rates Bill Clinton had in the 1990s.\n\n  But the truth is, this additional tax on savings and investment will \nmake taxes higher than they were even back in the 1990s when Bill \nClinton was President of the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my motion to commit this bill to the \nFinance Committee.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks two articles--a March 17 Wall Street Journal \narticle entitled ``ObamaCare's Worst Tax Hike'' and the report I \nreferred to a moment ago from the Institute for Research on the \nEconomics of Taxation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this is not the only job-killing \nprovision in this bill, this brandnew 3.8 percent tax increase that \nwill attack savings and investment. Other examples of job-killing \nproposals in this bill include increasing the hospital insurance \npayroll tax. This tax is increased to 3.8 percent. It will hit \nthousands of small businesses that file as subchapter S corporations \nand pay taxes at individual rates. In addition, this revenue will not \nbe used to pay for Medicare but will be used to fund a brandnew \nentitlement.\n  Another job-killing proposal in this bill includes new taxes and fees \non health care consumers. That is right, the very people for whom we \nare trying to lower costs and trying to make health care more \naffordable, many will have to pay additional taxes and fees to the tune \nof $100 billion which both the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Tax Committee have confirmed will inevitably be passed down to \nconsumers.\n  Then there are the higher premiums for individuals who do not get \ntheir health coverage from their employer but have to go into the group \nmarket. We are talking about a lot of small businesses, individuals, \npartnerships, sole proprietors, and the like. One consulting firm \nconcluded that premiums in the group market could go up as much as 20 \npercent because of the mandated, government-approved insurance that has \nto be sold under this bill. CBO said they concluded a somewhat lower \nlevel--between 10 and 13 percent. But still, if the purpose of health \ncare reform is to make health care more affordable, this bill simply \ngoes in the wrong direction.\n  Then there is the employer mandate. I met this morning with \nrepresentatives of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Hispanic \nChamber told me something I knew before but reiterated--the important \nrole of small businesses in terms of job creation--and pointed out to \nme how many Hispanics and minority business owners are engaged in the \nvery kind of job creation we should be encouraging, not discouraging. \nThis employer mandate will kill jobs because the additional cost of \nhealth insurance will be passed along to workers in the form of lower \nwages or result in reduced hours or layoffs. In a July 2009 report \nentitled ``Effects of Changes to the Health Care Insurance System on \nLabor Markets,'' the CBO concluded that the employer mandate is \n``likely to reduce employment.''\n  At a time when unemployment is at 9.7 percent, people are losing \ntheir jobs, and they cannot pay their mortgages, so they are being \nkicked out of their homes due to foreclosure, we are making things \nworse with this bill, not better.\n  All told, this bill that has been signed into law by the President \nand the bill before the Senate, this reconciliation bill, include more \nthan $500 billion in tax increases. It makes no sense, except in the \nrarefied air under this dome, for Congress to even consider raising \ntaxes, imposing new mandates on employers and individuals at a time \nwhen unemployment is so high and when that is the most pressing issue \nconfronting the Nation today. Congress is making this worse, not \nbetter. Why Congress would pass a new tax on investment that will act \nlike a wet blanket on the economy to further exacerbate unemployment \nand make recovery harder is, frankly, beyond me.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 17, 2010]\n\n                       ObamaCare's Worst Tax Hike\n\n       The forced march to pass ObamaCare continues, and all that \n     matters now is raw politics. But opponents should go down \n     swinging, and that means exposing such policy debacles as \n     President Obama's 11th-hour decision to apply the 2.9% \n     Medicare payroll tax to ``unearned income.''\n       That's what savings and investment income are called in \n     Washington, and this destructive tax wasn't in either the \n     House or Senate bills, though it may now become law with \n     almost no scrutiny.\n       For the first time, the combined employer-worker 2.9% \n     Medicare rate would be extended beyond wages to interest, \n     dividends, capital gains, annuities, royalties and rents for \n     individuals with adjusted gross income above $200,000 and \n     joint filers over $250,000.\n       That would lift the top capital-gains rate to 22.9% as the \n     regular rate bounces back to 20% from 15% when the Bush tax \n     cuts expire at the end of this year. The top rate for \n     dividends would rise to 42.5% when the Bush income-tax rates \n     expire. The White House plan also raises the ordinary \n     Medicare payroll tax by 0.9 percentage points for the same \n     filers, bringing it to 3.8%.\n       Preliminary estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     peg the revenue from these changes at $183.6 billion over 10 \n     years. The Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and \n     Brookings Institution estimates that 86% of the revenue from \n     the investment tax would come from people making more than \n     $624,000, or about 1.2 million taxpayers. This has led many \n     liberals to claim that it won't matter to investors or harm \n     the economy.\n       Yet these static analyses ignore the incentive effects \n     forecast by the Institute for Research on the Economics of \n     Taxation. Stephen Entin and colleagues estimates that the \n     investment tax would depress GDP by about 1.3% and reduce \n     capital formation by 3.4%, and thus reduce the after-tax \n     incomes of everyone not paying the tax directly in the \n     neighborhood of 1.1% to 1.2%. Labor productivity and wages \n     would fall across the board, while the lost government \n     revenues from the more-sluggish economy would offset the \n     expected receipts.\n       Senate Democrats rejected Nancy Pelosi's favored 5.4-\n     percentage-point ``surcharge'' on modified adjusted gross \n     income above $1 million as too radical. But they seem to be \n     fine with its 2.9-percentage-point alter ego, although the \n     Tax Policy Center concludes (on paper) that they'll soak more \n     or less the same people for more or less the same amount.\n       Earning even a single dollar more than $200,000 in adjusted \n     gross income will slap the 2.9% tax on every dollar of a \n     taxpayer's investment income, creating a huge marginal-rate \n     spike that will most hurt middle-class earners, as opposed to \n     the superrich.\n       This two-tier tax also fundamentally and probably \n     irrevocably alters the social insurance model that has \n     governed Medicare for more than a half-century. Medicare is \n     supposed to be a universal entitlement with at least some \n     connection between the taxes paid on wages in return for \n     benefits. The investment tax, and the apparatus of ObamaCare \n     financing more generally, severs this link by redirecting \n     Medicare's ``dedicated'' revenues toward a new entitlement. \n     Even Bill Clinton didn't cross this policy threshold in the \n     health debate of the early 1990s, proposing to fund \n     HillaryCare entirely through new corporate taxes and \n     preserving Medicare as its own discrete program.\n       Mr. Obama gave a preview of the fiscal confusion this \n     creates at a Wednesday campaign stop in St. Charles. Shortly \n     after accusing his critics of being ``just plain wrong'' \n     about everything, he went on to boast that ``we're going to \n     be able to help ensure Medicare's solvency for an additional \n     decade'' and also ``reduce the deficit by a trillion \n     dollars.''\n       Yet his claims are just plain wrong, as already exposed by \n     the Congressional Budget Office. The government can't spend \n     the same Medicare dollar twice: Either it can reduce the \n     deficit or extend the life of Medicare, but not both. This \n     may seem an arcane point, but the White House obviously knows \n     better and yet continues to peddle this falsehood.\n       The White House has embraced this investment tax because \n     Big Labor opposed its preferred excise tax on high-cost \n     health plans. So the White House decided to delay the excise \n     tax, which meant losing $116.2 billion in revenue over the \n     first 10 years. Voila, out came the 2.9% investment tax.\n       So for reasons of political expediency, Democrats will now \n     impose a destructive tax that will permanently skew the \n     incentives to work, save and create jobs. Come to think of \n     it, that sums up this entire exercise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n[From the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, Mar. 1, \n                                 2010]\n\n The Obama Administration's Proposed 2.9% ``HI'' Surtax Would Harm the \n                        Economy and Lose Revenue\n\n       President Obama has recommended imposing a 2.9% ``HI'' \n     surtax on ``passive income'' (income from saving and \n     investment) to help\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n     fund his health insurance overhaul. Social Security taxes for \n     retirement and medical programs for the elderly taxes have \n     always been levied on wages, as a form of social insurance. \n     Extending the Hospital Insurance tax to income from savings \n     would be a sharp departure from previous practice and very \n     bad economics.\n\n\n              Economic consequences of the 2.9% rate hike\n\n       On a static basis, our preliminary estimate is that the \n     Obama plan's 2.9% surtax on the capital gains, dividends, \n     interest, and certain other income of upper-middle class and \n     wealthy taxpayers would:\n       Raise approximately $39 billion yearly (at 2009 income \n     levels);\n       Affect only a small number of upper-income individuals.\n       In reality, on a dynamic basis, the 2.9% surtax would, \n     after the economy has adjusted to it:\n       Depress GDP by about 1.3%;\n       Reduce private-sector capital formation by about 3.4%;\n       Cut the wage rate by about 1.1%, and hours worked by about \n     0.2%;\n       Reduce the after-tax incomes of the people in the income \n     ranges supposedly not touched by the proposed 2.9% surtax by \n     1.1%-1.2%;\n       Lose about 70% of its anticipated income tax revenue gain \n     due to lower GDP and incomes across-the-board;\n       Decrease other federal tax revenues, causing total federal \n     receipts actually to fall by about $5 billion yearly (at 2009 \n     income levels).\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       Capital formation is very sensitive to taxes on capital \n     income, and reduced capital formation reduces labor \n     productivity and wages across the board. We estimate that the \n     proposed surtax will depress capital formation, GDP, and \n     wages. The resulting loss of income, payroll, corporate, \n     excise, and other taxes will offset the assumed revenue \n     gains. The wage depression will affect all income levels, and \n     the tax burden will not be confined to the top income \n     earners.\n       The 2.9% passive income surtax (equal to the Medicare Part \n     A--or Hospital Insurance--payroll tax rate) would be imposed \n     on dividends, interest, capital gains, rents, royalties, and \n     other income from saving and investing. The tax would hit \n     couples with more than $250,000 in adjusted gross income \n     ($200,000 trigger for singles and heads of households). The \n     tax would be triggered by earning even a single dollar above \n     the thresholds, after which all of the taxpayers' passive \n     income would be immediately subject to the tax. This creates \n     a huge tax rate spike or ``cliff' at the thresholds. It would \n     be imposed on AGI instead of taxable income, taking no \n     consideration of itemized deductions and the differing \n     circumstances of families which the deductions reveal.\n       The surtax would depress capital formation and wages, and \n     fail to bring in the expected revenue. The numbers below are \n     for the 2.9% rate hike in isolation. The Administration's \n     proposal to raise the top tax rates on capital gains and \n     dividends would produce additional losses. Further losses \n     would result from the Administration's proposal that the Bush \n     tax cuts expire for upper-income taxpayers, which would \n     increase the top two tax rates on interest income and other \n     ``passive'' income to 36% and 39.6%. The return of the \n     itemized deduction limitation and the personal exemption \n     phase-out would raise upper-income individuals' marginal \n     rates even higher and add more economic damage. (The rise in \n     the top two rates would also apply to labor income, and the \n     Administration's health care proposal, taking a page from the \n     health care bill that the Senate passed on Christmas Eve, \n     would pile on a 0.9% surtax on wages and self-employment \n     income.)\n       The House health bill has a 5.4% surtax on AGI. The Senate \n     considered that but dropped it as ill-advised and instead \n     opted for a 0.9% surtax on wage and self-employment income \n     only, building on the existing payroll tax. Any surtax is \n     undesirable, but a surtax on capital income would be \n     especially damaging, and the ``cliff' in the Obama \n     Administration's plan would compound the harm and is \n     especially inept.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, has the time on the Republican side \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I assume they do not want to use those 25 seconds, \nhearing no objection.\n  Madam President, we have several speakers. We are waiting for Senator \nShaheen, Senator Feingold, Senator Sanders, Senator Nelson, and Senator \nMcCaskill. I do not see any of them right now.\n  While we are waiting, I wish to make a point about CBO's analysis \nwith respect to premiums.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that the health care reform bill \nwill lower premiums for all--millions--Americans--all. The \nCongressional Budget Office said health insurance premiums would fall \nby 14 to 20 percent for the same plan in the individual market and the \nsmall group market, up to 2 percent lower. Let me repeat that. The \nindividual market for the same plan, the Congressional Budget Office \nsays premiums will fall under this legislation. They will be lower, \nthey will be less by 14 to 20 percent than the same plan in the \nindividual market, as people buy insurance individually, and premiums \nfor the small group market--that is roughly small business--would be up \nto 2 percent lower than currently.\n  Why is all that? It is basically because there are savings. The \nsavings come from lower administrative costs, increased competition, \nand from better pooling of risk.\n  The analogy I like to refer to is Orbitz and Travelocity. Today with \nOrbitz, you shop online for an airline ticket. You look for fares and \nyou look for times. The same type of operation would occur with respect \nto insurance--you get on the exchange and shop for insurance.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire is now on the floor. I yield 4 \nminutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Baucus.\n  I am pleased to be here to join in this effort to talk about the \nimportance of what we are doing with health care reform. We have waited \nso long for health care reform, and yesterday it became a reality. \nToday, we celebrate a reformed health care system that President Obama \nhas signed into law. With this historic step, we have ensured that more \nAmericans have the health care security and stability they need. We \nhave ensured that families will have choices for coverage even if their \njobs do not provide it. We have ended denials for preexisting \nconditions, and we have a guarantee that no one has to pay more for \nhealth insurance if they get sick and that the insurance coverage \ncannot be taken away. We no longer allow insurance companies to put \nlifetime limits on the amounts of benefits they will cover.\n  But insurance reforms are not the only thing we have done. We have \nmade health care more affordable for those who need it most and made it \neasier for small businesses to provide coverage for their employees. We \nmade important steps to encourage everyone to take advantage of \npreventive care, and we have created incentives for people to enroll in \nwellness programs and encourage communities to address the public \nhealth of their citizens. Finally, we are changing the way doctors \nprovide care, making it better coordinated and more patient-centered.\n  I am pleased we are here building on the success of the health care \nreform legislation that was just signed into law. Our resolve is \nstrong, make no mistake about that. We must continue our work in making \na good bill even better.\n  The legislation we are now considering makes great strides to \nstrengthen the new law. It will provide more tax relief to families to \nhelp them afford health care and more help for seniors to pay for \nprescription drugs.\n  I have talked with seniors throughout New Hampshire who struggle with \nthe high cost of prescription drugs. The Medicare doughnut hole, as it \nis known, causes great stress in family budgets when seniors have to \npay full price for the drugs they need, people such as Sue Quinlan from \nPortsmouth, who recently wrote me about her experience with the \ndoughnut hole. She wrote:\n\n       This year, because of my illness, my drug costs have \n     doubled, and in September I experienced the ``donut hole.'' \n     This meant that when my Total Drug Cost reached $2,400 for \n     the year, I was on my own.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       You know you are in the donut hole when a drug you have \n     been paying $90 for is now $364.47. You know you are in the \n     donut hole when the mail order prescription company calls to \n     warn you that your order is going to cost $720.82 and wants \n     to confirm that you really do want them to send it, and you \n     have no choice except to send it unless you want to stop \n     taking the medications. You know you are in the donut hole \n     when the pharmacist gives you a sympathetic smile when they \n     hand you your order.\n\n  Under this bill, seniors such as Sue no longer need to worry. They \nwill get a discount on medicine critical to their health, and we will \nbegin to close the doughnut hole. Seniors will now have access to \naffordable drugs on which they depend. We have all heard the\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nstory of seniors breaking their pills in half or skipping their daily \ndoses because of the cost. Under this bill, a senior with high \ncholesterol and heart disease who relies on Lipitor and \nantihypertension medication to stay healthy now can take these drugs \nwith peace of mind and less financial stress.\n  This bill will expand affordable coverage to 32 million Americans. \nThe bill will provide the same Medicaid deals for every State so that \nthe Federal Government will help share in the burden the States face in \nproviding coverage for new populations. The bill also builds on the \nprevious bill to attack waste, fraud, and abuse in our health care \nsystem.\n  This is a historic time. Today, we build on that historic legislation \nwith improvements to make it stronger and even better for American \nfamilies and seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 6\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, for far too long, my constituents have \nbeen at the mercy of the health insurance industry which has dictated \nhow and whether they get health care coverage. Wisconsinites have been \ndenied coverage because of preexisting conditions, dropped from \ncoverage because they made too many claims, or simply forced to pay \nthrough the nose for skyrocketing premiums. Those days are now coming \nto an end thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  We have taken an important step with the enactment of that bill, but \nas you know, our work is not done. The Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act is not perfect, and Congress must be committed to \nstrengthening and adjusting this law as necessary in the years to come. \nThe first step, of course, is for the Senate to pass the Health Care \nEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010, which the Senate is now debating. \nThis bill will strengthen our health care reform law to ensure that \nhealth insurance is even more affordable for working families and that \nseniors actually pay less for prescription drug coverage.\n  Taken together with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nthis bill would help Wisconsinites purchase good, affordable health \ninsurance and health care. As a result, this year children will no \nlonger be denied coverage for preexisting conditions, insurance \ncompanies will no longer drop Americans because they are sick, young \nAmericans can remain on their parents' coverage longer, and the \nMedicare doughnut hole that shortchanges seniors will begin to be \nfilled. Then, over the next 4 years, States will prepare to set up \nhealth insurance exchanges for individuals and small businesses to \npurchase more affordable health insurance. As a result, an estimated \n541,000 Wisconsinites who are uninsured and 320,000 Wisconsinites who \nhave individual market insurance will gain access to affordable \ncoverage. As many as 358,000 Wisconsinites are expected to qualify for \npremium tax credits to help them purchase health care coverage. Experts \nbelieve this reform effort will lower premiums in the nongroup market \nby 14 to 20 percent for the same benefits--premium savings of $1,540 to \n$2,200 for a family in Wisconsin. Now, this is real savings.\n\n  According to the nonpartisan experts at CBO, over the next 10 years, \nour national deficit will decrease by $143 billion and up to $1.2 \ntrillion in the following 10 years. Those savings come from a number of \ncost containment provisions, including one which I strongly support \nthat will begin to reimburse physicians based on the quality of care \nthey provide rather than on the quantity of care. This movement toward \nvalue-based health care purchasing is one that is already seeing great \nsuccess in hospitals and medical groups around my State of Wisconsin. I \nwas so pleased to work with our nationally recognized medical centers \naround Wisconsin on these successful efforts.\n  Health reform also means more choice, more affordability, and more \nprotections for Wisconsin businesses. Over 77,400 small businesses \nthroughout the State of Wisconsin are eligible now for tax credits \nstarting this year to help purchase health insurance for business \nowners and their employees. No longer will small businesses be \nvulnerable to insurance practices of raising rates on a year-to-year \nbasis due to an employee falling ill.\n  I visit all 72 counties in Wisconsin every year, and I always hear \nabout the burden of health care costs on small businesses. So many \nWisconsinites are discouraged from striking out on their own to start a \nsmall business or to expand it because they can't afford or couldn't \nget health insurance on their own. This bill will help those \nWisconsinites start businesses and create jobs by providing the \naffordability and protections of the large insurance group market to \nsmall business owners.\n  Reform also means better and more affordable health care for \nWisconsin's seniors. The bill we are debating will build upon \nimprovements made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by \nclosing the Medicare Part D prescription drug doughnut hole by 2020. \nBeginning this year already seniors who reach the doughnut hole will \nreceive a $250 rebate, with more and more assistance available each \nyear until the doughnut hole is ultimately closed. Seniors will also be \nguaranteed an annual wellness visit and no cost sharing on preventive \ncare visits to their physician.\n  Of course, we know this reconciliation bill is not just about health \ncare. It also ends unjustified subsidies for private banks and lenders \nto issue Federal student loans. By transferring the authority to make \nall Federal student loans over to the existing Federal Direct Loan \nProgram effective July 1 of this year, we will save approximately $61 \nbillion over 10 years. The savings will in part be used to help ensure \nthat students do not see a reduction in their Pell grant awards next \nyear, providing much needed assistance to Wisconsin's low-income and \nmiddle-income students when they need it the most.\n  Historic health care reform is now the law of the land. But we have \nto do more, and passing this bill is the next step.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, a very valued member of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Presiding Officer and the \nchairman.\n  For the first time as a nation, we are recognizing that people have a \nright to not be destroyed by sickness. Under the Senate bill passed by \nthe House and signed into law yesterday by the President, folks are no \nlonger going to have to choose between their health and their \npocketbooks. Parents will no longer have to worry about whether they \ncan afford to get their kids to the doctor. Seniors will not have to \nwonder if Medicare will still be there for them several years down the \nroad.\n  Health care reform doesn't mean people would not have to continue \ntaking responsibility for themselves. The bill we passed, and even the \none we are now debating, improves health care affordability and access \nfor all, but it still requires folks to do their part. Families who can \nafford to will be asked to contribute to the cost of their coverage. \nPeople are expected to get regular primary care so they do not end up \nin the emergency room with something that could have been treated \neasily and cheaply if it had been addressed sooner.\n  But, very importantly, we are also going to hold the insurance \ncompanies accountable. We are finally telling them: You can't drop \nsomeone just because they get sick; you can't cap someone's benefits \njust because you are tired of paying for their care; and you can't \ndecide not to offer someone coverage because they have a preexisting \ncondition. We are telling them: No more, no more, no more.\n  We are also saying to our seniors that we, as a nation, remain \nunwavering in our commitment to protecting and preserving Medicare for \ntoday, tomorrow, and the next millennium.\n  There has been an awful lot of misinformation going around about \nMedicare and something called Medicare Advantage. The fact is, the \noriginal Senate bill proposed an unfair way to fix overpayments to \nthese private Medicare HMO insurance plans. The fix\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nwould have come at the expense of seniors living in areas with high \nmedical costs, such as my State of Florida. I was able to pass an \namendment in committee that fixed that problem fairly.\n  Under this reconciliation bill, the President has proposed another \nway to rein in those Medicare Advantage insurance companies, and this, \nupon close inspection, also treats seniors fairly. It puts companies on \nthe hook for their performance. If they do not provide quality service, \ntheir reimbursements are cut. Their enrollees--the seniors--are going \nto demand that they provide quality service. I appreciate the \nPresident's leadership on this issue and the fact that he heard the \nconcerns expressed by a number of us, including Senator Schumer and \nSenator Wyden.\n  But having said all this, we have left something undone in this \nSenate bill that is now law and even in this reconciliation package. I \nam not happy this legislation lets the drug companies pretty much off \nthe hook. You all know that over the past few years I have been voicing \nthe concerns and fears of residents in my State about what is happening \nto their drug prices. I also hear from the folks who can't afford their \nmedications when they hit the prescription drug coverage gap known as \nthe doughnut hole. They skimp on food or split their pills or stop \ntaking them altogether. While this bill offers a discount to seniors in \nthe doughnut hole, there is nothing to keep drug companies from \ncontinuing to jack up the prices until that discount is meaningless.\n  I also hear from folks who are frustrated that in other countries \nfolks are getting the very same drugs for much less than we pay here. I \nhad an amendment that would have required the drug industry to pay its \nfair share of the tab for health care reform. It required the drug \nmanufacturers to give the government price breaks on drugs for a lot of \nour low-income seniors, and that would have saved us $106 billion of \ntaxpayer money, which was more than enough to fill the doughnut hole \naltogether and then make a dent in offsetting the Federal deficit.\n  So I intend to come back and revisit this. In the meantime, I want to \nsay this reconciliation bill deepens and extends the promise of the \nhealth care reform bill that was signed into law just yesterday. I \nstood with the President when he put pen to paper yesterday. I think it \nis great we have begun the process of health care reform.\n  It has been said by many folks in many different ways that we are not \nput on Earth for ourselves, but we are placed here for each other. \nWell, here we are, and here we are debating legislation that stands to \nimprove the lives of tens of millions of Americans. So despite its \nflaws, I will vote to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nvery considered and thoughtful conclusion in deciding to vote for this \nlegislation. I deeply appreciate that very much. He is a wonderful \nmember of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding.\n  Mr. President, my Republican colleagues have reached the conclusion \nthat this is not a perfect bill. Well, they are right. While my \nproblems with this bill are very different than theirs, I do hope that \nin the weeks and months to come, after we pass this reconciliation \npackage, we will improve it. But I would ask my Republican colleagues \nto tell me something: When they controlled the White House and they \ncontrolled the Senate and they controlled the House, when President \nBush was our President--during that period--7 million more Americans \nlost their health insurance and health care costs soared. Where were \nthey then in talking about health care? Did they have one substantive \nidea during that period about how we were going to lower the cost of \nhealth care for Americans and provide health insurance for all of our \npeople?\n  I do hope that after we pass reconciliation we are going to improve \nthis bill. In that regard I want to thank Majority Leader Reid who has \npromised us--Senator Merkley, myself and others--that we will have the \nchance to vote on a public option provision. I think millions of \nAmericans understand that public option is a choice that people should \nhave--the right to go outside of the private insurance companies for \ntheir health insurance. That public option will provide competitive \npressure on the insurance industry to control soaring health care \ncosts. So I very much appreciate Senator Reid telling us that we are \ngoing to have a vote on that issue within a couple of months.\n  This bill is a strong step forward. It is no small thing that we are \nproviding health insurance to 32 million more Americans. It is no small \nthing that we are moving to eliminate preexisting conditions as a \ngrounds for rejecting someone for health care. It is no small thing \nthat we are going to begin to fill that doughnut hole so that seniors \nwill be able to get the prescription drugs they need in an affordable \nway. Those are, among other achievements, quite significant.\n  But having said that, after the passage of this legislation, we still \nhave to deal with the reality that we will continue to spend far more \nper capita on health care than any other major country.\n  A few days ago, we had the Ambassador from Denmark visiting Vermont. \nIn that country, they provide quality care for all of their people, and \nthey do it spending about 50 percent of what we do because they have \neliminated private insurance companies and all of the administrative \nand profiteering costs associated with private insurance companies. I \nhope we will one day at least allow States the option to move forward \nwith a single-payer, Medicare-for-all program, which I think ultimately \nis the way we are going to go as a nation if we are going to solve the \nneed for comprehensive universal and cost-effective health care for all \nof our people.\n  I do want to say a word on one aspect, one provision of this bill \nwhich I think is enormously important, and I am very excited it is \nincluded in this bill. Again, I thank Senator Reid for his help in \nmaking sure it remained in and is amply funded. That is that in this \nlegislation we are going to take a giant step forward in providing \nprimary health care to the people of this country through a major \nexpansion of Community Health Centers and the National Health Service \nCorps. This legislation provides enough funding so that we are going to \ncreate, over the next 5 years, 8,000 new health center sites, more than \ndoubling the number that now exists. We are going to increase access \nfor primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and \nlow-cost prescription drugs by doubling the number of Americans with \naccess to community health centers from 20 million to 40 million in \nevery State, and in every region of this country. That is a huge step \nforward in providing basic health care to millions of Americans who \ntoday cannot access that care.\n\n  While we do that, we are also going to significantly expand the \nnumber of doctors, the number of nurse practitioners and dentists that \nwe desperately need in order to provide primary health care to our \npeople.\n  This legislation--over a 5-year period--triples the amount of money \ngoing into the National Health Service Corps, a program which provides \ndebt forgiveness and scholarships for those doctors and dentists who \nwill be serving in underserved areas throughout this country.\n  Through the National Health Service Corps, we are going to support an \nadditional 17,000 new primary health care doctors, dentists, nurse \npractitioners, and mental health professionals. What this means is that \nif somebody has no health insurance, if somebody has Medicaid, if \nsomebody has Medicare, if somebody has private health insurance, that \nindividual is going to be able to walk into a community health center \nand get the high quality care they need. The incredible thing, and this \nis quite remarkable, is that by doing this we are going to actually \nsave taxpayers money because we are going to keep people out of the \nemergency room, which is the most expensive form of primary health \ncare; we are going to prevent people from becoming sicker than they \nshould and ending up in the\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nhospital at great expense. Based on a study by the Geiger-Gibson \nProgram at George Washington University, it is conservatively estimated \nthat, by investing $12.5 billion in health centers and the National \nHealth Service Corps, we will save Medicaid alone over $17 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  This legislation is going to be very significant in providing the \nprimary health care that we need as a nation, and I am very \nappreciative it is part of the bill.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the findings of the study by the Geiger-Gibson/RCHN \nCommunity Health Foundation Research Collaborative, George Washington \nUniversity, dated October 14, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Findings\n\n       Since health centers are non-profit entities that operate \n     subject to comprehensive federal standards, our models assume \n     that health centers will serve as many patients as their \n     revenues permit. As a result, the number of patients served \n     at health centers depends on the revenue available to health \n     centers and the distribution of insurance coverage among \n     health center patients. The Senate provisions increase health \n     center revenues in three key ways: (1) by increasing federal \n     health center grants; (2) by increasing Medicaid revenues as \n     a result of expanded Medicaid coverage; and (3) by assuring \n     higher private insurance revenues as a result of the \n     extension of the Prospective Payment System (PPS) to health \n     center patients insured through a health exchange. By \n     lowering the number of uninsured patients, health reform thus \n     will allow health centers to use their grant funds to reach \n     additional uninsured patients, thereby increasing the number \n     of patients who can be served.\n       It is important to note that federal health center grants \n     and payments under Medicaid and private health insurance \n     represent only a portion of total health center revenue. \n     Other important sources include other federal, state, local \n     and private grants or contracts. As in our prior report, we \n     conservatively assume that these other funding sources will \n     grow by only five percent annually.\n       We estimate that by 2019, these combined policy changes \n     would roughly triple the number of patients receiving care at \n     health centers. The number of patients would rise from an \n     estimated 19.0 million in 2009 to 44.2 million in 2015 and to \n     60.4 million by 2019. In order to expand to serve this many \n     patients, we assume that the number of health center grantees \n     and the number of health center delivery sites (i.e., \n     clinics) would grow substantially, permitting a major \n     expansion of health centers and clinics into more medically \n     underserved rural, suburban and urban communities.\n       In our prior paper, we analyzed data from the 2006 Medical \n     Expenditure Panel Survey to compare the medical expenditures \n     of people who receive the majority of ambulatory care at \n     health centers and those who do not. We found that, after \n     adjusting for health status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and \n     health insurance coverage, the average patient receiving care \n     at a community health center had annual medical expenditures \n     $1,093 lower than an average patient who did not use health \n     centers. This estimated savings includes both reduced \n     ambulatory costs as a result of health center efficiencies as \n     well as reduced inpatient medical expenses, which may be due \n     to the prevention of more severe health problems requiring \n     hospitalization. These findings are consistent with numerous \n     prior studies showing that health centers are efficient \n     providers of quality primary care and that more effective use \n     of primary care can reduce hospital and specialty care costs.\n       Using the estimate of $1,093 savings per health center \n     patient in 2006, we applied the estimates of the increased \n     number of health center patients and adjusted savings to \n     account for health care inflation to estimate total medical \n     savings associated with the expansion of services at health \n     centers over the next ten years. These are summarized in \n     Table 1.\n\n TABLE 1--ESTIMATED INCREASE IN HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS, TOTAL MEDICAL SAVINGS AND FEDERAL MEDICAID SAVINGS UNDER\n                                       THE SENATE PROVISIONS, 2010 TO 2019\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         2009        2015        2019      2010-2015   2010-2019\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Number of Patients (mil)......................        19.0        44.2        60.4  ..........  ..........\nIncrease Over 2009 Patients (mil)...................  ..........        25.2        41.4  ..........  ..........\nEst.

Federal Medicaid Savings (bil).................          --       $11.0       $22.5       $34.2     $105.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Authors' estimates.\n\n       As seen in Table 1, in 2019, we estimate that the number of \n     patients receiving primary care services at health centers \n     will rise by 41.4 million over the 2009 level of 19.0 \n     million, to 60.4 million total patients. This growing use of \n     health centers to serve an additional 41.4 million patients \n     times the medical savings of $1,780 per patient yields an \n     overall medical savings estimate of $73.7 billion in 2019 \n     alone. Over the 2010-2019 period, we estimate that an \n     increase in the number of patients who receive their health \n     care through health centers will lead to $369 billion in \n     total medical savings. (Following the approach used by the \n     Congressional Budget Office, we estimate only the additional \n     savings due to increases in the number of patients served at \n     health centers. We estimate that the 19 million patients \n     already served in 2009 create medical savings of $24 billion \n     in that year alone; savings from the existing 19 million \n     patients are not included in the estimates shown in Table 1 \n     above.)\n       This estimate includes all medical savings, whether public \n     or private. From the federal perspective, the critical \n     question is federal savings. We estimate savings attributable \n     to federal spending by focusing on federal Medicaid savings, \n     accounting both for the increased volume of Medicaid patients \n     and the effective increases in federal matching shares for \n     Medicaid. (There are also state Medicaid savings not included \n     in the estimate of federal savings.) This calculation yields \n     an estimated federal Medicaid savings of $22.5 billion in \n     2019 and $105 billion between 2010 and 2019. This is a \n     conservative estimate of federal savings, since there would \n     also be savings under Medicare as well as in the federal \n     subsidies spent to purchase health insurance through \n     exchanges.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on our half hour?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes 40 seconds to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, we have had a lot of that childhood \nstory we all learned of ``Chicken Little.'' We have had a lot of \nChicken Little around this building in the last few months: The sky is \nfalling, the sky is falling. You know, I woke up this morning, I looked \nup and the sky was not falling. Every day that goes by in America \npeople are going to realize the sky is not falling. In fact, as time \ngoes on that sky is going to get bluer and brighter because people in \nAmerica are going to realize this bill is not full of booby traps, it \nis full of good things that will reform health care.\n  I rise this afternoon to take a couple of minutes to talk about a new \nlow of obstructionism, taking game playing to a whole new level. In 10 \nminutes I was supposed to convene a hearing on the contracts for police \ntraining in Afghanistan. This is a very important part of our mission \nin Afghanistan, the training of local police departments. There was a \nwitness who was going to be there from the State Department, a witness \nthere from the Defense Department, the Inspectors General were going to \nbe there.\n  Just last week GAO wiped out a contract that had been let on police \ntraining because of problems in the way the contract was competed. So \nthis hearing was timely and it is important. We cannot succeed in \nAfghanistan if we do not have effective police training. These \ncontracts are problematic. The State Department is supposed to be \noverseeing them. We have hundreds of millions of dollars not accounted \nfor.\n  So what do I find out this morning? The Republican party is not going \nto let us have the hearing. What in the world? Why in the world are we \nnot being allowed to work this afternoon? Why in the world are we not \nable to ask questions at a hearing in a few minutes as to why the \npolice training is not going well in Afghanistan and how we can do \nbetter?\n  Our men and women are over there and they are at risk if we do not \nget this right. I don't get it. I don't get what the purpose of saying \nno is. I don't get what we accomplish. We are sent here to work. We are \npaid by the people of this country to work. The idea that I had to call \nthese witnesses and say go home because the Republicans will not let us \nhave a hearing--\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nsomebody has to explain this to me. Disagree with us, debate, vote no--\nbut let us work. I implore you: Let us work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have one unanimous consent request that \nwe continue altering sides of the debate. I ask consent we continuing \nalternating back and forth, and the next half hour be on the Republican \nside.\n  I ask unanimous consent the next half hour be controlled by the \nRepublicans and the half hour thereafter be controlled by the majority, \nand the half hour after that be controlled by Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the final \nblock of time is reserved to be under the control of the chairman for \nconcluding remarks; that is, prior to a series of votes. I make that \nstatement for the information of Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3579\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask consent to call up Roberts-Inhofe-Brown amendment \nNo. 3579, and I ask unanimous consent Senator Crapo be added as \ncosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. ROBERTS], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, and Mr. Crapo, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3579.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To strike the medical device tax)\n\n       Strike section 1405 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1405. REPEAL OF MEDICAL DEVICE FEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 9009 of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, as amended by section 10904 of such Act, \n     is repealed effective as of the date of the enactment of that \n     Act.\n       (b) Expansion of Affordability Exception to Individual \n     Mandate.--Section 5000A(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, as added by section 1501(b) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and amended by section \n     10106 of such Act, is amended by striking ``8 percent'' and \n     inserting ``5 percent''.\n       (c) Application of Provision.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (b) shall apply as if included in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, included in the half trillion dollars in \nnew taxes in this health reform bill is a tax hike of $20 billion on \nmedical devices, a $20 billion excise tax on lifesaving medical \ndevices. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint \nCommittee on Taxation have both confirmed that these excise taxes will \nnot be borne by the medical device industry if in fact that is what the \nother side wanted to do. Instead, the tax will be passed on to patients \nin the form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums. My \ncolleagues are going to speak in greater detail about this tax, but let \nme take a moment to talk about some of the people who will bear the \nburden, and what types of devices will be taxed.\n  People with disabilities, diabetics, amputees, people with cancer and \npeople with Alzheimer's are just some of the folks who will see their \ntax costs go up because of this tax. My amendment prevents this new tax \nfrom raising the already high cost for these groups by striking the tax \non medical devices.\n  This is a tax on innovative devices as well, a device such as the \ncyberknife. The cyberknife is a noninvasive alternative to surgery for \nthe treatment of both cancerous and noncancerous tumors anywhere in the \nbody. Yet under this bill, such cutting-edge devices will be taxed. \nThose who need the treatment offered by the cyberknife will see the \ncost of that treatment go up. When innovative and lifesaving \ntechnologies such as the cyberknife are taxed, when the costs of many \ntests increase because the devices used in the tests are taxed, when \nthe new devices are not developed and when fewer manufacturers are able \nto survive in the anticompetitive environment this tax will create, \nconsumers of health care will suffer for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and yield the \nremainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Brown.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roberts \nfor bringing this very important issue to the forefront. Many of you \nknow I live in Massachusetts. We have over 225 medical device companies \nthere. Before I got here, I visited many of them and the message was \nvery clear, that if in fact that 3-percent medical device tax goes into \neffect, it is virtually all of their profit for many of these young \ncompanies and established companies.\n  Placing a tax on medical devices, in my opinion and their opinion, \nwill dramatically affect jobs, not only in Massachusetts but throughout \nthe country.\n  Unemployment in my State is hovering near 10 percent and we should be \ndoing everything we can at this point to create jobs and stimulate the \neconomy. I am hopeful that in the effort I made in the beginning for a \nbipartisan effort to start jobs with the first jobs bill that we can \nlook at the areas we are trying to focus on to make this bill better. I \nam hopeful once again, through the Senator's leadership and that of \nSenator Roberts and others who sponsored it, we will look twice at what \nwe are trying to do here in order to pay for the so-called health care \nbill.\n  As we are in the middle of a 2-year recession, taxing companies, \nespecially vibrant companies throughout my State and throughout the \ncountry, I am fearful they will leave and go to other countries to do \ntheir business.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3588\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3588 and make it \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. INHOFE] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3588.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent we dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To exclude pediatric devices and devices for persons with \n               disabilities from the medical device tax)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (e) Exclusion of Medical Devices for Pediatric Use and \n     Persons With Disabilities.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of section 4191(b)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by subsection (a), \n     the term ``taxable medical device'' shall not include any \n     device which is primarily designed--\n       (A) to be used by or for pediatric patients, or\n       (B) to assist persons with disabilities with tasks of daily \n     life.\n       (2) Expansion of affordability exception to individual \n     mandate.--Section 5000A(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, as added by section 1501(b) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and amended by section \n     10106 of such Act, is amended by striking ``8 percent'' and \n     inserting ``5 percent''.\n       (3) Application of provision.--The amendment made by \n     paragraph (2) shall apply as if included in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, President Obama repeatedly promised during \nthe campaign that no one making under $250,000 per year would see their \ntaxes increase. However, the Democrats claim to spend $2.6 trillion in \nnew health care at a time when the country cannot afford the promises \nthey have already made and we have a record 1-year budget deficit, $1.4 \ntrillion.\n  We hear President Obama always talking about what he inherited from \nGeorge W. Bush. What he inherited was nothing like what he did. He \nactually raised the deficit $1.4 trillion in 1 year. That is more than \nPresident Bush did in his last 5 years.\n  The HELP bill, which recently passed the House, represents an \nunprecedented\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nexpansion of government control and increases taxes on Americans during \na difficult economic time. But the Democrats did not stop with one \nexpensive health care bill. Now the Senate is debating a fix-it bill \nwhich increases taxes an additional $50 billion on the American people.\n  Reading through the legislation, I am struck by a myriad of ways this \nraises taxes on American citizens, from job-creating small businesses \nto middle-income families--over a half trillion dollars of new taxes.\n  If you happen to need a medical device--that is what we are talking \nabout right now--you get taxed under the bill. Section 9009 of the \nrecently passed health care bill imposes a new tax on assistive \ndevices, which includes items such as pacemakers, ventilators, and \nprosthetics, and incubators for premature babies. The fix-it bill--I \ncall this the payoff bill because as you all know the Speaker of the \nHouse had to pay off all these individuals. We understand how that \nworks. That is what this bill is all about right now. That is why it \nneeds to be amended. This is what we are currently debating. It \nactually expands to include more medical devices such as tongue \ndepressors, elastic bandages, most hand-held dental instruments, and \nexamination gloves.\n  I am joining with my Republican colleagues to propose an amendment \nstriking the tax on medical devices.\n  Additionally, I have filed amendment No. 3588--that is what we are \ntalking about now--that will strike this expansion of taxes on \nassistive devices for two of the most vulnerable populations, children \nand individuals with disabilities.\n  I have previously spoken on the floor about this new tax and how it \nhurts Americans. Let me remind you of a couple of examples.\n  My son-in-law Brad Swan installs pacemakers and defibrillators. I \nknow this is true because he lives right across the street from us. At \n1 o'clock in the morning he was called to an emergency involving a \nyoung 8-year-old boy with no heartbeat whatsoever.\n  He was born with congenital heart disease, was able to have a \npacemaker put in that morning, right after he was called, and now he \nhas a full, healthy life ahead of him. My older sister Marilyn faced a \nsimilar situation and is alive and healthy today. Additionally, Dr. \nStanley DeFehr, a cardiologist in Bartlesville, OK, explained to me \nthat:\n\n       The cost of a pacemaker [we are talking about $5,000; it is \n     something that lasts 10 years] pales in comparison to the \n     cost of a stroke or multiple fractures.\n\n  Now with this tax, we are making these medical devices more expensive \nfor families, which may prevent others from accessing the device they \nneed in order to enhance or even save their lives.\n  I have never been through anything like this in the 20 years I have \nbeen here. We look at the tax increase in this bill of $569 billion; \nnow it is going to be more than that.\n  Additionally, I was talking this morning in Chickasha, OK, on a radio \nshow, and the person intervening me was talking about his 94-year-old \nmother and how she depends on Medicare. I explained that there is $523 \nbillion in Medicare cuts in this bill.\n  So, you know, the White House was celebrating. You could hear the \nchampagne corks popping all night long. Yes, they successfully \nincreased taxes by $569 billion.\n  So I encourage people to vote for this amendment to at least relieve \npart of the problem that is out there. It is amendment No. 3588.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3644\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Coburn, \n     and Mr. Crapo, proposes an amendment numbered 3644.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To protect access for America's wounded warriors)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (e) Exclusion of Medical Devices Sold Under the TRICARE for \n     Life Program or Veteran's Health Care Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of section 4191(b)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by subsection (a), \n     the term ``taxable medical device'' shall not include any \n     device which is sold to individuals covered under the TRICARE \n     for Life program or the veteran's health care program under \n     chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, any portion of \n     the cost of which is paid or reimbursed under either such \n     program.\n       (2) Expansion of affordability exception to individual \n     mandate.--Section 5000A(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, as added by section 1501(b) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and amended by section \n     10106 of such Act, is amended by striking ``8 percent'' and \n     inserting ``5 percent''.\n       (3) Application of provision.--The amendment made by \n     paragraph (2) shall apply as if included in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before I talk about my amendment to exempt \nour Nation's wounded warriors from this new medical device tax, let me \ntake a moment to talk about the enormous tax burden imposed under this \nbill.\n  Republicans in Congress agree with the majority of Americans who \nbelieve that simply throwing more hard-earned taxpayer dollars at a \n$2.5 trillion health care system will not deliver meaningful reform. \nSimply raising more than $650 billion in new taxes at a time when our \nnational unemployment rate stagnates near double digits is a really bad \nidea.\n  Now, let us take a look at the claims that despite more than $650 \nbillion in new taxes in this bill, this big government bill will not \nraise taxes for Americans making less than $200,000 a year, a pledge \nthat President Obama repeatedly mentioned both as a candidate and then \nas our President. Well, the Democratic chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and I commend him for his honesty, in his floor remarks on \nMarch 23, 2010, stated: One other point that I think is very important \nto make is that it is true that in certain cases, the taxes will go up \nfor some Americans who might be making less than $200,000. We have \nknown all along that this pledge is an illusion that will slowly but \ncontinuously disappear over time.\n  A recent analysis by former Congressional Budget Office Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin based on data provided by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation revealed some startling facts on the distributional impact of \nthe Senate-passed bill. Let me share these findings with you:\n  Only 7 percent of Americans would qualify for the new government \nsubsidy to help them pay for mandatory health insurance. 93 percent of \nall Americans will not be eligible for a tax benefit under this bill.\n  Twenty-five percent of Americans earning less than $200,000 a year \nwould see their taxes rise.\n  So what does this all mean? For every one family that receives the \ngovernment subsidy, three middle-class families will pay higher taxes.\n  Simply put, we will continue our march towards the Europeanization of \nAmerica as fewer and fewer Americans continue to bear the burden of \nsupporting the needs of a growing majority.\n  By the way, the figures I just discussed, do not take into account \nall the tax increases in this bill signed by the President yesterday, \nincluding hundreds of billions in new taxes on employers who do not \nprovide coverage to insurance premiums, prescription drugs and medical \ndevices.\n  Representatives from both the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation testified before the Finance Committee that \nthese taxes will be passed on to the consumers. So even though the bill \ntries to hide these taxes as fees, average Americans who purchase \nhealth plans, use prescription drugs and buy medical devices will end \nup footing the bill. Every American knows that there is no such thing \nas a free lunch in this town.\n  Included in the $650 billion of new taxes in this health bill is a \ntax hike of $20 billion on medical devices. Of the few exemptions \nincluded in the reconciliation bill, there is no mention of\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nthe brave men and women in the military and our veterans who have \nsustained injuries defending this country during the wars.\n  My amendment would prevent this new tax from raising costs or hurting \naccess for American soldiers and veterans by exempting medical devices \nused by the TRICARE program and the Veterans health care program. We \nmust protect our wounded warriors who rely on these life-saving and \nlife-enhancing medical devices.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for our brave warriors and support \nthis amendment.\n  Let me tell you, I hope my colleagues on both sides will stand up for \nthe wounded warriors. I hope they will stand up and realize that these \nfolks should not be hammered with higher costs on medical devices. We \nowe them a debt of gratitude not more taxes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to speak in support of Senator Inhofe's \namendment No. 3588, which would be to exclude medical devices for \nchildren and persons with disabilities from a medical device tax.\n  I know that when you talk about a medical device tax and if it is on \nthe manufacturers, you are going to say: Well, what should I be \nconcerned about that for because some manufacturer is going to pay it. \nWell, don't fool yourself. You know, corporations do not pay taxes, \nonly people pay taxes, and there are three categories of people who pay \ntaxes: stockholders or employees or consumers. And I will bet in most \ncases consumers end up paying for that.\n  So this provision in this bill is much broader than the Inhofe \namendment would apply to, but I think Senator Inhofe has picked out a \nvery important aspect of adding taxes, the extent to which surely the \nvulnerable people whom you call children and persons with disabilities \nare consumers who shouldn't be paying for a tax to pay for a bill that \n59 percent of the people in this country say they are against. But \nbecause the majority party and the President want to make history, just \nmake history, don't worry about the people at the grassroots of \nAmerica, what they think.\n  So there are all these taxes and all of these fees in here, and I \ncompliment Senator Inhofe for his leadership in at least trying to \nreduce this burden on people who are very vulnerable, people with \ndisabilities.\n  Of the many taxes in this bill, I am especially worried about the tax \non medical devices. What will happen when the Democrats impose a new \ntax hike on $20 billion of these innovative medical devices? During the \nmarkup of the Finance Committee bill, I asked the question to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation.\n  For people who might not understand the emphasis of ``nonpartisan'' \nabout the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, I would like to say it is very important that you understand \nthat because everybody thinks everything connected with Congress is \ntotally political. Well, these are professionals who are around here a \nlot longer than a lot of Senators and Representatives, and then their \njob is, in a professional way, to look at what things cost and how much \nmoney certain taxes will raise. So they are kind of like God around \nhere. They are believed. If you want to overrule them, you know, it \ntakes 60 votes. That is a lot of power when you have to have 60 votes \nto overrule something on a point of order.\n  So explaining what nonpartisanship is with the Congressional Budget \nOffice and our constituents understanding that so they understand we \nare not quoting a Republican or a Democrat, we are quoting \nprofessionals, I think is very basic to understanding the points we \nindividually make so that they are accepted as intellectually honest.\n  In this particular case where these two offices--both of them said \nthese excise taxes will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher \nprices and higher insurance premiums. When I began my remarks, I said \nthat is what is going to happen. Well, Chuck Grassley said that, but I \nwant you to know that is what these professionals in the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office backed me up \nin saying.\n  Who are the consumers of these devices? I have the exact language \nhere of how these things are going to be passed on to consumers so that \nyou know, you see the document right here.\n  Who are these consumers of these devices who will bear the burden of \nthe new medical device excise tax? I would like to tell the story of \nthe Tillman family, a family who would bear the burden of this new \nmedical device tax.\n  At only 5 months old, Tiana Tillman had her life saved by a medical \ndevice.\n  This story has received a lot of attention because Tiana's father is \na professional football player for the Chicago Bears. However, \nlifesaving stories like this happen all across the country.\n  When Charles Tillman reported to training camp in 2008, it was not \nlong before his coach told him his 5-month-old daughter Tiana had been \nrushed to the hospital. When Charles got to the hospital, Tiana's heart \nrate was over 200 beats per minute. The doctor told Charles and his \nwife Jackie that Tiana may not make it through the night.\n  Tiana survived the night, and after a series of tests, she was \ndiagnosed with cardiomyopathy, that is, an enlarged heart that is \nunable to function properly. Her condition was critical, and without a \nheart transplant, she would not survive. But finding pediatric donors \nis very difficult, and many children do not survive that long wait \ntime.\n  Tiana was immediately put on ECMO, a device that would help the \nfunctions of the heart while Tiana waited for a transplant. However, \nECMO is an old device that has many shortcomings.\n  The Tillmans waited for one of two outcomes: either Tiana would \nreceive the transplant or she would die waiting on ECMO.\n  If you want to know, ECMO is E-C-M-O, an acronym.\n  But then doctors told them about the new pediatric medical device \ncalled the Berlin Heart--the Berlin Heart is an external device that \nperforms the function of the heart and lungs--the Tillmans decided to \nmove forward with the Berlin Heart. After 13 days of being on ECMO \nwithout any movement, Tiana underwent surgery to connect the Berlin \nHeart. After the operation, you can see Tiana in that photo. It pumped \nher blood through her body--a job her heart could not perform on its \nown. Doctors said the Berlin Heart helped Tiana regain her strength \nbecause she was off the paralytic medication and finally moving.\n  Not long after Tiana connected to the Berlin Heart, a donor was found \nand Tiana underwent an 8-hour transplant surgery. The risky surgery was \na success, thank God. Usually it takes some time for a new heart to \nstart working, but doctors said that due to Tiana's strength, her new \nheart started working immediately.\n  So you see here Tiana today. She probably loves that football just \nlike her dad loved the football. She is a happy and healthy 2-year-old \ngirl. She enjoys playing on her swing and watching her dad play \nfootball.\n  Without the Berlin Heart to keep her alive and help her to gain \nstrength, she might not, in fact, be alive. Democrats would increase \ncosts for families such as the Tillmans with this tax, particularly. \nBut it will be relieved somewhat if we adopt the Inhofe amendment. In \nfact, the Democratic bill would tax most pediatric medical devices. I \nwish to make clear that any vote against the Inhofe amendment is an \nendorsement of the tax on devices such as the Berlin Heart and many \nothers children across this country rely upon. Not only that, it would \nalso probably have a great impact upon research that brings about some \nof these miracle medical devices that make a difference. Taking money \naway from research at businesses is going to delay the miracle things \nthat come along, whether they are pharmaceuticals or medical devices.\n  We should not be discouraging that. In the rest of the world, there \nhas not been as much research done in the rest of the world as is done \nin the United States. Maybe go back 50 years ago and you had Germany \nand other European countries very much involved. But their government \ntaking over everything and their high rates of taxation are drying up \nresources used for research. So the United States has been the \nbeneficiary of that. Our pharmaceutical industry and medical device\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nindustry have taken advantage of it. So much new development around the \nworld in the enhancement of these devices as well as pharmaceuticals \nhave come because of the research we do. This tremendous tax burden \nthat the American consumer is going to feel from the massive money \ncoming in to fund this bill, which isn't going to drive down health \ncare costs, is going to stymie a lot of innovation we should not want \nto stymie.\n  May I ask the Chair how many minutes my side has remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will take that 3\\1/2\\ minutes to comment on another \naspect of the bill. This is not on the Inhofe amendment, at this point. \nIt is something unrelated to health care, but in a sense it is related \nto health care. This is the nationalization of the student loan \nprogram. For a long time, colleges on behalf of their students have had \nthe benefit of going with a direct student loan from the government or \ngetting it through the banks. They have voted by their feet, by the \noverwhelming amount of them going to the banks to get their student \nloans. Now this reconciliation is going to nationalize student loans, \nhave just direct loans. There are about 31,000 people around the \ncountry who have something to do with student loans. Those people are \ngoing to be out of work at a time when we are all talking about jobs. \nWe need to do something for jobs. So we're going to nationalize \neducation loans and have that unemployment and then take four call \ncenters around the country to take its place. Do you think college \nstudents are going to get the service they get when they have to deal \nwith the Federal bureaucracy redtape? I don't believe so. But there's \nsupposedly a certain amount of savings in this. I don't know whether it \nis real savings, but the CBO, which I say is God around here, scored it \nas a certain amount of savings, even considering the fact that the \ngovernment is going to have to borrow $\\1/2\\ trillion to get this \nprogram underway. They are going to use those supposed savings from the \nstudent loan program to fund this bill, the health care bill.\n  We are in a situation that is just something that common sense \nAmericans in the Midwest are not going to understand. But it is \nsomething, I suppose, you would expect to happen in Washington, DC, \nwhich is an island surrounded by reality, that you are going to have \ncollege students who are going to pay 6.75 percent interest on their \nloans to the Federal Government that the government only pays 2.75 \npercent to borrow, that you are going to be taxing college students to \npay for health care. It doesn't add up, at the very same time that too \nmany of us in this body are complaining about the increased cost of \neducation.\n  I hope the college students will speak up in this particular instance \nabout what is being done, that college students should not be taxed to \nprovide health insurance. But this whole health care bill taxes \neverything. It just seems like everything.\n  How many minutes are remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus for his \nleadership on this health care reform effort that is underway.\n  This is the most astounding thing. For all these weeks, our friends \non the other side have said no, no, no to health care. Not one good \nword. Not one of them stood and said: Yes, we should cover 32 million \npeople who don't have coverage; yes, we should cover young people who \nwant to join their parents' health insurance policy. They said no to \nsmall businesses that need help in providing affordable health coverage \nto their employees.\n  Many know that recently I was stricken with an illness. Five weeks \nago this time, I was in an ambulance on my way to the hospital, \nbleeding profusely, very sick. I was lucky. I had health care coverage. \nThe doctors were there waiting for me. They were there to give me \ntransfusions. They were there to give me intravenous fluids. They were \nthere to care for me. I had nursing care, and I came through a crisis, \nas my children stood by, my four children stood by with their fingers \ncrossed, pleading for my health to return. It was because I had health \ncare coverage that I am standing here today on my way to a full cure--\nless hair but still willing to fight the fight for the people I \nrepresent, for the people across this country who are being denied \ncoverage in any way they can do it.\n  What we see is obstructionism at its worst. I have yet to hear them \nsay: Let our conscience come out here and say we ought to cover these \npeople, that we ought to make sure health care is affordable.\n  The night I was brought into the hospital and was so fortunate enough \nto have the health care coverage I had, during the days of recovery I \nthought: What would happen if I was 40 years younger, had two or three \nkids, had no health care coverage, and I came in, in this kind of \ncritical condition? The chances of my walking out of that hospital \nwould have been very low.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side, they are not bad people, \nthey are just totally wrong. They don't want to say that a young person \ncan join their family's affordable health care insurance. They don't \nwant to encourage people to find insurance that is affordable through \nthe exchanges that are provided. They don't want to permit people who \nare there without coverage, who would force their way into an emergency \nroom, perhaps, and say: Look, I am very ill. I have no pep. I feel \nterrible. Take care of me. Yes? Take a number like you do in a \nsupermarket. You are No. 32. We will get to you. Don't worry about it.\n  Well, I worry about it because I know a different kind of America. I \nknow an America that was there for me when I needed an education. I \nknow an America that is there for people. I get letters from them all \nthe time that say thank you for helping us to be able to afford a \nbetter education. Thank you for the things you can do.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side: Open up. Tell the truth. If \nyou don't want to give those people affordable coverage, then throw in \nthe coverage you have. Throw in your policy. When you say no to the 32 \nmillion people, say: I mean it when I say no. I am giving up my \ncoverage similar to those people out there. Tell the truth about how \nyou feel about the people who stand there without coverage, worrying \nevery day whether an illness is going to rob them of their jobs, of \ntheir opportunity to perform their parental duties or any duties. That \nis what ought to happen. Stand. Vote no, vote no against anything that \nimproves or might improve this insurance and say: No, I mean it when I \nsay no. I mean it. I am willing to give up the coverage I and my family \nhave.\n  I am talking to the Senators on the other side. Say no and mean no. \nBut mean it for yourselves as well as the people outside who are \nbegging for the coverage.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New Jersey. I \nam reminded how he led the fight years ago to stop cigarette smoking in \nairlines. I was so pleased when he did that. I know many millions of \nAmericans who are still pleased. It was he who did it.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, a big leader in health \ncare reform. He has been working health care reform as long as I can \nremember. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves the floor, let me echo the praise for our \nfriend from New Jersey, who has prosecuted the case against cigarettes \nfor so many years. We are thankful to him. What a strong advocate he \nis.\n  I thank the chairman as well for all his efforts. I wish to highlight \na couple provisions he and I worked on together that speak to the \nheadlines we are seeing in this morning's newspaper; in particular, the \nprovision he and I partnered on that allows States to innovate and take \ntheir own fresh approaches in terms of addressing health care \nchallenges. We all read today about how roughly a dozen States are\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nalready challenging the important, recently-signed health care law on \nthe grounds that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. He and I \nworked very closely together to ensure that States could have a waiver \nto, in effect, go out and set up their own approach. In fact, counsel \nto the Senate Finance Committee specifically said, in response to our \nquestions during the markup of health reform, that if a State could \nmeet the general framework of our legislation, it did not have to do it \nwith an individual mandate.\n  I thank the chairman for stepping up and empowering the States. I \nwant the country to know that under the legislation Chairman Baucus \nworked on with me, every State does not have to litigate. They can \ninnovate. They can go out and look at fresh approaches to address our \nhealth care challenges. That would include doing health reform without \nan individual mandate. I have followed the discussion on the floor over \nthe last couple days about how somehow reform would Europeanize the \nhealth care system. On the contrary, what Chairman Baucus has done, \nwith Section 1332 of the health reform bill, similar to what I sought \nto do in the legislation I drafted that had bipartisan support, is to \nsend a message to all the States all across the country that we invite \nthem to come up with the kind of fresh, creative ideas that are going \nto help us hold health care costs down. In fact, the chairman and I \nspent a lot of time trying to make sure States could tailor their own \nhealth insurance exchanges, which would be fresh marketplaces, so that, \nfor example, an approach in Montana or Oregon that folks there thought \nmade sense, could be entirely different than a strategy New York would \ntry on its own. Not only is section 1332 a provision that allows for \nState innovation, but, as the chairman knows, there is also another \napproach that our colleague Senator Cantwell came up with that advances \nsimilar State innovation, allowing States to set up a basic health care \nplan.\n\n  So my message to these States talking about litigating right now is, \nwhy would you say at this point you are going to go out and go to court \nand sue everybody in sight when, in fact, what the President signed \nyesterday gives the States the authority to come up with their own \napproach? Senate Finance Committee counsel is on record as saying that \nStates could pursue their own approach without an individual mandate. I \nhope--given the amount of attention that is being paid this afternoon \nto the question of States filing these lawsuits, alleging the law is \nunconstitutional because of the individual mandate--I hope some of \nthose States will take a look at section 1332 that, in my view, ought \nto be attractive to elected officials all across the political spectrum \nwho share the view Chairman Baucus and I share; which is, we would like \nto empower the States.\n  Another area where innovation is encouraged to occur is the Medicare \nAdvantage provision in our legislation. We have had a lot of discussion \non the floor about Medicare Advantage. Having been involved with this \nprogram for a number of years, and its predecessors during the days \nwhen I was codirector of the Gray Panthers, I wish to offer up to \ncolleagues that not all Medicare Advantage is created equal. Two years \nago, we heard testimony in the Senate Finance Committee about some \nMedicare Advantage products that, as far as I am concerned, are so \nshoddy and so devoid of consumer protection the people who sold them \nought to be in jail. We have taken steps to add consumer protection to \nthe Medicare Advantage Program.\n  On the other hand, there are very good Medicare Advantage Programs in \nour part of the country that have been able to win recognition from the \nFederal Government as high quality plans. In fact, under this \nlegislation, plans that have earned a high quality rating from the \nFederal Government on the basis of, for example, how they manage \nchronic conditions, the kinds of screenings they do of a preventive \nnature, and their responsiveness to member complaints, when they get a \nhigh rating from the Federal Government on the basis of such criteria \nand earn those extra stars, they will get bonus payments. This was an \nidea the Chairman worked closely with me on when the legislation was \nadvanced by the Finance Committee.\n  We will probably have further discussions on the floor about Medicare \nAdvantage, but I only come to the floor today to say--for those who are \ninterested in promoting quality; for those who believe that no matter \nhow much you do to contain costs, you also have to beef up quality--\ntake a look at the work that was done with respect to Medicare \nAdvantage. It acknowledges that not all Medicare Advantage is created \nequal.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Presiding Officer in the Senate, who has just joined \nus, knows that our home State has the largest percentage of folks in \nMedicare Advantage than any other State in the United States: over 40 \npercent. They happen to be in good plans with those high ratings I \nmentioned from the Federal Government. So clearly, our States with high \nquality are going to be appreciative of this. But so will all the other \nprograms across the land that have similar ratings, and we will have \ncreated an incentive for all of those other Medicare Advantage Programs \nin the years ahead to meet our standards.\n  I come to the floor briefly this afternoon to point out these two \nprovisions in the bill that promote quality and innovation. First, I \nhope States will use the provision that creates incentives for them to \ninnovate. Our message ought to be innovate rather than litigate. I hope \nattorneys general will remember that in the days and weeks ahead.\n  Second, I hope colleagues will look at the new incentives in this \nlegislation to promote quality in the Medicare Advantage program and \nbeyond because I believe those two provisions in this legislation--that \nencourage State innovation, that promote quality in the Medicare \nProgram--ought to be widely supported by colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle in the days ahead.\n  That is, in my view, the kind of approach that can bring the American \npeople together and help us implement this law in a fashion that is in \nline with what Americans want: good quality, affordable care, and \nreform that works for them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this time and particularly for your \nhelp on those two provisions that I think ought to appeal to both \nRepublicans and Democrats in the days ahead.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I inquire, Mr. President, how much time remains on \nthis side for this block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes--5 minutes--to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Mr. President. I say thank you to the Senator \nfrom Montana for his generosity. I will not take 10 minutes. I know the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is here.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today for the millions of Coloradans and \nAmerican families who are sick and tired of the name calling, the \nbickering, and the partisanship in Washington.\n  I am here today for over 800,000 uninsured Coloradans who will now \nhave a fighting chance to get the health care they need.\n  I am here for the 1.2 million Coloradan children who will never again \nbe at risk of being denied coverage because they have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  I am here for the 70,000 small businesses that will get a tax cut to \nprovide health insurance, so they do not have to make the terrible \nchoice between providing health care coverage for their employees and \nkeeping their doors open.\n  I am here for the hundreds of thousands of seniors who depend on \nMedicare and expect us to protect and preserve it for generations to \ncome.\n  We have passed a bill that makes our country more competitive, ends \ninsurance company abuses, gives people more coverage, and starts \nputting our country on a more sound fiscal footing for the next 20 \nyears.\n  I join those on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the \naisle who have said this is not a perfect piece of legislation. No \npiece of legislation is perfect. But it is a great first step for the \nreasons I said.\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has confirmed a $143 \nbillion reduction in the Federal deficit over 10 years, as a \nconsequence of our passing this legislation, and a $1.2 trillion \nreduction in the first 20 years.\n  Now we need to pass this reconciliation bill--a bill that gets rid of \nthe special deals I spoke out against at the end of the year, a bill \nthat makes sure our seniors can afford the prescription drugs they \nneed, a bill that covers more people in my State of Colorado.\n  But the insurance companies and the special interests have not given \nup. The defenders of the status quo are still at it. Put simply, to \namend the bill is to kill this bill. The only reason we are going \nthrough this process is because opponents of health care reform want to \nkill the bill. Now is not the time to play games with the lives of \nthousands of Coloradans and millions of Americans, and I will not do \nit.\n  There are also some who are well intentioned and want to amend this \nbill to include a public option. I am and have been a strong proponent \nof a public option and, like a lot of people, have taken a lot of heat \nfor it. I am not sure why because everywhere I went in Colorado people \nsaid to me: Michael, if you are going to require us to have insurance, \nwe want as many choices as possible for our family. Please don't force \nus into this private insurance if there are other options out there.\n\n  A lot of us did all we could to convince the House to include it in \nthis bill, and we were disappointed when they did not. We are going to \ncontinue to fight for it until we get a vote. We will have our vote on \na public option. But I will not risk the well-being of Coloradans to do \nit, and I will not play into the hands of those who want to kill the \nbill.\n  So today I stand with many of my colleagues, with the American \nDiabetes Association, the American Hospice Foundation, the Autism \nSociety, Doctors for America, Easter Seals, and the National Alliance \non Mental Illness, along with over 150 organizations that want us to \npass this bill as well. I stand with AARP which knows that changing \nthis bill now will put seniors at risk.\n  But more important than all of that, I stand with the people of \nColorado who expect more from their government and who want more for \ntheir children and grandchildren than politics and name calling.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to pass reconciliation and send this bill \nto the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak \nabout health care. I commend our chairman, Senator Baucus, for his \ngreat leadership in the Finance Committee and on so many other \nimportant issues we have been wrestling with with regard to health \ncare.\n  We have had a chance over many months now--and even as we speak \ntoday--to talk about a lot of the policy of the bill the President \nsigned into law, our health care bill we passed here in the Senate, \nand, of course, the policy contained in the bill we are considering \nnow. But sometimes it is important for us to step back and talk about \nsome--not all--but a few examples of some of the real people out there \non whom this legislation will have an impact.\n  I have spoken a number of times about Trisha Urban from Berks County, \nPA--all the problems she and her family had with their health care: \ndenied coverage because of a preexisting condition, running into \nproblems when the insurance company dropped coverage. Her husband died \nin the process. And the same day he died, her daughter was born. I have \ntold that story a number of times, and I will tell it again.\n  I also want to highlight what has happened to another family, the \nRitter family from Manheim, PA, Lancaster County. The family has two \nyoung girls whom I have met. I met them in 2009. As children, these two \nlittle girls, Hannah and Madeline Ritter, hit their lifetime cap on \ntheir cancer treatment before they completed their course of treatment. \nWhen they hit this cap, they were 4 years old, these two Ritter twins. \nIf that is not proof that comprehensive health reform is needed now, I \ndo not know what more we can say.\n  We are very happy the President signed into law the bill we passed in \nDecember. Now the health care reform is the law of the land. The Ritter \ntwins--Hannah and Madeline Ritter--will not have to worry about how to \nget or keep health insurance coverage throughout their lives because, \nin 2010, strong consumer protections will go into effect. Not only will \nthese protections ensure that these two little girls--Hannah and \nMadeline--not only will it ensure they can have access to the medical \ncare they need to grow up healthy, but also they will be able to reap \nthe benefits of other parts of this bill.\n  This bill will also help hard-working insured Americans from having \nto declare bankruptcy due to medical bills, as the Ritter family of \nManheim, PA, had to do at one point. I do not have the time in this \nsegment to be able to tell their whole story, but suffice it to say, in \naddition to the nightmare their daughters lived through, the family had \nto declare bankruptcy.\n  But some highlights of what this bill means to real families: Health \ninsurance reform puts American families and small business owners--not \ntheir insurance companies--in control of their own health care.\n  Secondly, this bill makes health insurance affordable for middle-\nclass families and small businesses--one of the largest tax cuts in \nhistory--reducing premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n  Third, it holds insurance companies accountable, at long last, to \nkeep premiums down and prevent denial of care and coverage, including \nfor preexisting conditions.\n  No. 4, this legislation improves Medicare benefits with lower \nprescription drug costs for those in the doughnut hole, better chronic \ncare, free prevention care, and nearly a decade more of solvency for \nMedicare.\n  Finally, No. 5--and this is not a comprehensive summary but one more \npoint--this legislation reduces the deficit, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, by $143 billion over the next 10 years. If \nyou look at the 10 years after that, 20 years in total, it is well over \n$1 trillion.\n  So this is a bill, and this is legislation, whose time has come. At a \ntime when our State--in Pennsylvania, where we have 577,000 people out \nof work, almost a record number of people out of work in Pennsylvania--\nwe have to make sure that one of the things we put in place is a more \nsecure health care system for workers and their families.\n  We all have heard the list of provisions that will go into effect \nright away. Small businesses will have access to--have the eligibility, \nI should say--for tax credits. Some companies will get credits up to 35 \npercent of the dollars they spend on premiums. The Federal Government \nwill be investing in community health centers even in greater amounts \nthan the Federal Government does now. Older citizens would not be \naffected by the doughnut hole problem where they have to pay the whole \nfreight for prescription drug costs for several thousands of dollars' \nworth of care. They are going to get relief from that. In 3 months' \ntime--3 months from yesterday--people with preexisting conditions will \nbe able to get help from a high-risk pool, a special fund to help them \nin that crisis.\n  As we know, in 6 months--in September--children will have the full \nlegal protection in new insurance plans for denials of coverage--or I \nshould say against denials of coverage--for a preexisting condition.\n  So for all of those reasons and more, whether we are thinking about \nthe problem that Trisha Urban and her family had before and certainly \nafter her husband's death, or the Ritter twins, Hannah and Madeline \nRitter, we hope more families have the benefit of the protections in \nthis bill. We know one thing. We know small businesses across the \ncountry are starting to get a sense now of what this will mean in terms \nof helping them with the tax credit, helping their employees with the \ncritically important issue of health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Tennessee is \nhere and ready to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I might meditate for about 60 seconds and \nstep back up. I now notice the absence of a quorum, unless I should \ngive it to the other side.\n  Mr. GREGG. No. If the Senator is not ready to speak, I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Tennessee is going to offer an amendment \nin a second, and I will follow him with an amendment. I wish to \nhighlight what my amendment will do as we are waiting.\n  One of the extraordinary shell games that is played under this bill \nin the ``Alice in Wonderland'' claim that this bill is paid for is the \nfact that the doctors will receive a $285 billion cut in their \nreimbursements if this bill goes forward in its present form. We all \nknow that is not going to happen. So at some point there is going to \nhave to be a doctors fix, which means $285 billion not accounted for in \nthis bill will have to be spent over the next 10 years. Of course, if \nthey had included this in the bill--this fact that doctors are being \nunderreimbursed and that we are going to correct this; this is called \nthe doctor fix, and we do it every year on an annual basis--if they had \nincluded it in the bill, as they should have because this is, after \nall, called health care reform, then the bill would have been in \ndeficit even under the gamesmanship played by the Democratic Party on \nthis bill.\n  Remember, the way they got a surplus in this bill in the first 10 \nyears was they took 10 years of spending cuts, 10 years of revenues, \nand matched them against 6 years--6 years--of programmatic \nexpenditures. So they were able to get a surplus, and CBO has to score \nwhat is given to them. If you are given phony ideas, you have to score \nthem. In any event, what CBO was not asked to score as part of this \nhealth care, because there was no attempt to correct it, and even \nthough it is the essence of health care, is how do you correct the \nreimbursed doctors.\n  So after the Senator from Tennessee proceeds, and I think he may be \nready to proceed at this time, I am going to offer an amendment for a \ndoctors fix so that this bill will address that issue which is, \nobviously, one of the core issues on the question of health care reform \naround here.\n  So I will reserve now on that issue and turn to the Senator from \nTennessee who I see is ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire who I think has offered extraordinary leadership on this \nissue and on the issues regarding our country's huge amount of \nindebtedness. As does Senator Gregg, I find it hard to believe that we \nare taking over $500 billion in savings from Medicare, as he just \nmentioned, to leverage a new entitlement when we know that Medicare \nitself has a $37 trillion unfunded liability. As he mentioned, we go \nfurther by not even dealing with this doc fix which he was just \ndiscussing.\n  I look forward to his amendment, I look forward to supporting it, and \nI thank him for his leadership.\n  I wish to speak today about unfunded liabilities. I was the mayor of \na city. I know the Presiding Officer served in the general assembly in \nthe State from where he comes. I was the commissioner of finance for \nour State where we dealt with all of our financial issues for the State \nof Tennessee. I know Senator Gregg was a Governor.\n  One of the things that I think bothered all of us who used to serve \nat the city and State levels was unfunded mandates. It is an incredible \nthing where Washington will pass a piece of legislation and, by the \nway, have a major signing ceremony where everybody is patting each \nother on the back and celebrating that they just passed something, and \nthe part that is left out is that the States across this country are \nleft with a huge unfunded mandate.\n  We have a very good Governor in our State. His name is Phil Bredesen. \nHe is a Democrat. He has spent a lifetime in health care. He has \nhandled our State's finances very well. He called me on Friday with a \nsense of tremendous concern in his voice talking about the fact that \nthis bill was going to cause the State of Tennessee, which is already \nexperiencing huge tuition increases--we have all kinds of services \nthere that we are having difficulties dealing with--and this bill is \ngoing to create a $1.1 billion unfunded liability for the State of \nTennessee. I just find it hard to believe that, again, knowing the \nstress our States around this country are dealing with, we are passing \nlegislation that puts in place a $1.1 billion unfunded mandate on the \nState of Tennessee.\n  But let me go a step further. This bill also violates something we \nthought was sacrosanct around here and that was the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act, which basically said that we acknowledge--most of us have \ncome from other places, served in local and State governments, and we \nacknowledge that we should not be passing legislation that creates \nunfunded mandates. We shouldn't be patting ourselves on the back, \npassing legislation that we say is good for the people back home, and \nthen sending the tab there.\n  So this bill violates that. I think everybody in this body knows it \nviolates that. So it is just kind of, yes, we said we didn't want to \ndeal inappropriately with States, but we decided we wanted to pass \nhealth care reform, and we are going to do it.\n  Let me come to the one that I find most fascinating. Senator Gregg \nwas just talking about the fact that we have this 21-percent cut coming \nfor physicians who treat Medicare recipients, and instead of taking the \nMedicare savings that we found in this bill and using that to make sure \nthese physicians are paid, we are not going to do that. So in a short \ntime, without us taking, again, emergency action--$200 billion or so--\nthese physicians are going to have a cut.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what we are doing in this bill, and I think \nthe Presiding Officer may already know this, but in addition to \ncreating in our State a $1.1 billion unfunded mandate, we are going to \npay physicians who treat Medicaid recipients at the same level as, if \nyou are a primary care physician, as Medicare reimbursements are today, \nbut we are going to do that for 2 years.\n  Now, this is like the worst joke ever that we can play on our States. \nWhat we are saying is, we are going to mandate to the States that the \nprimary care physicians who treat Medicaid recipients, their rate has \nto be jacked up, and we are going to provide the money for that for 2 \nyears, but then that drops off. So not only do we have this issue of \nthe unfunded mandate, we are creating that exact cliff issue for States \nin this bill, which means that after this 2-year period ends--after \nthis 2-year period ends and we have given them the money to pay these \nphysicians at Medicare rates instead of Medicaid, which is much lower--\nwe are going to cut off the funding.\n  So the State is going to be in the position, obviously, of having to \nkeep that up. It is like the worst joke ever.\n  I don't know how we can come up with legislation such as this and \ncall it reform. I said this before. Half the people who are going to be \nreceiving health insurance after this bill passes are going on a \nMedicaid Program.\n\n  There was a bill in the Senate that Senators Wyden and Bennett worked \non together. It had some flaws. It would have been an interesting \nstarting place, though, and that bill did away with Medicaid and caused \nMedicaid recipients to have the same kind of health care that you and I \nhave. What we have done in this bill instead of that--instead of \nfocusing on cost--we are going to put half of the new recipients in a \nprogram that none of us--none of us--would want to be in, and we are \ncalling that health care reform.\n  So I do plan later to offer an amendment to deal with this issue of \nunfunded mandates. I think it is wrong for us as a country to have \npeople in Federal office who push their desires off on people and then \ncall them to pick up the tab. I was a mayor. I was a commissioner of \nfinance. The Presiding Officer served in the general assembly. Senator \nGregg served as a Governor.\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\nWe know that is wrong. I don't know why we are doing it. I plan to \noffer an amendment to correct it.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3651\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The States don't have the elasticity the Federal \nGovernment has, which we will not have much longer, by the way, as a \nresult of passing this bill specifically because our debt is growing so \nfast that it is going to be very hard for us 5 or 6 years from now to \nbe able to sell our debt at a reasonable price, in my opinion, and we \nare going to find that maybe some people don't even want to buy our \ndebt.\n  There was a very significant event this week when it was determined \nthat the debt issued by Warren Buffett was going out at a lower cost \nthan the debt issued by the United States of America. That is the first \ntime that anybody can remember something like that, and that is a very \nclear statement by the markets that they are getting very worried about \nhow much deficit and debt this government is running up.\n  Now we pass this bill which adds $2.6 trillion to the spending of the \nU.S. Government and alleges it is paid for, but we know it is not going \nto be, and creates new entitlement programs which we know would not be \nfully funded. Even if it were paid for, it takes resources which should \nbe used to reduce the debt, especially in the area of making Medicare \nmore solvent, and uses them to expand new programs.\n  This event, as I have described it, is an astroid of debt headed at \nour country. The simple fact is, it is going to have an effect. The \neffect will be that we will have more difficulty selling our debt, the \ndeficits and debt we pass on to our children will be extraordinary, and \ntheir ability to have a higher standard of living will be reduced as a \nresult of that.\n  But the point, of course, is this bill, on top of all of the other \negregious things it does in the area of fiscal policy--of running up \ndebt and creating a massive government that we can't afford, being \nintrusive in everybody's health care delivery system, undermining the \nability of small businesses to offer insurance, raising premiums, \nraising taxes on people not only earning more than $200,000 but earning \nless than $200,000, replete with special deals--on top of all of that, \nthis bill, as Senator Corker said, puts pressure on the States and \nlocal communities.\n  It asks them to spend money which they did not want to spend and \nwhich is not reimbursed. That is not fair. It is called unfunded \nmandates. It is inappropriate. We actually have a law around here that \nthis bill basically runs over that says we will not do that.\n  As I said earlier, another thing this bill does, which I find \nextraordinary, is it does not address one of the elephants in the room \nrelative to the cost of health care in this country, which is the fact \nthat we are not adequately reimbursing our doctors; that our doctors \nare going to receive a $285 billion cut over the next 10 years, a $65 \nbillion cut over the next 3 years unless we correct that. This is from \nbasically a freeze level of reimbursement.\n  Every year we adjust that payment so doctors do get their money they \ndeserve or at least some portion of it in that we do not keep up with \ninflation. But this bill, which is supposed to be a comprehensive \nresolution of health care, leaves the doctors out in the cold. It means \nevery year they are going to have to come hat in hand, one more time, \nasking for something they should not have to ask for, which is a fair \nreimbursement for their services.\n  We will every year, hopefully, address it. But it is not right that \nwe have a bill that does not even account for that.\n  Why was it not put in? It was not put in because if it had been put \nin, this bill could not meet the budgetary rules that give it the \nspecial protection that allows it to come to the floor of the Senate, \nand it would have been in deficit, at least over the first 10 years, by \n$100 billion, even using the gamesmanship scoring the other side of the \naisle has used relative to the big bill.\n  This is not fair to the doctors. The doctors deserve better than \nthis. We should correct this right now as part of this process. This \ntrailer bill has the title ``fix-it bill'' on it. One thing we should \ndefinitely fix is the fact the doctors are getting shortchanged. So \nlet's fix it. That is what my amendment does.\n  My amendment says: OK, this bill alleges it generates a surplus. \nLet's use part of that surplus to make the doctors whole for the next 3 \nyears. It is a paid-for amendment. I cannot imagine anybody would want \nto oppose this amendment. After all, after we complete this bill--\nimmediately after we complete this bill--we are going to do, I believe \nit is a 1-month extension to try to correct the doctor problem. How \ninconsistent, how fundamentally hypocritical is it for us to pass a \nmajor health care reform bill, and then in the next breath--literally \nthe next breath--within the next 24 hours, this body will take up a \nbill to give a 1-month extension to the doctors fix. I think it is 1 \nmonth. That is not right. Let's do it now. Let's do it in this bill. \nLet's do the doctors fix. I have come up with a proposal that will take \ncare of the doctors in a fair and forthright manner for 3 years.\n  That is my amendment. I am not sure if it is at the desk or whether I \nhave to send it to the desk.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3651.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a long-term fix to the Medicare sustainable \n      growth rate formula in order to improve access for Medicare \n                             beneficiaries)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASE IN THE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT UPDATE \n                   FOR THE LAST 9 MONTHS OF 2010 AND ALL OF 2011 \n                   THROUGH 2013.\n\n       Paragraph (1) of section 1848(d) of the Social Security \n     Act, as added by section 1011(a) of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-118) and as amended \n     by section 5 of the Temporary Extension Act of 2010 (Public \n     Law 111-144), is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(10) Update for 2010 through 2013.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (7)(B), (8)(B), \n     and (9)(B), in lieu of the update to the single conversion \n     factor established in paragraph (1)(C) that would otherwise \n     apply for each of 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the update to \n     the single conversion factor shall be 0 percent for such \n     years.\n       ``(B) No effect on computation of conversion factor for \n     2014 and subsequent years.--The conversion factor under this \n     subsection shall be computed under paragraph (1)(A) for 2014 \n     and subsequent years as if subparagraph (A) had never \n     applied.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me summarize it again. We know the \ndoctors are being shortchanged. They deserve fair treatment. It is \npretty obvious that if we are going to do a health care reform bill, \nthe proper place to correct the doctor issue of reimbursement is in \nthat bill, not the next day in a short-term extension.\n  This is a forthright and fully paid-for attempt--and if it is passed \nit will occur--to reimburse the doctors at a fair rate for the next 3 \nyears and correct what is known as the SGR problem relative to doctor \nreimbursement.\n  I cannot understand why we would not want to do something such as \nthis.\n  I see the Senator from North Carolina. I will be happy to yield to \nhim for any thoughts he may have on this amendment or the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to reiterate the fact that this \nshould be part of health care reform. It is not. It is shocking that we \nwould have something of this magnitude that is not fixed in a reform \nbill. We have an opportunity in a bill that has now come before us, \nwhich is to fix the things they missed in the health care bill, to \nprovide a 3-year comfort on the part of physicians around the country \nthat their reimbursements are not going to\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nbe cut. They are targeted for 21 percent. It expires March 31. There is \nnot a more appropriate time than right now.\n  What a lot of us have said is: Let's pay for it. Let's simply pay for \nit. Enough is enough on spending money we do not have. Here is an \nexcellent opportunity, where we have savings from the health care \nreform bill that we can now pump back in to pay for the fix to the \nsustainable growth rate about which the doctors have been under the \ngun.\n  We have extended it every 30 days for some time without paying for \nit. Here is a real opportunity in a bill that is designed specifically \nto fix things that were missed in the health care bill.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Gregg, for understanding the importance \nof this issue and working up an amendment but, more importantly, saying \nto every physician in America: We can finally fix this, we can do it \nwith money that is paid for and, more importantly, we can take you out \nof the box of this horror story of wondering what your reimbursement \nfor services is going to be at any given point in time in the future.\n  Let's seize this opportunity in this bill and fix this sustainable \ngrowth rate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what needs to be fixed in this bill is a \nwhole lot more than that, but this is a great attempt to try to solve a \nproblem.\n  Let me describe a scenario, what is getting ready to happen. Every \nState is cutting Medicaid reimbursement. We are going to add 16 million \npeople to Medicaid. We cannot get them all seen now. Then we have a \ndoctor cut that is coming to 21 percent for people who are under \nMedicare. What is going to happen? What do you think the average \nphysician in this country is going to do? I can tell you that they are \ngoing to do three things: Fewer will see Medicaid patients so there \nwill be fewer doctors taking Medicaid at the time we increase the \nenrollment by 50 percent. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, fewer doctors are going to take Medicare as we have this \nballooning increase of baby boomers going into Medicare.\n  No. 3--and this is probably more important than anything--we are \ngoing to see a large percentage of doctors, with this bill passed with \nno continuity as to how they are ever going to get funded under \nMedicare, quit. They are going to quit. They can take their training, \ntheir effort, their education and knowledge and apply it in some other \nfield of endeavor and not have to live with the hassle of a 21-percent \ncut hanging over their head.\n  Even if we fix it for 3 years, 3 years from now the same problem is \ngoing to come up, except it is going to be worse. So there is no fix in \nit. There is an unrecognized $300 billion to get doctors even, let \nalone take away the cut--no increase--with this amendment. My hope \nwould be we would fix this situation for 3 years.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be able to \nparticipate in a colloquy on our side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwho is obviously a physician and has an indepth knowledge of this \nissue, I heard the other side of the aisle say: There are no cuts to \nthe benefits of people on Medicare. If you reduce doctor payments under \nMedicare 21 percent, don't you think that is going to affect what they \nreceive? Technically, there will be no cut because they will still have \nthe right to see a doctor. Is it not going to be hard to see a doctor \nbecause doctors will stop seeing them?\n  Mr. COBURN. They are not going to find a doctor, and that is the \nwhole problem. Whatever we see in the urban areas now, multiply it \ntenfold in the rural areas. We are going to increase eligibility for \nMedicaid to 133 percent of the poverty level, we are going to add 16 \nmillion people to a system that is not handling the people who are in \nit today, so we are going to promise them: Here is your Medicaid.\n  Now where is the care? It is not going to be there. There is not the \navailable physicians in this country to care for 16 million new \nMedicaid patients.\n  If we, in fact, do not fix long term the SGR, physicians are going to \ndo one of two things. They are either going to completely quit seeing \nMedicaid and Medicare patients or they are going to retire. Quite \nfrankly, physicians my age who are still practicing are not doing it \nfor the money; they are doing it because they love the patients. But \nthey are going to be forced to quit because they will not even be able \nto pay their overhead to care for those patients.\n  Mr. BURR. If I may add to Dr. Coburn's comments and say, when you \ndouble the size of the Medicaid population, you are already forcing \nmore doctors to say: I am not going to see Medicaid patients. But you \nare changing the payer mix. Every provider, every practice, every \nhospital is going to see more patients whose reimbursement is less. \nThat is automatically going to affect Medicare right there because \npeople are going to have to try to bring in more private pay, private \ninsurance.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. BURR. Absolutely.\n  Mr. COBURN. What it is going to do is exacerbate the cost shifting \ngoing on with Medicare and Medicaid right now, which means insurance \nrates for everybody else in the country are going to go up.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thought we were told insurance rates were not going to \ngo up.\n  Mr. COBURN. All I will tell you is, the best guess of CBO--wonderful \npeople, but they can only make decisions within the parameters they are \ngiven. There is no question private insurance, individual and family \ninsurance, is going to go up, but everybody else's is because we are \ngoing to increase the trend of cost shifting from government programs \nto the private sector.\n  You are going to end up with three taxes. You will pay income taxes, \nyou will pay a Medicare tax, and then you will pay a tax on your \ninsurance--actually, you will pay four--and then you are going to pay \nhigher health insurance premiums because the government does not cover \nthe cost.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I assume that is not just going to be people with incomes \nover $200,000.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is everybody in this country who has private \ninsurance, either through their employer or the individual market.\n  Mr. GREGG. Isn't it equally likely that a large number of small \nemployers will get frustrated with the rate increases they are getting \nin order to support people on Medicaid that they will simply drop that \nand push their membership, their employees over into this new exchange?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, they will pay the fee. They will pay the tax and say \nit is easier. Consequently, the young people in our country, because we \ndo not have a big enough payment under the ``individual mandate,'' are \ngoing to say it is smarter for me to save my money, pay the fine, and \nnot get insurance because when I get sick, I can get it. You are going \nto get what is called adverse selection, which is even going to drive \nthe rates up further. Anybody 40 or older, watch out, your health \ninsurance rates are getting ready to bloom.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have basically a multiplier effect----\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. In the area of costs being driven up as a result of this \nnew policy of adding a huge number of people to an uninsured system \nthat cannot afford it right now, Medicaid. The costs are going to \nmultiply on people in the private sector. The effect will be higher \npremiums, less opportunity for your employer to give you insurance and, \nin the end, a higher tax rate for you, Americans who are just working \nAmericans, not people with high incomes.\n  Mr. COBURN. And people who are not necessarily getting a subsidy.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then they do not even take care of the doctors. They cut \nthe doctors 21 percent on top of all this.\n  Mr. COBURN. What happens to all this? What is the ultimate? The \nultimate is failure of the insurance market.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is the goal, isn't it?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is the goal, so the government can control it all. I \nyield back.\n  Mr. BURR. Let me add, if I may, to my good friend, Senator Gregg, \neven though some would choose not to have coverage and pay the fine, we \nhave an\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nemergency room system that is obligated to see those individuals when \nthey have traumatic care. For those who claim we have sorted out the \nsystem where the high-cost delivery of care does not exist, no, we have \nagain exacerbated the problem.\n  I think Senator Coburn hit on the key. As you try to handle the \nhealth care of individuals by limiting the reimbursement, whether that \nis the way we are limited in the problem you are trying to fix, whether \nwe do it by shoving them into Medicaid, you have now cost shifted more \nmoney to the side causing greater inflation for the health care in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely right. Isn't it true one of the \nultimate cost shifts is to claim that the health care bill is fiscally \nresponsible when it ignores the fact that the doctors are being cut by \n21 percent and does not even attempt to address that huge problem which \nrepresents $65 billion over 3 years?\n  Mr. BURR. I have learned throughout this whole process to never try \nto figure out what promises have been made. But I know the promise we \nhave made to physicians--to reimburse them fairly for the services they \nprovide--and anything less than that jeopardizes the pool of health \ncare professionals we have and eventually will affect the quality of \ncare simply because if the pool is not big enough to handle the \npatients, the quality will suffer.\n  Mr. GREGG. So I guess I would get on to the next question because it \nis pretty obvious we have to correct this problem with the physicians. \nIn fact, as I understand it, the next bill immediately that we will \nconsider will correct it for 30 days. Why wouldn't we correct it right \nnow for 3 years, get that 3-year consistency in the system so \nphysicians can have some confidence in their reimbursement rates, fully \npaid for? What possible, conceivable reason would there be not to vote \nfor this type of amendment?\n  Mr. BURR. Because the Senator from New Hampshire remembers this body \ndid pass a bill that partially paid for an extension of this through \nSeptember of this year. The problem was, when they passed the health \ncare bill, they used the pay-fors out of that extension bill to be \nincluded in this health care bill. Now they have gone to a point that \nthey just seek the 30-day renewals and claim it is an emergency. One, I \ndon't think that passes the threshold of emergency. I think it should \nbe paid for. And there is a legitimate way to pay for it and extend it \nfor 3 years, where this Congress can fully understand the implications \nof the current health care bill as it is implemented and put back the \ncomfort of physicians around this country and their trust back in the \nsystem.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I think the Senator is absolutely right, but I would \nalso suggest that maybe there is another reason they haven't paid for \nit in this bill or put the correction in this bill, which is that if \nthey did that, the bill would fall because it would be out of \ncompliance with the budget because it is a $285 billion cost over 10 \nyears. Therefore, aren't they sort of trying to pull the wool over \nsomebody's eyes here? Aren't they trying to act as if this bill that we \nknow exists for our doctors, that we are never going to pay for it? We \nare not going to pay; we are just going to act as if it doesn't exist? \nWe know as soon as this bill is over, we will have to do something \nabout it, at least for the next 30 days.\n  Mr. BURR. You are absolutely right, it will be the first order of \nbusiness when this bill is finished if we miss the opportunity to fix \nit in this bill and fix it for 3 years and actually fix it in a way \nthat it is paid for.\n  Mr. GREGG. I see the Senator from Arizona has arrived.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be included in \nthe colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the Senator from New Hampshire that there \nis some recent information that I find hard to believe, but apparently \nit may be the case. As we go through this 2,733-page piece of \nlegislation, the IRS may need up to $10 billion to administer the new \nhealth care program this decade, and it may need to hire as many as \n16,500 additional auditors, agents, and other employees to investigate \nand collect billions of new taxes from Americans. Is that possible, in \nthis legislation, I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct, and that does call into \nquestion the representation that this bill is not a tax increase on \nAmericans that we need 16,000 new IRS agents to enforce it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At $10 billion to administer. That is probably \nbelievable, given what is in 2,733 pages.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, you are going to need one IRS person for everybody \nin America who doesn't have insurance, I guess, or however the ratio \nworks out. Everybody has to buy insurance under this bill, and your \nlocal IRS agent is going to show up at your door to tell you that you \nbetter do it or else you will have to answer to the IRS.\n  We know there are no new taxes in this bill because that has been \nrepresented to us a number of times.\n  Mr. BURR. If I could add, it also adds some insight into how many \npeople will choose not to have insurance and make themselves \nsusceptible to the fine. The anticipation is the IRS is going to chase \na lot of people to recover the fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also finally add that perhaps we could get some \nindication--I think we should before we vote on passage of this bill--\nas to how many new bureaucrats and bureaucracies there are going to be \nwith 193 new boards and commissions and other layers of bureaucracy. I \nthink the American people are owed at least a round figure as to how \nmany new bureaucrats there are going to be to administer this program.\n  I see the Senator from Montana, and I don't want to impede on what \nhas been the agreed-upon rule here, but I did want to continue and say \nto my friends very quickly that I think there are several myths here \nthat have to be refuted by the facts.\n  One is that this legislation will result in a tax cut for the \nAmerican people. I would say to my friend from New Hampshire, we have \nto rebut that in the next hour.\n  The next myth is that the health care bill won't increase taxes on \nindividuals with incomes under $250,000. The fact is, millions of \nAmericans with incomes below $250,000 will pay higher taxes.\n  Another myth: The legislation will reduce the growth of health \ncosts--President Obama's stated goal for health reform--and premiums \nwill go down. The fact is, national health expenditures and premiums \nwill increase.\n  Another myth: The legislation is deficit neutral. The fact is, \ncommitment to health care spending under existing obligations increases \nthe deficit.\n  Myth: ``If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.'' Fact: \nMillions of Americans with coverage will lose their current coverage, \nincluding 330,000 citizens of my State who have the Medicare Advantage \nProgram.\n  Finally, the myth is that the law will provide immediate coverage for \nchildren with preexisting conditions. The fact is, children are not \nnecessarily protected against discrimination for preexisting \nconditions.\n  So I hope we have a chance, I would say to my friend from New \nHampshire, to address the allegations about this legislation, and \nperhaps the first one is that legislation will result in a tax cut for \nthe American people when the fact is that taxes will increase for \nmillions of Americans.\n  I would yield to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Arizona, who has been one of the \nmost cogent and thoughtful speakers on the issue of what this bill \nreally does. He has hit the nail on the head time and time again with \nhis points. They are all absolutely accurate.\n  Has the Senator completed his statement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I just wanted to throw in here that perhaps one of \nthe most egregious statements, and it is worth repeating, is this so-\ncalled doc fix. They are using an assumption that we will cut \nphysicians' fees by 21 percent sometime this fall in order to make up--\nand please correct me if I am wrong--some $281 billion over 10 years, \nwhich we know is not going to happen. And the reason it is not going to \nhappen is because doctors would refuse to take Medicare patients if \nthey cut their reimbursement by some 21 percent.\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\n  So this is one of the fundamental assumptions they are selling this \non, is that it is deficit neutral when it is not.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I may, I would like to add one other thing here. Think \nabout it. We are talking about the cuts that are set to go. But since \nthere is no tort reform in this bill, we spend $250 billion on \ndefensive medicine and liability costs continue to rise. You could \nbring them back whole, but if you give them no increase, they are still \ngoing to quit seeing Medicare patients.\n  One other point I would like to make is with the student loan program \nbeing totally taken over by the government, 31,800 people in this \ncountry this July will lose their jobs. So we are going to lose 31,800 \njobs in the private sector, but we will add 16,500 jobs at the IRS. I \ndon't think anybody in America would like to see that happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The CEO of Caterpillar wrote a letter saying that the \ntaxes for Caterpillar would go up by $100 million next year. What does \nthat do to Caterpillar? It obviously makes them either not hire or lay \noff individuals as they pay an additional $100 million. And I might \npoint out, as we all know, Caterpillar's headquarters is in Peoria, IL.\n  So, again, I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire, is this \nlegislation deficit neutral?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, it is not deficit neutral if you actually score the \nnumber of years of income against the number of years of expenditures \nor you include the doctors fix. Either one would throw this into a \ndeficit-negative situation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't that another of the great scams, that for 4 years \nthe benefits are cut and the taxes are increased, and for most--not all \nbut most--of this bill, none of the benefits really kick in until after \n4 years?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So when you score it, that is the way you make it deficit \nneutral over 10 years?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. And it is a bit of a scam, as you say.\n  I am going to have to reserve the remainder of our time here for a \nmoment, but I understand the Senator from North Carolina wants to bring \nup an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3652\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending motions and amendments so that I may offer an \namendment that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3652.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect the integrity of Department of Veterans Affairs \n  and Department of Defense health care programs for veterans, active-\nduty service members, their families, widows and widowers, and orphans \n             who have sacrificed in defense of our Nation)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1__. TREATMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAMS.\n\n       Subtitle G of title I of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 1564. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAMS.\n\n       ``(a) Clarifications With Respect to Certain Programs and \n     Authorities.--Nothing in this Act or in the amendments made \n     by this Act shall be construed as affecting any of the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Any authority under title 38, United States Code.\n       ``(2) Any authority under chapter 55 of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       ``(3) Any health care or health care benefit provided under \n     the TRICARE program under chapter 55 of title 10, United \n     States Code, or by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under \n     the laws administered by such Secretary.\n       ``(b) Clarification With Respect to Minimum Essential \n     Coverage.--For purposes of this Act and the amendments made \n     by this Act, the term `minimum essential coverage' includes \n     the following:\n       ``(1) Coverage provided under chapter 55 of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n       ``(2) Eligibility for health care provided by the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs under title 38, United States Code.''.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I protect the \nremainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the debate on this bill is winding to a \nclose, so let me return to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is the referee we all turn to as an \nimpartial judge of whether we are accomplishing what we set out to do, \nso I will take a moment and quote from the Congressional Budget Office. \nIt is very appropriate as it relates to the prior conversation on the \nother side. Let me read excerpts from the most recent Congressional \nBudget Office statement on deficits, debt, and coverage and whether \nthis is deficit neutral. This was released Saturday. This is a \nstatement by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. They are our scorekeepers. They determine how much we are \nspending and how much revenue we are taking in on legislation and what \nthe net result is.\n  Here are the highlights of the letter:\n\n       Enacting both pieces of legislation--H.R. 3590--\n\n  That is basically our Senate bill that passed the House and the \nPresident signed--\n\n     --and the reconciliation proposal--would produce a net \n     reduction in Federal deficits of $143 billion over the 2010-\n     2019 period.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the CBO.\n  Further quoting:\n\n       Enacting H.R. 3590 by itself would yield a net reduction in \n     Federal deficits of $118 billion over the 2010-2019 period.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       The incremental effect of enacting the reconciliation \n     proposal would be an estimated net reduction in Federal \n     deficits of $25 billion during the 2010-2019 period over and \n     above the savings from enacting H.R. 3590 by itself.\n\n  Further quoting CBO:\n\n       The combined effect of enacting H.R. 3590 and the \n     reconciliation proposal would be to reduce the number of \n     nonelderly people who are uninsured by about 32 million \n     people. The share of legal nonelderly residents with \n     insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently \n     to about 94 percent.\n\n  CBO said of the new health care law:\n\n       Enacting H.R. 3590 would reduce Federal budget deficits \n     over the ensuing decade--\n\n  That is the next decade, the second decade--\n\n     with a total effect during that decade in a broad range \n     between one-quarter percent and one-half percent of gross \n     domestic product.\n\n  But what is more, CBO further said:\n\n       The combined effect of enacting H.R. 3590 and the \n     reconciliation proposal would also be to reduce Federal \n     budget deficits over the ensuing decade . . . with a total \n     effect during that decade of a broad range around one-half \n     percent of GDP.\n\n  I might add parenthetically, that is about $1.3 trillion.\n  CBO continues:\n\n       The incremental effect of enacting the reconciliation bill \n     over and above the effect of enacting H.R. 3590 by itself \n     would thus be to further reduce Federal budget deficits in \n     that decade, with an effect in a broad range between zero and \n     one-quarter percent of GDP.\n\n  In other words, the new health care formula would accomplish major \ndeficit reduction. This is the CBO talking, not Senators. Don't take my \nword for it. Don't take anyone else's word for it. This is the \nCongressional Budget Office. This reconciliation bill itself would \naccomplish major deficit reduction, probably the greatest deficit \nreduction actually we are going to take over a long period of time--the \npreceding perhaps 8, 9, 10 years and a subsequent period of time. We \ndon't know that, but this is certainly major deficit reduction. \nTogether, these two bills would accomplish deficit reduction of \nhistoric proportions.\n  Let me continue to quote the letter from the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n\n       [T]he reconciliation proposal would probably continue--\n\n  Get this--\n\n     to reduce deficit budget deficits relative to those under \n     subsequent decades. . . .\n\n  Not just this period, not next decade but subsequent decades. This is \nmy edit now. This means this bill continues to reduce the deficit in \nyear after year after the second decade, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Finally, CBO says:\n\n       In subsequent years, the effects of the provisions of the \n     two bills combined that would tend to decrease the federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care would grow faster\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n     than the effects of the provision that would increase it.\n\n  Let me get to that statement. It gets to the Federal involvement in \nhealth care as a result of the consequences of this bill.\n\n       In subsequent years the effect of the provisions of the two \n     bills combined that would tend to decrease the federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care would grow faster than \n     the effects of the provisions that would increase it.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       As a result, CBO expects that enacting both proposals would \n     generate a reduction in the federal budgetary commitment to \n     health care during the decade following the 10-year budget \n     window. . . .\n\n  Even less government in the second 10 years relative to current law. \nIn other words, CBO says that after the first decade, health care \nreform will reduce--yes, reduce--the budgetary role of government in \nthe health care sector.\n  Whom do we trust? Whom else are we going to listen to? We all have \nopinions. Those folks at CBO have sharp pencils. They are very good at \nwhat they do. They are nonpartisan. Nobody has ever suggested they are \npartisan. Nobody has ever questioned their professionalism. They are \nvery good. This is what CBO says.\n  That is it. CBO says health care reform cuts the deficit. Let me \npause there and let that sink in. CBO says health care reform will cut \nthe deficit. CBO also says it expands coverage. More people will get \nhealth insurance, from 83 percent to 94 percent. Also, this legislation \nreduces the Government's budgetary role in health care. It reduces it.\n  That is quite a feat--more coverage, deficit reduction, and less \nFederal involvement in health care. I think this bill is pretty well \ndesigned to accomplish all those purposes--cuts cost, increases \ncoverage, and reforms the health insurance market, most significantly \nin the individual market and also in the small group market.\n  On another matter, I think it is relevant and important--this is a \nletter from AARP, dated March 24 of this year. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator,\n       We have made enormous progress advancing historic, urgently \n     needed health care reform legislation but we are not done \n     yet.\n\n  This is from the AARP. Continuing:\n\n       We now urge you to promptly pass the Health Care an \n     Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010--without \n     amendments.\n\n  Let me repeat that. AARP, in a letter dated March 24, strongly \nsuggests the Congress, especially Senate, pass this legislation without \namendments. Those are their own words, ``without amendments,'' in order \n``to help make affordable, high-quality health care available to all \nAmericans.''\n  The letter is much longer. I just wanted to quote the more salient \nprovisions, where the AARP suggests amendments not be adopted so we can \nget reconciliation passed so we can implement the law which the \nPresident already signed and get health care to Americans who \ndesperately need it and reform of the health care industry, which is \ndesperately needed, and start getting control of health care costs, \nwhich is desperately needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         AARP--Nancy A. LeaMond, Executive Vice President, AARP \n           Social Impact Group,\n                                                   March 24, 2010.\n\n       Dear Senator: We have made enormous progress advancing \n     historic, urgently needed health care reform legislation, but \n     we are not done yet. We now urge you to promptly pass the \n     Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of \n     2010--without amendments--to help make affordable, high \n     quality health care available to all Americans.\n       The Reconciliation Act will:\n       1. Close Medicare's dreaded ``doughnut hole'' drug coverage \n     gap for all beneficiaries. This is a top priority for AARP \n     because it helps older Americans afford drugs they need to \n     stay healthy and avoid costlier treatments;\n       2. Make coverage more affordable for hard-working middle-\n     income families who now too often are uninsured because the \n     cost of coverage is beyond their modest means. Added help is \n     vital to meet the public's demand for coverage that is truly \n     affordable for all Americans;\n       3. Further strengthen our fight against fraud, waste and \n     abuse, a key component to better controlling rising costs in \n     our health care system; and\n       4. Improve Medicare's fiscal health and extend the solvency \n     of the Medicare Trust. Fund.\n       These provisions build on the solid foundation of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that the Senate \n     passed in December. These two bills together will protect and \n     strengthen Medicare's guaranteed benefits, eliminate barriers \n     to prevention, and crack down on insurance company abuses, \n     such as denying affordable coverage because of age or health \n     status and setting arbitrary caps on how much care they will \n     cover. The legislative package will also provide affordable \n     coverage options to millions of Americans and small \n     businesses, help Americans to better plan for their future \n     long-term care needs, and receive services to help them \n     remain in their own homes and stay out of costly nursing \n     facilities.\n       We, like you, hear countless stories from our members who \n     were denied coverage or cannot afford their prescriptions or \n     insurance premiums. Health care remains among the most \n     important and personal economic issues for the vast majority \n     of Americans.\n       Health expenditures consume roughly one sixth of our \n     economy today, and will reach 20 percent in seven years if \n     current trends continue. These skyrocketing costs strain the \n     budgets of families and businesses as well as the \n     government--crowding out other priorities--as health care \n     costs continue to grow 2-3 times faster than general \n     inflation. That is why all the major health care stakeholders \n     have come to the table to solve this unsustainable situation.\n       Delay will only mean more Medicare beneficiaries will not \n     be able to afford the drugs they need. Millions of our family \n     members and neighbors will not be able to afford the coverage \n     they need. Billions of additional dollars in uncompensated \n     care costs will unfairly shift to those who do have coverage. \n     More individuals will impoverish themselves to get the health \n     care they need. Skyrocketing costs will continue to strain \n     even more family, business, and government budgets.\n       AARP therefore urges all Senators to vote in favor of the \n     Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of \n     2010. Both the economic and physical health of our members, \n     their families, and our nation are at stake,\n       Because AARP members have a strong interest in how their \n     elected officials vote on key issues, we will be informing \n     them about how their Senators vote on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Addison Barry Rand.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). We have 27 minutes 51 seconds on \nthe majority side and 35 minutes 42 seconds on the minority side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me make two quick points. The only way CBO gets to the \nconclusions they reach, and they had to get to those conclusions, is \nbecause of the facts put before them. One of those facts, they have to \npresume Medicare is going to be cut $500 billion in the first years \nbefore full implementation, $1 trillion in the second 10 years during \nfull implementation, and $3 trillion during the first 20 years of full \nimplementation--$3 trillion.\n  All that money is going to be taken out of Medicare and moved over to \nstart new programs, new entitlements to benefit people who are not \nsenior citizens and who, for the most part, have never paid into \nMedicare. That is a serious problem.\n  You can score that positively if you wish, but first off I do not \nthink it will happen. I think what will end up happening is, it will \nget put on our children's backs as debt. But second, if it does happen, \nit is wrong because Medicare has to be fixed and you are taking the \nmoney that should be used to fix it, if you believe in these types of \ncuts in Medicare, and you are spending them on a new entitlement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague a friendly \nquestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. On your time you may ask a question, including my answer, \nwhich may take 24 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I trust in the good faith of the Senator from New \nHampshire not to abuse the situation.\n  As I understand it, basically the Senator does not question the \nprofessionalism of CBO. Clearly, CBO had all the facts. All Senators \nhave them, all Senators, House Members, the whole world has. CBO has \nall the facts. You are not questioning their professionalism. You do \nquestion their conclusions.\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly don't question their professionalism. They are \nan extraordinarily good organization with a wonderful leader who is \nfair and unbiased. I don't question their conclusions because what they \nhave to score is a fact pattern that was given them and\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nthe fact pattern given them by this bill is, on its face, not \nbelievable relative to what is going to happen in the outyears, even \nthough they have to score it as believable. It is a fantasy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, while the Senator \nfrom Montana is here, maybe it is a legitimate question. Does the \nSenator from Montana believe that the assumption given to the \nCongressional Budget Office that the so-called doc fix, reimbursement \nfor physicians who treat Medicare patients, will be cut by 21 percent? \nThe Senator from Montana knows full well the AMA has been told in no \nuncertain terms it will be fixed between now and when it is supposed to \ntake effect because the fact is, as the Senator from Montana knows, you \ncan cut Medicare physician reimbursement. Then doctors will not treat \nMedicare patients. So maybe the Senator from Montana would tell us if \nthat was a valid assumption given to the CBO, that there would be some \n$281 billion that would be accrued because physicians' payments would \nbe reduced by some 21 percent?\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply ask the time of the Senator from Arizona come off \nours and the time of the Senator from Montana for his answer come off \nhis.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, that sounds fair.\n  Let me say to my good friend from Arizona, first of all, clearly this \nbody, the Senate and the Congress, is going to not let the SGR problem \nexpire; that is, doctors are not going to be cut 21 percent, whatever \nthe rate is the first year or more and so on. That is not going to \nhappen. First, from the seniors' point of view, second from the \ndoctors' point of view, that is not going to happen. I do not want to \ntake too much time on the subject, but the long and short of it simply \nis we are going to have to find a way, this Congress, to address that \nproblem. If I might finish, it is not part of health care reform, and \nwe will find a way. A question is going to be how much will be paid \nfor. That is a judgment this body is going to have to make in the \npretty near future.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate very much the acknowledgment, on the part of \nthe manager of the bill, that the assumption that provides us with \ndeficit neutrality is not valid. That is the point we have been trying \nto make. It is based on false assumptions. The assumption that \ndoctors--I am very happy to hear the Senator from Montana state \nunequivocally what was given and assumed by the CBO when they gave us \nour numbers is not true. So we will be voting, in a short period of \ntime, on a piece of legislation which is based on false assumptions. I \nthink that is an unfortunate circumstance.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply note the Senator from Montana made the case for \nmy amendment rather eloquently because my amendment does address the \ndoctors fix and it is paid for. Therefore, I certainly hope the Senator \nmight consider voting for it.\n  At this point, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator, from New Hampshire. Let me \nreiterate what just came out of this dialog and colloquy between the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Arizona. That is this. CBO \nhas said this is going to be a deficit saver, a deficit reducer, and \nthe President is going around the country talking about the fact that \nthis bill is going to reduce the deficit.\n  What the President is not going to say but what the Senator from \nMontana just agreed to, is the fact that our physicians who are due a \n21-percent decrease in Medicare reimbursement payments are not, in \nfact, going to have that 21-percent reduction. That decrease was \nincluded in this bill to make it appear more deficit-neutral over the \nfirst 10 years. When you factor that in, this not only does not reduce \nthe deficit, but it adds to the deficit an additional $281 billion \ndifference in what the number of the CBO says we are going to reduce \nthe deficit by.\n  You know very clearly we are going to add to the deficit when we pass \nthis bill because the Senator from Montana is right, we are not going \nto see that 21-percent reduction. I suspect that the $523 billion in \nMedicare cuts that are provided for in this bill, that are scheduled to \ntake effect in future years, may not ever happen. If that is the case, \nthen not only are we looking at an additional cost of that $523 \nbillion, the $281 billion for the SGR fix or the doctors fix, but we \nare looking at increasing the deficit to fund a domestic program in a \nfuture way.\n  One thing the CBO does say is, this bill provides an additional \n$569.2 billion in new taxes, new taxes on the American people, \nparticularly the small business community that is hit the hardest by \nthis.\n  The American people have made it very clear: They do not want these \nbills to become law. Two new polls by CBS and CNN show that only 20 \npercent of Americans believe this legislation will benefit them and \ntheir families. Still, the majority party has chosen to push these \nunpopular proposals through.\n  My constituents in Georgia have reached out in record numbers to \nregister their opposition to President Obama's plan.\n  Why? For starters, because this is an unprecedented government \ninvolvement in an industry that constitutes one-sixth of the Nation's \neconomy. If we get it wrong, if we overreach, our fragile economy will \nsuffer and a recovery will lag, perhaps for years.\n  This bill also does something very un-American: It would penalize \nindividuals for not purchasing health insurance. Today, we have seen 13 \nState attorneys general file lawsuits challenging the constitutionality \nof fining Americans for not purchasing insurance.\n  The bill that passed the Senate and was signed by the president is \nfilled with backroom deal-making, partisan arm-twisting and special \ncarve-outs for some of my wavering colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Now, instead of working together on a bill that would be more \npalatable to all Americans, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have decided to push forward in the face of united opposition.\n  The Governor of Georgia recently expressed concern regarding the \nunfunded mandates in this legislation. Our State faces an additional \nbillion dollars or more of Medicaid spending per year.\n  These new costs that will be absorbed by the State will require \nfurther tax hikes on Georgians or cuts to public safety, education and \nother core State government services.\n  The bill that was just signed contains $518.5 billion in gross tax \nincreases. It cuts Medicare by $465 billion--and, more importantly--\ndoes nothing to bend the health care cost curve down.\n  With Medicare on the verge of insolvency, this bill takes money from \nthe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to pay for unrelated entitlement \nspending.\n  Under this new plan, new Federal taxes on Americans start \nimmediately. But full benefits won't take effect until 2014. The bill \nraises $60 billion in taxes before any of the major benefits go into \neffect.\n  Looking at the years 2013-2024, the 10-year period after the law is \nfully implemented, the overall cost is estimated to be $2.6 trillion.\n  Some of these numbers are so large that its tough to get your head \naround them. But rest assured that they will detrimentally impact \nAmericans and our economy.\n  There is also substantial evidence that this new law will hurt small \nbusinesses.\n  The bill imposes $493 billion in new taxes that will fall \ndisproportionately on the backs of small-business owners.\n  A $54 billion increase in the Medicare payroll tax will hit \napproximately one-third of the small-business owners across the \ncountry.\n  A $60 billion tax on insurers means small businesses that manage to \nprovide health insurance coverage for their employees will see this tax \npassed on to them, increasing premiums.\n  The CLASS Act portion of the new law appears to make it less costly \nbecause, as the CBO said, ``the program would pay out far less in \nbenefits than it would receive in premiums over the 10-year budget \nwindow,'' raising $70 billion in premiums that will fund benefits \noutside the window. Outlays in later years will increase significantly.\n  And the legislation just signed into law is still filled with the \nsweetheart deals that have so angered Americans.\n  That includes the Cornhusker Kickback, in which the Federal \nGovernment pays the entire tab of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion.\n  It also includes the Louisiana Purchase, in which the Federal \nGovernment pays an extra $300 million in\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nMedicaid dollars to the State of Louisiana.\n  And it still has the Gator Aid Florida Medicare Advantage grandfather \nclause to protect certain areas of Florida from Medicare Advantage cuts \nthat all other seniors in America will face.\n  Meanwhile, the 176,000 seniors in Georgia who rely on Medicare \nAdvantage to supplement the gaps in traditional Medicare will see their \nbenefits cut by $33 each month.\n  The new law significantly raises taxes, cuts benefits for seniors, \nadds to the Federal deficit and allows the government to make decisions \nthat should be between a patient and his doctor.\n  The reconciliation bill--optimistically deemed a ``fix-it'' bill--is \nactually a ``make-it-worse'' bill.\n  The legislation before us today raises taxes by an additional $50 \nbillion more than the Senate bill. That is an overall tax increase of \n$569.2 billion.\n  The reconciliation bill nearly doubles the tax on health insurers \nbeginning in 2014, and also raises taxes and fees on drugmakers and \nmedical devices. The Congressional Budget Office has specifically \nstated that these taxes will be passed on to all Americans in the form \nof higher health costs and rising insurance premiums.\n  The reconciliation bill raises another $66.1 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage, bringing total Medicare cuts in both bills to $523 billion.\n  And it forces an additional 1 million individuals into Medicaid on \ntop of the 15 million already added to Medicaid in the Senate bill. \nThat means 16 million of the 32 million newly insured individuals would \nobtain that coverage through Medicaid--a program President Obama \nadmitted already suffers from serious access problems.\n  It also increases penalties for businesses that don't offer health \ninsurance and have at least one employee receiving a subsidy in the \nexchange from $750 per full-time employee to $2,000 per full-time \nemployee.\n  And, among other things, it penalizes many Americans with higher \nincomes from rent, interest, royalties and individuals by forcing an \nalmost 4 percent Medicare tax on their investment income.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill is going to \ncost $940 billion over 10 years.\n  We are burdening our children and grandchildren--generations of \nAmerica's future--by creating a behemoth new government entitlement \nprogram.\n  And in the same week of its creation, we turned around and \nimmediately added to this new program almost $1 trillion more.\n  The American people are asking a simple question: Where does the \nspending end?\n  Also, I wish to talk about a specific provision that is going to have \nan immediate, direct impact on my taxpayers in Georgia; that is, with \nthe increase in the threshold to qualify for Medicaid going from 100 \npercent to 133 percent, in my State, according to our Governor--and he \nhas run the numbers--that is going to cost the taxpayers of Georgia, in \naddition to their share of this $569.2 billion in additional taxes, an \nadditional $1 billion per year that Georgia taxpayers are going to have \nto pay.\n  We are in difficult times in my State, as all 50 States are right \nnow. That is a new provision, a new tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the Governor of \nGeorgia, the Honorable Sonny Perdue, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Office of the Governor, Mar. 22, 2010]\n\nStatement of Governor Sonny Perdue Regarding the Healthcare Legislation \n                  Passed by the United States Congress\n\n       Atlanta.--Governor Sonny Perdue issued the following \n     statement today regarding the healthcare legislation passed \n     by the United States Congress:\n       ``Unfortunately, the United States House of Representatives \n     last night chose politics over the will of the American \n     people. The enormous upheaval of our healthcare system was \n     pushed through the House against the wishes of the majority \n     of American families and businesses.\n       Here in Georgia, this vote will force an additional billion \n     dollars or more of Medicaid spending per year, requiring \n     either a tax hike or offsetting cuts to public safety, \n     education and other core services of state government. While \n     this colossal unfunded mandate cripples our budget, I am even \n     more concerned about the debilitating impact it will have on \n     Georgia's small businesses. The extension of the Medicare tax \n     on all non-wage income means that small business owners will \n     see their top rate increased by 20 percent and investment \n     income taxes increasing 60 percent.\n       What is most unfortunate is that the American people had no \n     voice at the table in Washington during the course of this \n     debate. The only glimpse citizens saw of the process were \n     closed-door meetings that resulted in backroom deals and the \n     buying of votes to ensure passage. I am today renewing my \n     December request to the Attorney General that he join other \n     states in reviewing the constitutionality of this travesty. \n     My office has already begun to review any and all legal \n     options to challenge this legislation.\n       I also urge the Georgia General Assembly to continue moving \n     forward on my proposal to allow Georgians to purchase \n     insurance plans across state lines. Now that Congress is \n     mandating that every American purchase health insurance, we \n     should open the individual market to as much competition as \n     possible.\n       Since this bill has such a significant impact on future \n     state budgets, it is imperative that current candidates for \n     elected office publicly state their plans to either support \n     the Obama-Pelosi legislation or fight for the people of \n     Georgia.''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me say that within the last 48 hours we have \ndiscovered that the agency that is going to be administering the new \nhealth care reform bill the President signed into law is none other \nthan the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service has \nsaid that in order to review the tax returns of every taxpayer in \nAmerica to ensure that they have complied with the law and bought \ninsurance or had insurance taken out through their employer, they are \ngoing to have to have an additional 16,500 Internal Revenue Service \nAgents at a cost of an additional $10 billion to the taxpayers. That \n$10 billion is not factored in here in anyway.\n  We are dealing with a piece of legislation that the American public \nhas shown, over and over in every poll taken, whether it is by a \nDemocratic pollster, Republican pollster or an independent pollster, \nthat they do not want. We are going to force that bill down on the \nAmerican people and that is wrong, that is not the way this body and \nthe body across the Capitol should be working with respect to the best \ninterests of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time during the vote on the \namendments this afternoon and tonight to repeal this bill and let us \nreplace it with a true, meaningful health care reform bill that we can \nall agree on. There are a lot of provisions in those 2,700 pages plus, \nthe length of this so-called fix-it bill that we can agree on, that we \ncan replace this bill with, that will provide the American people with \ntrue, meaningful health care reform that they need and deserve.\n  We will not see all of these huge increases in taxes, we will not see \nall of these huge reductions in Medicare benefits, and we can do the \nwill of the people in the right and appropriate way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3553\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside any pending amendment and call up amendment No. 3553.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3553.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To repeal the government takeover of health care)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Choice Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL.\n\n       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the \n     amendments made by that Act, are repealed.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, and it goes \nto the heart of all of these arguments. This amendment would repeal \nthis new ObamaCare plan.\n  All of us on this side urge this action and urge us to focus instead \non a focused step-by-step approach to solve\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nspecific, real problems with specific solutions. This gargantuan plan \nwhich this amendment would repeal does not do that. This gargantuan \nplan has fundamental problems at its core that my colleagues have been \ntalking about; truly offensive, fundamental problems such as over a \n$\\1/2\\ trillion cut to Medicare. The American people do not want to pay \nfor anything through that. Over $\\1/2\\ trillion of increased taxes and \ncosts. The American people do not want an approach that does that, \nincreasing health ObamaCare costs, when the American people know our \nbig challenge is to do the opposite.\n  Nonpartisan sources such as the Congressional Budget Office confirm \nthat the ObamaCare plan does not decrease health ObamaCare costs, it \nincreases health ObamaCare costs from their rising rate already. It \npushes that cost curve up and growing the bureaucracy, including \nthousands of new IRS workers, and putting them and the Federal \nGovernment between you and your doctor.\n  These are not minor parts of the ObamaCare plan. This is the core of \nthat plan. That is why we absolutely need to repeal it and take a \nfundamentally different approach, an approach that is focused like a \nlaser beam on real problems and that deals with those real problems \nwith real and targeted and step-by-step solutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. I urge support of amendment No. 3553.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are coming to a close, or a beginning, \nI am not sure which, when we start the vote on amendments. If my \ncalculation is correct, the time for debate on this reconciliation bill \nwill expire around 5:10, about that time, approximately.\n  At that time, approximately, we will start voting on amendments. By \nmy count we have 21 amendments pending, and if we vote on amendments in \nthe time in which it usually takes to vote on amendments in a series, \nmy experience is it roughly takes around an hour for three amendments. \nMaybe we can speed that up. With 21 amendments, that is 7 hours. That \nis the good news. There probably will be some intervening disruptions.\n  But the good news is, that means the earliest we might be finished is \naround midnight. But, of course, that is not the case, because there \nwill be other amendments offered.\n  For the information of my colleagues, we will probably start voting \non amendments at approximately around 5:10, thereabouts. We have 21 \namendments pending at the present time. It takes about 1 hour to vote \non three amendments. I believe we can squeeze that time down. It is my \nhope that we can. But that is my experience around here, it takes about \nthat long.\n  Because there are a lot more amendments most likely to be offered, I \ninform my colleagues that we will be in very late tonight, certainly \nway past midnight, because of the number of amendments that are \ncurrently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 23 minutes 47 seconds left.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, could you let me know when 8 minutes \nhas been consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this has been a debate filled with \npassion and good intentions and a lot of hard work. Our political \nparties have come to vastly different conclusions. The President and \nthe majority have said, this is an historic occasion. I agree.\n  But I believe, as do most of us, that it is an historic mistake, and \nit is important to say why we think that. This is the fundamental \nmistake, that with the law that was passed yesterday and what the \nmajority has proposed to do in this second bill, to expand a health \nObamaCare delivery system that we all know is more expensive than we \ncan afford, instead of stepping back and instead seeking to reduce the \ncost of that health ObamaCare delivery system so that more Americans \ncan afford to buy health insurance. That is the mistake.\n  I wish to try to say in 3 or 4 minutes what this bill means to \nTennesseans. I was listening to the Senator from Montana and the \nRepublican Senators talk about debt. We believe, I believe, that this \nbill, these two bills, will increase each Tennessean's share of the \nnational debt.\n  The Senator from Montana says: Well, but the Congressional Budget \nOffice says it does not. Well, that would be like going to the \nCongressional Budget Office and saying: I have got a horse farm here. \nTell me how much it costs to operate over the next 10 years. The CBO \nwould say: Would you like me to tell you how to do it with the horses \nor without the horses? If you tell me how to do it without the horses, \nit is not going to cost as much. Or, if I have a gas station, would you \nlike me to tell you how to operate that with the gas in it or without \nthe gasoline?\n  That is what we are saying here. They have gone to the Congressional \nBudget Office and said: Tell us how much this health bill costs. They \nhave said to them: With the doctors or without the doctors?\n  They say: Oh, no, keep the doctors out.\n  Because, according to the President's own budget, that is $371 \nbillion over 10 years. If you put that in, then the whole bill adds to \nthe deficit, so they leave it out. So that is why we say, and I would \nsay, that the first thing this bill does is add to the debt, each \nTennessean's share of the debt.\n  The second thing is, it adds $8,470 in new spending for every \nTennessean. Thirdly there are 243,000 Tennesseans enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage, which is about one out of four persons in Medicare who will \nhave their benefits reduced by half, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office Director in testimony before Congress, whose veracity we \nhave been hearing extolled on all sides.\n  The next thing it does is about 1.4 million Tennesseans making less \nthan $200,000 will pay higher taxes, based on estimates by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. Some 300,000 Tennesseans in the individual \nhealth insurance market will see premium rate increases of 30 to 45 \npercent based upon a Blue Cross/Blue Shield study of Tennessee and \nother analysis.\n  Next, Tennessee's small businesses employing 50 or more people and \nconstruction companies employing 5 or more people--that is 5,000 \nconstruction companies in Tennessee--will pay higher health ObamaCare \ncosts because of new government mandates.\n  Then here is the other one. This is the one that was just added over \nthe weekend: 200,000 Tennessee students including--I checked--11,000 at \nthe University of Tennessee-Knoxville where I was this week, will be \novercharged by $1,700 to $1,800 over the next 10 years on their student \nloans in order to help pay for the health ObamaCare bill and other \nprograms.\n  Let me say that again. Over the weekend, without any debate in the \nSenate, they have stuck in this bill--they are going to overcharge 19 \nmillion students in America, 200,000 in Tennessee, $1,700 or $1,800 \nmore than it costs the government to borrow the money, because the \ngovernment is taking over the student loan program.\n  They borrow the money at 2.8 percent, they loan it out at 6.8 \npercent, they take the difference, they spend it, $8.7 billion of it to \nhelp pay for the health ObamaCare program. So that is 200,000 Tennessee \nstudents. These are not Wall Street financiers. This is a mom with a \nchild and a job going to school to get a better job. That is 200,000 \nTennessee students. And $1.1 billion in costs will be forced on the \nTennessee government. That is according to our State Democratic \nGovernor, who said that is the cost of the Medicaid expansion and what \nhappens to the State after the physicians reimbursement expires in 2 \nyears for Medicaid. This will force States, Tennessee for sure, and \nmany other States, to raise taxes, cut services, or increase college \ntuition.\n\n  According to an Oliver Wyman study, 30 percent of young people will \npay up to 35 percent more in premiums as premiums go up in the \nindividual market.\n  Then finally, of course, the bill does add in Tennessee about 200,000 \npeople to our TennCare or Medicare rolls. But\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\nthat is not health ObamaCare reform because nationally only about half \nof doctors will see new Medicaid patients.\n  So we are saying to people, we are giving you health ObamaCare, but \nit is like saying, we are giving you a bus ticket to a bus line where \nthe bus only runs half the time. When you put these low-income \nAmericans into this program in such large numbers, what that \nadditionally does is create more opportunities for physicians, for \nhospitals, and for drugstores to say, we cannot serve Medicaid patients \nany more.\n  That is why we feel this is the wrong course and an historic mistake. \nWhat we would do instead is replace this bill with a different bill \nthat focuses on costs. We have said it over and over again. We said it \nat the health ObamaCare summit. We would start with allowing people to \nbuy health care across State lines; with allowing small businesses to \ncombine their resources to offer insurance to more people at lower \ncosts; with reducing the number of lawsuits against doctors for \nmalpractice.\n  We would step up efforts against waste, fraud, and abuse, expand \nhealth savings accounts. All of these were proposals made before the \nSenate, basically ignored. But the fundamental mistake and the reason \nwe have such a difference of opinion between that side of the aisle and \nthis side of the aisle is that that side of the aisle, which has the \nmajority, is expanding a health ObamaCare delivery system that we all \nknow is too expensive, and we think instead what we should be doing is \nfocusing on reducing health ObamaCare costs so that more Americans can \nafford to purchase health ObamaCare insurance.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would yield for 30 seconds to the Senator from Kansas to \nput in order a couple of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3577\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the \npending motions and amendments so that I may offer an amendment, No. \n3577, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3577.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect Medicare beneficiary access to hospital care in \n rural areas from recommendations by the Independent Payment Advisory \n                                 Board)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTING MEDICARE BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO HOSPITAL \n                   CARE IN RURAL AREAS FROM RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE \n                   INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1899A(c)(2)(A) of the Social \n     Security Act, as added by section 3403 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and amended by section \n     10320 of such Act, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new clause:\n       ``(vii) The proposal shall not include any recommendation \n     that would reduce payment rates for items and services \n     furnished by a critical access hospital (as defined in \n     section 1861(mm)(1)).''.\n       (b) Expansion of Affordability Exception to Individual \n     Mandate.--Section 5000A(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, as added by section 1501(b) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, is amended by striking \n     ``8 percent'' and inserting ``5 percent''.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent now to \ntemporarily set aside the pending motions so that I may offer a motion \nto commit, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] moves to commit the \n     bill (H.R. 4872) to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate within 3 \n     days with changes to repeal the Patient-Centered Outcomes \n     Research Institute, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Innovation, any new functions of the United States Preventive \n     Services Task Force, and the Independent Payment Advisory \n     Board and adds an offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield half that time to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, former acting chairman of the HELP Committee, \nand one of the most valuable and productive Members of this body, the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and commend him for his leadership on \nthis issue, along with, of course, our distinguished majority leader so \nmany others, including the wonderful staff we don't often mention--the \nremarkable work being done by the individual staff of Members and the \ncommittee staff of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I see my good friend, Tom Harkin, who now chairs that \ncommittee, along with Max Baucus, and so many others of the leadership \nstaff who have brought us to this moment.\n  I rise to discuss the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. \nAlthough none of us are ignorant of the historic nature of the health \ncare portion of our work this past week, I wish to take a few moments \nto talk about the significance of the education portion of the bill. I \nlistened intently to my friend from Tennessee talk about this part of \nthe bill as well. I have great admiration for him, having served as the \nSecretary of Education and as Governor of Tennessee. He has a wealth of \nknowledge on the subject matter. I commend him for it. However, we \ndisagree with this particular portion.\n  I rise to express a different point of view about why I believe what \nwe have included in this bill has great value. Obviously, the major \nattention has been focused on the health aspects of what we are doing. \nThat in itself is a major achievement. The reconciliation portion of \nthis bill before us now strengthens a good bill and makes it even \nbetter.\n  Last evening I discussed portions of the bill that I think add \ntremendous value to our efforts to provide health care once and for all \nfor all Americans. But the education portion of this bill also has \ngreat significance.\n  Since the Pell grant was established in the 1970s, as all of us know, \nit has made college a possibility for millions and millions of young \nAmericans. I had the great pleasure of serving with Claiborne Pell as a \nMember of this body. He served in the 1960s up until only a few years \nago. We lost him a number of months ago; he passed away. But it is \nincredible to think of what a difference that individual, that one \nSenator made in the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. In years \nto come, some may not know who Claiborne Pell was, but I would like the \nrecord to reflect he was a remarkable Senator. He authored legislation \ncreating the Northeast Corridor, wrote the legislation that banned the \ntesting of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor. He was the author, along \nwith Jacob Javits, of the National Endowments for the Arts and \nHumanities, and he was the author of Pell grants. Unique and remarkable \ncontributions, each and every one of them, but he should long be \nremembered for making education an opportunity that would not be denied \nbecause one lacked the resources to afford it.\n  Those millions of young Americans are now leaders in our Nation. They \nare innovators, some of our most productive and successful citizens. \nThis bill is not unlike the GI bill at the end of World War II, when we \nrecall men who came back from the theaters of the Pacific and Europe \nwho were able to receive an education under the GI bill, who would tell \nus what a remarkable investment it was.\n  It has been repaid millions of times over by those who today make \ncontributions to our country because they got an education because \nthere was a creative Congress, because there was an administration that \nunderstood the value of an education in the midpart of the 20th \ncentury. Here we are now into the second decade of the 21st century \nfacing a similar issue.\n  There should be no doubt in anyone's mind about the value not only of \nmaking us a healthier country by the adoption of the health care \nprovision of this bill, but a better educated country--\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\nnot only to advance our own needs--but to make sure individuals have \nthe opportunity to maximize all of their potential. Today that wouldn't \nbe the case without Pell grants. What they have done to and for our \nsociety has been remarkable. Countless individuals would not have had \nthe opportunity to attend college without Pell grants.\n  Since then the importance of a college education has only grown, not \nonly for the individual students who want to achieve their full \npotential, but our Nation as well. America's ability to compete in the \nglobal economy depends on having a well-educated workforce in the 21st \ncentury. Today, that means a college-educated workforce. Unfortunately, \nwhile the urgency of opening the door to college has grown, the support \nprovided to our most important college aid program has slipped. In \nfact, it has gone further--it has fallen off a cliff. In 1975, the \nmaximum Pell grant covered 80 percent of the average student's tuition, \nfees, room and board at a 4-year public university. Today it covers \nless than one-third at a public university.\n  Our failure to keep pace with the exploding cost of college threatens \nto slam the door on a generation of Americans, making college \nimpossible for many and leaving those who do find a way to further \ntheir education with a debilitating burden of overwhelming debt.\n  Make no mistake, allowing the Pell Grant Program to wither, as would \nbe the case without the adoption of the language in this bill, isn't \njust a slap in the face to low and middle-income hardworking American \nfamilies. It is a serious threat to America's competitiveness in the \n21st century. Fortunately, the legislation in front of us presents an \nopportunity to revitalize the Pell Grant Program and to unlock the \nopportunity of higher education for millions of Americans.\n  The bill invests $13.5 billion to fill the shortfall in the Pell \nGrant Program and ensures that such a shortfall doesn't develop again, \nas the cost of college continues to increase in the years ahead. For \ninstance, if we fail to act, the maximum Pell grant award could be a \npaltry $2,100 for the year 2010. Never before has the effectiveness of \nthis program been at such risk. The legislation before us protects the \nmaximum award at a level of $5,500 and increases to almost $6,000 by \n2017, 7 years from now.\n  We all know that in 7 years the cost of education will have continued \nto skyrocket. I would be the first to admit that while we are putting \ntremendous resources into this program, we can imagine in 2017 what \ncollege education will be like, even at public universities. This Pell \ngrant assistance, as important as it is, is not going to come close to \nmeeting the needs of families, so we will continue to work to increase \naid. But in this legislation, we also peg these increases to inflation \nin order to try to keep up with the cost of higher education.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, this would enable more than 4,300 \nadditional students to go to college. In addition, this legislation \nmakes important investments in Historically Black Colleges, community \ncolleges, and the College Access Challenge Grant Program, which fosters \npartnerships between government and the nonprofit sector that helps \nlow-income kids get a chance to go on to a higher education.\n  It invests in programs that help students determine what college is \nbest for them, as well as prepares them not only to get into those \nschools but to graduate from them. When those students do graduate, \nthey will no longer be faced with that mountain of debt we have heard \nabout over and over again that puts so many of their own careers and \ncontributions to society on hold while they have to pay off these \ndebts, seeking jobs and opportunities that may not be what they need \nfor their future growth and potential.\n  To help with this, our legislation caps repayment of Federal loans at \n10 percent of discretionary income and forgives payments after 20 \nyears. This represents an important investment not only in our \nchildren's future but in the future of our country. It will pay \nenormous dividends.\n  This investment isn't just smart, it is fully paid for. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates this legislation will reduce the \nnational debt and deficit by $10 billion over the next 10 years. We \naccomplish that by eliminating what amounts to billions of dollars in \nwasteful spending within the Federal student loan program.\n\n  Let me explain. Currently, some Federal student loans are made \nthrough the Direct Loan Program, while others are made through the \nFederal Family Education Loan Program, the so-called FFEL Program. This \nprogram overpays banks for servicing these Federal loans. The result is \nthat money intended to help students go on to a higher education ends \nup instead helping to pad the profits of those lenders. That is a waste \nof money.\n  What is more, banks in the FFEL Program get their loan guarantee and \ninterest subsidy entitlements regardless of how they treat the student \nborrowers. While they bank the profits when the loans are repaid, \ntaxpayers end up shouldering the risk of defaults. So our legislation \nconverts all future Federal student loans to direct loans.\n  This doesn't cut the private sector out of the student loan industry. \nWhat it does is as American as apple pie. It makes them compete. It \nends these unnecessary payments and force banks to compete for the job \nof servicing student loans. When institutions have to compete, \nconsumers benefit.\n  For students and parents, it means better customer service and the \nsame good rates that have always been the hallmark of Federal student \nloans.\n  As for taxpayers, it means a savings of $61 billion over 10 years, \nmoney that now flows into the coffers of banks, but under this \nlegislation will be used to help more kids go on to college and bring \ndown our national deficit.\n  In short, what we have here is a win-win, a fully paid for and much \nneeded investment in equal opportunity and American competitiveness. I \nwould be remiss if I did not note that we could and should be doing \nmore. It comes as a serious disappointment to me and to education \nadvocates across the country that funding for a new early childhood \nlearning initiative was not included in this package. I desperately \nwanted it to be there, as did my friend Tom Harkin from Iowa who has \nworked with me, along with others, for years on early education. As \nimportant as it is to enable a high school student to graduate and \nattend college, it is just as critical that we prepare every child to \nbe a viable candidate for their next step in the education process. The \nachievement gap that robs too many American children of their \nopportunity begins very early, before the age of 3, according to \neverything we know about child development. You know the statistics, as \nmost of us do. Investments in early childhood education pay off tenfold \nwhen we consider the decreases in crime, the reduced need for special \neducation and welfare services, and improved health of these children \nwho have access to early education.\n  Just as the increasingly competitive global economy calls us to \nunlock the door to higher education, we must also do everything we can \nto bring every American child to that threshold of maximizing his or \nher potential. That important work requires a serious commitment to \nearly education. This legislation would have been a perfect opportunity \nto follow through on that commitment. So the fight will continue, \nunfortunately, without the strength this bill would have provided. But \nfor now we have the chance to do some real good for young people and \nfor our Nation.\n  I urge my fellow Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to support \nthis commonsense measure, save the Pell Grant Program, and make a real \ndifference in the lives of countless young Americans for years to come. \nI remind my colleagues this is just part of what is at stake in this \ndebate. The amendments being offered, on too many occasions by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, are doing nothing more than \ntrying to stop this legislation from going forward. I hope that will \nstop. Let's pass this bill. We have a chance to not only change the \nquality of health in America but also to open the doors of opportunity \nfor American students.\n  For those reasons, I urge adoption of this package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to Senator McCain such time as he may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I read a lot about what has been going on \nin the\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nhealth care debate, and all of us have. Americans are very aware of it. \nI keep hearing the word ``historic'' this, ``historic'' that, \n``historic.'' I agree. It is historic. This is a historic vote, and I \nthink we are pretty aware of what the outcome will be sometime tonight, \ntomorrow, or the next day. It is the first time in history, the history \nof this country, that a major reform has been enacted on a purely \npartisan basis, the first time.\n  Every major reform throughout history has had significant--you can go \ndown the list--bipartisanship votes. In the 1970s--this one, purely \npartisan, rammed through from beginning to whatever this end is.\n\n  It is historic, and it is the first time that a process called \nreconciliation has ever been used to affect one-sixth of the gross \nnational product. I know the response will be: Well, Republicans did \nit--et cetera, et cetera. It will be the first time that 51 votes has \nbeen the measure of a decision on so-called reconciliation. Now, that \nis historic. That is historic because we have basically broken down the \n60-vote tradition of the Senate when we address it in this fashion--an \nissue of this magnitude.\n  Let me tell you, when the President of the United States was still a \nSenator--another time we were doing reconciliation--what he said:\n\n       You know, the Founders designed this system, as frustrating \n     [as] it is, to make sure that there's a broad consensus \n     before the country moves forward. . . . And what we have now \n     is a president----\n\n  He was referring to former President Bush--\n\n     who . . . [h]asn't gotten his way. And that is now prompting, \n     you know, a change in the Senate rules that really I think \n     would change the character of the Senate forever. . . . And \n     what I worry about would be you essentially have still two \n     chambers--the House and the Senate--but you have simply \n     majoritarian absolute power on either side, and that's just \n     not what the founders intended.\n\n  That is what Barack Obama, the Senator from Illinois, said.\n  So here we are. Yes, it is historic. It is historic. And it is \nhistoric what we have seen take place from the beginning. We have seen \nthe special interests. We have seen the votes, the provisions in these \nbills that carve out special deals for special interests and special \nStates, such as the ``Louisiana purchase,'' the $100 million inserted \nin this 2,733-page document that builds a hospital in Connecticut. Why \nConnecticut? Why $100 million? Why is it that there are these special \nprovisions for certain locations in the country?\n  It is historic in the special deals that have been cut--for PhRMA, \nfor the American Medical Association, for the hospital association, for \nthe unions in the taxation of Cadillac plans. Everybody has a deal but \nthe American citizen--the average American.\n  How many Americans, how many ordinary Americans who are, say, \nenrollees in Medicare Advantage in my State, who are going to see the \nMedicare Advantage program cut drastically--how many of them were \nallowed in the majority leader's office? How many of them were allowed \nin the Speaker's office? How many of them were allowed in the White \nHouse as the special interests' representatives went in and out?\n  So there are winners and losers. That is what is being judged. The \nwinners will be those who live in favored States who will have special \ndeals. There will be those who are winners--PhRMA, the hospital \nassociation, the unions. Again, my congratulations to PhRMA. They are \nrunning $100 million-some worth of ads favoring this deal because they \ngot a deal that is worth billions--worth billions.\n  As I have quoted on the floor several times, their head lobbyists, or \n$2 million-a-year lobbyists, said: A deal is a deal. We expect the \nWhite House to keep it.\n  So who are the losers? Who are the losers? Well, the first loser is \nthe Senate because, as I said before, this reconciliation, requiring \nonly 51 votes, is a radical departure from anything we have done in the \npast. I do not accept the statement that it has been done in the past--\nnot when it affects one-sixth of the gross national product, and as a \ndirect result of the vote in the State of Massachusetts that gave this \nside 41 votes. If they still had 60 votes, we would not be doing this \non reconciliation. We would be doing it in the regular way we address \nlegislation--legislation through the House, legislation through the \nSenate, a conference committee, and then, obviously, a final vote. But \nthey cannot afford a final vote because there are 41 votes now, not 60. \nSo the Senate is a major casualty of this process.\n  But the biggest losers probably are average citizens--average \ncitizens who were told the Congressional Budget Office judged this to \nbe deficit-neutral, and it would not cost the taxpayers additional \nmoney. I just had a conversation with the Senator from Montana who said \nclearly we are not going to cut physician payments by 21 percent; so, \ntherefore, the assumption they gave the Congressional Budget Office is \nfalse--is false. So before we go any further, it is already a $150 \nbillion deficit because everybody knows we are not going to cut \nphysicians' payments by 21 percent.\n  So the American people are the ones who never had access to get a \nspecial deal. And 330,000 citizens of my State who have enjoyed and \nchosen the Medicare Advantage program are now going to see those \nbenefits slashed. But the average citizen who thinks today there is a \nhuge disconnect between their lives and that of the life that is led \nhere and the way we do business here--last Saturday, I was in my own \nhome State of Arizona. I did two townhall meetings, one in Prescott and \none in East Valley Phoenix, and people are hurting. People are hurting, \npeople are angry, they are frustrated, and they feel there is a huge \ndisconnect between themselves and Washington. I come back the next day, \nand they are drinking champagne in celebration of a ``historic'' \nvictory. Americans do not get it. Americans do not get it. They are \nangry. They are frustrated.\n  I want to assure them--I want to assure them--this fight is not over. \nWe will take it, as I mentioned before, to the towns and cities of \nAmerica. We will have townhall meetings all over the country. We will \nregister voters. We will urge them to turn out. We will urge them to \ntake part in one of the most seismic elections in the history of this \ncountry.\n  I know the liberal media is saying: The American people are going to \nmove on. Well, they are not going to move on. They are not going to \nmove on because they are sick and tired of the spending and the \ngenerational theft we have committed on future generations of \nAmericans. This is only one part of their frustration. It is a big \npart, but it is only one part.\n  So I know I speak for my colleagues when I say this fight is far from \nover. This struggle to regain control of this body and this institution \nin Washington, DC, and give it back to the people of this country will \ngo on.\n  I have great faith in this country and its future. That is why I am \nconfident that over time, sooner or later, we will be back and we will \nrepeal and we will replace--we will replace--this huge government \ntakeover with medical malpractice reform, with going across State lines \nto get insurance of your choice, to reward wellness and fitness, to \nestablish risk pools that insurance companies will bid on in order to \ntreat people with preexisting conditions. We have a long list we will \nreplace this mortgaging of America's future with that will be what all \nAmericans want; that is, to maintain the quality of health care in \nAmerica and, at the same time, bring costs under control.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his leadership. I thank \nthe Senator from Montana for his courtesy during this debate over these \ndays and weeks and even months, on days and nights and weekends. I want \nto assure my colleagues this debate is far from over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I just want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his excellent summation of where this issue lies and its \nimpact on the American people. I hope that statement will be read \nacross this country because it was a reflection of the concerns which \nare legitimate and which are being expressed by vast amounts of \nAmericans. It is not unusual it should be expressed by the Senator from \nArizona because he is so much a personality of this Nation and a force \nwithin our political process.\n  I would reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, who has been so involved in health legislation, \neducation legislation. Might I ask, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 11 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield as much time to the Senator as he \nwishes to take, including 11 minutes 48 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I thank him for all of his great \nleadership, and also Senator Dodd, who just spoke.\n  If I might just add a little historical footnote. Senator Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee; Senator Dodd, who led the effort \nthrough the HELP Committee; myself, as now chairman of the HELP \nCommittee; Chairman Miller on the House side, chairman of the Education \nand Labor Committee; and Chairman Waxman, the chairman of the \nHouse Commerce Committee--all of whom had big parts of the whole health \ncare bill to develop--a historical footnote: We were all sworn in on \nthe same day in January of 1975. It was a great class, and our \nclassmates, as history would have it, survived to be able to put \ntogether this great health care bill.\n\n  I again want to thank my longtime friend and colleague from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, for his extreme patience and his endurance in getting \nus to this point.\n  Mr. President, we are in the midst of a historic week in this \nNation's Capital. Health care reform is no longer a bill; it is the law \nof the land. It has been signed.\n  Just as the history books remember 1935 as the year FDR signed Social \nSecurity into law, and 1965 as the year when Lyndon Johnson signed \nMedicare into law, they will now remember the year 2010 as the year \nPresident Barack Obama signed comprehensive health reform into law.\n  Each of these three bills marked a giant step forward for the \nAmerican people. Each was stridently opposed by the special interests \nand defenders of the status quo. But in the end--in 1935, in 1965, and \nnow in 2010--a critical mass of Senators and Representatives rose to \nthe historic occasion. They voted their hopes, not their fears. They \ncreated a better, fairer, more compassionate America for all of our \ncitizens.\n  As a Nobel Prize-winning economist recently put it, the new health \nreform law is a ``victory for America's soul''--a ``victory for \nAmerica's soul.'' At long last, we are realizing Senator Ted Kennedy's \ngreat dream of extending access to quality, affordable health insurance \nto every American. We are ending the last shameful bastion of legal \ndiscrimination and exclusion in our country.\n  Think about it: Over the decades, we have outlawed discrimination \nbased on race, color, and national origin. We have outlawed \ndiscrimination based on gender and religion. We have outlawed \ndiscrimination based on age and disability. But until now, it has been \nperfectly legal to discriminate against our fellow Americans because of \nillness--because of illness--and to exclude tens of millions of our \ncitizens from decent health care simply because they could not afford \ninsurance or afford health care--blatant discrimination.\n  When President Obama signed health care reform into law on Tuesday, \nhe set in motion a series of changes that will tear down these last \nbarriers of discrimination and exclusion. That truly is a great moral \nvictory. It is, indeed, a victory for America's soul.\n  But our work is not done. The reconciliation bill now before us \nincludes a number of modifications to strengthen the new health care \nreform law. It also includes reforms in the student lending program \nthat in their own way are also profound and historic. I regret these \nlandmark education reforms have not gotten the attention they deserve.\n  Senator Dodd--I just listened to his speech--outlined in great detail \nwhat these reforms are and what they will mean for our families and for \nour students.\n  This bill in front of us now eliminates $61 billion in wasteful \nsubsidies to banks and redirects most of that money to low-income \ncollege students in the form of increased Pell grants. The status quo \nin student lending is a bizarre Rube Goldberg process that makes no \nsense. The Federal Government pays private banks to make entirely risk-\nfree loans. The banks then sell the loans back to the Federal \nGovernment and pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. This is \na brazen case of corporate welfare--a huge government giveaway to \nbankers. This bill at long last will put a stop to it.\n  Mr. President, I want to state forthrightly I am not antibanker. I am \nnot antibank. I have family members in the banking business and they do \na great job. But who does not like free money? If you give the banks \nfree money, they love it. But if we have money we want to give away, I \nsay do not give it to the banks. Give it to low-income students so they \ncan go to college. Banks have lots of ways in which they can make \nmoney. A low-income student has no other way to go to college but that \nwe provide him and her access to meaningful Pell grants. I am \ndisappointed our Republican colleagues are doing everything in their \npower to delay and obstruct and to kill this bill. Reportedly, they now \nplan to offer dozens and dozens of largely meaningless amendments to \ntry to stretch the process out and delay a final vote. One might call \nthis the Republican version of March madness. They know it is going to \nend; they just want to drag it out.\n\n  Let's be clear what is at stake. A vote against this bill is a vote \nagainst eliminating the doughnut hole in the Medicare prescription drug \nplan for seniors. A vote against this bill is a vote against parents' \nrights to keep their kids on health insurance plans until age 26. A \nvote against this bill is a vote against a tough new crackdown on fraud \nand abuse in Medicare and Medicaid Programs. A vote against this bill \nis a vote against ending discrimination against rural areas in Medicare \nreimbursement rates. A vote against this bill is a vote against ending \ntens of billions of dollars in corporate welfare for banks, a vote \nagainst redirecting that money to more generous Pell grants for needy \ncollege students.\n  I might add, a vote against this bill is a vote against a very \nimportant provision. I know an amendment has been offered to do away \nwith what is called the CLASS Act. The CLASS Act is now the law of the \nland. Here is what it is. It is a voluntary program. No one has to join \nit. It is fiscally solvent for 75 years. All it says is that an \nindividual during their working years can set aside some money. If \nthey, God forbid, become disabled, they can have some income to be able \nto live in their own homes and not be put in a nursing home. That is \nthe law of the land right now, and there is an amendment before us to \ndo away with that. Over 275 groups representing people with \ndisabilities and seniors support the CLASS Act, and we ought to keep it \nin the law and not repeal it with an amendment.\n  In short, those who are determined to kill this reconciliation bill \nneed to decide whose side they are on. Are they going to continue their \ndie-hard defense of the health insurance companies and the banks or are \nthey going to stand with ordinary Americans who want access to quality, \naffordable, reliable health coverage and with needy young people who \nneed Pell grants in order to go to college? It is time to choose.\n  We are going to have a whole series of amendments. Oh, some of them \nwill sound nice. Some of them I would probably like to vote for myself \nif they weren't to this bill. But we can't be lured into this by the \nsiren song of amendments that sound good but only have one purpose; \nthat is, to kill this bill, to delay it, to kill it, to make sure it is \nnot enacted into law. That is the only purpose of these amendments, \nmake no mistake about it. So when an amendment comes up that I like and \nI might want to support, I will vote against it because it is that \nimportant to make sure this reconciliation bill gets passed and sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  So I say to all of my friends on this side of the aisle: Don't be \nlured. Don't be lured by the siren song of amendments that may sound \ngood. Don't be afraid that somehow they are going to use it against you \nin a campaign. Hey, they can use anything against you in a campaign. We \nall know that by now. Let's stand united. Let's stand strong. Let's say \nno to these amendments designed only to kill this bill.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of the Health Care and \nEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010, to defeat all of the amendments. \nLet's get this bill to the President, let's help our students get to \ncollege, and let's help the people of this country have better health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments raised by my Republican \ncolleagues regarding the landmark new health reform law just signed \ninto law by President Obama is that it is unconstitutional. Well, I \nstrongly disagree. One example of the strong constitutional basis of \nthe new law is outlined by the American Constitution Society in a paper \nreleased at the end of last year.\n  I commend this paper to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent its \nconclusions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, Dec. 2009]\n\n           Mandatory Health Insurance: Is It Constitutional?\n\n                           (By Simon Lazarus)\n\n\n     VI. Conclusion: mandatory insurance is neither burdensome nor \n                             unprecedented.\n\n       A major reason why all opponents' legal arguments fall \n     short is that they share a common factual foundation, which \n     itself is a fallacy. Their root assumption, or assertion, is \n     that requiring Americans to carry health insurance is both \n     extraordinarily novel--``unprecedented''--and extraordinarily \n     burdensome. But this endlessly repeated assertion is \n     specious, for several reasons:\n       To begin with, experience demonstrates that mandatory \n     health insurance is neither unprecedented nor burdensome. \n     Hundreds of millions of millions of individuals live under a \n     variety of mandatory health insurance regimes, with very high \n     rates of compliance and no record of discontent with the \n     requirement, in other advanced economies and, indeed, as \n     noted above, in Massachusetts.\n       As noted above, the overwhelming majority of Americans \n     already carry health insurance that satisfies the terms of \n     the mandate, so they will not be affected by the mandate at \n     all. Of the approximately 46 million Americans who currently \n     lack health insurance, the majority are in this state only \n     because it is unavailable or unaffordable, and they of \n     course, will welcome the opportunity presented by the \n     legislation to gain coverage.\n       For those currently uninsured Americans who would prefer to \n     forego the cost of coverage, even with whatever level of \n     subsidy they will be in a position to claim, the mandate is \n     no more a burden than the requirement to pay Social Security \n     and Medicare taxes--indeed, it is less, since the coverage \n     they receive in return is available immediately, not when \n     they reach eligibility in their 60s.\n       By conceding that social and health insurance taxes are \n     constitutionally valid restrictions on individual liberty, \n     while condemning functionally equivalent contributions to \n     private insurers, opponents effectively contend that a \n     single-payer, government-run program like Medicare is the \n     only type of universal health insurance system Congress may \n     establish. The Constitution surely does not impose such an \n     arbitrary strait jacket on Congress.\n       The great majority of Americans live in jurisdictions that \n     require the purchase of automobile insurance. Health care \n     reform opponents claim that these state mandatory auto \n     insurance regimes are not ``precedents'' for federal \n     mandatory health insurance, for a variety of essentially \n     legalistic reasons. For example, they assert that auto \n     insurance is a voluntary payment in exchange for a \n     ``privilege,'' permission to drive on public roads. But for \n     most people, driving is an economic necessity. In terms of \n     its actual impact on people, mandatory auto insurance is a \n     common-sense indicator of whether the public would find novel \n     or inherently burdensome a mandate to purchase health \n     insurance from the private insurance industry.\n       If, as opponents claim, the burden of mandatory health \n     contributions was--in principle--oppressive and unfair, \n     Medicare, and for that matter Social Security taxes would \n     raise constitutional questions no less than if these landmark \n     statutory programs were cast as regulations of interstate \n     commerce. In fact, of course, since 1937, such questions have \n     never been raised either in the courts or in Congress. The \n     reason is simple: most people regard these mandatory \n     contributions--in light of what they expect to receive in \n     exchange--as a bargain not a burden.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this bill makes unprecedented investments \nto expand high-quality educational opportunities for all Americans. It \ninvests in the Pell grant scholarship award, strengthens historically \nBlack colleges and universities and other minority-serving \ninstitutions, and provides more resources to States for college access \nand other supports for students through the college access challenge \ngrant program.\n  Further, these investments are paid for without increasing our \nNation's deficit, through key reforms in the Federal student loan \nprograms designed to provide a stronger, more reliable, and more \nefficient student loan system. The legislation directs more than $10 \nbillion of the savings generated under this legislation to paying down \nthe country's deficit.\n  The education provisions of this legislation will convert all new \nFederal student loans to the Direct Loan Program starting in July 2010, \nsaving $61 billion over the next 10 years. These changes will also \nupgrade the customer service borrowers receive when repaying their \nloans. The legislation will also maintain jobs by ensuring a robust \nrole for the private sector, allowing lenders and not-for-profits to \ncontract with the Department of Education to service Direct loans.\n  The legislation significantly increases the Federal Pell grant award; \nthe cornerstone of need-based Federal student assistance since its \ncreation in 1972. Investments in this program are essential to ensuring \naccess to higher education and making college more affordable for \nstudents and families. Both the House and Senate authorizing and \nappropriating committees have made significant investments in \nincreasing the maximum Pell grant award in the past few years--32 \npercent since 2006. This legislation includes $36 billion to help \naddress the Pell grant shortfall in fiscal year 2011 and to increase \nthe maximum Pell grant to $5,550 in 2010 and to $5,975 by 2017. \nStarting in 2013, the grant will be linked to match rising costs of \nliving for 5 years by indexing it to the Consumer Price Index.\n  The legislation includes $750 million to bolster college access and \nother supports for students. It will more than double funding for the \ncollege access challenge grant program to fund programs in every State \nthat focus on informing students about college options and financing, \nincreasing financial literacy and helping students persist from year to \nyear and graduate.\n  While this legislation seeks to ensure increased access and success \nfor all students, we intend for the Secretary to work with States to \naddress the unique access issues faced by underserved communities, \nincluding: low-income individuals, individuals with disabilities, \nhomeless and foster care youth, disconnected youth, nontraditional \nstudents, members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in \nhigher education, individuals with limited English proficiency, \nveterans, including those just returning from active duty, and \ndislocated workers.\n  The legislation also includes a continuation of funding for \ninvestments in historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-\nserving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, institutions \nserving Alaska and Hawaiian Natives, predominantly Black institutions, \ninstitutions serving Asian American and Pacific Islanders, and \ninstitutions serving Native Americans, first made under the College \nCost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, recognizing the critical role \nthese institutions play in serving the Nation's minority populations. \nMinority serving institutions educate more than half 58 percent, of \nminority undergraduate students. While Hispanic serving-institutions \n(HSIs) comprise less than 8 percent of colleges and universities \nnationwide, they consistently graduate approximately one-third of all \nHispanic students with degrees in science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics. Similarly, even though historically Black colleges and \nuniversities only make up 3 percent of all colleges and universities \nthey graduate 40 percent of African Americans with degrees in science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics. These schools also produce 50 \npercent of African-American teachers and 40 percent of African-American \nhealth professionals.\n  Concerning the servicing contracts with eligible not-for-profit \nservicers, this legislation recognizes that not-for-profit servicers \nplay a unique and valuable role in helping students in their States \nsucceed in postsecondary education and that students should continue to \nbenefit from the assistance provided by not-for-profit servicers.\n  Including more high-quality servicers in the contracting process will \nincrease competition amongst servicers and deliver better customer \nservice for student borrowers. Under the bill, not-for-profit servicers \nwill be allocated a minimum of 100,000 borrower loan accounts as a \nstarting\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\npoint. The Secretary of Education has been given the authority to \nincrease or decrease that volume based on factors that include capacity \nand customer service. With sufficient loan volume and competitive \nservicing rates, eligible not-for-profit servicers can individually or \ncollectively generate sufficient revenue to continue the valuable \nservices they provide to borrowers. Because of the significant increase \nin loan volume as all Federal loans are moved to the Direct Loan \nProgram, additional servicing capacity will be needed and is provided \nfor through the contracts provision. I encourage the Secretary to \nimplement these provisions in a timely manner so that many local not-\nfor-profit servicers will continue to play a role in the student loan \nprogram.\n  The Department of Education should use the not-for-profit servicers \nto increase competition and quality in the student loan programs. To \nensure that occurs, the Department must hold not-for-profit lenders to \nthe same high standards of quality, performance and integrity used for \nother Department of Education loan servicers. This bill would require \nthat eligible not-for-profit servicers meet the same standards for \nservicing Federal assets as apply to all other servicing contracts \nunder section 456. These standards relate to: information technology \nsecurity; financial reporting; collection and payment processing by the \nDepartment of the Treasury; internal control management; and, Federal \naccounting practices and debt management. The standards are derived \nfrom a variety of statutory and other sources of guidance, including \nthe Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3541 \net seq.); the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a); the Federal Financial \nManagement Improvement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208); the Debt Collection \nImprovement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-134);the Federal Managers Financial \nIntegrity Act (31 U.S.C. 3512); the Chief Financial Officers Act of \n1990 (31 U.S.C. 901 et seq.); the ``Government Management Reform Act of \n1994'' (P.L. 103-356); OMB Circulars A-123 (Management's Responsibility \nfor Internal Control), A-127 (Financial Management Systems), and A-129 \n(Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables); and the \nTreasury Financial Manual.\n  Critical amendments will be made in America's community colleges \nthrough one additional important program that is funded in the Finance \nCommittee's title of this bill. Community colleges serve an \ninstrumental role in both our education and workforce systems. They \nprovide needed postsecondary education and job training, particularly \nto individuals and families hardest hit by difficult economic times. \nThis includes workers eligible for training under the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance for workers program, individuals who are, or may become \neligible for unemployment compensation, and other individuals who have \nbeen impacted by the economic and employment crisis. To ensure that \nthese institutions have access to the resources they need to develop \nand improve educational and career training programs designed to meet \nthe needs of the workers in the affected communities, the legislation \ndirects the Secretary of Labor to award community college career \ntraining grants especially to struggling 2-year public community \ncolleges, (as defined in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of \n1965. As the legislation ensures that all States benefit from these \nresources with the inclusion of a State minimum, I also encourage that \nthe Secretary strive to ensure a diverse geographical representation of \ncommunity colleges in both urban and rural areas and to provide grants \nto both large and small community colleges. Finally, in order to ensure \nthat these grants reach the institutions and students they are intended \nto serve, I encourage the Secretary of Labor to consult with the \nSecretary of Education in implementing grants provided under this \nprogram. I also remind the Secretary of Labor in implementing this \nprogram that community colleges are public 2-year degree-granting \ninstitutions of higher education that offer associate's degrees; or \npublic 4-year institutions of higher education that offer associate's \ndegrees, are not located reasonably close to a community college, and \nhave an open enrollment policy for certificate or associate's degree \nprograms; or tribal colleges or universities. This should be the \nuniverse of institutions awarded grants under the community college and \ncareer training grants program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document entitled ``Constitutional Findings regarding the Individual \nResponsibility Requirement.''

Some individuals currently make an \n     economic and financial decision to forego health insurance \n     coverage and self-insure, paying for charges for services \n     directly to the provider and relying on uncompensated care. \n     The decision by individuals not to purchase health insurance \n     has many substantial effects on the national economy, the \n     national marketplace for health insurance, and interstate \n     commerce. Individuals who fail to purchase health insurance \n     have a diminished capacity to purchase health care services, \n     and increase overall health care costs. When such individuals \n     inevitably seek medical care, the costs of that caremust \n     often be paid for by providers, insured individuals and \n     businesses through higher premiums, or Federal, State, and \n     local governments. The requirement encourages prepayment for \n     services, and affects an individual's decision whether or not \n     to purchase health insurance by imposing penalties on \n     individuals who remain uninsured. Congressional Budget \n     Office, Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance \n     Proposals, December 2008.\n       (2) The uninsured receive about $86,000,000,000 in health \n     care, of which about $56,000,000,000 is uncompensated. \n     Private spending on uncompensated care is $14,500,000,000, \n     and includes profits forgone by physicians and hospitals. \n     Government spending on uncompensated care is $42,900,000,000, \n     and is financed by taxpayers at both the State and Federal \n     levels.

Health Affairs, \n     August 25, 2008.\n       (4) Those who have private health insurance also pay for \n     uncompensated care.

Massachusetts Division of Healthcare Finance and \n     Policy.\n       (8) By regulating the decision to self-insure, and \n     expanding coverage, the requirement addresses the problem of \n     free riders who rely on more costly uncompensated care, \n     shifting costs to medical providers, taxpayers, and the \n     privately insured. It will also reduce the cost to the \n     national economy of the lower productivity of the uninsured.\n       (9) The requirement is necessary to achieve near-universal \n     coverage while maintaining the current private-public system. \n     It builds upon and strengthens private employer-based health \n     insurance, which covers 176,000,000 Americans nationwide. In \n     Massachusetts, a similar requirement has strengthened \n     employer-based coverage: despite the economic downturn, the \n     number of workers offered employer-based coverage has \n     actually increased.

Long and Karen Stockley, \n     Massachusetts Health Reform: Employer Coverage from \n     Employees' Perspective, Health Affairs, October 1, 2009.\n       (10) Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     if there were no requirement, many individuals would wait to \n     purchase health insurance until they needed care. Higher-risk \n     individuals would be more likely to enroll in coverage, \n     increasing premiums and costs to the government. The Urban \n     Institute, January 2008.

It is necessary to \n     create effective private health insurance markets throughout \n     the country in which improved health insurance products that \n     are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-\n     existing conditions can be sold.\n       (11) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     Congressional Budget Office, December 2008. The requirement \n     is necessary to create effective private health insurance \n     markets throughout the country that do not require \n     underwriting, eliminating its associated administrative \n     costs. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage \n     and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase \n     economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     will significantly reduce administrative costs and lower \n     health insurance premiums.\n       (12) Health insurance and health care services are a \n     substantial part of the national economy. National health \n     spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or \n     17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in \n     2019.

Since most health insurance is sold by national or \n     regional health insurance companies, health insurance is sold \n     in interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       (13) The requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, will add more \n     than 30,000,000 consumers to the health insurance market. \n     Congressional Budget Office, Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, Incorporating the Manager's Amendment, \n     December 19, 2009.

The \n     requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of \n     economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would \n     undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.\n       (15) Payments collected from individuals who fail to \n     maintain minimum essential coverage will contribute revenue \n     that will help the Federal government finance a reformed \n     health insurance system that ensures the availability of \n     health insurance to all Americans.\n       The preceding 15 points cite numerous studies and papers \n     which illustrate the extensive evidence that the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by Section \n     1002 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, \n     substantially affects interstate commerce. These citations \n     are included as hyperlinks or in their written entirety for \n     the record.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of a bill that \nbuilds upon the health care reform legislation that was signed into law \nyesterday.\n  The new--and historic--law combined with the bill the Senate is now \nconsidering, will reform our health care system to reduce costs and \nimprove patient care for North Carolina families and families across \nAmerica.\n  In 1996, the average family premium was $6,000. Today it is $12,000. \nWithout health care reform, premiums would skyrocket to $24,000 by \n2016--or half of the average North Carolina family income.\n  Without reform, health care costs were projected to reach 20 percent \nof GDP, or $4.3 trillion, by 2017. This trajectory was simply \nunsustainable.\n  After decades of working to fix a broken health care system, \nPresident Obama yesterday signed into law a reform bill that controls \nexploding costs, increases access to health care and reduces our long-\nterm deficit by as much as $1.2 trillion within 20 years.\n  By passing this bill, we will reduce the deficit, for a total savings \nof $143 billion by 2019.\n  In addition to containing costs, health care reform will improve \naccess and quality of health care for millions of Americans. 1.7 \nmillion North Carolinians without insurance will now have access to a \nfamily doctor.\n  It will provide immediate benefits to small businesses, middle class \nfamilies, and seniors in North Carolina.\n  While small businesses make up 98 percent of North Carolina's private \nsector employers, in 2008, only 38 percent offered health insurance.\n  Small business owners I talk to want to provide coverage for their \nemployees, but costs are prohibitive. This month, I received an e-mail \nfrom a small chiropractic practice in eastern North Carolina that had \nto drop its health insurance plan for employees because rates were \ndoubled over 2 years. Most of the practice's employees are young women \nunder 30.\n  But starting today, 112,000 North Carolina small businesses will be \neligible for tax credits to provide health care to employees.\n  Within the next 6 months, hard-working, middle-class families will be \nable to add their children up to age 26 onto their health plans. This \nwill benefit about 877,000 young adults in North Carolina.\n  This year, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny \ncoverage to a child for a preexisting condition, like asthma or \ndiabetes.\n  Health care reform means people can access preventive care without \nbeing saddled with copays or deductibles. This includes well-child \nvisits and seasonal flu immunizations.\n  I recently heard a story about a North Carolinian who, as a junior in \ncollege, had terrible stomachaches. But he could not afford a \ncolonoscopy. He learned of his colon cancer too late for the doctors to \nsave him. Health care reform means this young man would have had a \nchance.\n  Health care reform means people with chronic illnesses will no longer \nhave to fear losing their insurance because of an arbitrary, insurance \ncompany-set lifetime cap.\n  And it means insurance companies will no longer be able to drop your \ncoverage because you get sick or file too many claims.\n  Seniors also will see immediate benefits. In North Carolina, 1.4 \nmillion seniors will receive preventive services with no additional \ncosts, and 247,000 seniors will have their drug costs in the ``donut \nhole'' immediately reduced and eventually eliminated.\n  I am proud of these immediate benefits and our efforts to reform the \nhealth care system for the long term.\n  This reform effort contains provisions that I have championed since \ncoming to the Senate. In the United States, 23 million adults and \nchildren suffer from diabetes, and in North Carolina, diabetes costs \nour State $5.3 billion per year in medical interventions, lost \nproductivity, and premature mortality.\n  Given these dire numbers, I added to the health care reform bill the \nsecond\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\npiece of legislation I introduced as a U.S. Senator--The Catalyst to \nBetter Diabetes Care Act. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, \ncosponsored the bill last July. It creates a national and State-by-\nState level diabetes report card to track progress at beating the \ndisease. It also requires the promotion of physician education on \nproperly completing birth and death certificates, and requires that \nrecommendations be made on appropriate levels of diabetes medical \neducation that should be completed prior to medical licensing and board \ncertification.\n  I also worked with the Senior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, to \nadd a section to health care reform to improve access to health care in \nrural areas. The section we added will help medical schools establish \nprograms designed to increase the number of graduates who practice in \nrural areas. It will give schools resources to recruit students from \nrural areas who have an interest in practicing medicine in their \ncommunities, and it provides for additional training in pediatrics, \nemergency medicine, obstetrics and behavioral health.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to discuss how the bill the \nSenate is currently considering will help make college affordable for \nour families.\n  One of the most significant provisions for our students in this \nlegislation is the over $2.5 billion investment over the next 10 years \nin historically Black colleges and universities.\n  There are 10 outstanding HBCUs in North Carolina. HBCUs graduate 40 \npercent of African Americans with degrees in science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics; 50 percent of African-American teachers; \nand 40 percent of African-American health professionals.\n  North Carolina A, an HBCU in my hometown of Greensboro, graduates \nmore African Americans with PhDs in engineering than any other school \nin the country.\n  This is a milestone week for the State of North Carolina. I am \nworking with my colleagues to send this bill to the President's desk to \nfurther reduce costs for North Carolina's families and small \nbusinesses.\n  This health care reform effort would not have been possible without \nthe work of some tenacious Capitol Hill staff, and I want to personally \nthank my two incredible health care staffers, Michelle Adams and Tracy \nZvenyach, who worked countless hours for reform in our country.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of the Health \nCare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. I assert \nthat the investment we make in education with this bill is an \ninvestment in America's economic future.\n  For too long, we have allowed America to lag behind other nations in \neducation, specifically in the number of college graduates we produce. \nNo more. Now is the time to train our workforce to compete in the \nglobal economy. Now is the time to provide affordable, accessible, \nquality educational opportunities so that America will shine as a \nbeacon of ingenuity and prosperity once again. This bill answers the \ncall by making college more affordable and accessible.\n  Perhaps most significantly, the bill invests in and protects the Pell \ngrant scholarship. It provides $36 billion over 10 years for this \nprogram which allows so many to attend college who would not otherwise \nhave the opportunity. This includes funding to cover a shortfall due to \ndemand. The failing economy has spurred a dramatic increase the number \nof those students who are eligible for Pell grants. In 2007, there were \n5 million Pell grant recipients. In 2009-2010, there were 8.3 million. \nThe bill also provides an increase in the maximum annual award which \nwill ultimately be indexed to the Consumer Price Index and thus linked \nto increases in the cost of living.\n  In Maryland, over 85,000 students depend on Pell grants to help them \nattend college. With the additional funding, that number is expected to \nrise to 100,000. That is 15,000 additional students who have the \nopportunity to share in the American dream! Students like Morris \nJohnson from Baltimore. Morris is a double major in sociology and \ncommunications at Goucher College with a 3.5 grade point average. \nMorris credits those who believed in him and his academic promise for \nkeeping his dream of attending college alive. But without financial \naid, including a Pell grant, that dream would have been out of reach.\n  For those who find it necessary to borrow to finance their education, \nthe bill solidifies a mechanism for obtaining high-quality student \nloans. The direct loan program is a reliable lender and cost-effective \nmechanism for taxpayers. Beginning in July of this year, all new \nstudent loans will be originated through the direct loan program. This \nwill bring an end to the costly federally-guaranteed student loan \nprogram that generated billions of dollars in subsidies for banks--at \nthe expense of additional financial aid for more deserving students. \nInstead, direct loans will be serviced by contracted private lenders. \nFurther, direct loans can only be serviced in the United States, \nthereby preserving American jobs.\n  The bill also makes it easier for new borrowers after 2014 to repay \nFederal loans by lowering the existing cap on monthly Federal student \nloan payments from 15 percent to 10 percent of discretionary income. \nThe legislation provides $1.5 billion for this income-based repayment \nprogram.\n  Just paying for college, however, isn't enough. We need to make sure \nour students succeed in college and graduate. To that end, the bill \nsupports additional key investments:\n  The bill dramatically increases funding for the College Access \nChallenge Grant program. This program funds innovative financial \nliteracy and retention projects. This will increase the number of low-\nincome students who are adequately prepared for the financial \nchallenges of paying for college and related expenses.\n  The bill underscores the role of minority-serving institutions in \neducating the Nation's low-income and minority students by providing \n$2.5 billion to support these institutions. This funding represents a \nsignificant investment in Maryland where we have four outstanding \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities. The bill also recognizes \nthe role of community colleges and provides $2 billion for a \ncompetitive grant program to develop and improve career training \nprograms.\n  I said the time for making college more accessible and affordable has \ncome and I believe that. But we also have to be fiscally responsible. \nThis bill is both. It makes historic investments in Federal financial \naid and yet comes at no cost to the taxpayers. This is possible by \nswitching all Federal loans to the direct loan program. Doing so saves \ntaxpayers a huge amount in subsidies that were going to the banks. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this savings will amount \nto $61 billion over 10 years. Even with the improvements, these \neducation provisions in the legislation will reduce the deficit by $10 \nbillion over 10 years, at least.\n  The education provisions in this legislation make college more \naffordable and accessible. It's necessary for America's students and \nfor America's future.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud today to support the student \nloan reform provisions in the Health Care and Education Affordability \nReconciliation Act of 2010. I've said this often, we in this country \nenjoy many freedoms: the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, \nthe freedom of religion. But there is an implicit freedom our \nConstitution doesn't lay out in writing, and its promise has excited \nthe passions, hopes, and dreams of people in this country since its \nfounding. The freedom to take whatever talents God has given you, to \nfulfill whatever passion is in your heart, to learn so you can earn and \nmake a contribution--the freedom to achieve.\n  When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls school, my mom and \ndad made it clear they wanted me to go to college. But, right around \ngraduation, my family was going through a rough time because my dad's \ngrocery store had suffered a terrible fire. I offered to put off \ncollege and work at the grocery store until the business got back on \nits feet. My dad said, ``Barb, you have to go. Your mother and I will \nfind a way because no matter what happens to you, no one can ever take \nthat degree away from you. The best way I can protect you is to make \nsure you can earn a living all of your life.'' My father gave me the \nfreedom to achieve. And the provisions in this bill will give millions \nof\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nAmericans that same freedom without adding a dime to the deficit.\n  For too long, banks have gotten a free ride from the U.S. Department \nof Education by offering federally guaranteed student loans. The \nprovisions in this bill will stop wasteful and unnecessary subsidies to \nlenders and put that money where it is needed most--in students' \npockets. By reforming the Federal student loan program, we will save \nover $60 billion in the next 10 years. Many of those savings will go to \nincrease the Pell grant, which has made college a reality for students \nof modest means for nearly half a century. But we also make critical \ninvestments in institutions that help our most underserved students: \ncommunity colleges and Minority Serving Institutions, particularly \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs.\n  I have fought alongside my colleagues for years to increase funding \nfor these programs and there was a point where Democrats had to fight \ntooth-and-nail just to keep Pell funding from being cut. Now we are in \na position where we can guarantee increases in the Pell grant, which \nhelps more than 90,000 students in my home State of Maryland. My \ncolleagues have spoken eloquently about the importance of the much-\nneeded investments in this bill, but I would like to take a moment to \nhighlight the investments in HBCUs. I am the only senior Democrat on \nthe HELP committee that has HBCUs in their State, and I have been a \nlong-standing champion for these schools in both my work as an \nauthorizer on the HELP committee and as an appropriator through my \nchairmanship of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  I am proud that Maryland has four public HBCUs which provide an \nincredible benefit to African-American students and the communities \nthey serve. Few people know, but HBCUs produce nearly a quarter of our \nNation's African-American public school teachers. They also produce \nalmost 40 percent of African-American graduates in physics, math, \nbiology, and environmental sciences.\n  Some of my colleagues might argue that HBCUs shouldn't be getting \nFederal funding based primarily on the racial makeup of their student \nbodies and, further, that there is no longer any place for these \ninstitutions in this day and age. What I would tell them is that \nCongress has been providing direct Federal support for HBCUs for more \nthan 50 years mainly for two reasons. First, Congress recognizes the \nhistorical and cultural importance of HBCUs and their benefit to \nstudents who are often the first in their families to go to college. \nSecond, the emergence of these institutions was a direct result of \nFederal action permitting the segregation of students in public \neducation based on race.\n  During those dark days, HBCUs were often the only pathways to college \nfor African Americans; they were able to open the doors of opportunity \nthat were so often shut. But these institutions are historically under-\nresourced, and their students are by and large underserved. For that \nreason they have had to fight for representation, respect, and \nrecognition since they were established. They've had to urge lawmakers \nto act ``now'' on behalf of their students when so many have told them \nto ``wait.'' So I am here to make sure that the more than 20,000 \nstudents at Maryland's HBCUs get the resources they deserve by \nsupporting the $850 million investment in HBCUs over 10 years enabled \nthrough this reconciliation bill. Maryland is slated to get $65 \nmillion, and I am confident that the presidents of Morgan State \nUniversity, Coppin State University, the University of Maryland Eastern \nShore, and Bowie State University will be good stewards of this \nlandmark Federal investment.\n  Our work isn't done when it comes to equity in access for higher \neducation, but this bill helps us get there.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, after decades of efforts and a year of \nextensive debate, Americans will finally have a health care system that \ncontrols costs, reduces the deficit, improves access, adds more \nprotections for seniors and curbs insurance company abuses. The \nPresident has signed meaningful health care reform into law that will \nextend immediate benefits to millions of American families and small \nbusinesses.\n  In implementing this comprehensive legislation, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services will be called upon, as will other Federal \nagencies, and the States, to make assessments in a variety of contexts \nas to whether the marketplace is functioning properly, or whether \nabuses are occurring. In making these assessments, and in deciding on \nappropriate steps to address any abuses or dysfunction, the Federal \nagencies and the States can benefit greatly from competitive analysis \nprovided by the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  One example where this advice would be particularly beneficial is in \nimplementing the mandate to establish State and/or regional health \nexchanges. At present, many State health insurance markets are \ncharacterized by their extreme concentration. According to the American \nMedical Association, in 2007, at least one insurer had a combined HMO/\nPPO market share of 50 percent or greater in 64 percent (200) of the \nlocal markets (or Metropolitan Statistical Areas) of the United States. \nAnd the two top insurers accounted for at least 60 percent of \nenrollment in almost 75 percent of these markets. High concentration \nand barriers to entry reduce price competition and customer choice.\n  The law just passed contains an antitrust savings clause, which \nclarifies that Congress did not intend health care reform to erode the \nreach of the antitrust laws in any way. To restore true competition \nhowever, more than a savings clause is needed.\n  I am pleased that the law vests in State exchange regulators the \npower to address competition failures in the market, including the root \ncauses of industry concentration. This means curbing anticompetitive \npractices designed to keep prices high and choices low, and also \nencouraging new market participants by mitigating barriers to entry. \nObvious market abuses, such as tying agreements, predatory practices \nand the like, must be stopped. But success also requires that the \nregulators get the more delicate issues right: does a preferred rate \nagreement constitute a de facto boycott? Will a regulation or exchange \nadversely impact the ability of a new participant to gain public trust? \nHow does a proposed rule impact the ability of young insurance \ncompanies to develop a comprehensive network of health care providers?\n  These are difficult questions and we should not expect State \nregulators to develop an expertise in them overnight. But our Federal \nantitrust agencies, have, through years of experience, developed just \nthis expertise. I urge the exchange regulators, as well as the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and other responsible agencies, \nto make full use of their assistance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of two \namendments, S.A. 3574 and S.A. 3575, offered by the junior senator from \nFlorida. I am concerned the student loan reforms in the bill will lead \nto a substantial loss of jobs in my State. That is why I recently led a \ngroup of six Senators in asking Majority Leader Reid to consider \nalternative ways to reduce the cost of student loans. Unfortunately, \nthat has not happened. The provisions in this bill could prove \ndetrimental to thousands of employees who serve in the student loan \nindustry throughout this country, about 700 who are located in Panama \nCity, FL. Therefore, Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the education \nprovisions in the reconciliation legislation that reforms Federal \nstudent loan programs and will help our Nation's neediest students \nafford college by providing $35.5 billion for the critical Pell grant \nprogram.\n  Nearly 700,000 students in California right now receive Pell grants \nof up to $5,550 out of over 8 million students nationwide. The majority \nof these students come from families where the average income is less \nthan $40,000.\n  The Pell grant funds in the bill will help prevent cuts to students' \ngrants of up to 60 percent and prevent nearly 600,000 students from \nlosing their grant entirely.\n  It will also help 63,000 more students in California receive a Pell \ngrant so they can afford to go to college during this tough economic \ntime.\n  Specifically, the legislation will allow the current Federal Direct \nLoan\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nProgram, backed by the U.S. Treasury, to be the sole originator of all \nfederal student loans; save $61 billion over 10 years by eliminating \nthe Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFELP, which provides \nunnecessary subsidies to private lenders and banks for originating \nstudent loans.\n  Of the $61 billion in savings, it directs $10 billion to help reduce \nthe Federal deficit, and the remainder towards important education \nprograms, such as $35.5 billion for Pell grants to help students afford \ncollege; direct $22.5 billion of the total $35.5 billion in new Pell \nGrant funds to increase the maximum award amount--from the current \n$5,550 to about $6,000 to help with rising college costs.\n  The economic downturn has resulted in increased enrollment at \ncolleges and universities, and increased eligibility in Federal student \naid, with the number of Pell grant recipients increasing by 1 million \nstudents in the past two years alone.\n  In my home state of California, these important provisions are \nsupported by the University of California, UC, California State \nUniversity, CSU, and California's public community college system--\nwhich together serve approximately 500,000 Pell grant students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these provisions that are critically \nimportant to our Nation's students.\n\n\n                              puerto rico\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and his \nstaff for taking the time and effort to ensure the 4 million residents \nin Puerto Rico are treated fairly in our health care system.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, first in the House, and now here in \nthe Senate, I have worked to see the people of Puerto Rico are not \nforgotten. The health care reform package we are debating today has \nseveral outstanding provisions for Puerto Rico. It is an example of the \ngood we can do for its nearly 4 million U.S. citizens--who pay Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes.\n  But there is one issue I want to raise and that is the Medicare \nAdvantage program on the island. Approximately 83 percent of the \neligible Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico participate in Medicare \nAdvantage, compared to 25 percent in the States. This can be tracked to \nthe fact that eligible seniors in Puerto Rico are not automatically \nenrolled in Medicare Part B when they turn 65. As a result, it is more \nbeneficial for seniors in Puerto Rico to enroll in Medicare Advantage \nto receive all of their Medicare services.\n  However, the fee-for-service, FFS, cost calculation for Puerto Rico \nis inaccurate and under counts expenditures per Medicare beneficiary. \nLast year the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, alerted \nCongress to this and recommends that the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, CMS, should expeditiously use its authority to \nemploy an alternative calculation method . . .'.\n  The fee-for-service cost calculation is important because it will \nsoon be the basis for Medicare Advantage rates throughout the country \nand Puerto Rico. I strongly believe CMS should take a look at the under \ncount. If there is validation that the FFS expenditures are too low, I \nbelieve the HHS Secretary and CMS should use current authority and \nadjust the calculations appropriately.\n  I am asking HHS and CMS to look at the under count because there is a \nvery real chance we could do harm to Medicare Advantage in Puerto Rico \nif we don't get the FFS costs accurate. I hope the chairman agrees with \nme.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for bringing attention to this issue. \nHe is a true champion for Puerto Rico and a constructive member of the \nFinance Committee.\n  I share his concern about the possible under count of fee-for-service \ncosts in areas like Puerto Rico. That is why we included a provision in \nthe Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 to \nhave MedPAC study the accuracy of the calculation and report to \nCongress. As he points out, MedPAC recommends that CMS alter the FFS \ncost calculation so that such under counts do not exist, particularly \nin areas like Puerto Rico where Medicare Advantage provides benefits to \nover 80 percent of its seniors.\n  I strongly agree with him that CMS should promptly use its authority \nto correct any and all under counts that might exist in areas like \nPuerto Rico. The island has unique circumstances that could affect \nMedicare expenditures and spill over to Medicare Advantage. Moving \nforward I will continue to work with the Senator closely to monitor and \ncorrect this issue as expeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Chairman for his leadership and commitment \non this issue.\n\n\n                                  PEOs\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to ask the \nchairman of the Committee on Finance and its ranking member a question \non the application of the legislation to Professional Employer \nOrganizations or PEOs.\n  As they know, there are millions of individuals throughout our \ncountry who are working for small businesses which are in PEO \narrangements. The clear objective of this legislation is to create \nincentives for health care coverage and not to provide disincentives. I \nwould like the chairman to clarify that, for purposes of the \napplication of section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act \n(Prohibition on Discrimination in Favor of Highly Compensated \nIndividuals) and for purposes of Internal Revenue Code sections 45R \n(Credit for Employee Health Insurance Expenses of Small Businesses) and \n4980H (Shared Responsibility for Employers), to any health plans \nsponsored by a Professional Employer Organization, PEO, or a PEO client \norganization, the rules would be applied to each client organization \nseparately and eligibility for the small business tax credits and \nemployer shared responsibilities would also apply to each client \norganization separately, and not at the PEO level.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the individual providing services to the PEO client \norganization pursuant to the PEO arrangement continues to be an \nemployee of the PEO client organization, the Senator from Florida is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to talk a moment about one of the \nonly retroactive tax provisions in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, Section 9016. This one deals with the special \ndeductions given to the many nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield \norganizations which are no longer exempt from Federal income tax.\n  Under section 833 of the Internal Revenue Code, these organizations \nreceive a 25 percent deduction for claims and expenses and an exception \nfrom the--otherwise applicable--20 percent reduction in the deduction \nfor unearned premium reserves. Effective January 1 of this year, these \nnon-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations must now meet a medical \nloss ratio of 85 percent or higher in order to take advantage of the \ntax benefits of section 833. This provision was included to ensure that \nrecipients of this special deduction actually spend out most of their \npremium income on the people they insure and not on administrative fees \nor executive compensation.\n  But I want to clarify two issues here. First, it was our intention \nthat, in calculating the medical loss ratios, these entities could \ninclude both the cost of reimbursement for clinical services provided \nto the individuals they insure and the cost of activities that improve \nhealth care quality. Determining the medical loss ratio under this \nprovision using those two types of costs is consistent with the \ncalculation of medical loss ratios elsewhere in the legislation. This \ndetermination would be made on an annual basis and would only affect \nthe application of the special deductions for that year.\n  Second, it was our intention that the only consequence for not \nmeeting the medical loss ratio threshold would be that the 25 percent \ndeduction for claims and expenses and the exception from the 20 percent \nreduction in the deduction for unearned premium reserves would not be \nallowed. The entity would still be treated as a stock property and \ncasualty insurance company.\n  It is my understanding that the Joint Committee on Taxation scored \nthis provision consistent with the policy I just outlined. We intend to \nclarify these two issues in a technical corrections bill as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak concerning the accounting treatment of \none of the tax provisions that passed in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nCare Act, Section 9008, and that is proposed to be modified in the \nHealth Care and Education Reconciliation Act. This deals with the \nannual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers which, as passed, is to go \ninto effect this year. It is our hope that Congress will delay the \nimplementation of this fee by 1 year, to 2011, by passing the \nreconciliation bill which we are discussing today on the floor. This \nwill give the government reporting agencies more time to establish \nsystems to report the drug sales to the Secretary of the Treasury as \nrequired by health care reform.\n  As a reminder of how the fee works: our legislation sets an \naggregate, annual fee that is to be apportioned among the relevant \ncompanies based on their market share of branded U.S. prescription drug \nsales made to or funded by specified government programs. The U.S. \nTreasury will allocate this annual fee to each company based on its \nrelative market share for the prior year.\n  Now, we understand that there have been questions about the nature of \nthis fee that are affecting how the fee should be treated for \naccounting purposes. It was our intent that the fee is assessed in the \nyear that it is due. A fee is assessed on an entity in any given \ncalendar year only if the entity is engaged in the business of \nmanufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs and has sales to \nthe specified government programs in that calendar year. The reference \nin the legislation to sales for the preceding calendar year is for the \nsole purpose of providing the method of calculating market share. It \nwould be difficult to calculate market share and impose and collect the \nfee in the same year, so we decided to look back to a completed year as \na proxy of market share. But it is not intended that a manufacturer or \nimporter would be assessed an annual fee in a calendar year in which it \nhad no branded prescription drug sales to the government programs. This \nis regardless of whether the manufacturer or importer had any relevant \nsales in the preceding year.\n  As an example, suppose a pharmaceutical company made sales in 2011 \nbut in November 2011 shut down its U.S. operations and had no further \nsales to the specified government programs. In 2012, that \npharmaceutical company would not be subject to the fee. Instead, the \n2012 aggregate fee would be allocated among those companies selling \ndrugs in 2012 to the specified government programs.\n  These same accounting questions may also be raised under the annual \nfee on health insurance providers--section 9010 of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, as amended. On these issues, our \nintent as to the treatment of the fees is the same.\n  We anticipate that the Secretary of the Treasury will provide \nguidance on how to determine the fees in situations involving mergers, \nacquisitions, business divisions, bankruptcy, or other situations where \nit may be difficult to account for sales taken into account in \ndetermining market share. We intend to work with the IRS and the \naffected groups to further clarify the law consistent with the policy I \nhave just outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 48 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First, I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. This has been a very civil discussion, very heartfelt feelings \non both sides, and I appreciate that.\n  Let me also say it is interesting that this is the first time in \nrecent memory that a reconciliation bill has all amendments on one side \nonly. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the reconciliation \nand therefore kill health care reform. So I very much hope that all of \nthese amendments are defeated.\n  I note there are 23 amendments pending. It is going to take 7 or 8 \nhours, hopefully less. There will be many more amendments offered \ntonight. It is our expectation that we will continue voting on all \namendments until we finally vote on all amendments and we can get \nreconciliation passed, and therefore all of the measures surrounding \nhealth care reform will be enacted and we can proceed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with great disappointment in \nboth the substance and process of this legislation.\n  We should be working from a long held medical premise; first, do no \nharm. Instead, Americans know this government takeover of the health \ncare system is bad and the tactics that have been used to do it are \neven worse. The policies contained in the recently passed health care \nbill combined with this reconciliation package will raise costs, lower \nthe quality of care in our country, shift a new unfunded mandate onto \nthe States, and will result in health care rationing.\n  The reasons Democrats passed this bill on a party-line vote in the \nSenate on Christmas Eve and late this past Sunday night in the House \nare because of a slew of backroom deals and arm twisting to buy up last \nminute votes. Now we take up the reconciliation bill to remove some of \nthese deals so the President can claim to have clean hands.\n  There are many other reasons to oppose this bill, aside from the \nunsavory deals made to secure its passage. In both its scope and reach, \nthe combination of health care legislation and reconciliation is \nunprecedented. It raises $644 billion in taxes and cuts $525 billion \nfrom Medicare. The Democrats' bill contains accounting gimmicks that \nwould make Bernie Madoff proud.\n  The Congressional Budget Office found that savings generated from \nMedicare will not be reinvested in the program, but rather will be used \nto pay for new programs, putting even more strain on the long-term \nviability of Medicare.\n  There is no guarantee this plan lowers health care costs for \nconsumers. What is sure is that 80 percent of Americans will find \nthemselves in some form of government-run, government-controlled health \ncare. The remaining 20 percent will soon be asked, if not required, to \nfollow.\n  Historically, large-scale social legislation has passed with great \nbipartisan support. Social Security legislation passed in 1935 with 77 \nbipartisan votes. Medicare passed with 68 votes, and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act passed with 76 votes. Never before have we acted in a \nmanner that would affect one-sixth of our economy on the whims of a \nsingle political party. The combination of tactics used to pass the \nhealth care bill and amend it through reconciliation moves us into \nuncharted territory.\n  Even previous budget reconciliation measures cited by my colleagues \non the other side have passed with large, bipartisan margins. The law \nthat created the COBRA insurance program, often cited by my friends, \nachieved final passage in the Senate on a voice vote in 1985. In \naddition, welfare reform was supported by 78 Senators and SCHIP passed \nthe Senate with a whopping 85 votes.\n  While there are a number of things that Republicans and Democrats \nagree on when it comes to reforming the health care system, Democrats \nhave chosen to pursue a winner take all strategy that leaves them in \nthe position of having to clean up a messy bill through the process of \nreconciliation. They have adopted a hard-line ideological approach and \ncontinue to push a plan that will put us one giant step closer to the \nsingle-payer government run health care system they have long desired.\n  Speaking of a federal takeover; if you want a federal takeover of the \nstudent loan industry, then your ship has come in. Every student in the \ncountry who needs to borrow money for college will now have to come to \nthe Federal Government for a loan, which will make the United States \nDepartment of Education one of the Nation's largest banks. A portion of \nthe proceeds from these loans, about $9 billion, will then be used to \nfinance new health care spending instead of being put back into \neducation programs. Students will be caught in the middle in terms of \nhealth care financing. Not only will their loan interest go to finance \nan unpopular health care proposal, but they will be paying higher taxes \nwhen they graduate and get a job.\n  I am afraid that by dealing Republicans out of the game, Democrats \nhave done great harm to comity in the Senate. I have never hesitated to \nwork across the aisle on tough issues and try to reach consensus. After \nthis maneuver, I fear that bipartisanship may be a\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nthing of the past for the foreseeable future. While there may have been \nthe chance to work together on important topics, I believe Republicans \nmust now pursue a strategy of repeal and replace. Repeal this damaging \nlegislation and replace it with programs that promote fair tax \ntreatment of health care, encourage innovation, reward wellness, and \nhelp those in need.\n  I will be voting against this reconciliation bill because I believe \nthat combined with the recently passed health care bill, it will do \nmore harm than good for health care and higher education in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a lot has been talked about here. A lot has \nbeen discussed. I don't want to get in an expansive discussion of the \nissue of the underlying bill. It has been fully aired. But this concept \nto vote down every amendment, that you have to do that in order to save \nthis bill, seems to reject the concept of a constitutional process.\n  Think about this for a moment. The whole series of amendments here \nare being offered to fulfill the statements made by the President of \nthe United States. For example, Senator McCain has offered an amendment \nto take out the sweetheart deals. The President said the sweetheart \ndeals would be taken out. Senator Barrasso has offered an amendment \nwhich says that if premiums go up, certain parts of this bill will not \ngo into force. The President said premiums will not go up on working \nAmericans. Senator Crapo has offered an amendment which says that if \nthere are taxes on people earning less than $200,000, those taxes won't \ngo into force. That is what the President promised. I have offered an \namendment which says that if there are Medicare cuts in this bill, the \ncuts should go to Medicare and make Medicare more solvent--a promise \nalso made from the other side of the aisle.\n  All of these are amendments which are substantive and the purpose of \nwhich is to put forward the policies which the other side of the aisle \nrepresented they were going to have in their original bill. This is \ncalled the fix-it bill. Well, we are suggesting you fix it so it meets \nthe conditions set out by the President and by the Democratic \nleadership. Yet now we hear that every amendment should be voted down. \nWhy? Because the idea of sending the bill back to the House is anathema \nto the Democratic Party. Did I miss something? Isn't the House of \nRepresentatives controlled by the Democratic Party with a \nsupermajority? You mean they couldn't survive the idea of knocking out \nthe sweetheart deals, sending it back to the House, and coming back \nhere? That is going to somehow fundamentally undermine this bill? That \nargument is absurd on its face. It is absurd on its face.\n  I think the only answer is that the other side of the aisle has \ndecided to proceed on this bill in a most arrogant process. From the \nbeginning of the core of this bill being put together in a hidden room \nbehind a hidden room behind a hidden door of the majority leader's \noffice suite, brought to this floor on a Saturday afternoon, the tree \nwas filled and we were told we had to vote on it on Christmas Eve. No \namendments were allowed. Then it was taken over to the House, and the \nSpeaker worked out the deals in the back rooms of her offices behind \nhidden doors without any public input, without C-SPAN there, as was \nrepresented it would be. And what happened? It passed the House without \nany amendments being allowed.\n  Now, for the first time, we have a chance to offer amendments, and \nthe position on the other side of the aisle is no amendments allowed \neven if they are good amendments.\n  So, I guess, obviously, they consider their promises to be an \ninconvenience. Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an \ninconvenience. The Democratic process is an inconvenience. It also \nappears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the \nAmerican people are an inconvenience and that amendments which make \nsense aren't going to be allowed to be passed because they don't want \nto send it back to the House of Representatives. It makes no sense to \nme, and I don't think it is going to make much sense to the American \npeople.\n  This bill is fundamentally flawed. It needs to be repealed and it \nneeds to be replaced. We have suggested a whole series of amendments \nwhich will significantly improve this bill, and I hope some will be \nsupported by the other side of the aisle since they are the policies of \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, make no mistake----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, point of order. Is there time remaining on \nthe bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 53 seconds remaining for the \nmajority.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent of every \nsingle one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is \nto kill health care reform. That is the sole purpose of each of those \namendments. That was the sole purpose of the amendments in the Finance \nCommittee last year--to kill health care reform. It was the sole \npurpose in the HELP Committee, except for a few benign amendments--to \nkill health care reform. It was the sole purpose on the floor of the \nSenate when we took it up. Every amendment was to kill health care \nreform.\n  A Senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this \nis hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health care \nreform. It is clear they want to kill health care reform.\n  The other side has said repeatedly in campaign statements in the \nother body that they want to repeal health care reform. They have \norchestrated legislatures to repeal health care reform.\n  Each amendment offered here is intended to kill health care reform, \nand that is why each amendment should fail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct this comment through the Chair to \nmy distinguished colleague, the Republican leader. All time has \nexpired. Under the rules in the Senate, we start our vote-athon now, as \nthe Republican leader knows. I would ask my friend, is it the desire of \nthe minority that there be time before each amendment and a response to \nthat?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I would say to my friend the majority leader, \nsince the voting will all occur during the so-called vote-arama, if we \ncould have a minute or so before each amendment simply to describe what \nit is, that would be helpful.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say again through the Chair to my \ncolleague and those Members of this body, we do not have to agree to 1 \nminute, but we want everyone to understand we have tried to be as fair \nas we can through this whole process. There are some who said: Why \nshould we waste--there would be 43 minutes or 46 minutes. I think there \nare 23 amendments pending, so that would be 46 minutes. But we want to \nbe fair. In recent years, we have agreed by unanimous consent to have 1 \nminute to explain the amendment and 1 minute to disagree with the \namendment. I think that is the appropriate thing to do. We want to make \nsure everyone is treated fairly.\n  But I alert everyone: The Chair is going to enforce--we are not \nwaiting for the Parliamentarian--the Chair is going to enforce that to \nthe letter of the law. Every time the Presiding Officer is here, there \nwill be 1 minute--if this consent agreement is agreed to--there will be \n1 minute to explain the amendment and 1 minute to disagree with the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my friend yield for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Even though allowing that, as the majority leader \nsuggested, is certainly optional, it has been the custom of both sides, \nwhen we have been in these vote-arama situations in the past, to allow \nthe time on\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\neach side, and I appreciate the willingness of the majority leader to \ndo that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as I directed, or \nasked, that there be 1 minute to explain the amendment and 1 minute to \ndisagree with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that after the \nfirst amendment, on which we will do our normal 15 minutes with 5 \nminutes of time after that, all votes thereafter be 10 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe amendments and the motions in the order they have been offered--I \nthink that is the fair way to go so we are not trying to catapult over \nother amendments people may have offered at an earlier time--with no \nintervening amendments or motions in order prior to a vote; further, \nthat after the first vote in this sequence, the succeeding votes be \nlimited to 10 minutes each.\n  The reason I suggest 10 minutes is I have been told by Senator \nMcConnell and others they want an opportunity to offer amendments, and \nthis will maybe allow them to offer a few more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also note that with just the amendments \nthat have been proposed, if we are fortunate, it will probably take 9 \nhours or so, maybe more than that, to get rid of those. There will be \ncontinuous votes without any breaks. We are not going to have any \nbreaks unless something untoward happens. Senators should be advised \nthat they should remain close to the floor during this process. If \npeople are not here at the end of the time, we are going to close it \nup. We need to move on. We have other things we have to do prior to the \nrecess. I have to work with the Republican leader. It has taken an \nenormous amount of time to do this. Everybody stay here. It works a lot \nbetter if my colleagues stay close to their seats and, hopefully, we \nwill have an orderly process as much as possible during the vote-arama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes of my \nleader time before we begin the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the administration and some in Congress \nwish this debate to be over. They want the American people to sit down \nand quiet down. That has been their approach to health care for an \nentire year.\n  Well, Republicans think Congress serves the people, not the other way \naround.\n  We have fought on behalf of the American people this week, and we \nwill continue to fight until this bill is repealed and replaced with \ncommonsense ideas that solve our problems without dismantling the \nhealth care system we have and without burying the American dream under \na mountain of debt.\n  That is what we have been doing all week in the Senate. While \nDemocratic lawmakers and staffers threw a party for themselves at the \nWhite House yesterday, Republicans were here at the Capitol fighting a \n150-page postscript that Democrats added at the last minute to the \nhealth care bill. This add-on took a terrible health spending bill and \nmade it even worse.\n  If you thought the tax hikes in the original bill were bad, this bill \nraised them even higher. If you thought the Medicare cuts were bad, \nthis bill made them even deeper. If you thought the first bill cost too \nmuch, this bill made it even more expensive. If you did not like the \nspecial deals in the first bill, they slipped more into this one. The \nwhole thing was one last slap in the face of Americans across the \ncountry who have been howling at Democrats for the past year to stop \nthis bill and to work instead across party lines on reforms that would \nactually drive costs down.\n  Today Republicans will give Democrats one last chance to reject the \nhorrible impact the underlying bill and this last-minute add-on will \nhave on our country. Unfortunately, we already know that they plan to \nturn the other way.\n  We will offer an amendment to direct the Medicare cuts in this bill \nback into Medicare, to preserve and strengthen it for future \ngenerations. They will reject it.\n  We will offer an amendment to strike all the new sweetheart deals in \nthis bill. They will reject it.\n  We will offer an amendment that would have obliged the President to \nkeep his pledge that families earning under $250,000 will not see any \ntax hikes as a result of this bill. They plan to reject it.\n  We will offer an amendment requiring HHS to certify that this bill \ndoes not increase premiums. They will reject it.\n  We will offer an amendment to strike a job-killing mandate on \nbusiness. They will reject it.\n  While the White House is trying to sell this health spending bill to \na skeptical public, Senate Democrats today will speak loudly and they \nwill speak clearly about the things in this bill the White House does \nnot want people to know and vote to endorse them: massive cuts to \nMedicare for seniors; job-killing mandates and business tax hikes; \nhigher insurance premiums; sweetheart deals; tax hikes on middle-class \nfamilies. This is the real story of health care reform.\n  Americans may not be hearing about it from the White House, but I \nassure you, they will be feeling the pain. Americans know this and they \nwant to know that somebody is fighting for them in Washington to make \ntheir voices heard. That is what Republicans have been doing on this \nissue for the past year. That is what we have been doing this week. \nThat is what we will be doing tonight. And that is what we will keep \ndoing until those voices are heard. We are not giving up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, USA Today-Gallup reported that the people of \nAmerica, the citizens of America, favor what we did by a score of 49 to \n40. That is a pretty significant majority. People support this \nlegislation. Why? Because they are tired of being treated by the \ninsurance industry the way they have been treated.\n  My friend talks about the mountain of debt of this bill. We have \nrules and guidelines in this body, in this Congress, and one of them is \nwe have an independent body that has been set up, not by Republicans, \nnot by Democrats, but by us. It is independent. It is not partisan. \nThat agency, the Congressional Budget Office, determined this bill over \nthe first 10 years will save about $140 billion; over the next 10 \nyears, $1.3 trillion. This is make-believe they talk about all these \nthings that are going to cost so much--$1.3 trillion.\n  I also have to comment on this. My friend, the Republican leader, \ntalks about how hard they were working yesterday when we were at a 45-\nminute meeting at the White House while the President made history \nsigning for the first time in 100 years major health care reform in \nthis country. They were working so hard here. They were working so hard \ntoday that they refused to let committees meet to hold sensitive, \nimportant hearings for our country.\n  Carl Levin had to cancel a meeting because the Republicans refused to \nallow that meeting to go forward, dealing with the safety and security \nof this Nation. Claire McCaskill, with her subcommittee, had to cancel \na hearing dealing with having police officers trained in Afghanistan. \nCanceled. Working hard, they are, to throw a monkey wrench in \neverything we are trying to do for the American people.\n\n  To in any way denigrate, as has been done this afternoon, Chairman \nMax Baucus and Chairman Chris Dodd and the work done by the man \nreplacing Ted Kennedy is an outrage. Max Baucus devoted his life to \nthis legislation for the last 2 years: the number of roundtable \ndiscussions with Finance Committee members and invited guests, 3; the \nnumber of papers outlining health care reform, significant, important \npapers that were distributed to everybody around the country interested \nin health care, 4; the number of meetings of the Gang of 6--three \nRepublicans and three Democrats--31 meetings; the number of member \nmeetings on health care reform, 141.\n  These are not back-room deals. This is how business is conducted in \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n  The number of days in the Finance Committee the bill was available \nbefore the markup even took place, 6; the total number of amendments \nposted online before the markup, 564. They were public. Everyone in \nAmerica could read them. The number of amendments considered during the \nmarkup, 135; the number of days the committee spent marking up the \nbill, 8; the number of days the final bill was available before the \nvote, 11.\n  There is more, but you get the picture.\n  Chairman Dodd conducted the longest markup in the history of the HELP \nCommittee. On what subject? Health care. Public meetings, many of them \non C-SPAN.\n  There is no bill anymore. It was signed into law yesterday. The work \nthat we did here on Christmas Eve, through the storms of 2010, is now \nthe law of this country. We are going to start in just a few minutes \nmaking that law even better.\n  In my State of Nevada, 600,000 people will be able to have insurance \nwho have never had it before; 24,000 small businesses will be eligible \nfor a subsidy for people they employ to have health insurance. They did \nnot have health insurance because they were cheap or mean; they could \nnot afford it. If they would get a palsy, they would cancel when \nsomebody got sick or hurt.\n  Now someone who is 26 years old can go to college or do whatever they \nwant to do and not worry about losing their insurance until they \nestablish themselves.\n  This legislation extends Medicare for 9 years as a healthy entity. \nMedicare is not a perfect program, but it is a good program.\n  My first elective job was a countywide job in Las Vegas, the \nmetropolitan areas Clark County. When I went on that hospital board, \nthe largest district in Nevada, 40 percent of seniors who came into \nthat hospital had no health insurance. Their sons, their daughters, \ntheir mothers, their brothers, their cousins, their neighbors signed \nfor them that they would be responsible for that bill. We had a large \ncollection agency in that hospital. We went after those people.\n  Not anymore. Now everybody who is a senior citizen who comes into \nthat hospital is taken care of because of Medicare. We extend the life \nof that program for about 9 years.\n  I had a letter written to me by a man from Nevada. He wrote to me and \nhe said: Senator, I have a son who has diabetes, but it has become more \ncomplicated. Now he has Addison's disease. I lost my job. We have no \nhealth insurance. When I go to bed at night and say my prayers, I don't \nknow whether to die or stay alive to help my son. That is how desperate \nhe is.\n  People such as this man from Nevada are no longer going to have to be \ndesperate. No longer are we going to have 750,000 people file for \nbankruptcy, 70 percent of them because of health care costs and 80 \npercent of the 70 percent have health insurance.\n  The bill that is now the law of this country dealing with health care \nis a wonderful bill, and we are going to improve it tonight.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3567, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Gregg amendment, as modified. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment fulfills the obligation to \nour senior citizens. This bill reduces on its face $520 billion in \nMedicare by cutting Medicare beneficiaries through reducing providers \nand by eliminating or significantly reducing the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. That number actually, when fully implemented, is $1 trillion \nover the first 10 years. That is $1 trillion of reductions in Medicare.\n  That money is then taken and used to create new entitlements for \npeople who are not seniors and who have, for the most part, not paid \ninto the Medicare trust fund. That is wrong. Medicare is in serious \ntrouble. We should use the Medicare savings in this bill for the \npurposes of making Medicare more solvent.\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. It keeps Medicare savings \nin the Medicare trust fund and uses them to make Medicare more solvent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, without being dramatic, this is a killer \namendment, pure and simple. Why? Because it is basically designed to \nprevent spending. That means it will take away tax credits to middle \nAmericans to help them buy insurance. This amendment would take it \naway. It would kill the assistance to seniors for prescription drugs. \nIt would take that away. It would take away assistance to States. That \nis why it is a killer amendment.\n  I proudly support this bill. Why? This bill reduces insurance costs \nfor working-class and middle-class Americans, expands Medicare \nprescription drug coverage to more than 3 million seniors, provides \nimmediate tax credits for nearly 4 million small businesses, stops $6 \nbillion in annual government subsidies for banks, and puts money into \ncollege grants for students and their families.\n  In contrast, our friends on the other side do not want to do that. \nThey want to kill this bill. I think that is patently against the \nwishes of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Gregg amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Isakson).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment removes the following items \nfrom the legislation: additional Medicaid funding for Hawaii hospitals; \nadditional Medicaid funding for Tennessee hospitals; provides special \nMedicaid funding for Louisiana; special Medicaid funding primarily for \nreclassified hospitals in Michigan and Connecticut; $100 million for a \nConnecticut hospital; frontier funding provision provided in new \nMedicare money for\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nMontana, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming; a provision allowing \nfor certain residents in Libby, MT.\n  I do not argue whether these are worthwhile or needed projects. I do \nargue the method in which they were inserted in this legislation--the \none for Tennessee being as recently as yesterday or the day before--is \nthe wrong process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is important to recognize this \namendment for what it is. It is basically a political stunt at the \nexpense of a lot of victimized people. One is victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, another is victims of asbestos in Libby, MT; it is at the \nexpense of rural Americans; it is an attempt to derail the bill and \nforce the House to have to vote again, therefore force, probably, the \nSenate to go through another vote-arama, go back and forth. It makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  Let's not forget the underlying legislation passed recently and \nsigned by the President yesterday reduces insurance costs for working \nand middle-class Americans. This amendment would have the effect of \ntaking that away if passed. If passed, it would take away Medicare \nprescription drug coverage for more than 3 million seniors. If passed, \nit would have the effect of taking away immediate tax credits for small \nbusinesses, and I could go on and on.\n  I urge Members to support my motion to table.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion to recommit offered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the two health care bills, the one the \nPresident has already signed into law plus this one we are considering \nwill spend another $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  In order to pay for it, one of the things that these bills include is \nover $600 billion in new taxes. The President has pledged there would \nbe no taxes on the middle class, and he defined that to be anybody who \nmakes less than $200,000 as an individual or $250,000 as a couple or a \nfamily.\n  All this motion to commit does is say: Let's take those taxes out of \nthese bills. There are 73 million Americans who fall squarely in the \nmiddle class who make less than $200,000 a year as an individual or \n$250,000 as a couple who will pay the burden of these taxes if we do \nnot make this change.\n  It is time for this Congress----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAPO. To help the President keep his pledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't want to be dramatic about this, \nbut it is a fact that this amendment is a killer amendment. That is why \nwe cannot adopt it. I remind colleagues that the underlying bill the \nPresident signed yesterday is a very large tax cut. It has tax credits \nin the neighborhood of about $400-some billion. That is a big tax cut \nfor Americans who today are having a hard time buying insurance, a tax \ncredit that enables middle and lower income Americans to buy insurance. \nI think we should keep that in mind. A vote for this amendment would, \nin fact, prevent all the benefits this bill provides for forming a \nhealth insurance market, stopping preexisting conditions. It would \nprevent about $17 billion in tax credits that otherwise would go to \nsmall business.\n  I strongly urge colleagues to support my motion to table this motion.\n  I move to table the motion to commit and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion to commit offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is not a killer amendment. This just \nkills a bad part of the bill.\n  The reconciliation bill makes a bad employment situation even worse. \nIt imposes $52 billion in new taxes on employers who cannot afford to \nprovide health insurance to their workers. The\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nnew employer tax will result in lower wages and lost jobs.\n  According to CBO:\n\n       Requiring employers to offer health insurance--or pay a fee \n     if they do not--is likely to reduce employment.\n\n  Low-income workers are particularly hard hit by the employer mandate \nin the reconciliation bill. CBO says an employer mandate ``could reduce \nthe hiring of low-wage workers'' and would ``increase incentives for \nfirms to replace full-time workers with more part-time or temporary \nworkers.''\n  The Nation's unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and in many States the \nunemployment rate is well into the teens. We should be doing everything \npossible to create new jobs, but the employer mandate in the \nreconciliation bill does the opposite.\n  The job-killing taxes in the bill will slash wages and cut jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I urge my colleagues to protect Americans' jobs by \nsupporting my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, sending the bill to committee sounds like \nkilling the bill to me. I have never heard of a motion to commit that \nis not, in effect, a motion to kill the bill.\n  We are all in this together in America in enacting health care \nreform--all groups: business groups, consumers, labor, and so forth. We \nhave consulted with business groups. They are an integral part of this. \nBusiness groups want to work with us and have worked with us to get \nhealth care reform passed.\n  I might also remind my colleagues there are tax credits in here for \nsmall business to the tune of--I think it is $17 billion. Firms with \nfewer than 50 employees are totally exempt from any penalty.\n  This clearly is a motion to kill the bill. Therefore, it would result \nin taking away all these provisions enacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, my amendment protects families and \nprotects small businesses from dramatic increases in insurance \npremiums. My amendment directs the Department of Health and Human \nServices to certify that insurance premiums will not rise faster under \nthe new health care law than they would have if the law had not been \npassed. If they find that premiums are higher, then the new law would \nsunset.\n  This month in Pennsylvania, the President said the Senate bill would \nreduce most people's premiums. I say to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, if you believe the President and you believe that this bill \nlowers premiums, prove it. Vote for this amendment.\n  This is a reasonable, straightforward amendment. It holds the \nPresident and it holds the Members of Congress accountable to the \nAmerican people for promises made.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all things being equal, I choose to \nbelieve the President. Second, I choose to believe the Congressional \nBudget Office. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that \npremiums under this legislation will, all things equal, be reduced for \nbig business as much as 3 percent. Small businesses will see a decrease \nof 11 percent if you factor in the small business tax credits for \ncoverage. Individuals who receive tax credits in the exchange will find \na 57-percent reduction in premiums; again, all things being equal.\n  Will someone find an increase in premium? Somebody might buy a very \nexpensive health insurance policy. Maybe that person's premiums might \ngo up.\n  Obviously, this is designed to kill the bill, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues not to support it. It prevents passage of the bill. It \nundermines the bill. It repeals the bill, in effect, that has already \nbeen signed by the President.\n  So I move that this amendment be tabled, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3564, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment would require the \nPresident, the Vice President, Cabinet members, and White House staff \nto use exchanges created in this bill. It would also fix a loophole so \nthat the committee and leadership staff are also required to obtain \ncoverage in these exchanges.\n  Today, after seeing my amendment, the White House announced that \nPresident Obama will voluntarily participate in the health insurance \nexchange that starts in 2014.\n  This is a little presumptuous since he has another election before \n2014, but it is still effectively an endorsement of my amendment to \nmake sure that political leaders live under the laws they pass for \neveryone else. But the principle should not be voluntary for political \nleaders. Congress and President Clinton confirmed that in 1995 by \nenacting the Congressional Accountability Act that Senator Lieberman \nand I sponsored. It is a matter of not having a double standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and make sure we are \nliving under the same laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I could be mistaken, but it is my \nunderstanding that the underlying amendment, which also includes \nMembers of Congress in the exchange, is language that was drafted on a \nbipartisan basis in the HELP Committee. I don't see Senator Dodd here. \nIt is an amendment Senator Coburn worked on and was agreed to in the \nHELP Committee. It covered Members of Congress and who all should be \nincluded.\n  Frankly, I don't think it is wise at this point to try to negotiate \nwho should additionally be covered in the exchanges and who should not. \nIt was agreed to before. I say to my good friend from Iowa--he has been \nmy very good friend--I don't think it is intended to embarrass the \nPresident and the executive branch people, but I think it is \ninappropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my friend, he can be happy when Northern Iowa \nbeats Michigan State this Friday. It will make him happy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I make a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 313 of the \nBudget Act for the consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Under the previous order, we will have 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to \ncommit offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is an effort to stop the Federal \nGovernment from overcharging 19 million college students to help pay \nfor the health care bill. It would reduce from 6.8 percent to 5.3 \npercent the interest on their loans. It would save $1,700 to $1,800 on \nthe average of a $25,000 loan over 10 years.\n  Why are we talking student loans during a health care bill? Because \nwe can't trust the other side with the Yellow Pages. If they find it in \nthere, they think the government ought to be doing it. They have taken \nover the Federal student loan program, and they are running up the debt \n$\\1/2\\ trillion to do it. They are firing 31,000 people by July 1. They \nare going to borrow money at 2.8 percent and loan it to students at 6.8 \npercent and use the rest to help pay for health care and for the \ngovernment. CBO has said this is $8.7 billion of overcharging students \nto pay for health care. So a ``yes'' means don't overcharge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. A ``no'' means savings to students.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The last time we took up higher education, in 2007, we \nlowered interest rates on student loans and crafted the interest-based \nrepayment program. In this bill, we lower that down even more--from 15 \npercent to 10 percent--and we make a historic investment in Pell \ngrants.\n  I would agree, I am all for lowering interest rates. I would just \nnote that my friend from Tennessee didn't take to the floor to complain \nwhen Sallie Mae was charging over 20 percent interest on its loans to \nstudents. I didn't see that.\n  This amendment is not about lowering interest rates. What it is about \nis continuing a $61 billion subsidy to the big banks in this country. \nWe take that money and give it to students in Pell grants.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the motion to commit, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have heard my friends on the other side \nof the aisle talk about 30 million new people in America having health \ncare. What they are not talking about is 16 million of those folks are \ngoing into Medicaid. Medicaid is a program that doesn't work. Forty \npercent of physicians according to MedPac no longer will see Medicaid \npatients. Pharmacies will not fill prescriptions. You cannot find a \nspecialist.\n  I have also heard our friends on the other side of the aisle come to \nthe Senate floor and say the people of America should have the same \ngreat health care that we have in this body. The corollary should be \ntrue as well. We should have the same health care that we are willing \nto put 16 million new Americans in and 50 million Americans in total. \nWe should all be on Medicaid.\n  My amendment says 535 Members of Congress, as well as the Vice \nPresident of the United States, will go into Medicaid. If it is good \nenough for them, it should be good enough for us. We talk the talk \naround here a lot, now let's see if we will walk the walk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't think this is really a serious \namendment that requires all Members of Congress to withdraw from their \nFederal health insurance plan, and it requires all Members of Congress \nto be in Medicaid. Medicaid is a safety net for vulnerable Americans. \nIt should not be the subject for political gamesmanship like this \namendment. It is a slap in the face of vulnerable, poor Americans.\n  Ironically, this killer amendment will have the effect of reducing \npayments to States which are in the underlying bill. It would take that \naway. I don't think that is the intent of the author of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order the pending amendment violates \nsection 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of those acts for purposes of \nmy amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my motion \nto commit.\n  Simply put, this motion protects the 11 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, both seniors and the disabled, currently participating \nin the Medicare Advantage program.\n  If the HHS actuary certifies that the Medicare Advantage cuts \nincluded in the health reform law would result in 1 million Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries losing current health benefits, those Medicare \nAdvantage cuts would not go into effect.\n  Medicare Advantage makes a tremendous difference in the lives of \nbeneficiaries. They have told me over and over again how important it \nis for them to have lower deductibles, premiums, and copayments.\n  And what a difference it makes to have dental and vision benefits.\n  The Medicare Advantage cuts in the health reform law would take away \nthose benefits. For that reason, I strongly oppose these cuts and urge \nmy colleagues to support my motion to commit and do the right thing for \nMedicare beneficiaries, seniors and disabled individuals, across \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as a motion to commit, this clearly is \ndesigned to kill the bill. All motions to commit have that intent and \neffect. Let's remind ourselves, the underlying bill protects all \nMedicare beneficiaries. All statutory benefits are guaranteed in the \nunderlying legislation. Second, the underlying bill reforms Medicare \nAdvantage which rewards high performance Medicare Advantage programs, \nthose providing value, whereas under current law that is not the case. \nIn addition, if this amendment passes, fee-for-service Medicare \nbeneficiaries would have to pay a $90-a-year penalty to pay for the \nexcess subsidy of Medicare Advantage plans. For lots of reasons, this \nmotion should not prevail.\n  I move to table the motion to commit and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment saves $6.5 billion over the \nnext 10 years for what it does on fraudulent Medicaid prescriptions--\n$6.5 billion--$650 million a year on fraudulent prescriptions. It also \ncreates a prohibition so that erectile dysfunction drugs are not paid \nfor by the American taxpayers to convicted rapists, those convicted of \nsexual assault, and pedophiles in this country.\n  You can say a lot of things about a lot of amendments.

Mr. President, this legislation is about filling the \ndoughnut hole for seniors. It is about providing health care for \nworking families, for children.

It deserves serious debate.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of \nthis Senate, the debate, and the American people. It is not a serious \namendment.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3608 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are hearing from State leaders all \nover our country begging Congress to abandon this bill that is an \nunconstitutional preemption of States rights, State innovation, and \nState prerogatives. Thirteen States have already filed suit against \nthis bill.\n  My amendment would restore the 10th amendment rights reserved to the \nStates by allowing State legislatures to pass legislation to allow them \nto opt out of this bill, opt out of the job-killing taxes, opt out of \nthe cuts to Medicare, opt out of the unfunded Medicaid mandates, when \nour States are hurting already. They are not balancing their budgets \nright now. This is going to make it worse.\n  This is an easy ``yes'' vote, and I hope our colleagues will help our \nStates to opt out of this bill if they choose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is another in a long series of killer \namendments. Clearly, allowing States to opt out of any or all \nprovisions of the underlying health care reform bill would have that \nresult. States could decide not to abide by health care market reforms, \npreexisting conditions, provisions against rescissions, et cetera. \nStates could decide not to provide health care coverage to their \ncitizens. One State versus the national program. States could decide \nthey are not going to pay the fees, enact the fees that are required on \nState pharmaceuticals or insurance industries. States could make all \nkinds of decisions which basically would have the effect of killing \nthis bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to not support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote in relation to amendment No. 3638, offered by the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, just last week we passed the HIRE Act, \nwhich included a tax credit offered by Senator Schumer and Senator \nHatch to encourage companies to hire unemployed workers. It makes no \nsense for any of us to have voted for that bill and then not to support \nthe amendment that I have offered.\n  The amendment I am offering would waive the onerous fines that are in \nthis bill for small businesses that hire unemployed workers. If you \nvoted for the HIRE Act giving a tax credit, why in the world would you \nsupport a policy of imposing penalties on businesses that hire \nunemployed workers?\n  Mr. President, I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment basically has the intent of \ncreating a group of second-class employees. It is very similar to the \nissue of subminimum wage. It makes all the sense in the world to \ndistinguish the two, between the HIRE Act and this amendment.\n  The HIRE Act gave incentives for firms to hire new employees. This \namendment creates a group of second-class employees. It says you can \nhire employees so long as they do not have health insurance. I think \nthat is wrong. I do not think we should have a second class of \nemployees, which is the effect of the amendment. I urge it be defeated.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3639, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this amendment gets at the issue of the \nstudent loan program and what this bill would propose to do to that \nprogram.\n  Under this bill, students in this country would have one option to \nget a student loan--the Federal Government. Today, there are 2,000 \nlenders across this country that make student loans. A recent article \nin the Wall Street Journal pointed out that the shift to government \nlending would mean lending would now be operated by the Department of \nEducation, which is ``distinguished in its Soviet-style customer \nservice.''\n  There are 30,000 to 35,000 jobs in this country that are associated \nwith the student loan program. At a time of record-high unemployment \nlevels, we need to ensure that moving student lending to the Department \nof Education does not place more Americans on unemployment. As our \neconomy recovers, we should be focused on ways to increase jobs in the \nprivate sector, not ending those positions in favor of adding more \ngovernment bureaucrats in Washington.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Education to certify \nthat no State would experience a net job loss as a result of the \nFederal Family Education Student Loan Program being terminated.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table is not in order.\n  There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is not about protecting \njobs, because the bill already does that. We carve out a role for \nnonprofit lenders to service loans. We provided $50 million in this \nbill to incentivize companies--private companies, too--to keep jobs in \nthe same towns and cities where they are now. Private lenders will \ncontinue to service the $450 billion in outstanding private loan \nvolume.\n  Let me say this also about Sallie Mae. They took a couple thousand \njobs out of this country. Guess what. They are bringing them back \nbecause they get to service the loans. Under Treasury rules, in order \nfor them to service the loans, it has to be done in this country. So \nSallie Mae is bringing jobs back to America.\n  This amendment is not about protecting jobs. It is about killing the \nbill and leaving the subsidies to the big banks, where they are today.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this amendment would strike the CLASS Act \nfrom the bill. The CLASS Act, as we all know, is a new entitlement \nprogram.

One of our Democratic \ncolleagues has called the CLASS Act ``a Ponzi scheme of the first \norder, the kind of thing that Bernie Madoff would be proud of.''\n  Even the Washington Post described it as a ``gimmick . . . designed \nto pretend that health care is fully paid for.''\n  The administration's Chief Actuary said ``there is a significant risk \nof failure, there is a significant risk that the problem of adverse \nselection would make the CLASS program unsustainable,'' and the CBO \nsaid the additional deficit increases would amount to ``the order of \ntens of billions of dollars for each 10-year period'' after 2029.\n  We know what this is. This is a gimmick. It is a budgetary gimmick \nused to make this bill look like it is paid for when it is not. We \nought to strike it from the bill, and I hope my colleagues will support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the CLASS Act is a voluntary, self-funded \ninsurance program, with enrollment for people who are presently \nemployed. There are no taxpayer dollars involved whatsoever.\n  The statement that the Senator referred to was made before we made \nsure it was paid for. It is all paid for. In fact, the Senator from New \nHampshire in our committee offered an amendment that made sure it was \nfully funded for 75 years. The Congressional Budget Office has \ncertified this will be solvent for 75 years. Plus, it will save \ntaxpayers money.\n  By letting people put some money aside, so if they become disabled \nthey can stay at home rather than going to a nursing home, we save \nMedicaid dollars. This saves taxpayer dollars from paying more into \nMedicaid in the future.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the Thune amendment \nviolates section 310(D)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, mine is a motion to commit the \nreconciliation bill back to the Finance Committee to report the bill \nback without the brandnew, whopping 3.8 percent tax on investment and \nsavings. This is a $123 billion mistake. It will discourage savings and \ninvestment and decrease the standard of living for millions of \nAmericans. Simply put, increasing taxes on investment income and \nsavings income is a job killer. It is just one of many job-killing \nprovisions of this bill, $100 billion of new taxes and fees on health \ncare consumers, an employer mandate that will kill jobs.\n  My motion will also make sure the bill does not break another one of \nthe President's promises when he pledged that everyone in America will \npay lower taxes than they would under the rates Bill Clinton had in the \n1990s.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an honest, straightforward \namendment which is concerned about people making more than $200,000. \nThe effect of some amendments prior to this moment have been trying to \nprotect people making less than $200,000. This amendment is the exact \nopposite; it is only concerned about people making more than $200,000 \nin income.\n  The bill itself also provides that people whose investment income is \nabove $200,000 should contribute to the Medicare trust fund. Currently, \nthey do not. Only taxes on wages contribute to the Medicare trust fund. \nThe thought is that people with unearned income should also contribute. \nThis tax only applies to those who make above $200,000. There is a \npassthrough exemption, subchapter S. Other passthroughs are exempted. \nRetirement income is exempted. It doesn't make sense that people making \nover $200,000 should be exempt.\n  I move to table the motion to commit and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3579, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, included in the new taxes in this health \nreform is a tax hike of $20 billion on medical devices. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation both \nconfirmed these excise taxes will not--will not--be borne by the \nmedical device industry but, instead, are passed on to patients in the \nform of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.\n  Who are these folks who will bear the burden of this new tax? People \nwith disabilities, diabetics, amputees, people with cancer, just to \nname some of the people--and more--who will see their costs go up \nbecause of this tax. We do not want to do this. Why should we want to \ndo this on those who are most vulnerable?\n  This amendment would prevent this new tax from raising the already \nhigh costs for this group and a tax that will stifle the Medicaid \ndevice technology and innovation of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is offset by an \namendment similar to that offered by Senator Schumer in the Finance \nCommittee so it must be bipartisan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how have Kansas and Kansas State done \nlately?\n  This is a very simple amendment. This health care bill is premised on \nthe assumption that all groups should participate in finding the \ncorrect health care solution for our health care system. That includes \nhospitals, pharmaceuticals, and it also includes device manufacturers. \nThis amendment would exclude one section: device manufacturers.\n  How is it paid for? It is paid for by reducing the number of people \nwho would otherwise get tax credits to help pay for their health \ninsurance. I do not think that is what we want to do. We do not want to \nreduce the number of people who have health insurance. This amendment \nwould reduce coverage for people who need help buying insurance.\n  So I move to table this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3588 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we just heard from Senator Roberts about \nthe medical devices. I think he pointed out very clearly that there is \nkind of another hidden tax in this legislation of some $20 billion on \nmedical devices. I think it is important to listen to what Senator \nRoberts said, that it was not--it is not the device companies that will \nbe paying this; it will be the individuals who would be paying it.\n  Now, the difference between my amendment and Senator Roberts' \namendment is that mine excludes those devices for children and those \nwith disabilities. For example, some of our troops coming home have \nlost limbs, and they have prosthetic devices. This is for them. This is \nfor the 8-year-old whose heart quit beating in the middle of the night \nand they put a pacemaker in and it saved his life. It is for incubators \nand this type of thing. It is the same thing. It is the same offset as \nSenator Roberts and Senator Schumer had, and I would ask that you \nseriously consider this amendment. This is for the children and those \nwith disabilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, two subjects. First, I wish to correct the \nrecord. I mistakenly stated that the Kansas Wildcats were not in the \nSweet 16. That was an error. The Kansas State Wildcats are very much in \nthe Sweet 16, and my apologies to coach Frank Martin of the Wildcats. I \nwish them very well in the tournament.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, I don't have much time, but I will do my very best.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am just so sorry that Montana lost in the first round.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would say to my good friend, he isn't nearly as sorry \nas I am.\n  Basically, this is like the last amendment--two flaws. It exempts a \ncertain group from the shared responsibility in helping to finance \nhealth care reform. The second flaw is that it reduces coverage by \nchanging the income threshold. This is not a way to do business.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, there is a tax hike of $20 billion on \nmedical devices in this bill. These taxes are passed on to patients in \nthe form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.\n  My amendment would prevent this new tax from raising costs or hurting \naccess for American soldiers and veterans by exempting medical devices \nused by the TRICARE Program and the Veterans Health Program.\n  We need to protect our wounded warriors who rely on these medical \ndevices for recovery and to live a normal life.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to the past \ntwo amendments we voted on. It seeks to exempt a sympathetic group of \nindividuals from the excise tax on medical device manufacturers. The \namendment is misplaced. We already exempt retail purchases of medical \ndevices, such as Band-Aids, glasses--all those kinds of items. The tax \nonly applies to large manufacturers. The government negotiates with the \nlarge manufacturers. The government is large enough to exact a better \nprice. It does not pass that on to individuals, not on our military, \nnot on our vets who already receive prescribed health care coverage.\n  Second, this amendment is paid for by increasing the number of \nuninsured. I do not think we want to increase the number of uninsured. \nWe want to decrease the number of uninsured.\n  I reserve the remainder of my 15 seconds so the Senator from Utah can \nfinish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I feel deeply about this. I do not think we \nshould leave these wounded warriors without access to the best medical \ndevices, and I do not think we should be assessing them extra costs. \nThis is a simple amendment. This is one we all ought to vote for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very simply, this will not be passed on. \nThe government is a large payer. They will be able to negotiate for \nbetter prices.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3651, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment addresses what is a core \nproblem we have with our health care system, which is the fact that \nevery year we cut our doctors' pay--those doctors who deliver Medicare \nservices. This year, it will be cut 21 percent. This amendment restores \nthat pay so that those cuts don't occur for a period of 3 years. This \nis known as the doctors fix.\n  It should have been in the bill to begin with. The reason it wasn't \nin the bill was because the other side wanted to not put it in the bill \nbecause of its cost, because it scores at $280 billion over 10 years. \nThe other side didn't want to absorb that score because it would have \nthrown the entire bill out of whack relative to the budget.\n  We have come up with a way to address this doctor problem that pays \nfor it for 3 years. Let's do it. Let's take care of these doctors who \nare delivering these services so they can continue to deliver services \nto Medicare recipients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire and I kid \neach other about this. The fact is, this is another killer amendment, \nand it is apparent it is designed to kill this bill. Why do I say that? \nBecause on October 21 of last year, the sponsor of this amendment, and \nevery other Senator on the other side of the aisle, voted against \ninvoking cloture on a bill to accomplish the very same thing they \nprofess to desire at this point.\n  Also, we have been advised by the Congressional Budget Office that it \nis not paid for. According to CBO--they recently sent us a note--the \nGregg amendment would increase the deficit by $65 billion over the next \n5 years.\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\n  We will solve the SGR problem at the appropriate time. This body will \nthen decide at that time the degree to which we want to pay for the \nSGR. This is not the time or the place. This is a killer amendment.\n  According to CBO, it increases the deficit by $65 billion over the \nnext 5 years; therefore, I raise a point of order that the Gregg \namendment violates section 310(d)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: This amendment pays \nfor the doctors fix for 3 years, does it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is unaware.\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw the inquiry.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and \nsection 4(G)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to \nwaive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget \nresolutions for purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3652\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes, equally divided, \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment No. 3652, offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, my amendment is quite simple. In the rush to \nfinish this bill, there were some errors. One of the errors was \nclarifying the status of some veterans programs, specifically the \nTRICARE program, the VA spina bifida program--that is the children of \nAgent Orange exposure from Vietnam--and the last one is the CHAMPVA \nprogram.\n  What this amendment simply does is set the minimum essential coverage \nas met on these programs, so the veterans' families, the children of \nveterans, are not at risk of determining that their insurance does not \nmeet the minimum essential coverage, therefore, exposing them to fines.\n  Some might suggest it does not need to be fixed. The House went back \nvery quickly and fixed TRICARE but not CHAMPVA or spina bifida. It is \nmy belief we should act on that on the appropriate mechanism, which is \nthis fix-it bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would suggest to my colleague from North \nCarolina and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if we \nwant to fix this problem, we can fix it right now and we should fix it \nright now.\n  We should not allow things to be tied up in the separate melodrama of \nthe moment. I introduced a bill on Monday which passed the House \nunanimously on Saturday to fix the TRICARE part of this. The chairman \nof the Veterans' Committee introduced a bill today to fix the spina \nbifida problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 3148, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode to provide for the treatment of Department of Defense health \ncoverage as minimal essential coverage, sponsored by myself; further, \nthat the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration en bloc, along \nwith the bill introduced earlier today by Senator Akaka, S. 3162, a \nbill to clarify the health care provided by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs that constitutes minimum essential coverage; that all \nDemocratic Senators be added as cosponsors to this measure; that the \nbills be read a third time and passed en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We got this 1\\1/2\\ minutes ago to see the language. You \nhave an amendment on the floor that actually accomplishes everything \nyou want to do. Why are we doing this? Because you do not want to mess \nup a package that is clean. It has every application, the Burr \namendment, to this.\n  With that, and the fact that this is exactly the kind of shenanigans \nthe American people do not want, I object.\n  Mr. WEBB. Let the American people understand, the Republicans \nobjected to a matter that could have been fixed by law tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I move that we table the Burr amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. It \nwould repeal the ObamaCare bill. That bill is fatally flawed in terms \nof its core, and we do need to repeal and replace it with a very \ndifferent, more targeted, focused, step-by-step approach. What is that \ncore? It is more than $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts on our seniors, \nwhich is wrong; over $\\1/2\\ trillion of tax increases, including on \nmiddle-class families, which is wrong; increasing health care costs \nrather than doing the opposite, decreasing them. That is what the CBO \nsays, nonpartisan. That will result in increased individual health care \npremiums, 10 to 13 percent, and government getting even more involved \nin our lives, including over 16,000 new IRS agents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I give a prize to the Senator from \nLouisiana. This is very transparent. It is very straightforward. It is \ntotally honest. It is not dressed up. It is not camouflaged. It is \nstraight repeal of health care reform.\n  Therefore, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes now evenly divided before \na vote with respect to the Roberts amendment.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment protects the rural health \ncare delivery system by exempting critical access hospitals from \ndangerous payment cuts by the Independent Payment Advisory Board. This \nboard is an unelected and unaccountable body, nefarious to be sure, \nwith unprecedented power to set payment rates and make other Medicare \npolicy changes.\n  While most hospitals are exempt from the board's cuts by virtue of \nthe special deals they cut with the administration--for shame--critical \naccess hospitals, which are among the most vulnerable in the country, \nare not exempt.\n  I do not know why critical access hospitals were let out of this \nexemption--perhaps a drafting error; I do not know--but I can think of \nno other more deserving providers than critical access hospitals \nthroughout our rural areas--in Montana and in Kansas--to be spared from \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board's cuts. Save the rural health \ncare delivery system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree--Kansas, Montana, anywhere--\ncritical access hospitals should be treated the same way as other \nhospitals. And when we get to that point, I say to my good friend from \nKansas, I will work with him, and I know he will with me, so we can \nexempt critical access hospitals from this commission.\n  However, the Parliamentarian tells us it is not permissible to amend \nprograms subject to fast-track rules such as this commission in a \nreconciliation bill. Critical access hospitals are not in. It is a \ntechnical error, oversight--there are all kinds of reasons why it \nshould be in, but they are not, and I cannot, at this point, agree with \nmy friend to take them out now. I will at a later date, but we cannot \nnow.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Surely, you are not going to raise a point of order?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, surely I have to do the right thing. The \nright thing is to raise a point of order. I raise a point of order that \nthe Roberts amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I take it the chairman has raised the \npoint of order, so we are at regular order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are, and the Senator can make his motion.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, pursuant to section \n904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the \nstatutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of those acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes \nof my amendment in saving rural hospitals, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote with respect to the Roberts motion to commit.\n  The junior Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This motion commits the bill back to the Finance Committee with \ninstructions to repeal ``the four rationers'' of health care reform. \nThese four horsemen of the rationing apocalypse are the Patient Center \nOutcomes Research Institute, already conducting research that will be \nused to deny coverage and ration care; the CMS Innovation Center, which \nwill grant new powers to CMS--that should be a pleasant thought by any \nbeleaguered hospital administrator--the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce, which is given new powers--that is the outfit that said women \nshould not have mammograms until age 50--wonderful--and the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board, vested with extraordinary power to set Medicare \npayment rates and make policy decisions.\n  These rationers comprise the infrastructure for the ``Brave New \nWorld'' of big government intrusion into health care decisions of all \nAmericans, and they must be repealed.\n  Start over. Put patient care first. Get them back in the corral. \nSupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, saying it doesn't make it so. It is not at \nall as it has been described.\n  We very much in this country have to work to control health care \ncosts. Doctors and hospitals--especially doctors--want to practice \nevidence-based medicine, even more than they do now. They want the \nevidence. They want the information. They want to know which procedures \nand medicine, et cetera, work better than others. These commissions \nwill help them get that information. Then, they make the decisions \nalone, independently, with their patients as to what to do. But they \nwant more evidence so they can make more evidence-based decisions.\n  Second, I am not going to sugarcoat it. This independent advisory \nboard is very important to help improve quality of care and to control \ncosts. It does have some teeth in it. But I say to my colleagues, if we \nreally want to do something about health care costs in this country, \nthis is a start. CBO says this does score positively. I, therefore, \nmove to table the motion, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have finished the first tranche of \namendments and motions, some 23 in number, all of which were amendments \npending at the end of the 20 hours. I think it is time we pause for a \nminute and find out where we are and where we need to go.\n  First of all, I congratulate the entire Senate. I think the decorum \nof the Senate has been maintained in the highest standards. The debate \nhas been good. I especially appreciate the work of the staff, the \nprofessionals they always are.\n  We have handled, as I indicated, 23 amendments and motions. Not a \nsingle one has been adopted. All of the amendments and motions have \nbeen offered by the minority, which is their right. The average, \naccording to CRS, number of amendments offered during this same type of \nproceeding is 21. We are two over that now.\n  I want, of course, to congratulate my friend, Senator Gregg, who has \nmanaged these budget-type proceedings on many occasions and is always a \ngentleman, easy to work with. There could have been a lot of \ncontroversy. There has been none. There has been no reading of \namendments. There has been agreement that time would be allowed to \nspeak on behalf of amendments.\n  I think, though--I am speaking to my chairs: Harkin, Baucus, Dodd, \nConrad--they agree unanimously we need to just continue. The House of \nRepresentatives worked all weekend moving this issue along, and I think \nwe need to move this along and find out if they have to take any action \non this tomorrow, which is today.\n  I say to my colleague, my counterpart, the Republican leader, through \nthe Chair that I think we would like to know what the plans are. We are \nnot going to offer any amendments. We would like to know if there is \nsome indication from the Republican side as to how many more amendments \nwe are going to deal with this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend the majority leader, \nI agree, I think the process has been well handled today. The top \nnumber of amendments that have been offered on past reconciliation \nbills is 53. We have offered 23.\n  We have had a number of discussions off the floor, I say for the \nbenefit of everyone in the Chamber, about some process to complete this \nbill and to complete the next bill that will be brought up by the \nmajority after we finish this bill. I think there is a chance we might \nbe able to reach some agreement on the disposition of this bill and \nthat bill. I think we should\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\ncontinue to discuss it. I will be happy to continue those discussions \nwith the majority leader. In the meantime, it strikes me we can either \ncontinue voting tonight or we could set a reasonable time in the \nmorning after everybody has had a chance to get some sleep, continue \nvoting and discussing and see if we can't wrap up both this measure and \nthe next one in the not too distant future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my focus is on this legislation, and I know \nthere are other things we have to deal with before we leave, but I am \nnot concerned about those at this stage. I want to finish this \nlegislation, and I want to do that as quickly as we can.\n  So I would ask that we just proceed. I hope there aren't that many \nmore amendments, but we are here for the duration.\n  I would note--and I am certainly in no way trying to denigrate those \namendments that have been offered, but we have to understand that not a \nsingle one has been adopted. I don't know what we are trying to \naccomplish. We have listened intently. Most of the comments from our \nside have been from the chairman of the Finance Committee because most \nof these issues deal with the jurisdiction he has. But it is very clear \nthere is no attempt to improve the bill. There is an attempt to destroy \nthis bill.\n  We already have a law in place. It is the bill that we passed on \nChristmas Eve 2009. That is the law of this land. This is a matter to \nimprove that, and I have to suggest that we are going to continue down \nthis road. I am not sure it is a good picture for the American people, \nto have all these amendments and not a single one of them having enough \nvotes to pass, but that judgment is not mine. We are here to try to \nmove this along.\n  The House of Representatives is waiting for us to act, as we speak. I \nthink they have proven they are willing to work hard, as indicated this \npast weekend and over the last several weeks. So let's continue forward \nin the same spirit we have gotten this far. But I would hope that my \nfriends understand I think it would be to the benefit of most everyone \nif we could get out of here at a decent hour today. If it is not, if we \nare going to keep going, that is the way it is. I am an old marathoner, \nand getting older every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would just add that there are some obvious \ndisadvantages to the minority to be in a reconciliation contest, but \none of the advantages is that we have had more amendment votes today \nthan we had in the entire month of December on the previous health care \nbill. So the majority leader may not think we are serious about \nchanging the bill, but we would like to change the bill. And with a \nlittle help from our friends on the other side, we could improve this \nbill significantly.\n  But rather than subject all of our Members to listening to the \nmajority leader and myself go back and forth, I would simply suggest it \nmight be a better use of his and my time for us to continue the \ndiscussions we have been having off the floor, continue to offer the \namendments, and see if we can reach an accommodation that satisfies \nboth sides. Maybe the best way to do that would be for Senator Reid and \nmyself to continue our discussions while we will keep voting, if that \nis what the majority would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3681\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to call up Bunning amendment \nNo. 3681.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3681.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow individuals to elect to opt out of the Medicare part \n                              A benefits)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE \n                   MEDICARE PART A BENEFIT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of \n     an individual who elects to opt out of benefits under part A \n     of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, such individual \n     shall not be required to--\n       (1) opt out of benefits under title II of such Act as a \n     condition for making such election; and\n       (2) repay any amount paid under such part A for items and \n     services furnished prior to making such election.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to offer a very important \namendment to many of our seniors. My amendment would allow individuals \nto voluntarily opt out of Medicare Part A benefits. Right now, if you \ndon't want to have Medicare Part A, you have to forego Social Security \nchecks and you also have to repay any Medicare benefits that have been \npaid on your behalf. I don't think that is fair.\n  If a senior doesn't want Part A, they shouldn't be forced to take it. \nMy amendment says that anyone who opts out of Part A will not have to \ngive up their Social Security benefits and would not have to repay \nMedicare payments that have already been made on their behalf. This \namendment does not allow anyone to opt out of paying their Medicare \ntaxes. Instead, it just allows them to not take Medicare benefits \nwithout being penalized.\n  I think this is a fairness issue, and I hope Members can support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, since 1965, Medicare has provided security \nand health to millions of seniors. Along with Social Security, it is \none of the two most successful and best social programs this country \nhas adopted. Now, after 45 years of success, what does this amendment \nseek to do? It seeks to undermine the foundation of our social \ninsurance program.\n  It is a two-tiered system. The wealthy can take care of themselves. \nThen, when they leave Medicare, it leaves a second-class seniors health \ncare system remaining in Medicare. It is unthinkable, frankly, that we \nwould have a two-tiered system for our seniors under Medicare. I \ntherefore move to table the Bunning amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment is based largely on the extenders \npackage that passed the House last week. It includes a 30-day extension \nfor unemployment insurance, COBRA coverage, and the SGR Medicare \nphysicians payment fix. It includes provisions on Federal poverty \nguidelines, national flood insurance, satellite television and \ncompensation for highway programs.\n  There is one very important difference between my amendment and the \nHouse bill. My amendment is fully offset. We can do this without adding \nto the deficit. I urge its passage and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is discussion in progress on how to \ndeal with extenders that is ongoing with the majority leader and \nminority leader. In fact, the minority leader referred to it when he \nspoke just about a half hour ago. I think it is best to continue that \nprocess. More important, I think, this amendment is a killer amendment \ndesigned to send the reconciliation bill back to the House and let it \ngo all over again. It is paid for by repealing some stimulus dollars. \nIt is paid for by cutting back on the fundability of the EITC--clearly \nnonstarters. I might say, too, there are other pay-fors in here that \nare not going to fly, frankly.\n  I raise a point of order the Grassley amendment violates section \n313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Do I have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes? Mr. President, let's wake up. This has to be \npassed. It has to be passed before the end. One of the problems we \nalways have is that it is not offset. It was included in the Baucus-\nGrassley bill way back in February. The leader had the chutzpah to dump \nhis own chairman aside and go ahead with a partisan bill. Then the \nother side complained about the Bunning filibuster, and we have an \nopportunity now to avoid all that. We ought to avoid it and move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I raise the point of order that the Grassley amendment \nviolates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the statutory \npay-as-you-go act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable provisions of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 40, nays 56, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 88 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bond\n     Byrd\n     Isakson\n     Lautenberg\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 40, the nays are \n56. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having not voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to, the point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3568\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I call up my amendment No. 3568.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for himself, Mr. \n     Wicker, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Inhofe, \n     and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 3568.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the democratic process and the right of the people \n            of the District of Columbia to define marriage)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO \n                   DEFINE MARRIAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a broad coalition of residents of the District of \n     Columbia petitioned for an initiative in accordance with the \n     District of Columbia Home Rule Act to establish that ``only \n     marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in \n     the District of Columbia'';\n       (2) this petition anticipated the Council of the District \n     of Columbia's passage of an Act legalizing same-sex marriage;\n       (3) the unelected District of Columbia Board of Elections \n     and Ethics and the unelected District of Columbia Superior \n     Court thwarted the residents' initiative effort to define \n     marriage democratically, holding that the initiative amounted \n     to discrimination prohibited by the District of Columbia \n     Human Rights Act; and\n       (4) the definition of marriage affects every person and \n     should be debated openly and democratically.\n       (b) Referendum or Initiative Requirement.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, including the District of \n     Columbia Human Rights Act, the government of the District of \n     Columbia shall immediately suspend the issuance of marriage \n     licenses to any couple of the same sex until the people of \n     the District of Columbia have the opportunity to hold a \n     referendum or initiative on the question of whether the \n     District of Columbia should issue same-sex marriage licenses.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, with eight other cosponsors, we have \noffered a bill that would allow the people of the District of Columbia \nto exercise the same right that has been exercised by 31 States with \nrespect to the issue of whether there would be gay marriage in their \njurisdiction.\n  This bill does not take any position with respect to gay marriage, \nsimply allows the District to hold a referendum. The Home Rule Charter, \nwhich is a constitution for the District, guarantees the people the \nright to challenge acts passed by the District Council by referendum, \nand the District Council has repeatedly ignored that right. It is in an \neffort to restore that that we offer this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, no matter where you are on the issue of \nmarriage, no matter where you are on the issue of DC home rule, we \nought to be able to agree that neither issue has anything to do with \nthis bill, neither one. Therefore, I raise a point of order that the \namendment is not germane and thus violates section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the statutory Pay-as-you-go Act of 2010, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of my amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. RISCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Fellow Senators, I cannot imagine anyone wanting to vote against this \namendment. Let me tell you what we have here. It is very simple. \nApparently, you made an error when you drafted the original bill \nbecause what you did was you levied a tax on people who make less than \n$200,000 a year. Very simply, what this amendment does is it corrects \nthat.\n  Right now, under the bill the President signed on Monday, it raised \nthe threshold to 10 percent from 7.5 percent at which you can deduct \nmedical expenses. That tax falls on the most vulnerable people in \nAmerica--mostly the elderly, mostly very low income. And it raises \ntaxes on 14.7 million people who make less than $200,000 a year. The \nPresident of the United States said--he told us, he committed--he would \nnot raise taxes on people who make less than $200,000 a year. I am sure \nhe was just confused when he signed the bill on Monday.\n  Let's adopt this amendment and get the bill corrected.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the goal of health care reform is to \nincrease coverage so more people have health insurance. That is the \ngoal of health care reform. What does this amendment do? It goes in the \nopposite direction. Compared with the bill that was just signed by the \nPresident, this amendment will cause many more people to lose health \ninsurance. Why? Because it lowers the income threshold from 8 percent \ndown to 5 percent. That is going to mean fewer Americans get tax \ncredits to pay for health insurance. That means fewer Americans are \ngoing to have health insurance compared with current law. That is the \nmain reason we should vote against this amendment, because it expands \nthe number of people who are uninsured rather than expand the number of \npeople who would be insured.\n  The provision the Senator talks about, frankly, was changed under \ncurrent law because with health insurance people have less need for \nthat deduction and less need for catastrophic coverage because health \ninsurance will not pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table the Risch amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the sunset on marriage penalty relief and to make \n     the election to deduct State and local sales taxes permanent)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 15__. PERMANENT TAX RELIEF PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Sunset on Marriage Penalty Relief.--Title IX \n     of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 (relating to sunset of provisions of such Act) shall not \n     apply to sections 301, 302, and 303(a) of such Act (relating \n     to marriage penalty relief).\n       (b) Permanent Extension of Election to Deduct State and \n     Local Sales Taxes.--Subparagraph (I) of section 164(b)(5) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``, \n     and before January 1, 2010''.\n       (c) Rescission of Stimulus Funds.--Any amounts appropriated \n     or made available and remaining unobligated under division A \n     of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public \n     Law 111-5; 123 Stat. 115) (other than under title X of such \n     division A), are hereby rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nwould just make relief from the marriage penalty and the sales tax \ndeduction permanent. If we don't act, people across our country are \ngoing to start getting the marriage penalty tax once again. This was \ncorrected under previous tax law, but that is going out of existence at \nthe end of this year. Sales tax deduction is something that affects \neight States that do not have a State income tax. It just gives people \neverywhere in America, if they have either an income tax or a sales \ntax, the ability to choose what they deduct from their Federal income \ntaxes.\n  We need to make this law permanent, and I hope everyone will support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues that the \nHutchison amendment uses as its offset rolling back the Recovery Act; \nthat is, rolling back stimulus funds. That is taking stimulus funds to \npermanently pay for the marriage penalty relief as well as sales tax \nrelief.\n  With unemployment as high as it is, hovering around 10 percent, it \nmakes no sense to cut back stimulus dollars. Stimulus dollars are a \nproven job creator. All mainstream economists and the CBO tell us that.\n  I think we should continue to create jobs by using the stimulus \ndollars. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to not support the Hutchison \namendment.\n  In addition to that, there are funds not within the jurisdiction of \nreconciled committees. For that reason, I raise a point of order that \nthe Hutchison amendment violates section 313(B)1(C) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of my amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

David Vitter: I am writing in support of the Mobile \n     Mammography Act which will eliminate the Federal Excise tax \n     on fuel for mobile mammography vehicles. At the LSU Health \n     Sciences Center in Shreveport, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, \n     this year we have put our mobile mammography vehicle into \n     service. We perform free mammograms for the uninsured and \n     underinsured in North Louisiana. As you know this is an \n     expensive operation and fuel costs can be significant. Any \n     savings in fuel cost will allow us to reach more patients in \n     our service area.\n       Mobile Mammography is especially important in Louisiana, \n     which according to 2005 SEER statistics has the highest \n     breast cancer mortality of all the states. The rural areas in \n     Louisiana are particularly underserved as 40% of the parishes \n     in North Louisiana have no mammography facilities; and those \n     parishes with mammography are often unaffordable to our lower \n     income patients.\n       On behalf of the women in Louisiana. I applaud your efforts \n     and support for a vital resource--mobile mammography.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Jerry W. McLarty, Ph.D.,\n                                  Professor of Medicine, Director,\n     Cancer Prevention & Control.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Mobile Health Clinics Network,\n\n                                                 October 29, 2009.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: We are writing to support for your \n     proposed amendment to the IRS Code of 1986 to allow refunds \n     of Federal motor fuel excise taxes on fuels used in Mobile \n     Mammography vehicles.\n       Most of the nearly 200 Mobile Mammography programs \n     throughout the U.S. are non-profits organizations; many \n     provide screenings for medically underserved women. In the \n     past year, non-profits have been struggling due to the \n     economic downturn, resulting in a decrease in donor dollars. \n     Because of the downturn, there are also more and more \n     Americans that need to access the services we provide, and it \n     is very difficult to predict when the benevolence of \n     Americans who can give will be restored to previous levels. \n     Thus, every cost savings that we can realize makes a \n     difference in our ability to continue the vital health \n     services that we offer. The change that you propose to the \n     tax code may be the difference between continued operations \n     and closing services for some programs, and with Mobile \n     Healthcare, our continuation gives us the opportunity to \n     further impact lives, and in some cases, saving lives of \n     Americans across the nation. We encourage the passage of this \n     important amendment, cited as the ``Mobile Mammography \n     Promotion Act of 2009''.\n       It is our sincere hope that the impact from this change \n     will be great enough to encourage you and your colleagues in \n     the Senate and the House to consider expanding the \n     application of the amendment to include all Mobile Healthcare \n     programs. There are approximately 2,000 Mobile Health \n     programs operating in the U.S., serving millions of women, \n     men, and children--many of whom have no other access to \n     affordable preventive and primary care, mammography \n     screenings, and oral healthcare. It is widely recognized that \n     Mobile Healthcare programs yield improved health outcomes for \n     the underserved and save the healthcare system billions of \n     dollars.\n       Mobile Health Clinics Network (MHCN) is a nationwide, \n     membership-based association of Mobile Health programs \n     primarily operated by non-profit entities such as community \n     health clinics, hospitals, and university schools of \n     medicine, nursing and dentistry. MHCN completed its Fifth \n     Annual Mobile Health Clinics Forum this past April, and we \n     are pleased to send you (under separate mail) a copy of the \n     official Program Binder. It will certainly offer you a view \n     toward the breadth and scope of Mobile Healthcare programs \n     that now operate in the U.S. and internationally.\n       On behalf of Mobile Mammography and Mobile Health clinics \n     across the nation, we thank you for your efforts toward \n     introducing the IRS amendment and for your continued \n     attention to making positive impacts that will support \n     continued operation of these unique healthcare delivery \n     systems. Early detection is the most effective method to \n     preventing and treating disease, and for Americans who rely \n     on Mobile Health services for these critical interventions, \n     this tax change could ensure many more years of access to a \n     healthcare system that provides potentially life-saving \n     services.\n     Sincerely,\n                                              Anthony Vavasis, MD,\n       Advisory Board Chair, Mobile Health Clinics Network, \n     Clinical Director, Health Outreach to Teens Program, New \n     York, NY.\n     Darien DeLorenzo,\n       CEO & Executive Director, Mobile Health Clinics Network.\n\n\n                      MHCN Advisory Board Members\n\n       Melissa Lofton, Administrative Manager, Mobile Mammograph, \n     Breast Diagnostic Clinic, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, \n     Houston, TX, Mammography Co-Chair, 2010 MHCN Annual Forum.\n       Candy Simbalenko, RN, BS, Manager, Breast Health Programs, \n     St. Joseph's Medical Center, Stockton, CA.\n       James Comeaux, LCSW, Chief Operating Officer, St. Charles \n     Community Health Center, Luling, LA.\n       Jennifer Bennet, Executive Director, The Family Van, \n     Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.\n       Tina Hembree, MPH, Program Manager, Cancer Detection & \n     Early Prevention, Norton Healthcare, Cancer Institute, \n     Louisville, KY, Chair, MHCN Mammography SIG.\n       Shirley Hampton, RN, Development Director, Nevada Health \n     Centers, Inc., Carson City, NV.\n       Karen McInerney, RTRM, Director, Breast Imaging Services, \n     Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA.\n       Leah Berger, MPH, Director, Community Health Programs, \n     Planning & Development, Office of Community Affairs & Health \n     Policy, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, \n     LA.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support--I think every Member \nin this Chamber does--prevention and treatment of breast cancer and \nwomen's health generally. And the bill the President signed Tuesday \nmakes great strides to that end. For example, it prohibits gender \nrating and eliminates the ability of insurers to limit coverage based \non preexisting conditions. In addition to the preventive services \navailable to everyone in the exchange, the health reform bill ensures \nthat women have access to the unique preventive services they need, \nsuch as wellness exams.\n  I might also add that the amendment further drains dollars from the \nhighway trust fund. We don't want to go in that direction. Therefore, \nMr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Therefore, after having had long discussions with my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, I ask unanimous consent that we \nare going to adjourn in a few minutes; that we will convene at 9:45 \na.m. this morning, resume the bill, consider amendments up to 2 p.m., \nwe will dispose of points of order that have been determined--and one \nis still under review--by 2 p.m. There will be no further amendments \nafter 2 p.m., and the third reading will occur after points of order \nare disposed of after 2 p.m.\n  I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ms. Rose Gordon of \nReno, NV. Ms. Gordon is a dedicated social worker and public servant \nwho has devoted much of her life to serving the people of Nevada, \nespecially those who are traditionally underrepresented. Her commitment \ntoassisting Nevadans is shown both by her work as a Washoe County \nsocial worker and by her involvement in numerous community \norganizations.\n  As a social worker, Ms. Gordon has been known for her endless \nmotivation and the sense of self empowerment she gives to members of \nher community. For 15 years Ms. Gordon has partnered with local school \ndistricts to identify potential high school drop-outs and has worked \nwith them and their families to encourage the student to complete high \nschool and receive their diploma. For her efforts to assist children \nand families, Rose has been honored by the mayor of Reno.\n  Ms. Gordon has also worked diligently in the pursuit of civil rights \nfor all individuals. Rose has previously held the positions of \npresident of her local NAACP chapter and vice president of the NAACP \nTri-State Conference of Idaho, Nevada, and Utah, and continues to serve \nas an adviser to the NAACP youth council. She is a member of the People \nof Color Caucus which focuses on the unequal distribution of wealth and \nknowledge to underserved populations. Through her participation and \nleadership in these organizations, Rose has been able to assist many \nmembers of her community and help ensure equal opportunities for \nNevadans.\n  Ms. Gordon's selfless dedication to assisting individuals who are \noften forgotten shows that she is a truly great American. She is a \nleader in the Reno community and an example of how one person with a \nsense of duty can positively affect many around them.\n  I am honored today to recognize Ms. Rose Gordon and thank her for her \ncommitment and for the work she has done to serve the people of Reno, \nNV.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2012-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JUDY TREICHEL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work of Judy \nTreichel, a true and dedicated public servant. Over two decades ago, \nthe Federal Government decided to dump the country's nuclear waste in \nthe Nevada desert, ignoring the opposition of most Nevadans and their \nleaders and widespread concern that the project was not scientifically \nsound. Judy recognized that the government's actions were unjust and \ndecided to help lead the opposition to the Yucca Mountain project. So, \nshe founded a nonprofit organization, the Nevada Nuclear Waste Task \nForce, and dedicated her career to making sure that the people of \nNevada and across the country have access to accurate information on \nthe proposed dump at Yucca Mountain and that they are given the \nopportunity to be heard.\n  Since 1987, Judy has attended thousands of meetings, hearings, \nconferences, and classroom discussions related to nuclear waste and \nYucca Mountain. As executive director of the task force, she served as \nthe principal liaison between the public interest community and the \nrelevant Federal Government agencies. She brought a public voice to \ngovernment hearings, technical meetings, and national conferences, and \nshe provided information to grassroots organizations and individuals on \nthe very technical and complicated issues surrounding Yucca Mountain, \nwhich concerned and affected their communities. That is how Judy became \none of the leading voices in Nevada on the proposed nuclear waste dump.\n  I have been honored to work with Judy Treichel over the past 23 \nyears, and I can say from experience, that the people of Nevada have \nbeen lucky to have such a dedicated and capable woman fighting on their \nbehalf. That is why I was proud to send Judy a note recently letting \nher know that, with her help, we have won the fight against Yucca \nMountain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2012-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2012-S2015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the President signed into \nlaw today the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This bill \nincluded a provision that would extend Medicare wage index \nreclassifications for hospitals across more than half of the United \nStates, including several in my home State.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 included section 508 which \nreclassified many hospitals' Medicare wage index to appropriately \nreflect the wage index of their area. This provision ensures that \nhospitals are able to compete fairly in that area's labor market. Since \nthe MMA was enacted, section 508 has been extended numerous times. Many \nhospitals, including some in Michigan, were left out of these \nsubsequent extensions. Consequently, those hospitals, originally \nincluded in section 508, required technical corrections so they could \ncontinue to be reclassified along with the other original hospitals \nincluded in section 508. This is something that we have done in \nprevious years and is nothing new. These technical fixes just ensure \nthat the original intent of section 508 is maintained.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, we saw what I have \ncalled the dawn of a new day of hope for tens of millions of Americans \nwho have fallen through the cracks--or who worry with good reason that \nthey may fall through the cracks--of our broken health insurance \nsystem. The signing into law of comprehensive health insurance reform \nby President Barack Obama ranks with the creation of Social Security \nand Medicare as a defining moment and legislative achievement.\n  Congress and Presidents from both parties tried to reform the health \ninsurance system for decades. Through an arduous process over the last \nyear, America rose to meet one of its foremost challenges. This effort \nprevailed through the grueling gauntlet of obstructionism erected by \ndefenders of\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nthe status quo. It took a year of debate, the work of numerous \ncommittees and both Chambers of Congress to enact health insurance \nreform and to begin to get a handle on costs by having Americans \ncovered by health insurance.\n  Now that comprehensive health insurance reform is the law of the \nland, the Senate is already working on improvements to this \nlegislation. These include making coverage more affordable and creating \na more equitable distribution of Medicaid reimbursements to States like \nVermont that acted early and correctly on reform.\n  Some are still in denial, and continue to resist the path to reform. \nSome in the Senate resist improvements to the aspects of the new law \nthat they had previously criticized. They appear intent on voting \nagainst improvements and, in effect, in favor of the aspects of the law \nthey had said raised concerns. Some opponents of reform continue to \ndistort what this reform really means, and continue their misleading \narguments and spurious attacks. Some appear to see political gain in \ntrying to attack health care reform with lawsuits. This is an effort to \nhave judges override the legislative decisions of Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. This is an effort to repeal \nthrough the courts what they cannot do in Congress. Regardless, health \ninsurance reform is the law of the land.\n  Every member of Congress takes an oath of office. Ours is to \n``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' I take \nthis oath very seriously and always have. We took it seriously during \nthe many months of open and public debate of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act last year. During Senate debate last December, as \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I responded to arguments \nabout the constitutionality of the bill's requirement that individuals \npurchase health insurance. During that debate, the Senate rejected a \npurported constitutional point of order raised by Republicans claiming \nthat the individual responsibility requirement was unconstitutional. \nThe Senate's judgment and mine were that the act was constitutional.\n  This week the President signed the measure into law. This President \nhas studied the Constitution. He has served in the Senate. He has \ntaught classes on constitutional law. The oath he took when he became \nPresident of the United States of America is provided in the \nConstitution. He swore that he would to the best of his ability \n``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' \nI know President Obama and know that he takes his oath seriously. I \nknow that when he signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \ninto law, he understood it to be consistent with the Constitution.\n  Despite the overheated rhetoric from opponents, the authority of \nCongress to act is well-established by the text and the spirit of the \nConstitution, by prior acts of Congress like Social Security and \nMedicare, by longstanding precedent established by our courts, and by \nthe history of American democracy. These were arguments considered and \nrejected in congressional committees. They were arguments expressly \nconsidered by the Senate. Indeed the findings adopted and contained in \nthe law itself are that the individual responsibility requirement is \ncommercial and economic in nature, has a substantial effect on \ninterstate commerce and is ``essential to creating effective health \ninsurance markets.'' That is the congressional judgment.\n  Ironically, the so-called individual mandate has long been a \nRepublican proposal. The individual mandate was supported by the senior \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, when they opposed health care reform \nefforts during the Clinton administration. It was a part of the health \ncare reform effort in Massachusetts supported by former Governor Mitt \nRomney, a Republican.\n  This individual mandate did not originate with President Obama. In \nfact, when President Obama was a candidate, as a matter of policy he \ndid not support the individual mandate requirement as part of his \ninitial comprehensive health reform proposal. It was one of the \nhundreds of Republican health care reform ideas he came to support and \nthat were included in the law as the bill was drafted, developed, \ndebated and passed. Now that the law is enacted, some Republicans have \nchanged their tune in order to undercut these reforms by suggesting \nthat it is unconstitutional.\n  Although the legislative record supports the constitutionality of the \nindividual mandate, and expert after expert maintain that there is no \nquestion about congressional authority, I, again, recall what I set \nforth last December when the Senate considered this issue, made its \nfindings and reached its determination.\n  The Constitution of the United States begins with a preamble that \nsets forth the purposes for which ``We the People of the United \nStates'' ordained and established it. Among the six purposes set forth \nby the Founders was that the Constitution was established to ``promote \nthe general Welfare.'' It is hard to imagine an issue more fundamental \nto the general welfare of all Americans than their health.\n  The authority and responsibility for taking actions to further this \npurpose is vested in Congress by article I of the Constitution. In \nparticular article I, section 8, sets forth several of the core powers \nof Congress, including the ``general welfare clause,'' the ``commerce \nclause'' and the ``necessary and proper clause.'' These clauses form \nthe basis for Congress's power, and include authority to reform health \ncare by containing spiraling costs and ensuring its availability for \nall Americans.\n  Any serious questions about congressional power to take comprehensive \naction to build and secure the social safety net have been settled over \nthe past century. According to article I, section 8: ``The Congress \nshall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare \nof the United States.'' This clause has been the basis for actions by \nCongress to provide for Americans' social and economic security by \npassing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those landmark laws \nprovide the well-established foundation on which Congress builds with \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  As noted by Tom Schaller, enforcing the individual mandate \nrequirement by a tax penalty is far from unprecedented, despite the \nclaims of critics. Individuals pay for Social Security and Medicare, \nfor example, by payroll taxes collected under the Federal Insurance \nContributions Act, FICA. These FICA payments are typically collected as \ndeductions and noted on Americans' paychecks every month. As Professor \nSchaller recently wrote: ``These are the two biggest government-\nsponsored insurance programs administered by the [Federal Government], \nand two of the largest line items in the federal budget. These paycheck \ndeductions are not optional, and for all but the self-employed they are \ntaken out immediately.'' The individual mandate requirement in the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act is hardly revolutionary when \nviewed against the background of Social Security and Medicare that have \nlong required individual payments.\n  Congress has woven America's social safety net over the last three \nscore and 12 years. Congress's authority to use its judgment to promote \nthe general welfare cannot now be in doubt. America and all Americans \nare the better for it. Growing old no longer means growing poor. Being \nolder or poor no longer means being without medical care. These \ndevelopments are all due to congressional action.\n  The Supreme Court settled the debate on the constitutionality of \nSocial Security more than 70 years ago in three 1937 decisions. In one \nof those decisions, Helvering v. Davis, Justice Cardozo wrote that the \ndiscretion to determine whether a matter impacts the general welfare \n``is not confided in the courts'' but falls ``within the wide range of \ndiscretion permitted to the Congress.'' Turning then to the ``nation-\nwide calamity that began in 1929'' of unemployment spreading from state \nto state throughout the Nation, leaving older Americans without jobs \nand security, Justice Cardozo wrote of the Social Security Act: ``The \nhope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of \nthe poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits \nthem when journey's end is near.''\n  The Supreme Court reached its decisions upholding Social Security \nafter the first Justice Roberts--Justice\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nOwen Roberts in the exercise of good judgment and judicial restraint \nbegan voting to uphold the key New Deal legislation. He was not alone. \nIt was Chief Justice Hughes who wrote the Supreme Court's opinion in \nWest Coast Hotel v. Parrish upholding minimum wage requirements as \nreasonable regulation. The Supreme Court also upheld a Federal farm \nbankruptcy law, railroad labor legislation, a regulatory tax on \nfirearms and the Wagner Act on labor relations in National Labor \nRelations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation. The Supreme \nCourt abandoned its judicially-created veto over congressional action \nwith which it disagreed on policy grounds and rightfully deferred to \nCongress's constitutional authority.\n  These Supreme Court decisions and the principles underlying them are \nnot in question. As Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of \nCalifornia Irvine School of Law wrote in an op-ed in the Los Angeles \nTimes: ``Congress has broad power to tax and spend for the general \nwelfare. In the last 70 years, no federal taxing or spending program \nhas been declared to exceed the scope of Congress' power. The ability \nin particular of Congress to tax people to spend money for health \ncoverage has been long established with programs such as Medicare and \nMedicaid.'' I included this article in the Congressional Record in \nDecember.\n  The opponents of health insurance reform are now going so far as to \ncall into question the constitutionality of America's established \nsocial safety net. They would leave American workers without the \nprotections their lifetime of hard work have earned them. They would \nturn back the clock to the hardships of the Great Depression, and \nthrust modern American back into the conditions of Dickens' novels. \nThat path should be rejected again now, just as it was when another \ninspiring President led the effort to confront the economic challenges \nfacing Americans 70 years ago. To strike down principles that have been \nsettled for nearly three-quarters of a century would be wrong and \ndamaging to the Nation, and would stand the Constitution on its head.\n  For the past year we debated whether or not to pass health insurance \nreform. Before passing the law, we debated whether to control costs by \nhaving all Americans be covered by health insurance. We considered \nuntold numbers of amendments in committees and before the Senate. That \nis what Congress is supposed to do. We consider legislation, debate it, \nvote on it and act in our best collective judgment to promote the \ngeneral welfare. Some Senators agreed and some disagreed, but it was a \nmatter decided by the full Senate. In fact, due to Republican \nobstruction, it took an extraordinary majority of 60 Senators, not a \nsimple majority of 51, for the Senate's will to be done.\n  The fact that Senate Republicans disagree with the majority's effort \nto help hardworking Americans obtain access to affordable health care \ndoes not make it unconstitutional. Nor does the fact that some \npartisans seek to make political gains by attacking the health care \nreform we have passed. As Justice Cardozo wrote in upholding Social \nSecurity: ``[W]hether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of \nbenefits set forth . . . it is not for us to say. The answer to such \ninquiries must come from Congress, not the courts.'' I agree. Justice \nCardozo understood the separation of powers enshrined in the \nConstitution and the Supreme Court's precedent.\n  As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in his landmark decision in McCulloch \nv. Maryland: ``Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of \nthe Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are \nplainly adopted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent \nwith the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.'' \nIn 1803, our greatest Chief Justice, John Marshall, upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Judiciary Act in Stuart v. Laird, and noted \nthat ``there are no words in the Constitution to prohibit or restrain \nthe exercise of legislation power.'' That is true here, where Congress \nacted to provide for the general welfare of all Americans.\n  I believe that Congress was right when it decided that the problems \nof the lack of availability and affordability of health care and of \nhealth insurance and the rising health care costs that burden the \nAmerican people, is a problem, ``plainly national in area and \ndimensions,'' as Justice Cardozo wrote of the widespread crisis of \nunemployment and insecurity during the Great Depression. I believe that \nit was right for Congress to determine that it is in the general \nwelfare of the Nation to ensure that all Americans have access to \naffordable quality health care. But whether other Senators agree or \ndisagree with me, none should argue that we should turn back to clock \nto the Great Depression when conservative activist judges prevented \nCongress from exercising its powers to make that determination.\n  In seeking to discredit health insurance reform, the other side \nrelies on a resurrection of long-discredited legal doctrines used by \ncourts a century ago to tie Congress's hands by substituting their own \nviews of property to strike down laws such as those guaranteeing a \nminimum wage and outlawing child labor. They have to rely on such cases \nof unbridled conservative judicial activism as Lochner v. New York, \nShechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, Reagan v. Farmers Loan \nand Trust and the infamous Dred Scott case. Those dark days are long \ngone and better left behind. The Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, \nour history and congressional action all stand on the side of \nCongress's authority to enact health insurance reform legislation.\n  Under article I, section 8, Congress has the power ``to regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.'' Since at \nleast the time of the Great Depression and the New Deal, Congress has \nbeen understood and acknowledged by the Supreme Court to have power \npursuant to the commerce clause to regulate matters with a substantial \neffect on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has long since upheld \nlaws like the Fair Labor Standards Act against commerce clause \nchallenges, ruling that Congress had the authority to outlaw child \nlabor. The days when women and children could not be protected, when \nthe public could not be protected from sick chickens infecting them, \nwhen farmers could not be protected and when any regulation that did \nnot guarantee profits to corporations would be voided by the judiciary \nare long past. The reach of Congress' commerce clause authority has \nbeen long established and well settled.\n  Even recent decisions by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican-\nappointed justices have affirmed this rule of law. In 2005, the Supreme \nCourt ruled in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress had the power under the \ncommerce clause to prohibit the use of medical marijuana even though it \nwas grown and consumed at home, because of its impact on the national \nmarket for marijuana. Surely if that law passes constitutional muster, \nCongress' actions to regulate the health care market that makes up one-\nsixth of the American economy meets the test of substantially affecting \ncommerce. Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Nor can they ignore \nthe settled meaning of the Constitution as well as the authority of the \nAmerican people's elected representatives in Congress.\n  The regulation of health insurance clearly meets the test from Raich, \nsince the activities ``taken in the aggregate, substantially affect \ninterstate commerce.'' In fact, when the Senate considered the health \ninsurance reform bill in December, it adopted a set of findings related \nto the impact of the individual mandate on interstate commerce. Among \nthose findings, now the law, were that ``health insurance and health \ncare services are a significant part of the national economy,'' that \nthe individual ``requirement regulates activity that is commercial and \neconomic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when \nhealth care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased'' and \nthat the ``requirement is essential to creating effective health \ninsurance markets.''\n  These findings demonstrate that Congress took into account the \nsignificant cumulative economic effects on the Nation of the rising \ncosts of health care, with those costs making up a large percentage of \nour economy and with American businesses struggling to provide benefits \nto their employees. As set forth in a paper by Georgetown University \nand the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, which I \ndiscussed in December, the requirement for individuals to purchase \nhealth\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\ninsurance would address the problem of free riders, millions of \nAmericans who refuse to buy health insurance and then rely on expensive \nemergency health care when faced with medical problems. This shifts the \ncosts of their health care to people who do have insurance, which in \nturn has a significant effect on the costs of insurance premiums for \ncovered Americans and on the economy as a whole. A requirement that all \nAmericans have health insurance--like requirements to pay FICA--is \nwithin congressional power if Congress determines it to be essential to \ncontrolling spiraling health care costs. In passing health care reform, \nCongress determined that requiring that all Americans to have health \ninsurance coverage, and preventing some from depending on expensive \nemergency services in place of regular health care, can and will help \nreduce the cost of health insurance premiums for those who already have \ninsurance.\n  Addressing these problems is at the core of Congress's powers under \nthe commerce clause. In fact, the Supreme Court expressly addressed \nthis issue 65 years ago, ruling in 1944 that insurance was interstate \ncommerce and subject to Federal regulation. Congress responded to this \ndecision in 1945 with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gave insurance \ncompanies an exemption from antitrust laws unless Federal regulation \nwas made explicit under Federal law. It is the immunity from Federal \nantitrust law enacted in McCarran-Ferguson that I have been working to \novercome with the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act \nof 2009. My proposal would repeal health insurance companies' \nantiquated exemption from the antitrust laws. These are the pro-\ncompetition rules that apply to virtually all other businesses, to help \npromote vibrant markets and consumer choice. Competition and choice \nhelp lower costs, expand access and improve quality.\n  I launched this effort last fall, built a hearing record to examine \nits merits and worked to build bipartisan support. House leaders late \nlast year added it to their plan. And last month it became the first \nstand-alone part of the health reform package to pass on its own, in a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 406 to 19 in the House. To me this is the \nlatest proof that, appearances aside, there is much common ground in \nthe health reform plan--more than partisan opponents or the insurance \nindustry would have the public believe.\n  Why would this exemption have been necessary if insurance was not \ninterstate commerce? I strongly believe that the exemption in McCarran-\nFerguson is wrongheaded. But would anyone seriously contend that it is \nunconstitutional? Of course not.\n  Now that we have enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, I hope we will soon turn to this reform by taking up and passing \nthe House-passed bill. We should end the health insurance exemption \nfrom our precompetitive Federal antitrust laws without delay.\n  The Constitution contains in article I, section 8, the necessary and \nproper clause. That, too, provides a basis for congressional action. \nThis clause gives Congress the power ``to make all Laws which shall be \nnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers \nand all other Powers vested by his Constitution in the United States.'' \nThe Supreme Court settled the meaning of the necessary and proper \nclause 190 years ago in Justice Marshall's landmark decision in \nMcCullough v. Maryland, during the dispute over the National Bank. \nJustice Marshall's wrote that ``the clause is placed among the powers \nof Congress, not among the limitations on those powers.'' The necessary \nand proper clause goes hand in hand with the commerce clause to ensure \ncongressional authority to regulate activity with a significant \neconomic impact.\n  Congress has enacted and the President has signed into law the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This landmark legislation \naddresses our health care crisis and helps provide health care \ninsurance for millions of Americans previously uninsured and seeks to \nencourage lower costs for Americans who are insured. We have acted to \nensure that Americans not risk bankruptcy and disaster with every \nillness. Americans who work hard their entire lives should not be \nrobbed of their family's security because health care is too expensive. \nAmericans should not lose their life savings because they have the \nmisfortune of losing a job or getting sick. That is not America.\n  One of the great American successes of the last century was the \nestablishment of a social safety net of which all Americans can be \ngrateful and proud. Through Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, \nCongress established some of the cornerstones of American economic \nsecurity. Comprehensive health insurance reform has now joined them. \nCongress has acted within its constitutional authority to legislate for \nthe general welfare of all Americans. No conservative activist court, \non any level, should overstep the judiciary's role by seeking to turn \nback the clock and deny a century of progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2015-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2015-S2016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD TUBERCULOSIS DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize World \nTuberculosis Day.\n  It is a day that allows us to take stock of how far we have come, and \nhow far we have to go, in the fight against this deadly disease. \nClaiming about 1.8 million lives each year, TB is a vicious killer that \nmust be stopped in order to protect the global public health.\n  Today we recognize not only that we must do more, but that, with the \ntechnology, medical expertise, and a worldwide commitment, we can do \nmore.\n  We have waged an aggressive campaign to eliminate TB in the U.S. \nHowever, progress toward TB elimination has slackened.\n  Anywhere from 9 to 14 million Americans are infected with latent TB. \nWithout treatment, about 5 to 10 percent of them will develop active \nTB. As the global pandemic of drug resistant TB spreads, the disease \nposes an imminent public health threat to the United States.\n  According to the World Health Organization, 5 percent of all new TB \ncases are drug resistant, with estimates of up to 28 percent in some \nparts of Russia. Of these cases, it is estimated that only 7 percent \nare being treated.\n  Over the past decade, the U.S. has had more than 83 cases of an \nextremely drug resistant strain of TB, known as XDR-TB, which is very \ndifficult and expensive to treat. Because XDR-TB recognizes no borders, \nthese cases will continue to rise unless we adopt control measures on a \nglobal scale.\n  As it stands, drug resistant and extremely drug resistant forms of TB \nare not easily transmittable; however, should an easily transmittable \nstrain arise, we face the real possibility of a deadly pandemic in our \ncountry and across the globe.\n  TB control is not just an imperative for the developing world; it is \nan imperative for every nation on this planet.\n  Our current drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines are out of date and \nincreasingly inadequate to control the spread of TB. The TB vaccine, \nfor instance, provides some protection to children, but provides little \nto no help to prevent TB in adults.\n  In addition, the most commonly used TB diagnostic in the world, \nsputum microscopy, is more than 100 years old and lacks sensitivity to \ndetect TB in most HIV/AIDS patients and in children.\n  Finally, the course of treatment available today is simply too long, \nresulting in skipped doses and the development of resistant strains.\n  New TB drug regimens are long overdue, and Congress must act to help \naccelerate the development, approval, and delivery of new TB medicines \naround the globe. We must bring our methods of prevention and treatment \ninto the 21st century so we can fight the new age of the TB epidemic.\n  Congress has made significant strides toward this goal. The enactment \nof the Lantos-Hyde Act and the Comprehensive TB Elimination Act \nreaffirmed our commitment to research, treatment, and prevention.\n  These laws put the U.S. on the path to successfully treating 4.5 \nmillion TB patients and 90,000 new multidrug resistant TB cases by \n2013. However, Congress and this administration must not underfund the \ncommitment we made with this legislation.\n  World Tuberculosis Day provides an opportunity to reflect on the \nprogress made to eradicate TB, acknowledge the\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nmillions of lives this disease takes as it orphans children and \ndestabilizes communities throughout the world, and recommit to fighting \nTB with the sense of urgency and level of resources this global public \nhealth battle requires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2016-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OBJECTION TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Judiciary Committee was scheduled \nto welcome two of President Obama's nominees to fill vacancies on the \nFederal bench in California: Professor Goodwin Liu, nominated to fill a \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit, and Magistrate Judge Kimberly Mueller, \nnominated to a judgeship in the Eastern District of California. \nHowever, we will not be able to hear from those nominees today because \nSenate Republicans have anonymously objected to the hearing. They have \ncontinued their ill-advised protest of meaningful health reform \nlegislation by exploiting parliamentary tactics and Senate Rules, to \nthe detriment of the American people and, in today's instance, at the \nexpense of American justice.\n  I have previously accommodated requests from Judiciary Committee \nRepublicans to delay the committee's hearing to consider Professor \nLiu's nomination. I had intended to hold this hearing 2 weeks ago but, \nat the request of Republicans, delayed it until today. We had agreed, \ninstead, to proceed to a hearing for Judge Robert Chatigny, a nominee \nto the Second Circuit court of appeals, on March 10. Republicans then \nreversed themselves and asked for additional delay in connection with \nthat March 10 hearing. I, again, accommodated them. Earlier this week I \nsought to move this afternoon's hearing to the morning, into the 2-hour \nwindow of time after the Senate convened, that would not be subject to \nthis arcane objection. Republicans asked that we keep it scheduled for \nthis afternoon because it worked better for the schedules of the \nRepublican members of the committee, and they had planned to \nparticipate this afternoon. Now, having objected to holding the hearing \nthis morning, they object to it not being held this afternoon. They \npulled the plug on our hearing and put up roadblocks to the committee's \nprocess for working to fill judicial vacancies.\n  It is particularly troubling that Republicans will not allow the \ncommittee to hear from Professor Goodwin Liu, a widely respected \nconstitutional law scholar who they targeted for criticism and \nopposition the moment he was nominated. The day Professor Liu was \nnominated, committee Republicans declared themselves ``disappointed'' \nby the President's nomination of Professor Liu and claimed that \nProfessor Liu was ``far outside the mainstream of American \njurisprudence.'' Their opposition was instantaneous and the drumbeat \nhas continued. Rather than give Professor Liu a chance to answer their \nquestions and respond to their attacks, Republicans have now prevented \nProfessor Liu from appearing, from answering their questions, and from \naddressing their concerns. They are being unfair. They are seeking to \nrender him mute by their obstruction while they continue their attacks.\n  Goodwin Liu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, has a great American \nstory and sterling credentials. He did not learn English until \nkindergarten, yet rose to graduate from Stanford University and Yale \nLaw School and become a Rhodes scholar. After law school, Professor Liu \nclerked for DC Circuit Judge David Tatel and Supreme Court Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg. He has a brilliant legal mind and is admired by legal \nthinkers and academic scholars from across the political spectrum. As \nconceded by a Fox News commentator, Professor Liu's qualifications for \nthe appellate bench are ``unassailable.''\n  Professor Liu would also bring much-needed diversity to the Federal \nbench. There are currently no active Asian-American Federal appeals \ncourt judges in the country. Judge Denny Chin of New York has been \nnominated to the Second Circuit, but Senate Republicans have stalled \nhis nomination for over 3 months, despite his unanimous approval by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  Senate Republicans have not given Professor Liu fair consideration. \nLike their practice of pocket-filibustering more than 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees in the 1990s, the decision by Republicans \nto block the hearing today gives Professor Liu no chance to respond to \nthe attacks that they began weeks ago.\n  Republicans' filibusters and stalling tactics have been evident since \nPresident Obama took office. Senate Republicans threatened to \nfilibuster President Obama's judicial nominations before the President \nhad made a single one. They insisted on filibustering the nomination of \nJudge David Hamilton of Indiana, a well-respected mainstream district \ncourt judge who had the support of Indiana Senator Dick Lugar, the \nsenior Republican in the Senate. They forced the Senate to invoke \ncloture, a time consuming process, by refusing for months to agree to \ndebate and vote on the nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan of Virginia \nto the Fourth Circuit. She was then confirmed by a vote of 99 to zero.\n  The Republicans tactics of obstruction have led to 22 judicial \nnominations stalled on the Senate's Executive Calendar and only 18 \ncircuit and district court nominations confirmed. That lack of progress \nstands in stark contrast to this date in 2002, when a Democratic Senate \nmajority had proceeded to confirm 42 of President Bush's judicial \nnominations. Republicans obstruct virtually every judicial nominee. \nEven though 15 of the 18 Federal circuit and district court judges \nconfirmed have been without opposition, they have delayed and stalled \nfor weeks and months as Republicans drag out the process and stall \nSenate consideration by withholding their consent.\n  During President Bush's first 2 years the Senate confirmed 100 of his \njudicial nominees. Republican obstruction has us on pace to confirm \nfewer than 30 Federal circuit and district court nominees before this \nCongress adjourns. Their approach has led to skyrocketing judicial \nvacancies, again, like the pocket filibusters they employed during the \nClinton Presidency that led to a vacancy crisis in the 1990s. They do a \ndisservice to the American people seeking justice in our overburdened \nFederal courts. We have to do far more to address the growing crisis of \nunfilled judicial vacancies, which now top 100. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to do better.\n  Sadly, actions like today's objections from Senate Republicans to the \nconsideration of two nominations to fill vacancies on overburdened \ncourts will be viewed as little more than what they are: petty, \npartisan politics with no regard for the priorities of the American \npeople. I urge them to reconsider and allow this hearing to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2016-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2016-S2017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUSTICE FOR JAMIE LEIGH JONES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, I was pleased to learn that a \nbrave young woman, Ms. Jamie Leigh Jones, will finally have her day in \ncourt. Ms. Jones testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nyear about how the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal \nArbitration Act has hampered American employees from having their civil \nrights protected. Ms. Jones was a compelling witness; her case deserves \nthe attention of every Senator.\n  When she was just 20 years old and was working overseas for the \nmilitary contractor, KBR, Ms. Jones was sexually assaulted by her \ncoworkers. She filed suit in Federal court alleging sexual harassment, \nhostile work environment claims under title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, and several state law tort claims including assault and \nbattery. Both KBR and its former parent company, Halliburton, argued \nthat her claims were subject to forced arbitration under a clause that \nMs. Jones was required to sign as a condition of her employment. The \ndistrict court agreed with the company in part. It dismissed her \nFederal civil rights claims because it found that they were subject to \nforced arbitration under her contract. But the court held that Ms. \nJones could proceed to trial on some of her tort claims, albeit only \nafter her civil rights claims had been decided in arbitration. \nHalliburton and KBR appealed to the Fifth Circuit court of appeals, \narguing that under her employment contract and the Federal Arbitration \nAct, all of Ms. Jones's claims were subject to forced arbitration, \nincluding her assault and battery claims arising out of her alleged \nrape. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision, and \nonce again the companies appealed.\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\n  In the interim, Congress enacted an amendment to the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act of 2010, Public Law 111-118. That amendment \nwas sponsored by Senator Franken and supported by Senators from both \nparties. It prohibited the U.S. Government from entering into contracts \nwith and paying Federal tax dollars to corporations who force their \nemployees to arbitrate their civil rights or tort claims related to \nsexual assault and harassment or take any action to enforce such forced \narbitration clauses. I am pleased that the companies cited this law, \nwhich I was happy to support, as a reason for dropping their appeal.\n  As we examined in our October hearing, however, millions of hard \nworking Americans like Ms. Jones are being denied their civil and \nconstitutional rights and being forced into arbitration merely by \naccepting a job offer that contains an arbitration clause as a \ncondition of employment. There is no rule of law in arbitration. There \nare no juries or independent judges in the arbitration industry. There \nis no transparency or accountability. And unfortunately, there is often \nno justice.\n  After more than 5 years of hard won challenges, Ms. Jones will \nfinally be able to seek justice in a courtroom. But this small victory \nshould not have been such a struggle. I will continue to work to ensure \nthat Americans have a meaningful choice about whether or not to enter a \npredispute arbitration agreement--no American should be forced to \nforfeit their access to the courts in order to get a job or a product \nor a service. Arbitration clauses like the one in Ms. Jones's contract \nstrip Americans of the civil rights protections many of us in Congress \nhave fought for so long to enshrine in our law.\n  Legislation such as Senator Feingold's Arbitration Fairness Act, S. \n931, which would make mandatory predispute arbitration clauses in \nemployment, consumer, franchise, or civil rights disputes \nunenforceable, would correct these practices and restore fairness to \nthe marketplace for jobs and other goods and services. Jamie Leigh \nJones's struggle also highlights the importance of the Civilian \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2010, S. 2979, which I recently \nintroduced. My legislation would fix outdated criminal laws by \nestablishing that all U.S. government employees and contractors who \ncommit crimes while working abroad can be charged and tried in the \nUnited States under American law. We must continue to protect victims \nlike Ms. Jones and others who have their civil rights violated. I look \nforward to the day when justice is the norm, rather than the exception, \nin all cases like this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2017-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY HEIGHT\n\n Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, today I celebrate the 98th birthday \nof a true civil rights pioneer and social activist: Dorothy Height.\n  She began her career in the 1930s, as a teacher in Brooklyn, NY. \nShortly after it was founded, she became active in the United Christian \nYouth Movement.\n  It was this cause that would first carry her to national leadership, \nthough she was quite a young woman at the time.\n  In 1938, Dorothy was selected by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to help \nplan a World Youth Conference, and later served as a delegate to the \nWorld Conference on Life and Work of the Churches.\n  The same year, she was hired by the YWCA, and quickly began to rise \nthrough the ranks of the national organization.\n  And it was also around this time that she caught the attention of \nMary McLeod Bethune, founder and president of the National Council of \nNegro Women, or NCNW, who recruited young Dorothy to join the fight for \nwomen's rights.\n  She remained deeply involved in the YWCA, and also attained high \nleadership positions in the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the United \nCivil Rights Leadership, and a number of other organizations.\n  She helped to guide these pivotal groups through the stormy waters of \nthe civil rights movement, looking always to the future, and \nmaintaining a steadfast dedication to cause and principle.\n  But it was Dorothy's distinguished leadership of the NCNW that would \ncome to define her career.\n  In 1957, Dorothy Height was elected fourth national president of \nNCNW--a position she would hold continuously until 1998.\n  For more than four decades, she was at the helm of the preeminent \nleadership council for African-American women.\n  Thanks to her unrivaled expertise, transcendent vision, and lifelong \ndedication to this cause and this great organization, when she retired \nin 1998, she lived in a country that was far more free, more fair, and \nmore equal than the one she knew as a child.\n  For her extraordinary work, in 2004 this Congress bestowed upon her \nits highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal. President \nBush presented her with this award on her 92nd birthday.\n  And so today, as Dorothy turns 98, I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in honoring the immeasurable contributions she has made to this \ncountry. I ask them to reflect upon the leadership she has rendered, \nthe causes she has championed, and the countless lives she has touched.\n  Without Dorothy Height, America might be a very different place. I \nthank her immensely for the difference she has made, and for the \nlifetime of hard work she has devoted to her fellow citizens.\n  I wish her a wonderful birthday and many happy returns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2017-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2017-S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CEDAR FALLS HISTORIC RECOGNITION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we \nface not just in Iowa but all across America is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our small towns. This is about economics, but \nit is also about our culture and identity. After all, you won't find \nthe heart and soul of Iowa at Wal-Mart or Home Depot out in the strip \nmalls. No, the heart and soul of Iowa is in our family farms and on \nMain Streets in small communities all across my State. That is why we \nneed to be as generous as possible--and as creative as possible--in \nkeeping our downtowns not just alive but thriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram, which provides challenge grants to revitalize downtown \nbuildings across my State, is in a class by itself. It is smart. It is \neffective. And it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the citizens of Cedar Falls, IA, and their Main Street \nprogram are making efforts to improve their downtown and spur \ninvestment in the area. The Blackhawk Hotel received a Main Street \nChallenge Grant in 2003 to renovate its historic downtown location. The \nBlackhawk Hotel, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, is \nthe oldest continuously operating hotel site in Iowa. More recently, \nanother Challenge Grant was awarded for the Bruhn Building to help \ncomplete a forward-thinking project that will transform the designated \narea into a gathering space, entrance, outdoor dining room, and \nvertical garden on Main Street.\n  Thanks to these and other projects undertaken by the Cedar Falls \ncommunity and business leaders, the city was recognized last month by \nthe National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of its ``2010 Dozen \nDistinctive Designations.'' According to the National Trust, this \ndistinction recognizes ``cities and towns that offer an authentic \nvisitor experience by combining dynamic downtowns, cultural diversity, \nattractive architecture, cultural landscapes and a strong commitment to \nhistoric preservation, sustainability and revitalization.'' I would \nlike to commend the excellent work of all those involved in these \neconomic development efforts in Cedar Falls.\n  State and Federal programs can provide limited funding and technical \nassistance to progressive cities like Cedar Falls. But, as we have seen \nhere,\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nsuccess ultimately comes from local leadership, local teamwork, and \nhomegrown ideas and solutions. When people see one of the anchors of \nMain Street being renovated or expanded, this can change the whole \npsychology of a town or community. It offers hope. It serves as a \ncatalyst for a far-reaching ripple effect of positive changes. Cedar \nFalls is a shining example of the great things that are possible. So I \nam pleased to congratulate the Main Street program and the citizens of \nCedar Falls for formulating a strategy that has reinvigorated its \ndowntown and won accolades from an esteemed national organization like \nthe National Trust. Their vision for a revitalized Cedar Falls is \nsetting a terrific example for other small towns across \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2018-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE KIRKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Under the \ndirection of orchestral program director Patrick Jackson, these young \nmusicians are locally renowned and have earned national acclaim for \ntheir work. Particularly noteworthy was their performance at the 2008 \nHeritage Music Festival in New York City. That performance, which \nreceived perfect marks from the judging panel, was so stirring that \nmore than one judge was moved to tears. It is a fitting advance in the \nstoried history the students of the Kirkwood High School Symphonic \nOrchestra are writing that they would be invited to play in the world-\nfamous Carnegie Hall.\n  As you can imagine, becoming a member of this elite ensemble is not \neasy. Members of the Kirkwood High School Symphonic Orchestral Program \nmake a 9-year commitment that begins in 4th grade and continues through \nthe students' senior year in high school. Mr. Jackson has directed the \nsymphonic orchestra for two decades. During that time, participation \nhas grown from 19 students to more than 300. As a testament to Mr. \nJackson's commitment to his students, he has been honored by former \nstudents in Who's Who Among American High School High School Teachers \n17 times.\n  Moreover, the resounding support for the symphonic orchestra from the \ncommunities of Kirkwood and Saint Louis has been inspiring. In order to \nmake the trip, the students reached their fundraising goal of $72,000 \nwith the help of local radio, TV stations, and newspapers promoting \ntheir yearlong ``Road to Carnegie Hall.'' Inspired by these young \nmusicians, members of our own Saint Louis Orchestra were moved to \nvolunteer their time and expertise with the students in advance of \ntheir performance.\n  Mr. President, I understand how difficult being a kid in this day and \nage can be. All too often, we read and hear negative stories about \nAmerica's children that seem to suggest a generation in crisis. These \nKirkwood students make it clear that this is not so. I am proud to \nshine a light on this group of young people who strive for greatness \nand embrace the fact that the greatest heights can be achieved through \nhard work and discipline.\n  On behalf of myself and the people of Missouri, I congratulate the \nKirkwood High School Symphonic Orchestra and wish them the best of luck \nduring their time at Carnegie Hall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2018-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2018-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2018-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:39 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3976.

A bill to amend Public Law 10-377 to revise the boundaries \nof the Gettysburg National Military Park to include the Gettysburg \nTrain Station, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to incorporate two historically significant properties into \nthe boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park. This expansion \neffort is consistent with Gettysburg National Military Park's 1999 \nGeneral Management Plan, the goals of the National Park Service and is \nsupported by the Gettysburg Borough Council.\n  The bill I have introduced will expand the boundary of the park to \ninclude the Gettysburg Railroad Station, also known as the Lincoln \nTrain Station, located in downtown Gettysburg, PA. This train station \nwas built in 1858 and is listed in the National Register of Historic \nPlaces. The station served as a hospital during the Battle of \nGettysburg and was the departure point for thousands of soldiers who \nwere wounded or killed in battle. The Lincoln Train Station is perhaps \nmost historically significant as the site at which President Abraham \nLincoln arrived on November 18, 1863, 1 day before he delivered the \nGettysburg Address.\n  Currently, the station is operated by the National Trust for Historic \nGettysburg and is open to the public throughout the year. Additionally, \nthe station\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nserved as the home of the Pennsylvania Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial \nCommission, which promoted events to commemorate the 200th anniversary \nyear of Lincoln's birth in 2009. I am informed that the borough of \nGettysburg had planned for the Lincoln Train Station to be used as an \ninformation and orientation center for visitors. Toward that goal, the \nborough in 2006 completed a rehabilitation of the station funded \nthought a State grant but has been unable to operate the visitor center \ndue to a lack of funds. Accordingly, I understand that the Gettysburg \nBorough Council voted in 2008 to transfer the station to the National \nPark Service.\n  The legislation I introduced also expands the boundary of Gettysburg \nNational Military Park to include 45 acres of land at the southern end \nof Gettysburg battlefield. I am informed by National Park officials \nthat there were cavalry skirmishes in this area during the Battle of \nGettysburg in July of 1863. Moreover, I am advised that this property \nis environmentally significant as the home to wetlands and wildlife \nhabitat related to the Plum Run stream that traverses the park. This \n45-acre property is adjacent to current park land and was generously \ndonated in April of 2009. Therefore, no federal land acquisition \nfunding will be necessary to obtain this property.\n  This legislation will help preserve properties and land that are \nhistorically and environmentally significant and critically important \nto telling the story of the Battle of Gettysburg. The Civil War was a \ndefining moment for our Nation and we ought to take steps necessary to \npreserve historical assets for the benefit of current and future \ngenerations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3160. A bill to provide information, resources, recommendations, \nand funding to help State and local law enforcement enact crime \nprevention and intervention strategies supported by rigorous evidence; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nPRECAUTION Act--the Prevention Resources for Eliminating Criminal \nActivity Using Tailored Interventions in Our Neighborhoods Act. It is a \nlong name, but it stands for an important principle--that it is better \nto invest in precautionary measures now than it is to pay the costs of \ncrime--both in dollars and lives--later on. I am pleased that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, will again join me as an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The Federal Government has three important roles to play in fighting \ncrime. First, the Federal Government should develop and disseminate \nknowledge to state and local officials regarding the newest and most \neffective law enforcement techniques and strategies. Second, the \nFederal Government should provide financial support for innovations \nthat our State and local partners cannot afford to fund on their own. \nWith that funding, it should also provide guidance, training, and \ntechnical assistance to implement those innovations. Third, the Federal \nGovernment can help to create and maintain effective partnerships among \nagencies at all levels of government, partnerships that are crafted to \naddress specific law enforcement challenges.\n  The PRECAUTION Act is designed to support all three of these \nimportant roles. It creates a national commission to wade through the \nsea of information on crime prevention and intervention strategies \ncurrently available to identify those programs that are most ready for \nreplication around the country. Over-taxed law enforcement officials \nneed a simple, accessible resource to turn to that recommends a few, \ntop-tier crime prevention and intervention programs. They need a \nresource that will single out those existing programs that are truly \n``evidence-based'' programs that are proven by scientifically reliable \nevidence to be effective. The commission created by the PRECAUTION Act \nwill provide just such a report--written in plain language and focused \non pragmatic implementation issues--approximately a year and a half \nafter the bill is enacted.\n  In the course of holding hearings and writing this first report, the \ncommission will also identify some types of prevention and intervention \nstrategies that are promising but need further research and development \nbefore they are ready for further implementation. The National \nInstitute of Justice then will administer a grant program that will \nfund pilot projects in these identified areas. The commission will \nfollow closely the progress of these pilot projects, and at the end of \nthe three-year grant program, it will publish a second report, \nproviding a detailed discussion of each pilot project and its \neffectiveness. This second report will include detailed implementation \ninformation and will discuss both the successes and failures of the \nprojects funded by the grants.\n  There is particular urgency for this bill as State and Federal budget \nshortfalls continue and State and local law enforcement are forced to \ndo more with fewer resources. There is no doubt that money is tight, \nwhich makes it all the more important that innovative and cost-\neffective law enforcement strategies that benefit both public safety \nand the government bottom line are being used in our communities. To \nhelp accomplish this, the Federal Government must work in concert with \nState and local law enforcement, with the non-profit criminal justice \ncommunity, and with other branches of State and Federal Government. \nWhile we have an obligation to provide leadership and support, we do \nnot have the right to unilaterally take control from the State and \nlocal officials on the ground. With these partnerships in place we can \ninvest our resources in crime-fighting measures, confident that they \nwill work. Sometimes, small and careful advances are the ones that \nyield the most benefit.\n  The PRECAUTION Act answers a call by police chiefs and mayors from \nmore than 50 cities around the country during a national conference \nhosted by the Police Executive Research Forum in 2006. According to a \nreport on the event from the Forum, these law enforcement leaders \nagreed that while there is a desperate need for the law enforcement \ncommunity to focus on violent crime, ``other municipal agencies and \nsocial services organizations--including schools, mental health, public \nhealth, courts, corrections, and conflict management groups--need to be \nbrought together to partner toward the common goal of reducing violent \ncrime.'' In the hearings held by the PRECAUTION Act commission, these \nvoices will all be heard. In the reports filed by the commission, these \nperspectives will be acknowledged. In the pilot projects administered \nby the National Institute of Justice, these partnerships will be \ndeveloped and fostered.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee highlighted the need for cost saving \nmeasures when it held a hearing entitled ``Encouraging Innovative and \nCost-Effective Crime Reduction Strategies.'' Chief of Police Michael \nSchirling of Burlington, Vermont, in response to a question I asked him \nin conjunction with the hearing, said of the PRECAUTION Act that it \nwould be:\n\n       [A] useful tool for law enforcement that could, if properly \n     implemented, result in long-term cost savings not only for \n     law enforcement, but also for communities as a whole. The \n     manner in which creative initiatives would be studied to \n     validate their effectiveness and then added to a resource \n     library of new ideas seems like a prudent approach to \n     spreading important concepts and ideas to improve the \n     criminal justice system in a meaningful way.\n\n  The PRECAUTION Act, though very modest in scope, is an important \nsupplement to the essential financial support the Federal Government \nprovides to our State and local law enforcement partners through \nprograms such as the Byrne Justice Assistance grants and the COPS \ngrants. When State and local law enforcement receive Federal support \nfor policing, they have difficult decisions to make on how to spend \nthose Federal dollars. We all know that prevention and intervention are \nintegral components of any comprehensive law enforcement plan. The \nPRECAUTION Act not only highlights the importance of these components, \nbut will also help to single out some of the best, most effective forms \nof prevention and intervention programs. At the same time, it will help \nto develop additional, cutting-edge strategies that are supported by \nsolid scientific evidence of their effectiveness.\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish penalties for servicers that fail to \ntimely evaluate the applications of homeowners under home loan \nmodification programs; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mortgage \nModification Reform Act, which is designed to protect homeowners and \ncommunities from big banks who fail to modify mortgages in a timely \nfashion.\n  In the past year I have heard from hundreds of families in New \nHampshire who have fallen behind on their mortgages. Often, they tell \nme that they can no longer afford their payments because of \ncircumstances beyond their control. A family member has been laid off \nor had her hours reduced. Medical bills have started piling up. Higher \ninterest payments kicked in at just the wrong time. And since value of \nthe average home has declined over 15 percent in New Hampshire, they \nnow owe more on their home than it's worth.\n  But these families want to make it work, so they reach out to their \nbank or ``mortgage servicer'' to figure out a way to make payments they \ncan afford. Often, when a homeowner comes to a servicer, they can work \ntogether to bring the homeowner's payments down to an affordable level. \nWhen a servicer modifies a mortgage, everybody wins: the homeowner can \nstay in their home; the servicer avoids the costly foreclosure process; \nand communities are spared from the devastating effects that \nforeclosures have on home values and communities.\n  That is why these families in New Hampshire and others across the \ncountry breathed a sigh of relief when they heard that a new program, \ncalled the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, would provide \npowerful incentives to servicers to work with borrowers to keep them in \ntheir homes.\n  We were told that HAMP would help 3-4 million homeowners stay in \ntheir homes by reducing the amount a family owes each month to 31 \npercent of its monthly income. The big, national servicer banks who \nsigned up for the program would avoid the foreclosure process and \nreceive incentive payments. Most importantly, communities would have \nbenefitted by stemming the tide of foreclosures, which have so \ndrastically lowered home values and the equity of millions of \nhomeowners.\n  But a year into the program, it is clear that many of these big banks \nare unwilling or uninterested in helping people in our communities. The \nbanks routinely lose documents and ask the borrower to send them in \nagain, delaying the process for months at a time. They don't respond to \ncalls and voice messages that are only returned weeks or months later--\nif they are returned at all. And as homeowners wait for a decision, the \nbanks charge them late fees, which puts them even further behind. When \nhomeowners finally receive modification offers, they often come at the \nlast minute--just days before the borrower's home is set to be \nauctioned.\n  As a result of these abuses, instead of helping the millions of \nhomeowners that they promised would be able to stay in their homes, \nservicers have offered trial modifications to less than 30 percent of \neligible homeowners. The banks participating in HAMP have only provided \npermanent relief to only 116,000 homeowners.\n  We know that the servicers are capable of success in this program \nbecause some servicers have been better than others. According to the \nlatest Servicer Performance Report from the Treasury, some servicers \nhave helped as little as 2 percent of their eligible\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nborrowers, while others have helped over 50 percent. And it's not \nsurprising that some of the servicers with the worst numbers are the \nsame big banks that were happy to be bailed out by TARP not too long \nago.\n  It is time to tell these big banks that enough's enough. We need \nprotections for homeowners, and we need to penalize the servicers who \nhave failed to offer the help they promised.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation today, the Mortgage \nModification Reform Act, to stop the big banks from abusing homeowners \nand to start penalizing those who do not live up to their promise to \nprovide homeowners with the relief they need.\n  The Mortgage Modification Reform Act would charge banks ``late fees'' \nfor every month that they fail to evaluate a homeowner for this \nprogram. After 3 months, if a homeowner has not received an answer on \nwhether their mortgage will be modified, the banks' payments will be \nreduced 10 percent for each month that it fails to evaluate the \nhomeowner. By reducing payments to the banks over time, the bank will \nbe encouraged to evaluate these borrowers earlier and more frequently. \nThis also protects the taxpayer by only rewarding those banks that \nrespond quickly and punishing those that fail to act. Banks will have \nto perform to get paid, and if they don't, their compensation will stay \nwith to the taxpayer.\n  This legislation would also require banks to stop the foreclosure \nprocess until it determines whether a borrower qualifies. This would \nalso give much-needed peace of mind to homeowners who aren't sure which \nwill come first: the modification they need, or the sale of their home.\n  In addition, the legislation would prevent banks from imposing fees \nwhile they wait for a decision. There is no reason that a bank should \ncharge a homeowner for being delinquent while waiting for evaluation in \nthe program. There is no reason for a homeowner to pay fees for an \nunnecessary foreclosure process. This legislation would put an end to \nthese abusive practices.\n  Finally, the Mortgage Modification Reform Act provides a protection \nfor borrowers that has been missing from day one of this program: a way \nfor homeowners to request a review of the bank's decision. Right now, \nthe banks make all the decisions whether a homeowner qualifies for the \nprogram or not. There is no way for the homeowner to appeal that \ndecision. But we know that those decisions aren't always right. Many \nhomeowners were originally told that they didn't qualify, but ask their \nSenator or get legal assistance to ask the servicer to take another \nlook. Often, they did qualify for the program, but the servicer did not \nevaluate the borrower properly.\n  But not every homeowner should have to involve their Senator or a \nlawyer to get their bank to respond. They should be able to make their \ncase on their own to an independent arbiter. This legislation requires \nthe Treasury Department to create a separate, independent review \nprocess to allow homeowners who feel they have been wrongly denied the \nchance to stay in their home. In addition, to ensure transparency, this \nlegislation would require the servicer to submit documentation to the \nTreasury for each denial that it makes.\n  Making this program work isn't just important for these homeowners, \nit's also critical to our economic recovery. With million homeowners \nacross the nation behind on their mortgages and at risk of foreclosure, \nwe need this program achieve its potential of stopping millions of \nhomes from flooding the housing market and further depressing home \nvalues.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me to prevent banks from continuing to \nabuse this program, and to get it on track to provide help to the \nmillions of homeowners who need it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify the health care provided by the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs that constitutes minimum essential coverage; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, concerns have been raised to me about a technical \nerror in the health care reform bill that was recently passed, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590. In drafting the \nPPACA, a provision was included which designates health care provided \nunder VA's authority as meeting the minimum required health care \ncoverage that an individual is required to maintain.\n  However, due to the way this exemption was worded, this definition \nmay exclude children with spina bifida, who are seriously disabled and \nto whom VA provides reimbursement for comprehensive health care. The \nunderlying bill gave authority to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to designate other care, which could include the VA spina \nbifida program, as meeting the definition of minimum essential \ncoverage. This bill would simply clarify what was originally intended.\n  Chapter 18 of title 38 contains the Spina Bifida Health Care Program, \nwhich is a health benefit program administered by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs for Vietnam War and certain Korean War Veterans' birth \nchildren who have been diagnosed with spina bifida, except spina bifida \nocculta. The program provides reimbursement for medical services and \nsupplies.\n  The legislation I introduce today corrects this small error. \nAdditionally, this legislation would clarify that recipients of CHAMPVA \nwould also be considered as meeting the requirement for minimum \nessential coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDED BY THE \n                   SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THAT CONSTITUTES \n                   MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Clause (v) of section 5000A(f)(1)(A) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section \n     1501(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(v) chapter 17 or 18 of title 38, United States Code, or \n     otherwise under the laws administered by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, of an individual entitled to coverage under \n     such chapter or laws for essential health benefits (as \n     defined by the Secretary for purposes of section 1302(b) of \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) insofar as \n     such benefits are available under such chapter or laws; or''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in section 1501(b) of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and shall be \n     executed immediately after the amendments made by such \n     section 1501(b).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/24/senate-section/article/S2026-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2026-S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 468--HONORING THE BLACKSTONE VALLEY TOURISM COUNCIL \n               ON THE CELEBRATION OF ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. Reed) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

OPEN FUEL STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Open \n     Fuel Standard Act of 2009'' or the ``OFS Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The status of oil as a strategic commodity, which \n     derives from its domination of the transportation sector, \n     presents a clear and present danger to the United States;\n       (2) in a prior era, when salt was a strategic commodity, \n     salt mines conferred national power and wars were fought over \n     the control of such mines;\n       (3) technology, in the form of electricity and \n     refrigeration, decisively ended salt's monopoly of meat \n     preservation and greatly reduced its strategic importance;\n       (4) fuel competition and consumer choice would similarly \n     serve to end oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and \n     strip oil of its strategic status;\n       (5) the current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of \n     petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices, \n     effectively imposing a harmful tax on the economy of the \n     United States;\n       (6) much of the inflated petroleum revenues the oil cartel \n     earns at the expense of the people of the United States are \n     used for purposes antithetical to the interests of the United \n     States and its allies;\n       (7) alcohol fuels, including ethanol and methanol, could \n     potentially provide significant supplies of additional fuels \n     that could be produced in the United States and in many other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere that are friendly to the \n     United States;\n       (8) alcohol fuels can only play a major role in securing \n     the energy independence of the United States if a substantial \n     portion of vehicles in the United States are capable of \n     operating on such fuels;\n       (9) it is not in the best interest of United States \n     consumers or the United States Government to be constrained \n     to depend solely upon petroleum resources for vehicle fuels \n     if alcohol fuels are potentially available;\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\n       (10) existing technology, in the form of flexible fuel \n     vehicles, allows internal combustion engine cars and trucks \n     to be produced at little or no additional cost, which are \n     capable of operating on conventional gasoline, alcohol fuels, \n     or any combination of such fuels, as availability or cost \n     advantage dictates, providing a platform on which fuels can \n     compete;\n       (11) the necessary distribution system for such alcohol \n     fuels will not be developed in the United States until a \n     substantial fraction of the vehicles in the United States are \n     capable of operating on such fuels;\n       (12) the establishment of such a vehicle fleet and \n     distribution system would provide a large market that would \n     mobilize private resources to substantially advance the \n     technology and expand the production of alcohol fuels in the \n     United States and abroad;\n       (13) the United States has an urgent national security \n     interest to develop alcohol fuels technology, production, and \n     distribution systems as rapidly as possible;\n       (14) new cars sold in the United States that are equipped \n     with an internal combustion engine should allow for fuel \n     competition by being flexible fuel vehicles, and new diesel \n     cars should be capable of operating on biodiesel; and\n       (15) such an open fuel standard would help to protect the \n     United States economy from high and volatile oil prices and \n     from the threats caused by global instability, terrorism, and \n     natural disaster.\n       (c) Open Fuel Standard for Transportation.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 32920.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) give all Americans immediate relief from the \n     outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals;\n       (2) reverse the perverse economics of the American \n     pharmaceutical market;\n       (3) allow the importation of prescription drugs only if the \n     drugs and facilities where such drugs are manufactured are \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and to exclude \n     pharmaceutical narcotics; and\n       (4) ensure continued integrity to the prescription drug \n     supply of the United States by--\n       (A) requiring that imported prescription drugs be packaged \n     and shipped using counterfeit-resistant technologies;\n       (B) requiring Internet pharmacies to register with the \n     United States Government for Americans to verify authenticity \n     before purchases over the Internet;\n       (C) requiring all foreign sellers to register with United \n     States Government and submit to facility inspections by the \n     Government without prior notice; and\n       (D) limiting the eligible countries from which prescription \n     drugs may be imported to Canada, member countries of the \n     European Union, and other highly industrialized nations with \n     safe pharmaceutical infrastructures.\n\n     SEC. 3004.

HEALTH CARE FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Health Care Fraud Prevention System.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     establish a fraud prevention system which shall be designed \n     as follows:\n       (A) In general.--The fraud prevention system shall--\n       (i) be holistic;\n       (ii) be able to view all provider and patient activities \n     across all Federal health program payers;\n       (iii) be able to integrate into the existing health care \n     claims flow with minimal effort, time, and cost;\n       (iv) be modeled after systems used in the Financial \n     Services industry; and\n       (v) utilize integrated real-time transaction risk scoring \n     and referral strategy capabilities to identify claims that \n     are statistically unusual.\n       (B) Modularized architecture.--The fraud prevention system \n     shall be designed from an end-to-end modularized perspective \n     to allow for ease of integration into multiple points along a \n     health care claim flow (pre- or post-adjudication), which \n     shall--\n       (i) utilize a single entity to host, support, manage, and \n     maintain software-based services, predictive models, and \n     solutions from a central location for the customers who \n     access the fraud prevention system;\n       (ii) allow access through a secure private data connection \n     rather than the installation of software in multiple \n     information technology infrastructures (and data facilities);\n       (iii) provide access to the best and latest software \n     without the need for upgrades, data security, and costly \n     installations;\n       (iv) permit modifications to the software and system edits \n     in a rapid and timely manner;\n       (v) ensure that all technology and decision components \n     reside within the module; and\n       (vi) ensure that the third party host of the modular \n     solution is not a party, payer, or stakeholder that reports \n     claims data, accesses the results of the fraud prevention \n     systems analysis, or is otherwise required under this section \n     to verify, research, or investigate the risk of claims.\n       (C) Processing, scoring, and storage.--The platform of the \n     fraud prevention system shall be a high volume, rapid, real-\n     time information technology solution, which includes data \n     pooling, data storage, and scoring capabilities to quickly \n     and accurately capture and evaluate data from millions of \n     claims per day. Such platform shall be secure and have (at a \n     minimum) data centers that comply with Federal and State \n     privacy laws.\n       (D) Data consortium.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     provide for the establishment of a centralized data file \n     (referred to as a ``consortium'') that accumulates data from \n     all government health insurance claims data sources. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal health \n     care payers shall provide to the consortium existing claims \n     data, such as Medicare's ``Common Working File'' and Medicaid \n     claims data, for the purpose of fraud and abuse prevention. \n     Such accumulated data shall be transmitted and stored in an \n     industry standard secure data environment that complies with \n     applicable Federal privacy laws for use in building medical \n     waste, fraud, and abuse prevention predictive models that \n     have a comprehensive view of provider activity across all \n     payers (and markets).\n       (E) Market view.--The fraud prevention system shall ensure \n     that claims data from Federal health programs and all markets \n     flows through a central source so the waste, fraud, and abuse \n     system can look across all markets and geographies in health \n     care to identify fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, the \n     State Children's Health Program, TRICARE, and the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs, holistically. Such cross-market \n     visibility shall identify unusual provider and patient \n     behavior patterns and fraud and abuse schemes that may not be \n     identified by looking independently at one Federal payer's \n     transactions.\n       (F) Behavior engine.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     ensure that the technology used provides real-time ability to \n     identify high-risk behavior patterns across markets, \n     geographies, and specialty group providers to detect waste, \n     fraud, and abuse, and to identify providers that exhibit \n     unusual behavior patterns. Behavior pattern technology that \n     provides the capability to compare a provider's current \n     behavior to their own past behavior and to compare a \n     provider's current behavior to that of other providers in the \n     same specialty group and geographic location shall be used in \n     order to provide a comprehensive waste, fraud, and abuse \n     prevention solution.\n       (G) Predictive model.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     involve the implementation of a statistically sound, \n     empirically derived predictive modeling technology that is \n     designed to prevent (versus post-payment detect) waste, \n     fraud, and abuse. Such prevention system shall utilize \n     historical transaction data, from across all Federal health \n     programs and markets, to build and re-develop scoring models, \n     have the capability to incorporate external data and external \n     models from other sources into the health care predictive \n     waste, fraud, and abuse model, and provide for a feedback \n     loop to provide outcome information on verified claims so \n     future system enhancements can be developed based on previous \n     claims experience.\n       (H) Change control.--The fraud prevention system platform \n     shall have the infrastructure to implement new models and \n     attributes in a test environment prior to moving into a \n     production environment. Capabilities shall be developed to \n     quickly make changes to models, attributes, or strategies to \n     react to changing patterns in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (I) Scoring engine.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     identify high-risk claims by scoring all such claims on a \n     real-time capacity prior to payment. Such scores shall then \n     be communicated to the fraud management system provided for \n     under subparagraph (J).\n       (J) Fraud management system.--The fraud prevention system \n     shall utilize a fraud management system, that contains \n     workflow management and workstation tools to provide the \n     ability to systematically present scores, reason codes, and \n     treatment actions for high-risk scored transactions. The \n     fraud prevention system shall ensure that analysts who review \n     claims have the capability to access, review, and research \n     claims efficiently, as well as decline or approve claims \n     (payments) in an automated manner. Workflow management under \n     this subparagraph shall be combined with the ability to \n     utilize principles of experimental design to compare and \n     measure prevention and detection rates between test and \n     control strategies. Such strategy testing shall allow for \n     continuous improvement and maximum effectiveness in keeping \n     up with ever changing fraud and abuse patterns. Such system \n     shall provide the capability to test different treatments or \n     actions randomly (typically through use of random digit \n     assignments).\n       (K) Decision technology.--The fraud prevention system shall \n     have the capability to monitor consumer transactions in real-\n     time and monitor provider behavior at different stages within \n     the transaction flow based upon provider, transaction and \n     consumer trends. The fraud prevention system shall provide \n     for the identification of provider and claims excessive usage \n     patterns and trends that differ from similar peer groups, \n     have the capability to trigger on multiple criteria, such as \n     predictive model scores or custom attributes, and be able to \n     segment transaction waste, fraud, and abuse into multiple \n     types for health care categories and business types.\n       (L) Feedback loop.--The fraud prevention system shall have \n     a feedback loop where all Federal health payers provide pre-\n     payment and post-payment information about the eventual \n     status of a claim designated as ``Normal'', ``Waste'', \n     ``Fraud'', ``Abuse'', or ``Education Required''. Such \n     feedback loop shall enable Federal health agencies to measure \n     the actual amount of waste, fraud, and abuse as well as the \n     savings in the system and provide the ability to retrain \n     future, enhanced models. Such feedback loop shall be an \n     industry file that contains information on previous fraud and \n     abuse claims as well as abuse perpetrated by consumers, \n     providers, and fraud rings, to be used to alert other payers, \n     as well as for subsequent fraud and abuse solution \n     development.\n       (M) Tracking and reporting.--The fraud prevention system \n     shall ensure that the infrastructure exists to ascertain \n     system, strategy, and predictive model return on investment. \n     Dynamic model validation and strategy validation analysis and \n     reporting shall be made available to ensure a strategy or \n     predictive model has not degraded over time or is no longer \n     effective. Queue reporting shall be established and made \n     available for population estimates of what claims were \n     flagged, what claims received treatment, and ultimately what \n     results occurred. The capability shall exist to complete \n     tracking and reporting for prevention strategies and actions \n     residing farther upstream in the health care payment flow. \n     The fraud prevention system shall establish a reliable metric \n     to measure the dollars that are never paid due to \n     identification of fraud and abuse, as well\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n     as a capability to effectively test and estimate the impact \n     from different actions and treatments utilized to detect and \n     prevent fraud and abuse for legitimate claims. Measuring \n     results shall include waste and abuse.\n       (N) Operating tenet.--The fraud prevention system shall not \n     be designed to deny health care services or to negatively \n     impact prompt-pay laws because assessments are late.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times more to fill their \n     prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n       (2) the United States is the largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n     highest prices for brand pharmaceuticals in the world;\n       (3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an \n     individual who cannot afford it;\n       (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n     prescription drugs to ensure access to safe and affordable \n     drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration will \n     provide a level of safety to American consumers that they do \n     not currently enjoy;\n       (5) American spend more than $200,000,000,000 on \n     prescription drugs every year;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office has found that the cost \n     of prescription drugs are between 35 to 55 percent less in \n     other highly-developed countries than in the United States; \n     and\n       (7) promoting competitive market pricing would both \n     contribute to health care savings and allow greater access to \n     therapy, improving health and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 3003.
