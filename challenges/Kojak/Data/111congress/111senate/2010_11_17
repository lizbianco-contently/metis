Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the challenges \nAmerica faces in our relationship with Russia and their implications on \nthe Senate's consideration of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, \nknown as START.\n  A number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have spoken \nabout the treaty's impact on global nuclear nonproliferation. I would \nlike to use my remarks today to highlight my concerns about the treaty \nin the broader context of: one, the Obama administration's ``Reset \nPolicy'' towards Russia; and two, the new START treaty's impact on our \nallies in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. I believe these \nconcerns must be addressed by the administration before I can determine \nmy support for the treaty.\n  Over the last decade I have been an ardent champion of NATO and have \nworked diligently to increase membership in the alliance. I have also \nbeen active in improving our public diplomacy in Eastern Europe through \nour expansion of the Visa Waiver Program at the request of our friends \nand allies in Central and Eastern Europe. That legislation which the \nPresident signed on Visa Waiver was supported by both our State \nDepartment and by our Department of Homeland Security.\n  In my remaining time in the Senate, I will continue to work to \nstrengthen the Visa Waiver Program which has improved our image in the \nworld and strengthened our borders through shared best practices and \nenhanced intelligence sharing with our partners and allies abroad.\n  My passion for foreign relations stems in large part from my \nupbringing as the grandson of Southeast European immigrants. As an \nundergraduate at Ohio University, my first research paper examined how \nthe United States sold out Central and Eastern Europe and the former \nYugoslavia to the Soviets at the Yalta and Tehran conferences in 1943 \nand 1945. These states would become the ``Captive Nations'' suffering \nunder the specter of Soviet domination, brutality, and oppression for \nnearly 50 years.\n  As a public official in Ohio, I remained a strong supporter of the \nCaptive Nations. During my tenure as mayor of Cleveland, I joined my \nbrothers and sisters in the Eastern European Diaspora to celebrate the \nindependence days of the Captive Nations at City Hall. We flew their \nflags, sang their songs, and prayed that one day the people in those \ncountries would know freedom.\n  We saw the Berlin Wall fall and the Iron Curtain torn in half thanks \nlarge in part to the leadership of Pope John Paul II, President Reagan, \nand President George H.W. Bush. But even with the end of the Cold War, \nI remain deeply concerned that darker forces in Russia are reemerging \nas a threat to democracy, human rights, and religious freedom, not just \nfor the Russian people but for the citizens of the newly freed Captive \nNations.\n  This concern in 1998 during my tenure as Governor of Ohio and Chair \nof the National Governor's Association prompted me to pursue an all-50 \nState resolution supporting NATO membership for the Czech Republic, \nHungary, and Poland.\n  When I think about the importance of NATO and our commitment to the \nCaptive Nations, I am inspired by President George W. Bush's speech on \nNATO expansion in Warsaw on June 15, 2001. President Bush stated: ``We \nshould not calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we \ncan do to advance the cause of freedom.'' There was concern at that \ntime because of the debate with Russia that we would back off and not \nsupport further expansion of NATO.\n  I worked diligently from my first day as a member of the Senate in \n1999 to extend NATO membership to my brothers and sisters in the former \nCaptive Nations. I knew NATO membership would provide these fledgling \ndemocracies safe harbor from the possible threat of new Russian \nexpansionism. But I also knew the process of NATO expansion would \nenhance much more than security in Europe.\n  As I noted in a speech on the Senate floor on May 21, 2002, ``While \nNATO is a collective security organization, formed to defend freedom \nand democracy in Europe, we cannot forget that common values form the \nfoundation of the alliance.'' In other words, the foundation of the \nAlliance is based on common values.\n  Democracy, the rule of law, minority rights, these are among the \nvalues that form the hallmark of the NATO alliance.\n  One of my proudest moments as a Senator was when I joined President \nBush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN Richard Myers at the NATO \nSummit in Prague on November 21, 2002, when NATO Secretary General Lord \nRobertson officially announced the decision to invite Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to become \npart of the Alliance. This was truly one of the most thrilling days of \nmy tenure as a Senator.\n  Later that day, my wife Janet and I were happy to attend a dinner in \nhonor of Czech President Vaclav Havel at the Prague Castle. Following \nthat dinner, at 1:30 a.m. Prague time, I placed a call to Cleveland to \ntalk with my brothers and sisters at home with ties to these NATO \naspirant countries. They had gathered in the Lithuanian Hall at Our \nLady of Perpetual Help to celebrate that day's historic events, and \nthis was truly a capstone to years of effort.\n  It is because of my long history and work with the Captive Nations \nthat I continue to worry about the uncertainties of our future \nrelationship with Russia. I have traveled to 19 countries during my 21 \ntrips to the region as a Senator. Presidents, prime ministers, and \nforeign ministers in Eastern Europe have told me time and time again it \nis comforting for them to know their relationship with NATO and the \nUnited States serves as a vital hedge against the threat of a future \npotentially expansionist Russia.\n  Yet now there is much talk from this administration about resetting \nthe U.S. bilateral relationship with Russia. Moscow seeks to regain its \nglobal stature and be respected as a peer in the international \ncommunity. I do not blame them.\n  President Obama's May 2010 National Security Strategy states: ``We \nseek to build a stable, substantive, multidimensional relationship with \nRussia, based on mutual interests. The United States has an interest in \na strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia that respects international \nnorms.'' I agree with the administration. There is nothing inherently \nwrong with this approach.\n  There are indeed key areas where the United States and Russia share \ncommon cause and concern:\n  1. Russia is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and will \ncontinue to be essential towards any effective multilateral pressure on \nIran to give up its nuclear program.\n  2. Russia continues to have leverage on the North Korean regime and \nhas stated a nuclear-free Korean peninsula is in the interest of both \nour nations.\n  Russia continues to have leverage on the North Korean regime and has \nstated a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is in the interest of both our \nnations.\n  No. 3, we are partners in the International Space Station, relying on \nthe Russians. Until the August 2008 invasion of Georgia, our government \nand U.S. industry were working hard on a nuclear cooperation agreement \nwith\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\nRussia similar to the one we entered into with India. In fact, I worked \non that with Senator Lugar. I thought that was a good idea. With the \nworld economy as it is today, the worst thing we can do is break off \ncommunication and revert back to our Cold War positions. President \nObama's trip to Moscow last year and President Medvedev's reciprocal \ntrip to Washington in June were opportunities to further engage Russia \nand determine where we have a symbiotic relationship and what we can \naccomplish together for the good of the international community.\n  However, I believe our reset policy with Russia should not establish \na relationship with Moscow at the expense of the former Captive \nNations. We simply do not know how our relationship with Russia will \ntranspire during the years to come. Will Russia fully embrace a \ndemocratic government, free markets, and the rule of law or will Russia \nseek to reestablish its influence over the former Soviet Union whose \ncollapse then-President and now-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin described \nin 2005 as ``the greatest geopolitical catastrophe'' of the 20th \ncentury? This is what Putin had to say about the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union, a pretty striking comment coming from the former \nPresident and now Prime Minister.\n  This brings us to the topic of the new START treaty, which the Senate \nmay consider in the coming weeks. America's grand strategy toward \nRussia must be realistic. It must be agile. As I have said, it must \ntake into account the interests of our NATO allies. I am deeply \nconcerned the new START treaty may once again undermine the confidence \nof our friends and allies in Central and Eastern Europe. Let me be \nabsolutely clear: I do not ideologically oppose the administration's \nnonproliferation agenda. The President's stated goal of a world without \nnuclear weapons is noble, but I believe the Senate's consideration of \nthe new START treaty must be considered through a wider lens that \nincludes the treaty's implications for our friends and allies in the \nformer captive nations.\n  Let's talk about what is going on right now. First, I am concerned \nabout the uncertainties surrounding a Russia that could revert back to \na country seeking to expand its influence on the Baltic States and \nEastern Europe. President Medvedev's February 2010 National Military \nDoctrine of the Russian Federation, released 2 months before the \nconclusion of the new START treaty in April of this year, explicitly \nlabels NATO expansion as a national threat to Russia's existence and \nreaffirms Russia's right to use nuclear weapons if the country's \nexistence is threatened. I am sure such statements, combined with \nRussia's 2008 invasion of Georgia, send shivers down the spines of our \nbrothers and sisters in Central and Eastern Europe, even if they don't \nsay so publicly.\n  The concerns of our captive nation brothers and sisters regarding \nRussia are not abstract. They are rooted in blood and tears and in a \nhistory of abandonment. My hometown of Cleveland, OH, was once the city \nwith the world's second largest population of Hungarians after \nBudapest. I remember vividly the stories my Hungarian brothers and \nsisters told me about the Hungarian revolution of 1956. Encouraged by \nthe implicit promise of intervention from the United States and the \nUnited Nations, hundreds of thousands of Hungarians protested against \nthe People's Republic of Hungary in support of economic reform and an \nend to political oppression. Those protests spread throughout Hungary. \nThe government was overthrown. But Moscow sought to maintain its \ncontrol over the captive nations, took advantage of America's inaction \non the rebellion, invaded Hungary, crushed the revolution and \nestablished a new authoritative government. Over 2,500 Hungarians were \nkilled in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees to the \nWest. Hungary would suffer under the oppression of the Soviet Union for \nnearly another half century. Of course, there was a similar episode in \nCzechoslovakia during the Prague spring of 1968.\n  The former captive nations have accomplished so much as free market \ndemocracies and members of the NATO alliance. Our friends and allies \nmust have absolute confidence negotiations toward the new START treaty \ndid not include side agreements or informal understandings regarding \nany Russian sphere of influence in those Captive Nations. Moreover, I \nremain deeply concerned, even in the absence of agreements of \nunderstanding, that the former Captive Nations may once again wonder: \nWill the West abandon us again? Will agreement with Russia once again \nbe placed above the interests and concern of our allies? Will we forget \nwhat happened after Yalta and Tehran? We cannot let this happen again.\n  Second, the former Captive Nations are also closely watching Russia's \nmilitary activities. Last September--and nobody made a big deal out of \nit--Russia undertook Operation West, a military exercise involving \n13,000 troops simulating an air, sea, and nuclear attack on Poland. Not \nmuch said about it. These war games, which took place during the 70th \nanniversary of Polish independence, were the largest Russian military \nexercises since the end of the Cold War. If we look at the Russian \nmilitary's recent activity, one cannot help but understand our allies' \nconcern Moscow may be reverting to the past. I hope President Obama \nwill meet with leaders from the former Captive Nations this weekend \nduring the NATO summit in Lisbon. The President should provide these \nleaders public reassurance that the United States remains committed to \narticle 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on \nany member of NATO shall be considered to be an attack on all.\n  One of the best ways to alleviate the anxiety about the Russian \nmilitary amongst our Captive Nation allies is for this administration \nto pursue negotiations with Russia toward its compliance with the \nTreaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the CFE. The Senate's \npotential consideration of a new START cannot be disconnected from \nRussia's prior track record on treaty compliance. Russia decided in \n2007 to suspend its compliance with the CFE treaty, a treaty signed by \n22 countries that placed balanced limits on the deployment of troops \nand conventional weapons in Europe. This unilateral decision by Moscow \nshould serve as a reminder to Senate colleagues about Moscow's \ncommitments to its international obligations. Russia's compliance with \nthe CFE treaty is essential to sustained security and stability in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. Again, complying with it would send a very \ngreat signal to the people worried about Russia's direction.\n  Our friends in Central and Eastern Europe are worried about the \nuncertainty surrounding a Russia that appears at times to be reverting \nback to an authoritative state seeking to weaponize its oil and natural \ngas resources as a means to expand its influence on Europe and the \nWest. Russia has the largest reserves of natural gas and the eighth \nlargest oil reserves. Moscow turned off the tap to Europe in the recent \npast. They could do it again. We should also be concerned about Moscow \nusing its control of oil and natural gas to pit members of NATO against \neach other. I know when I was at the German Marshall Fund Brussels \nforum this year and last, I spoke with our friends in the EU and \nencouraged them that rather than unilaterally negotiating with Russia \nin terms of natural gas, they should all come together and negotiate as \na team so they wouldn't be pit against the other. Unfortunately, most \nof them ignored that.\n  Finally, I am deeply troubled that the Obama administration has \ndecoupled Russia's human rights record from America's bilateral \nrelationship with Russia. The United States and Russia are both \nsignatories of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration, which clearly states \nthat:\n\n       Participating States will respect human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, \n     conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction \n     as to race, sex, language or religion.\n\n  In recent years, we have seen anything but a respect for human rights \nin Russia. Prime Minister Putin stated during a recent interview with \nthe Kommersant newspaper that prodemocracy demonstrators in Russia \nassembling without prior permission ``will be hit on the head with \nbatons. That's all there is to it.''\n\n  The actions of the Russian Government speak louder than words. We \nhave seen protests canceled, newspapers closed, activists detained and \nabused.\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nYet we have seen little effort by this administration to engage in a \nsustained dialog with Moscow on its human rights record and commitments \nunder the Helsinki Declaration. We did more about human rights \nviolations 20 years ago in Russia than we are doing today. It is like \nwe have tape over our mouth.\n  As David Kramer of the German Marshall Fund of the United States \nnotes in a Washington Post opinion on September 20:\n\n       The human rights situation in Russia is bad and likely to \n     get more worse as [Russia's] March 2012 presidential election \n     nears. Those in power will do anything to stay in power . . . \n     Enough already with U.S. expressions of ``regret'' about the \n     deteriorating situation inside Russia--it's time to call it \n     like it is: Condemn what's happening there and consider \n     consequences for continued human rights abuses.\n\n  I believe the Obama administration's inaction and reluctance to \nconfront Russia on its human rights record sends a dangerous signal to \nMoscow that there are little or no consequences for bad behavior. At a \nminimum, such coddling of bad behavior by the West only serves to \nembolden Moscow as to our resolve to hold Russia to account on its \ninternational obligations, a distressing thought as we consider the new \nSTART in the Senate.\n  I have fought all my life to secure freedom for my brothers and \nsisters in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Yugoslavia. Once \nthey received their freedom, I championed--and continue to champion--\ntheir membership in NATO and the EU. I am working with Senator Shaheen \nright now in the former Yugoslavia to see how many of those countries \nwe can get into the European Union and how many we can get into the \nNATO alliance. I will be darned, at this stage in my life, to do \nanything that would jeopardize their security and economic prosperity. \nI have seen too many opportunities for the region slip away during my \nlifetime. I will not let it happen again.\n  Political expediency should never be an excuse to rush to judgment on \npublic policy, let alone our national security. Treaties supersede all \nlaws and acts of Congress. The Senate's advice-and-consent duties on \ntreaties are among our most solemn constitutional duties. I cannot, in \ngood conscience, determine my support for this treaty until the \nadministration assures me that our reset policy with Russia is a policy \nthat enhances rather than diminishes the national security of our \nfriends and allies throughout Europe.\n\n  Moreover, I must receive the strongest assurances that this policy \ndoes not once again amount to the United States leaving our brothers \nand sisters in the former Captive Nations alone against undue pressures \nfrom Russia.\n  When I finally cash out, I want to know these countries we forgot at \nthe end of the Second World War, where millions of people were sent to \nthe gulag, will never be forgotten again.\n  I think this President has an obligation to look at this treaty \nbeyond just the nonproliferation side. He has an obligation to look at \nit as part of resetting our relationship with Russia, and we ought to \nget some things cleared up before we go ahead and sign this treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7916-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a legendary \nKentucky newspaperman who, after 39 years, is retiring, and the \nCommonwealth will certainly be the poorer for it. I am going to miss my \nold friend, Bill Bartleman of the Paducah Sun, as his service in the \nfourth estate ends this month.\n  Bill's first day at the Paducah Sun was January 7, 1972, when the \nMurray State University graduate was hired as both a reporter and a \nphotographer. In the four decades since, he has covered Senators and \nGovernors, local lawmakers and the Kentuckians whose names you may not \nknow but who, in his words, ``make life happen.''\n  He has interviewed a President of the United States, and he has \nridden a hot air balloon over the Ohio River. He has become Kentucky's \nlongest running legislative reporter. He has led quite a life of \naccomplishment, and I wish him well in the next stage of his career.\n  I first met Bill when he covered my initial race for the Senate in \n1984, and he has covered every one of my races since that time. For my \nlast election campaign in 2008, Bill moderated a debate between me and \nmy opponent that was broadcast on C-SPAN. So the whole Nation had a \nchance to see Bill hard at work. He was fair, honest, and professional, \nas always.\n  After 39 years, it would be easy for some reporters to make the \nmistake of thinking they are the story--but not Bill. This veteran \njournalist has words of wisdom for young reporters. This is what Bill \nhad to say:\n\n       Remember the responsibility of what you do.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Bill Bartleman isn't important, but what he covers is \n     important. You need to represent the public and report what \n     happens fairly. You can't send people tainted water, and you \n     can't send tainted news.\n\n  Those words are well said. Those of us in public life will always \nhave a close relationship with members of the press. Sometimes it is a \nbit challenging and sometimes it is frustrating. Sometimes the \npolitician and the reporter do not always see eye to eye. I cannot say \nBill Bartleman and I agree on everything. But I can say that Bill \nBartleman will always have my respect.\n  For 39 years, Kentuckians have benefited from his incisive political \ncoverage. As he moves on to a position with Mid-Continent University in \nMayfield, KY, I know I speak for many Kentuckians when I say: Thank \nyou, Bill. Thank you, Bill, for your dedicated service. You certainly \nwill be missed.\n  Bill's own newspaper, the Paducah Sun, recently published an \nexcellent article about his life and career, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Paducah Sun, Oct. 24, 2010]\n\n              After 39 Years, Bartleman To Retire From Sun\n\n       Kentucky's longest-running legislative reporter plans to \n     retire from The Paducah Sun in November.\n       Bill Bartleman, 61, will retire from the Sun after 35 years \n     of covering government and politics, and nearly 39 years \n     total working for the newspaper.\n       ``I have thoroughly enjoyed my career as a reporter for The \n     Paducah Sun and have mixed emotions about retiring,'' \n     Bartleman said.\n       ``The profession has provided me with opportunities to \n     experience things and see things that others don't get to see \n     and feel. Most gratifying are the memories of the people I've \n     met and having the opportunity to work for people who care.''\n       The Pennsylvania native graduated from Murray State \n     University in December 1971. Bartleman served his first day \n     at the Sun on Jan. 7, 1972, after being hired as a dual \n     reporter and photographer with the majority of his duties in \n     photography.\n       He took over the paper's government and politics beat in \n     1975 and covered, in person, every session of legislature in \n     Frankfort from 1976-2007 while using the Web, phone \n     interviews and less frequent Frankfort visits for coverage in \n     the past three years.\n       A frequent commentator for more than 30 years on Kentucky \n     Educational Television's ``Comment on Kentucky,'' Bartleman \n     also served as a panelist for KET political debates for \n     governor, U.S. senator and other offices.\n       In 2008, he moderated a U.S. Senate candidate debate \n     between Sen. Mitch McConnell and Bruce Lunsford, which was \n     broadcast on C-SPAN, the national cable affairs network.\n       Bartleman said he will become an administrator at Mid-\n     Continent University in Mayfield on Dec. 1.\n       ``I learned early in my career that The Paducah Sun has had \n     a rich tradition and responsibility of reporting news \n     thoroughly, fairly and accurately,'' Bartleman said. ``It is \n     a tradition handed down by Ed Paxton, Sr. I've always viewed \n     myself as one of his caretakers to help carry on that \n     tradition and responsibility. It is time for me to pass on my \n     caretaker role to someone else and meet a new and exciting \n     challenge.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7916-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7916-S7917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRIORITIES DURING LAMEDUCK SESSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, both Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate held many meetings this week to assess the priorities of our \nrespective conferences.\n  I am extremely proud of the clarity my Republican colleagues have \nused to express what our priorities must be and\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nthat we have listened to the American people. Last night, Republicans \nexpressed the need to cut spending, reduce the debt, shrink the size \nand scope of the Federal Government, and help spur private sector \nemployment--in short, change the way Washington is doing business to \nget our economy going again.\n  There is no question that is a sentiment shared by the American \npeople. I would be remiss if I did not also express some dismay with \nthe priorities that are being put forward on the other side of the \naisle.\n  This is a lameduck session, and they have an opportunity to respond \nto the American people before we convene for the 112th Congress, but \nthere is no reason why we cannot get to work on their behalf beginning \ntoday.\n  Let me share with you what I believe our priorities need to be during \nthe lameduck session: first and foremost, preventing massive tax \nincreases on families and small businesses and stopping the Washington \nspending spree. It is critical we send a message to job creators that \nCongress will not raise taxes on January 1.\n  In September, I offered a bill that would make the current tax rates \npermanent. In other words, nobody--nobody--in America would get a tax \nhike at the end of the year. The White House did not like that idea. \nTheir preference was to raise taxes on small businesses. I think it is \nsafe to say the American people clearly preferred our proposal: no tax \nhikes on anybody, especially in the middle of a recession. We should be \ncreating jobs, not killing them.\n  It is my hope that starting today Democrats will turn to the \npriorities that reflect the wishes of the American people. If they \nchoose that route, I know Republicans will be happy to work with them \nto get those things accomplished. If not, I am confident Republicans \nwill be eager to chart a different course on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  When we return from the Thanksgiving break, Republican and Democratic \nleaders will have an opportunity to discuss these priorities with the \nPresident in a meeting at the White House. I am looking forward to the \nmeeting and to the opportunity to share with the President again the \nareas where we agree. I believe we can work together to increase \nopportunities for job growth here at home through increased trade \nopportunities abroad. I agree with the President that we should \nincrease our exploration for clean coal technology and nuclear energy, \nand Americans feel strongly that we need to reduce spending and our \nnational debt.\n  We can work together on all those items, and the White House meeting \nis a good opportunity for congressional Democrats to join us in those \nefforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7917-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7917-S7921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know my colleague, Senator Harkin, will \nbe on the floor momentarily to speak about the Food Safety \nModernization Act. I wish to preface my remarks by thanking him \npersonally. Tom Harkin has been not only a great colleague and friend, \nhe has been such an exceptional leader when it comes to this important \nissue. It is no surprise for those of us who know Tom Harkin's \ncongressional and Senate career. He has always been an extraordinary \nleader.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act, which literally has changed the \nface of America and opened doors for the disabled across our Nation, is \nnot only one of the most dramatic steps forward when it comes to human \nrights and civil rights in my time, it was led by Senator Tom Harkin of \nIowa and Senator Robert Dole, Republican of Kansas, who then served in \nthe Senate.\n  So Tom Harkin has been our conscience and our leader when it comes to \nissues involving safety, human rights, and expanding the reach of \nfreedom in our Nation to those who otherwise might have been denied.\n  I will tell you why I am passionate about the food safety issue. It \ngoes back to a note I received as a Congressman. It was almost 16 years \nago. It was a note from a woman who did not live in my congressional \ndistrict. She was from Chicago and I was 200 miles away. Her name was \nNancy Donley, and she told the story of her 5- or 6-year-old son Alex. \nShe brought some hamburger home from the local grocery store to fix it \nfor her son. She made his dinner. He ate it, and then he got sick, \nterribly sick. In a matter of a few hours, he was at the hospital, and \nin a matter of a few days he had passed away.\n  He was a victim of E. coli. Trust me, his mom would never have done \nanything to harm him, and she thought she was doing the right thing to \ncook his meal and bring it to him at the dinner table. Unfortunately, \nthat family decision, which is made millions of times across America \nevery single day, was a fatal decision.\n  Nancy Donley--heart broken, her life shattered by the loss of that \nlittle boy she loved so much--could have shrunk away in despair and \nanger over what had happened but did not. She made it her passion and \nher crusade to gather others like her in behalf of the cause of food \nsafety. She started an organization called Safe Tables Our Priority--or \nSTOP--and started lobbying Members of Congress, even a Congressman 200 \nmiles away, to do what they could to make our laws stronger and better \nacross America.\n  I have kept in touch with Nancy. It has been over 16 years. We are \nclose friends now. I have to tell you that in my pantheon of heroes, \nNancy Donley is right up there for what she has done with her life. If \nwe are fortunate enough today and successful in passing this bill--at \nleast moving it forward procedurally--I wish to say I am doing that in \nher name and in the memory of her son Alex and the thousands, tens of \nthousands, maybe even more, across America who are victims of \ncontaminated food.\n  For some people, it is just a simple case of indigestion or diarrhea \nthat goes away after a few days. It may be mistaken for the flu. For \nothers, it gets more serious. The number of Americans who die or become \nseverely ill due to preventible foodborne illness is unacceptably high, \nand it has been that way for a long time.\n  Every year, 76 million Americans suffer from preventable foodborne \nillness. Mr. President, 325,000 of our family members, friends, and \nneighbors are hospitalized each year because of food contamination and \n5,000 die--100 a week. That means that every 5 minutes 3 people are \nrushed to the hospital because the food they ate made them sick, and at \nthe end of the day 13 will die.\n  Throughout the debate on this bill, I have shared the heartbreaking \nstories of victims such as Alex Donley and his family. Some of these \nvictims who were courageous enough to share their stories will suffer \nchronic symptoms that do not go away for a long time, if ever. The \nvictims who have died would have wished they were lucky enough to be \nalive, even with these long-term illnesses.\n  Today, as we vote to move to this bill, I will be thinking about how \nmuch it means to so many of us. I talked about Nancy Donley and her son \nAlex. They are not the only ones. There are people all across America \nwho understand, when they go shopping at the food store and buy \ngroceries or buy produce, there is a sort of built-in assumption it is \nsafe. Would our government let things be put on the shelves in a store \nthat have not been inspected, that are not safe?\n  Most people assume that if the government is doing its job like it is \nsupposed to, they should not have to worry about those things. Well, to \na great extent, they are right. We have extraordinary resources in the \nFederal Government dedicated toward food safety. But the simple fact \nis, there are wide gaps when it comes to food safety in America, and \nthose gaps need to be closed by this bill.\n  The vast majority of Americans understand this. According to a recent \npoll commissioned by Pew, 89 percent of Americans want us to modernize \nour food safety system. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Harkin and \nSenator Enzi, our Republican colleague, our food safety bill passed the \nHealth, Education and Labor Committee unanimously more than a year ago.\n  This bill has substantial bipartisan support. Twenty Republican and \nDemocratic Senators are already committed to it. It is supported by a \nbroad group of consumer protection interests, including those at the \nGrocery Manufacturers Association and those at the\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\nFood Marketing Institute and other places that actually market the \nproducts and are willing to accept the new legal burdens of this bill \nin order to give their customers peace of mind in terms of what they \nare going to buy and consume.\n  The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act will provide the FDA with the \nauthority it needs to prevent, detect, and respond to food safety \nproblems.\n  The bill will increase the frequency of inspection at all foreign and \ndomestic food facilities according to the risk they present.\n  One of the issues we have to be aware of is that a global economy \nmeans food is moving across borders more frequently. It is rare that we \nhave the resources in place in some foreign country to make sure what \nis in that can or in that package is safely prepared. This bill moves \nus toward this goal. We pick the things that are the most dangerous \nwhen it comes to food imports and say they will be the highest \npriority; we will start the inspection now on food imports coming into \nthe United States. The FDA doesn't currently have the resources or \nstatutory mandate to inspect more frequently, and what they do inspect \nin terms of imports is very limited. We expand that to the most high-\nrisk, dangerous food products that might come in.\n  Most facilities are inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, \nthough only once every 10 years. Think about it. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture is in place every single day at meat and poultry and \nproduction facilities with the inspectors in place to do the job. When \nit comes to the FDA, an agency with such a broad responsibility--in \nfact, much broader: 1 inspection every 10 years--if it is your son or \ndaughter, your baby, someone you love, is that enough? I don't think it \nis. This bill significantly increases the frequency of inspections at \nall domestic and foreign food production facilities according to the \nrisks they present. The bill gives the Food and Drug Administration \nlong overdue authority to conduct mandatory recalls of contaminated \nfood.\n  It is hard to believe today, but if we know something is contaminated \nand has been sent out to the grocery shelves across America, our \ngovernment has no legal authority to say: Bring it in. The best we can \ndo is advertise the fact that it is dangerous and hope that the \nmanufacturer, the distributor, and the ultimate retailer will get the \nmessage and move on it and do the right thing. It is voluntary. It is \nnot mandatory, even if we know that something is dangerous. This bill \ngives that authority to the Food and Drug Administration. That means \nthat if a company refuses to recall contaminated food, the most \nexpedient action the FDA can take is to issue a press release right \naway, and we have to get beyond that. We have to give them authority. \nMany companies do cooperate with the FDA, and I salute them. It is not \nonly the sensible thing to do; it certainly maintains the \nrepresentation of them as food producers.\n  Some, such as the Peanut Corporation of America, which distributed \nthousands of pounds of peanuts and peanut paste contaminated with \nsalmonella, didn't fully or quickly recall food that made people sick. \nThe Food Safety Modernization Act is going to change that by ensuring \nthe FDA can compel a company to recall food that can cause serious \nadverse health consequences or death.\n  Experts agree that individual businesses are in the best position to \nidentify and prevent food safety hazards at their own facilities. The \npeople who run a facility know where the vulnerabilities are on the \nassembly line and they know which hazards their foods are most \nsusceptible to. That is why our bill requires each business to identify \nthe food safety hazards at each of its locations and then implement a \nplan that addresses those hazards and keeps the food safe and free of \ncontamination. The bill gives the FDA the authority to review and \nevaluate these food safety hazard prevention plans and hold companies \naccountable.\n  I see the chairman of the committee on the floor and I will end in a \nmoment.\n  Finally, our bill gives the FDA the authority to prevent contaminated \nfood from other countries from entering the United States. If a foreign \nfacility refuses U.S. food safety inspection, the FDA has the authority \nto deny entry to their imports. Think about that. This is now going to \nbe put into the law that if you are producing food overseas and you \nwill not allow us to inspect your facility, we can stop exports to the \nUnited States. Is there any Member of the Senate, any family, who \ndoesn't think that is a good idea? That is what this bill is all about.\n  I wish to thank Senator Harkin for his extraordinary leadership on \nthis bill. I can't tell my colleagues how many times we have come \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, trying to work out differences. We \nare very close. I think there is one item of disagreement going into \nit. That is pretty good for Senate work--only one item of disagreement.\n  I say to my friends: Bring this bill to the floor. Let's vote on that \nparticular item--Senator Tester's concern--up or down. Let's do it. But \nlet's not go another day without providing the protection families \nacross America expect and deserve when they buy food. Let's do this on \nbehalf of Nancy Donley and moms and dads all across America who ran the \nrisk and, in her case, went through the bitter experience of losing her \nlittle 6-year-old boy Alex because of contaminated food. This is \nsomething that should be totally nonpartisan.\n  I urge my colleagues: Let's give a strong vote today to move forward \non this important bill and help ensure that the food on America's \ntables is safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I intend to defer to Senator Harkin for I \nunderstand 15 minutes. I wish to offer a brief unanimous-consent \nrequest that following Senator Harkin's speech for up to 15 minutes I \nbe recognized for 5 minutes, and that any remaining time on our side be \nreserved for Senator Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding.\n  I wish to thank Senator Durbin for all the work he has done on food \nsafety for so many years. He has been a leader. He has prompted us and \nprodded us to get to this point, and we have a good bipartisan bill. I \nwish to take a few moments to talk about it before the vote that will \nbe coming up in the next hour.\n  The aim of the Food Safety Modernization Act, as it is called, is \nvery simply to bring our Nation's antiquated and increasingly \ninadequate inspection service into the 21st century. This bill takes a \ncomprehensive approach to reforming the current system. I am pleased to \nreport that this bill is a product of strong bipartisan collaboration \non the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Again, I wish \nto particularly thank Senator Durbin and Senator Gregg who have worked \ntogether over many years to produce this excellent bill. I also wish to \nthank our ranking member, Senator Enzi, for his leadership in helping \nto bring this bill to the floor, as well as to my good friend Senator \nDodd who has been working on this bill also from the beginning and \nadding his expertise, especially on food allergies. I also thank \nSenator Burr, who has been personally involved in this entire process.\n\n  Senators often speak about the importance of addressing kitchen table \nissues here in the Senate--the practical, everyday concerns of working \nAmericans and their families. Well, food safety is a kitchen table \nissue and it couldn't be more urgent or overdue. It is shocking to \nthink that the last comprehensive overhaul of our food safety system \nwas in 1938, more than seven decades ago. Think about how our food \nsystem has changed in those 70 years. On the whole, Americans enjoy \nsafe and wholesome food. We know that. But the problem is that ``on the \nwhole'' is not good enough any longer.\n  As my colleagues can see from our first chart, they will see that \nrecent foodborne illnesses have been wide in scope and have had a \ndevastating impact on public health. When people get\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\nsick from eating bagged spinach, we have a problem. When kids take \ntheir peanut butter sandwiches to school and they get sick from it and \ngo to the hospital, we have a problem. We had 90 deaths and 690 \nreported cases in 46 States. We have found salmonella in tomatoes, in \npeppers, and even in cookie dough. When families eat cookie dough and \nthey are getting E. coli, we have a problem. Recently, of course, we \nhad the salmonella outbreak in eggs. So it is widespread. It is not \njust in bagged spinach or eggs, it is in peanut butter, cantaloupes, \ntomatoes. It is widespread. So we know we have a real problem.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that \nfoodborne illnesses cause an estimated 76 million illnesses a year; 325 \nAmericans every year are hospitalized because of foodborne illnesses; \nand 5,000 Americans die every year due to a foodborne illness. These \nare not my figures. These figures are from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. According to a Georgetown University study, the \ncost to our society is about $152 billion a year in medical expenses, \nlost productivity, and disability. So the numbers are staggering, not \nonly the number of people who get sick, but the number of people who \ndie and the cost to our society.\n  I checked in my own State of Iowa, and the cost alone in Iowa--we \nhave over 800,000 cases every year. Each Iowan has to spend about \n$1,800 in annual health-related expenses, and about $1.5 billion in \ntotal related costs. My colleagues can look at their States and see the \nimpact. So these are intolerable, but somehow we tolerate them. No \nlonger can we do that. Our current regulatory system is broken. It does \nnot adequately protect Americans from serious widespread foodborne \nillnesses.\n  Our meals have grown more complex with more varied ingredients and \nmore diverse methods of preparation and shipping. By the time raw \nagricultural products find a way to our dinner plates, multiple \nintermediate steps and processes have taken place. Food ingredients \ntravel thousands of miles or, as Senator Durbin said, from other \ncountries to factories here and then to our tables. They are \nintermingled and mixed along the way. Yet, despite all of these \nchanges, our food safety laws have not changed in 70 years.\n  What we need to do for starters is improve processes to prevent the \ncontamination of foods and methods to provide safe foods to consumers. \nTo achieve this, more testing and better methods of tracking food can \nbe utilized and verified that the processes are working.\n  Here are some interesting figures. Thirty years ago, we had 70,000 \nfood processors in this country. The FDA made 35,000 visits a year. So \nwe had 70,000 food processors and we made 35,000 visits a year. Today, \na full decade into the 21st century, we have 150,000 food processors--\nover twice as many--but today FDA inspectors make 6,700 visits each \nyear, one-fifth as many as they did 30 years ago, with twice as many \nplants. So is it any surprise we are getting more and more foodborne \nillnesses throughout this country? Referencing what Senator Durbin said \nearlier, more and more of our food is coming from other countries. All \nwe are saying in our bill is you have to adopt the same kind of food \nsafety processes and prevention methods that we have in this country to \nbe able to ship your food in. I don't think that is unreasonable, to \nsay that their processes and their safety procedures have to be at \nleast the same as ours or as adequate as ours.\n  As this chart shows, our bill overhauls our food safety system in \nfour critical ways. First is prevention. We have had some success in \nour Agriculture Committee in the past on what is called a program of \nfinding out where are the points where contamination can come in and \nthen address those points in a preventive manner. Well, we are now kind \nof extending that beyond meat and poultry to all food to get the \nprevention in place. We improve the detection and response to foodborne \nillness outbreaks with better detection services and better response \ntimes. We have a mandatory recall in here that the Department has never \nhad, ever. We enhance the U.S. food defense capabilities, and we \nincrease the FDA resources in order to take care of this.\n  This bill today will dramatically increase FDA inspections at all \nfood facilities. It will give FDA the following new authorities: It \nwill require all food facilities to have, as I said, preventive plans \nin place, and the FDA can have access to those plans. So they have to \nhave preventive plans that the FDA gets access to. We have better \naccess to records in case of a food emergency to try to find out what \nhappened. It requires, as Senator Durbin said, importers to verify the \nsafety of imported food. It strengthens our surveillance systems. It \nrequires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \nto establish a pilot project to test and evaluate new methods for \nrapidly tracking foods in the event of a foodborne illness outbreak. As \nI said, it gives the FDA the authority to order a mandatory recall of \nfood. A lot of people don't know this: If there is an outbreak of \nillness because of foodborne diseases, pathogens, FDA does not have the \nauthority to recall that food.\n  You might say that the companies do that. Well, they do. Most of them \nsee it in their best economic interest to do that. But you might have \nfly-by-night operators out there that will take the money and run. You \nmight have some foreign-based companies--and I don't mean to pick on \nthem--that are offshore and they may have some food in this country \nthat has caused foodborne illnesses, and they may not want to recall \nit. We cannot go after them. The FDA doesn't have the authority to \nrecall that food. This bill would give them that authority.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, strongly supported by consumer groups and \nindustry. I have letters from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Restaurant Association, Pew \nCharitable Trusts, Consumers Union, Center for Science in the Public \nInterest, and Trust for America's Health, to name a few. I think it is \na rarity when I can say both the Chamber of Commerce and the Center for \nScience in the Public Interest are on the same page. That is true here.\n  I have several letters, and I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 8, 2010.\n     Senator Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Gregg: Trust for America's Health \n     (TFAH), a nonprofit, nonpartisan public health advocacy \n     organization, would like to express our strong support for \n     immediate Senate passage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization \n     Act (S. 510). Although every American depends on the safety \n     of the food they serve to their families, the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) lacks the tools to ensure that safety. \n     S. 510 would finally help bring the FDA into the 21st \n     century.\n       Approximately 76 million Americans--one in four--are \n     sickened by foodborne disease each year. Of these, an \n     estimated 325,000 are hospitalized and 5,000 die. A recent \n     study by Ohio State University found that foodborne illnesses \n     cost the U.S. economy an estimated $152 billion annually. \n     With multiple severe food outbreaks in recent years, it is \n     urgent that the Senate take this step to keep Americans safe.\n       The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act would place more \n     emphasis on prevention of foodborne illness and give the FDA \n     new authorities to address food safety problems. Under this \n     legislation, food processors would be required to identify \n     potential hazards in their production processes and implement \n     preventive programs to eliminate those hazards. Additionally, \n     the bill would require FDA to inspect all food facilities \n     more frequently and give FDA mandatory recall authority of \n     contaminated food. S. 510 is a bipartisan bill, with \n     widespread support from industry, consumer groups, and public \n     health organizations. The bill passed the Senate HELP \n     Committee with a unanimous voice vote, and food safety \n     legislation passed the House last year with overwhelming \n     bipartisan support.\n       We thank you for your strong leadership on this \n     legislation. If you have any questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact TFAH's Government Relations Manager.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jeffrey Levi, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                September 8, 2010.\n     Hon. Dick Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Senator Gregg: Consumer Federation \n     of America strongly supports passage of the FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act (S. 510). CFA is an association of nearly \n     300 nonprofit consumer organizations that was established in \n     1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, \n     advocacy and education.\n       Foodborne illness strikes tens of millions of Americans \n     each year, sends hundreds of thousands to the hospital, and \n     kills approximately 5,000 of us. The diseases are more than \n     ``just a bellyache.'' Many victims suffer long-term chronic \n     health problems including reactive arthritis, kidney failure \n     and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Children under the age of 5 are \n     the most frequent victims of foodborne illness. People over \n     age 60 are most likely to die after contracting a food-\n     related illness. The economic costs are enormous. A recent \n     study estimated the annual cost of all foodbome illnesses to \n     be $152 billion.\n       The suffering and heartbreak and deaths are pointless. \n     Foodbome diseases are almost entirely preventable. They \n     continue to rage because our nation's primary food safety \n     agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, operates under \n     the constraints of a 70-year-old law that is largely \n     extraneous to current threats to food safety. The Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act does not give the FDA a specific statutory \n     mandate, appropriate program tools, adequate enforcement \n     authority or sufficient resources to stop foodborne disease \n     before it strikes us and our loved ones.\n       S. 510 changes the paradigm for fighting foodbome illness, \n     directing the FDA to prevent foodbome illness rather than \n     just reacting to reports of illnesses and deaths. It requires \n     food companies to establish processing controls to avoid food \n     contamination, gives the FDA authority to set food safety \n     standards, and requires the Agency to inspect food processing \n     plants regularly to assure controls are working as intended.\n       On behalf of CFA's millions of members, we thank you for \n     your strong leadership in developing S. 510 and your \n     determination to ensure its passage. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you to get a final bill to the \n     President as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Carol L.

Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Gregg: The Pew Charitable Trusts \n     urges the Senate to vote at the soonest possible date on S. \n     510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009, and \n     encourages you to continue the important support and \n     leadership you each have provided for this crucial \n     legislation over the past year. The HELP Committee \n     unanimously approved a strong, bipartisan bill in November, \n     and a manager's package of amendments was released in mid-\n     August. With the limited time left for legislative action \n     this year, a vote by the full Senate on S. 510 is necessary \n     as soon as possible to ensure that a final bill arrives on \n     the President's desk for enactment before this Congress \n     adjourns.\n       This country has experienced a seemingly endless number of \n     foodborne-illness outbreaks and recalls of contaminated \n     products, demonstrating the clear need for this legislation. \n     S. 510 fundamentally shifts the government's approach in this \n     area to preventing food-safety problems, rather than just \n     reacting to them. The bill requires food companies to develop \n     food-safety plans that identify possible sources of \n     contamination and implement measures to minimize them. This \n     legislation also provides the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) with much-needed enforcement tools, such \n     as mandatory recall authority and better inspection.\n       Enactment of FDA food-safety legislation could \n     significantly reduce the burden of foodborne illness in the \n     United States, both for families and businesses. A Pew-funded \n     study estimates the annual health-related costs of foodborne \n     illness at $152 billion. For this reason, a wide range of \n     stakeholders--consumer advocates, public health \n     organizations, and major industry groups--support this bill. \n     We thank you for your leadership on S. 510 and ask you to \n     continue your efforts to secure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Shelley A.

Judd Gregg,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Senator Gregg: Consumers Union, the \n     non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, writes in \n     support of S. 510, the bipartisan FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act. This legislation will finally bring our \n     outdated food safety laws into the 21st century, and will \n     help protect consumers from deadly recalls like last month's \n     recall of half a billion eggs for Salmonella contamination. \n     Consumers expect that the food they eat and serve to their \n     families will not make them sick, or worse. We applaud your \n     leadership on this vital consumer protection legislation, and \n     hope that S. 510 comes to the floor of the Senate for a vote \n     in September.\n       S. 510 will protect consumers by:\n       Requiring the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to inspect \n     food processing plants on a regular basis;\n       Giving FDA the power to order recalls of contaminated food; \n     right now, the agency can only request that the food be \n     recalled and hope that companies respond in the public \n     interest;\n       Requiring food producers to identify where food can become \n     unsafe, and requiring them to take steps to prevent \n     contamination by Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, and other \n     pathogens;\n       Improving methods of tracing contaminated food back to its \n     source, so that consumers can act in a timely and \n     knowledgeable fashion to protect their families from unsafe \n     food; and\n       Requiring imported food to meet the same safety standards \n     as food produced in the U.S.\n       S. 510 also takes steps to address the concerns raised by \n     small food producers that they be regulated in a scale-\n     appropriate manner.\n       We also urge you to support Senator Feinstein's proposed \n     amendment to ban Bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, \n     from baby bottles, sippy cups, baby food, and infant formula. \n     BPA has been linked to a wide range of health problems. \n     Numerous studies have shown BPA effects on the brain, \n     prostate, hormonal and reproductive systems, and it has been \n     linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance and even \n     cancer.\n       The health impact is even more pronounced on babies and \n     children. Seven states and several cities have already taken \n     action to ban BPA from food and beverage containers used by \n     children and babies, as have three nations, including Canada. \n     In addition, packaging and containers already exist on the \n     market today without this chemical. We urge you to support \n     the Feinstein amendment, and to provide all American children \n     with BPA-free food and drink.\n       Again, we thank you for your strong leadership on this \n     vital public health legislation. We look forward to working \n     with you to send a final bill to the President's desk for \n     signature this fall.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jean Halloran,\n                                Director, Food Policy Initiatives.\n                                                    Ami V.

The HELP Committee approved a strong, \n     bipartisan bill in November, and we believe that a vote would \n     keep the momentum going for enactment of landmark food-safety \n     legislation.\n       Strong food-safety legislation will reduce the risk of \n     contamination and thereby better protect public health and \n     safety, raise the bar for the food industry, and deter bad \n     actors. S. 510 will provide the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) with the resources and authorities the \n     agency needs to help make prevention the focus of our food \n     safety strategies. Among other things, this legislation \n     requires food companies to develop a food safety plan; it \n     improves the safety of imported food and food ingredients; \n     and it adopts a risk-based approach to inspection.\n       Our organizations--representing the food industry, \n     consumers, and the public-health community--urge you to bring \n     S. 510 to the floor, and we will continue to work with \n     Congress for the enactment of food safety legislation that \n     better protects consumers, restores their confidence in the \n     safety of the food they eat, and addresses the challenges \n     posed by our global food supply.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Beverage Association, American Frozen Food \n           Institute, Center for Foodborne Illness Research & \n           Education, Center for Science in the Public Interest, \n           Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Food \n           Marketing Institute, Grocery Manufacturers Association, \n           International Bottled Water Association, International \n           Dairy Foods Association, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Coffee Association of U.S.A., \n           Inc., National Confectioners Association, National \n           Consumers League, National Restaurant Association, The \n           PEW Charitable Trusts, Trust for America's Health, \n           Snack Food Association, S.T.O.P.

Local \n     health officials around the country begin to see an uptick in \n     illnesses from a particular source. As they notify the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epidemiologists \n     begin to see a pattern in the illness and outbreak reports, \n     identify a food as the likely cause, and notify the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA). FDA, state health and local \n     officials then deploy investigators across the country, \n     furiously searching for the source of the illness, knowing \n     that every day more people are getting sick, some seriously. \n     In the meantime, the public must be warned to avoid the food \n     of concern, creating anxiety for consumers and economic \n     losses for farmers, food processors and retailers.\n       This time we're seeing this pattern play out with \n     Salmonella Enteriditis in eggs, with illnesses in 22 states \n     and more than half a billion eggs being recalled. But in \n     recent years it has been spinach, salsa, peanut butter, bean \n     sprouts, cookie dough, green onions--the list goes on and on, \n     covering many of our most common foods. Many people are left \n     wondering: heading into the second decade of the 21st \n     century, why can't we prevent and react more effectively to \n     the threat from foodborne illness?\n       Sadly, the answer is simple. As President Obama said during \n     last year's peanut butter outbreak, caused by a different \n     form of Salmonella, we have a food safety regulatory system \n     designed early in the 20th century, one that must be \n     overhauled, modernized and strengthened for today.\n       Under the current system, FDA is often forced to chase food \n     contaminations after they have occurred, rather than \n     protecting the public from them in the first place. \n     Difficulties in tracking the movement of food from its origin \n     to its eventual sale to the public (often far across the \n     country) can frustrate efforts to identify contaminated food. \n     The biggest surprise to most people: FDA cannot order a \n     recall of contaminated food once it is found in the \n     marketplace. Although government has a crucial role in \n     ensuring the safety of our food supply, strong regulation has \n     been missing. An overhaul of our antiquated food safety \n     system is long overdue.\n       Proposed food safety legislation would give FDA better ways \n     to more quickly trace back contaminated products to the \n     source, the ability to check firms' safety records before \n     problems occur, clear authority to require firms to identify \n     and resolve food safety hazards, and resources to find \n     additional inspections and other oversight activities. \n     Pending legislation would also give the agency mandatory \n     recall authority, and other strong enforcement tools, like \n     new civil penalties and increased criminal penalties for \n     companies that fail to comply with safety requirements. In a \n     world where more and more food is imported, the legislation \n     also would strengthen FDA's ability to ensure the safety of \n     imported food.\n       The good news is that a bipartisan majority in the House of \n     Representatives passed major food safety legislation last \n     year that would move the United States from a reactive food \n     safety system to one focused on preventing illness. Likewise \n     in the Senate, a bipartisan coalition has developed a strong \n     food safety bill that is ready for the Senate floor. This \n     legislation has the support of a remarkably broad coalition \n     of public health, consumer and food industry groups. We \n     commend both chambers for their hard work.\n       Now it's time to finish the job. We encourage Senators to \n     support a critical and commonsense piece of public health \n     legislation. And, we urge the House and Senate to quickly \n     deliver a modem food safety bill to the President's desk. \n     It's time to break the pattern of foodborne illnesses and \n     economic loss. It's time to give FDA the modem tools and \n     resources it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st \n     century.\n                                                Kathleen Sebelius,\n               Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services.\n                                        Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D.,\n                                   Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have said many times that to say that \nfood safety in this country is a patchwork is giving it too much \ncredit. Food safety has too often become a hit-or-miss gamble, with \nparents obliged to kind of roll the dice when it comes to the safety of \ntheir kids' food. It is frightening and unacceptable. It is past time \nto modernize our food safety laws and regulations--70 years past time. \nWe need to give FDA the resources and authority it needs to cope with a \ngrowing problem that threatens today a more abundant and diverse food \nsupply. We need to act now.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the bipartisan sponsors to pass this \nimportant legislation and vote for cloture this afternoon on the motion \nto proceed. Hopefully, we can get on the bill and pass it as soon as \npossible, so that the families of America will have more assurance that \nthe food they eat, no matter what the source, or from where it comes, \nhas more safety procedures attached to it, and so that we have a new \nprocess for prevention in place for all facilities in this country and \nin foreign countries, and so we can raise the bar and say to our \nfamilies that you can have more assurance in the future that the food \nyou buy, whether it is the fresh fruits you buy in the middle of \nwinter, shipped from Chile, Argentina, or Mexico, or Guatemala, or the \nfresh fruits you get in the summertime from California, Washington \nState, and Canada, or the produce, the lettuce, the bagged spinach, or \nwhatever it might be, will be more safe for you and your family. That \nis what this is all about--protecting our families and making sure our \nfood safety laws are adequate for the 21st century and not the 18th \ncentury.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7921-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7921-S7923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the United States has one of the best food \nsafety systems in the world. However, even the best of systems have \nroom for improvement. That is why my colleagues and I worked together \nover the past year to produce a bill that has broad bipartisan support. \nFood safety is not a partisan issue. We all want the safest food supply \npossible and the Food Safety Modernization Act makes significant \nimprovements in that direction.\n  This is not a perfect bill. If it were solely up to me, there are \nseveral provisions that I would have done differently. However, this \nbill provides real improvements for our food system by placing a \ngreater emphasis on prevention and targeting government involvement to \nthe areas of greatest need.\n  The American food industry is made up of hundreds of thousands of \nprocessors, distributers, and retailers of all sizes, both foreign and \ndomestic. When you say ``food industry'' many think of the Nations \nlargest food processors that carry the brand names with which we are \nfamiliar.\n  In truth, ``industry'' also consists of tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses across the country. It also includes over 2 million farmers, \nboth large and small, in the United States that provide the food that \nwe consume at our tables. This bill recognizes the diversity of all \nthese individuals and organizations and protects their ability to \ncontinue to grow safe food for our families.\n  The bill also recognizes the vital role played by State and local \nofficials. Our State officials are on the front lines when it comes to \nresponding to food safety concerns and this bill makes sure that they \nwill have the resources they need to do their jobs. Specifically, the \nbill provides training and education of State, local, and tribal \nauthorities to facilitate the implementation of new standards under the \nlaw.\n  My colleagues, including Senators Harkin, Gregg, Durbin, Burr and \nDodd, have recognized all these challenges in this process and have \nworked together to prepare a bill that makes improvements to all \naspects of our food system.\n  I am particularly pleased with the efforts the group has made in the \nmanagers' package that focus on providing flexibility for small and \nvery small food processors. This bill provides small processors \nadditional time to comply with new food safety practices and \nguidelines. The bill also requires the FDA to publish user-friendly \nsmall entity compliance guides to assist firms with the implementation \nof new practices. This way, small businesses in the food system, know \nexactly how to plan to adopt any new practices that could apply to \nthem.\n  This bill also protects farms. Farmers remain exempt from \nregistration under the Bioterrorism Act and any new produce safety \nstandards must consider the unique practices that farmers use to grow \nor market their food. This includes consideration for farmers that use \nspecific conservation practices or grow organic foods under the Organic \nFoods Production Act.\n  Small entities that produce food for their own consumption or market \ndirectly to consumers are also not subject to registration under this \nbill. This ensures that individuals can continue to provide food to \ntheir communities through farmers markets, bake\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\nsales, public events and organizational fundraisers. Some have confused \nthis bill with provisions in other food related bills and it is not \ntrue that S. 510 regulates backyard gardens or potluck dinners. All \nacross Wyoming, people grow their own food and contribute dishes to \norganizational fundraisers and this bill continues the practice of \nmaking sure those individuals aren't subject to federal regulation.\n  However, if the amendment tree is filled so amendments cannot be \nsubmitted, I will likely oppose any further cloture.\n  I want to again recognize and thank my colleagues who have worked on \nthis bill. I look forward to considering this bill on the floor and \nappreciate those Members that have helped make this bill a bipartisan \neffort.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased that through the leadership \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--HELP--Committee, S. \n510--the Food and Drug Administration--FDA--Food Safety Modernization \nAct--Food Safety Act--will be taken up on the floor of the Senate. I \nbelieve that consideration of the Food Safety Act represents positive \nsteps toward better protections for the safety of the American people.\n  I am also pleased that a few of the provisions from my Commercial \nSeafood Consumer Protection Act--Seafood Safety Act--that I introduced \non September 29, 2010, have been incorporated into S. 510. I am, \nhowever, disappointed that more of the Seafood Safety Act could not be \nincluded, and will continue to work on passage of the full bill.\n  The Seafood Safety Act will strengthen the partnership between the \nSecretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nthe Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, the Federal \nTrade Commission, FTC, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to \ncoordinate Federal activities for ensuring that commercially \ndistributed seafood in the United States meets the food quality and \nsafety requirements of Federal law. The bill provides for no new \njurisdiction and does not alter any existing jurisdiction given to FDA \nor any other agency. The bill does not include any authorization of \nappropriations, but seeks only to strengthen existing partnerships and \nshare information.\n  The bill remains largely unchanged since I introduced it in the 110th \nCongress, but this version incorporates the FTC as an additional \npartner since they have broad existing authority for consumer and \ninter-state commerce fraud issues.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the Secretaries of Commerce, HHS, \nDHS, and the FTC to enter into agreements as necessary to strengthen \ncooperation on seafood safety, seafood labeling, and seafood fraud. \nThose agreements must address seafood testing and inspection; data \nstandardization for seafood names; data coordination for the purposes \nof detection and prosecution of violations regarding importation, \nexportation, transportation, sale, harvest, or trade of seafood; \nseafood labeling compliance assurance; and information-sharing for \nobserved noncompliance. The bill also increases the number of \nlaboratories certified to inspection standards of the FDA and allows \nthe Secretary of Commerce to increase the number and capacity of NOAA \nlaboratories responsible for seafood safety testing. It allows for an \nincrease in the percentage of seafood import shipments tested and \ninspected to improve detection of violations. Finally, the bill allows \nthe Secretary of HHS to refuse entry of seafood imports from countries \nwith known violations, and also allows the Secretary to permit \nindividual seafood shipments from recognized and properly certified \nexporters.\n  Again, I am grateful for the leadership shown by the HELP Committee \nand Chairman Harkin on S. 510, yet I remain committed to the Seafood \nSafety Act and look forward to continuing to work to ensure its \npassage.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my mixed emotions \non S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\n  With past recalls on spinach, peppers, cookie dough, peanuts and \npeanut products, there appears to be an increase in the frequency of \nfoodborne outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC, estimates that foodborne disease cause approximately 76 million \nillnesses in the U.S. each year, including an estimated 325,000 \nhospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. These statistics are strong evidence \nthat our current food safety laws and regulations are antiquated and \nshould be updated.\n  We live in a global food economy, but our Nation's current food \nsafety laws and regulations are geared predominately to a local and \ndomestic market. As a result, there are new safety challenges that have \nrisen from this global market that must be addressed.\n  As the former chairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP \nCommittee--it was then known as the Senate Labor Committee--I have a \nlittle history on this issue. As chairman of the committee, I \nintroduced the Food Safety Amendments with the intent of ensuring a \nsafer food supply, similar to the goal of the legislation before the \nSenate today.\n  I would like to point out that S. 510 is one of the few bipartisan \npieces of legislation currently in the Senate. We had Republicans and \nDemocrats working across the aisle to come up with solid policies to \naddress some of the major gaps in our current food safety system. And \nas we deliberated these policies, it was important to me to protect \nexisting laws that already have solid consumer protections. One of \nthose laws is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.\n  Briefly, DSHEA clarified the regulatory structure of supplements to \nensure that individuals would continue to have access to safe \nsupplements and information about their use. Under DSHEA, Congress set \nout a legal definition of what could be marketed as a dietary \nsupplement.\n  We created a safety standard that products have to meet. We allowed \nthe FDA to develop good manufacturing process standards for \nsupplements. We clarified which claims could be made about these \nproducts and we said those statements must be truthful and not \nmisleading.\n  Furthermore, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer \nProtection Act of 2006 created a mandatory adverse event reporting, \nAER, system for dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. My \nfriend and chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, Tom Harkin, and I \nworked on this law very closely with Senator Mike Enzi, who was \nchairman of the HELP Committee at the time, the late Senator Ted \nKennedy, who was the ranking member of the HELP Committee at the time, \nand Senator Dick Durbin on this important legislation. Our legislation \ncreated a system to provide the government with information about \nserious adverse events associated with dietary supplements and over-\nthe-counter drugs. It provides Federal authorities with a better and \nmore effective tool to become aware and to respond to any problems that \nmight occur.\n  I am grateful and appreciative to the sponsors of the bill for \nincluding provisions to preserve the DSHEA and AER laws' consumer \nprotections as part of S. 510.\n  In addition, I have heard from many of my constituents that they are \nconcerned with the international harmonization provisions in this bill \nand its impact on the availability and affordability of dietary \nsupplements--in particular, the Codex Commission which is an \ninternational organization that provides guidelines for food safety. \nRest assured that the Commission's guidelines on vitamin and mineral \nfood supplements will not affect the regulation of dietary supplements \nin the United States unless Congress decides to adopt the provisions.\n  Another issue I want to mention is the importance of promoting small \nbusinesses. Without a doubt, small businesses are the engine for \neconomic growth in America and represent a powerful vehicle for \nopportunity. Small businesses contribute greatly to Utah's economy, and \nI am committed to doing all I can to promote job creation, grow our \neconomy, and ensure America's businesses are competitive in the global \nmarketplace.\n  So I am pleased that S. 510 considers the needs of small businesses. \nIt accomplishes this by requiring the FDA to publish user-friendly \nguidance to assist firms with the implementation and compliance of new \npractices. It also\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\ngives small food facilities additional time to comply with the new food \nsafety practices and guidelines. In addition, the legislation also \nrequires the FDA to coordinate its outreach activities with the \nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, in order to educate and train growers and small food \nfacilities about the new requirements from this bill.\n  Finally, I wanted to address concerns raised by the Utah farming \ncommunity, particularly small farmers. First, this bill preserves the \ncurrent jurisdictional separation between the USDA and the FDA. In \nother words, this bill does not change those who are currently subject \nto USDA regulation versus those who are subject to FDA regulation under \nthe existing laws. Second, this bill does not change the existing \ndefinition of a facility currently required to register with the FDA. \nThis means that farms that are currently exempt from registering with \nthe FDA under the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 continue to remain exempt. \nFinally, small entities that produce food for their own consumption or \nmarket directly to consumers or restaurants are not subject to \nregistration or the new recordkeeping requirements under this bill. \nThis includes food sold through farmers' markets, personal or backyard \ngardens, bake sales, public events and organizational fundraisers.\n  Unfortunately with all those great provisions that I just mentioned, \nthere is still one major concern that I cannot overlook, the cost of \nthe bill. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has estimated that the \nlegislation will cost $1.4 billion over 5 years. We need to rein in the \nout-of-control government spending, especially in today's fiscal \nenvironment. We simply cannot continue to drive up the national debt. \nWe cannot sustain trillion-dollar deficits. More government spending \nwill push the Nation over a precipice from which we may not be able to \nrecover.\n  Even though this spending is discretionary, it troubles me that if \nfuture appropriations are not sufficient to cover the cost of the bill, \nCongress would be unintentionally giving the FDA an unfunded mandate. \nIf this happens, the FDA would either simply not be able to live up to \nits new responsibilities or would be forced to shift funds from other \nimportant and already strapped agency programs like the regulation of \nprescription drugs, medical devices, and/or biologics. The latter could \ncause significant harm to the American public. So it is with deep \nregret that I cannot support S. 510 without it being paid for. However, \nI am committed to working with my Senate colleagues to find ways to \noffset the cost of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to briefly draw attention to a \nresolution that the conference of Republican Senators and Senators-\nelect adopted yesterday, one that I think fits the times we are living \nin, one which has seen historic levels of Federal spending and debt and \ndeficits, as well as unsustainable debt that will be inherited by our \nchildren and grandchildren, unless we take responsibility for it.\n  This resolution, I think, would demonstrate the seriousness that we \nwould have as a Congress to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. \nThis resolution reads:\n\n       It is Resolved by the United States Senate Republican \n     conference:\n       That a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution is necessary to restore fiscal discipline to our \n     Republic;\n       That a Balanced Budget Amendment should require the \n     President to submit to Congress a proposed budget prior to \n     each fiscal year in which total federal spending does not \n     exceed total federal revenue;\n       That a Balanced Budget Amendment should include a \n     requirement that a supermajority of both houses of Congress \n     be necessary to increase taxes;\n       That a Balanced Budget Amendment should include a \n     limitation on total federal spending.\n\n  I thank the 20 Republican Senators and Senators-elect who cosponsored \nthis resolution and the members of the conference who voted to adopt \nit. Let me share with you a few factoids that I think will demonstrate \nthe compelling nature of this joint resolution and constitutional \namendment.\n  In fiscal year 2010, our deficit was $1.3 trillion or 8.9 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. That is actually down from 9.9 percent in \nfiscal year 2009, but certainly nothing to celebrate. The Congressional \nBudget Office baseline estimates that Federal deficits will average \n$605 billion each year through 2020, and the budget that the President \nsubmitted to us this year, itself, if implemented, would call for an \naverage of $1 trillion of deficit each year for the next 10 years.\n  We know that the Budget Act passed by Congress, signed by the \nPresident, requires the President of the United States to submit his \nbudget by the first Monday in February. I can tell you that I am \nanxiously awaiting to see in that budget proposal submitted by the \nPresident by the first Monday in February his commitment to fiscal \ndiscipline--now particularly since the American people have spoken so \nloudly and clearly about their concerns over reckless spending and \nendless debt.\n  We know a balanced budget amendment actually works, because virtually \nevery State in the Nation has one, including my State of Texas. Only \nthe Federal Government has no requirement of a balanced budget and can \nspend huge deficits and borrow money it does not have. No family in \nAmerica, or small business, when income goes down, can continue to \nspend at the same level. They have to live within their means. So \nshould the U.S. Government.\n  We also know that a balanced budget amendment is popular with the \npublic. A recent referendum held by Florida voters showed that 71 \npercent approved a nonbinding resolution supporting a balanced budget \namendment. We have had votes in the Senate on this not that long ago. I \nbelieve it was in 1997, so I will let you judge whether it was long \nago. Sixty-six Senators at the time voted in favor of a balanced budget \namendment or 1 shy of the two-thirds necessary, including 11 colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, demonstrating the bipartisan support \nfor a balanced budget amendment.\n  It is important to note that at that time, when 66 Senators voted on \na bipartisan basis for a balanced budget amendment, the deficit was \nonly 1.4 percent of GDP. Today, it is 8.9 percent. I think if a \nbalanced budget amendment was a good idea--at least in the minds of 66 \nSenators--in 1997, it is even a better idea today. So I hope colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will join with me to offer ideas on drafting \nthis joint resolution.\n  Of course, as you know, under Article V of the Constitution of the \nUnited States, a constitutional amendment can emanate from Congress \nitself with a two-thirds vote or it can be the result of a \nconstitutional convention. Under either circumstance, three-quarters of \nthe States would be necessary to ratify it. I think if Republicans and \nDemocrats can listen to the voice of the American people and get behind \na joint resolution, it will restore some of the public's lost \nconfidence in our ability and our willingness both to heed their voice \nand also live up to our responsibility.\n  I think a balanced budget amendment would be a big step forward in \nthe cause of fiscal discipline but, of course, not the only step. As \nthe cochairs of the President's debt commission have already indicated, \nwe need other measures. One that caught my eye they called a ``cut and \ninvest committee,'' charged with trimming waste and targeting \ninvestment. They noticed a good example at the State level, in my State \nof Texas, where we have a sunset commission that requires, every 10 \nyears, every State agency to go through a process to determine whether \nthe programs and the agency itself continue to have good reason to \nexist at the spending levels authorized.\n  We need something such as that, which will provide a tremendous \nability for us to have additional tools to contain costs and avoid \nwasteful spending. To that end, I have put forth a model of the bill of \nthe Texas sunset commission, called the United States Authorization and \nSunset Commission Act. I urge my colleagues to take a look at that, and \nI can assure you that, come January, when we have a new Congress, I \nwill offer that legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7924-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7924-S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAYCHECK FAIRNESS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on paycheck fairness, a \nbill on which we will be voting on cloture. The paycheck fairness bill \npicks up where the famous Lilly Ledbetter bill left off. I was so proud \nto lead the fight on the Senate floor 2 years ago, under a new Congress \nand a new President, to ensure that we righted the wrong of a Supreme \nCourt decision, where Lilly Ledbetter, on behalf of American women \neverywhere, would be assured that she could get equal pay for equal or \ncomparable work. The Congress responded well and that legislation is \nnow the law of the land.\n  The paycheck fairness bill picks up where Ledbetter left off, because \nLedbetter left the courthouse door open to sue for discrimination. \nPaycheck fairness makes it more difficult to discriminate in the first \nplace; it increases penalties for discrimination; prohibits employer \nretaliation for sharing pay information; it closes the loophole that \nallows for a broad defense in equal pay cases.\n  Let me go through this one by one. It improves remedies where \ndiscrimination has occurred. Current law now says that women can only \nsue for back pay and fixed damages. The paycheck fairness bill would \nallow women to get additional compensatory damage, which makes up for \nthe injury or harm suffered based on discrimination. Ledbetter had no \nprovisions regarding that. Also, so crucial is that it prohibits \nemployer retaliation--and, wow, does this go on in the workplace.\n  Under current law, employers can sue or actually punish employees for \nsharing salary statements and information with coworkers. This is \nusually the way employees find out that they are being discriminated \nagainst. In the famous Supreme Court hearing, some of our Supreme Court \nJustices, who bragged that they don't know what a BlackBerry is, gave \nwomen the raspberries when they said women should know they are being \ndiscriminated against, but you cannot even talk at the water cooler, or \ndown in the office gym, and say: I get paid this; what are you getting \npaid for the same job?\n  What paycheck fairness will now do is prohibit employers from taking \naction against employees who simply share information about what they \nare getting paid. This was not included in the Ledbetter Act. It \nclarifies that any factor other than a sex offense--right now, an \nemployer can assert a defense that the pay differential is based on a \nfactor other than sex. Courts can interpret this broadly, and a number \nof factors are limited. What the paycheck fairness bill does is tighten \nthat loophole by requiring that the differential is truly caused by \nsomething other than sex or gender or is related to job performance \nthat is necessary for the business. Ledbetter did not address that \nloophole. By the way, I know that the specter of small business is \nalways raised, but I say to my colleagues that small businesses with \nrevenue of less than $500,000 are exempt from the Equal Pay Act. That \nmeans that paycheck fairness maintains that exemption. That is how it \ntakes Ledbetter one step farther. It gives women the tools to begin to \nknow what they are being paid--or people of ethnic minorities, et \ncetera.\n  Why is this important? First, it is fundamental fairness. You ought \nto be paid equal pay for equal or comparable work. It is fundamentally \nfair. If the same people are doing the job with the same skills and \nbackground, they ought to get the same pay. It affects a family's \npaycheck; it affects their pension; it affects their whole way of life. \nRight now, equal pay is actually critical to economic recovery. It is \none of the ways that we can make sure the family checkbook is increased \nbased on merit.\n\n  Some people say: Oh, well, why do you need another bill, Senator \nBarb? Women already have enough tools to fight discrimination. Well, we \nhaven't fixed everything. And here, I think this bill is simple and \nachievable with the small business exemption that will do that.\n  When the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, women earned merely 59 \ncents on every dollar earned by men. We have made progress. In 47 \nyears, we have now come up to 77 cents for every dollar that men make. \nIt only took us 43 years to get an 18-cent increase. Well, I think \ntimes are changing. Women are now more in the workplace, and women are \nnow often the sole or primary source of income. Creating a wage gap is \nnot the way to improve the health of a family or the health of our \ncommunity.\n  I could go through a lot of statistics about what that means, but I \nsimply want to say to my colleagues that with many Americans already \nearning less, we need to make sure that the family budget is based on \npeople being able to get paid for what they do and to make work worth \nit and make wage compensation fair.\n  I think the facts speak for themselves as to why this bill is \nnecessary. I think the bill itself is a very specific, achievable, \nnarrowly drawn bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Paycheck \nFairness Act, a critically important bill to guarantee women equal pay \nfor equal work. I am proud to lead the effort in the Senate to pass \nthis legislation, which my dear friend and colleague Rosa DeLauro has \nalready shepherded through the House of Representatives.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering this commonsense \nlegislation and am grateful to the majority leader for his strong \nsupport and his recognition of how important this bill is to American \nfamilies.\n  Americans must be assured of equity in the workplace. Unfortunately, \nthe fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work has yet to be \nrealized in this country. In my view, it is high time that Congress \nstep in to remedy this injustice.\n  Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act over 40 years ago, which was \nintended to ensure that women are paid the same as their male \ncounterparts, a large wage gap still persists. Women are paid, on \naverage, just 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. To put it \nanother way, the pay gap means that the average woman is paid more than \n$10,000 less per year than she deserves. The gap is even larger in the \nAfrican American and Hispanic communities, with black women earning 70 \ncents and Hispanic women earning merely 67 cents for every dollar a man \nearns. In my view, it is an outrage that in the year 2010 we are still \nnot treating women as equals in the workplace.\n  Even a college education doesn't suffice to correct this inequality. \nIn my home State of Connecticut, the median wage for a woman with a \nbachelor's degree is $55,000--which puts her on par with a man who only \nhas a high school diploma. This wage gap means that, cumulatively, a \nworking woman will be shortchanged by $400,000 to $2 million over her \nlifetime in lost wages, pensions, and Social Security benefits.\n  Now, some will argue that the wage gap is a product of the choices \nwomen make, such as what they study in college, what field they pursue \ncareers in, and whether to take time off to raise their children. But \nstudy after study has corrected for every possible variable, and still \nhas found that only part of the wage gap can be explained by measurable \nfactors. The rest of the gap is a result of discrimination in the \nworkplace. One study compared men and women who had pursued the same \nmajors, attended equally good schools, and were entering the same \nindustry, and found that women are already paid less than these \nidentically qualified men just one year out of college.\n  This is not just a matter of fairness but of economic necessity. \nEvery dollar that women are shortchanged means a dollar less spent in \nher community, to take care of her family. The problem is particularly \nacute during the current economic recession, in which women are \nincreasingly the primary or sole breadwinners for their families. Since \nthe recession began, approximately 70 percent of jobs lost were jobs \nthat had been held by men. In the typical married-couple family, this \ntranslates into forcing the family to survive on just 42 percent of its \nformer income. This means families have less money to spend on \neverything--groceries, going out to eat, new school clothes, home and \ncar repairs--all of which means less money going into our local \neconomies. Paying women fairly is not just the right thing to do, it is \nalso an immediate economic boost.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would finally give women tools strong \nenough\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nto end wage discrimination. It provides a long-overdue update to the \nEqual Pay Act, which has not been amended since it was signed into law \nby President Kennedy in 1963. I would add to my colleagues who may be \nundecided on whether to support the upcoming cloture vote--it has been \nforty-seven years since the Equal Pay Act was enacted. If we fail to \npass this critically important legislation now, there may not be \nanother opportunity to do so for a decade or more.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act improves on the Equal Pay Act by toughening \npenalties for pay discrimination. It puts gender-based discrimination \non equal footing with discrimination based on race or ethnicity by \nallowing women to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. It closes \na significant loophole in the Equal Pay Act that for too long has \nallowed to justify unequal pay without a legitimate business need. It \nprohibits employers from punishing whistleblowers. Furthermore, it will \nrequire better data collection by the Department of Labor and Equal \nOpportunity Commission and set up training programs to help women learn \nmore effective salary negotiation skills.\n  To continue our economic recovery, I believe that we must not only \nwork to create jobs. We must also ensure that those jobs are good jobs. \nMaking sure that all workers are confident that they are being treated \nand compensated fairly is critical to that goal.\n  This bill will ensure that workers are paid what they deserve and \nwill provide them with security and fairness in the workplace. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Paycheck \nFairness Act.\n  Progress for women in this country has not come easily or come \nquickly. There was a time when women were not allowed to vote or own \nproperty. In fact, our country once considered women to be the property \nof their fathers or husbands.\n  Over the years, women have fought gender barriers and broken down \nstereotypes, making great strides toward equity. Unfortunately, \ninequities still exist. While women have successfully broken through \nglass ceilings on careers across the employment spectrum, pay \ndiscrimination still remains.\n  Today, women make up half of the total workforce and nearly 4 in 10 \nmothers are the primary breadwinners of their household. Nearly two-\nthirds of mothers bring home at least a quarter of the household \nearnings. In these hard economic times, when women's wages put food on \nthe table, keep the lights on and put gas in the car, pay inequities \nshould not be tolerated.\n  In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in an effort to end pay \ndiscrimination. Despite the good faith effort of this legislation, \nlegal loopholes exist that have weakened the intent and goal of the \nlaw. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the core \nprinciples in the Equal Pay Act. It will close loopholes in the \noriginal legislation; level the playing field for employers, so the \nemployers paying fair wages are not disadvantaged; and will shine a \nlight on pay discrimination occurring throughout our country.\n  According to the Census Bureau, although women between the ages of 25 \nand 29 possess a higher percentage of bachelor degrees than men in the \nsame age group, women consistently earn less than men at every level of \neducation attainment. In 2009, women working full time, year around \nwere paid 77 cents for every dollar paid to men on average. This gap is \nworse for minorities. African-American women were paid 62 cents and \nLatino women are paid only 53 cents for every dollar a man makes.\n  In fact, women earn less on the dollar than men as their level of \neducation increases. A study completed by the American Association of \nUniversity Women found that female graduates working full time earn \nonly 80 as much as their male graduates. The study then looked ten \nyears after graduation to find women fall further behind, earning only \n69 as much as men. Overall women are paid less than their male \ncounterparts during their entire career.\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that there is no real gender pay \ngap and if there is one it's due to women's choices. Specifically, \nopponents assert that women earn less because they are more likely to \nchoose part-time work to accommodate a growing family. This is \nincorrect. Many studies demonstrate that the wage gap is real. \nAccording to a recent GAO study, so-called life choices do not explain \nthe persistent wage gap. Additionally, GAO found that even when all \nrelevant career and family attributes are taken into account, there is \nstill a significant unexplained gap in men's and women's earnings.\n  Additionally, opponents of the legislation assert that the Paycheck \nFairness Act will create increased litigation. This, too, is just \nwrong. The Equal Pay Act is not a strict liability statute and it sets \na very high burden for an employee to bring a claim. That burden will \nnot change with the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The \nlegislation will now require that the ``factor other than sex'' defense \navailable to employers is a bona fide, job related factor that must be \narticulated. This language mirrors other civil rights legislation \nprohibiting discrimination.\n  Finally, opponents assert that this legislation will hurt businesses \nand reduce job growth during these hard economic times. This is yet \nanother incorrect assertion. In fact, this legislation will help ensure \nthat women are paid fairly for equivalent work. In a nationwide survey \nof registered voters, 84 percent of voters said they supported ``a new \nlaw that would provide women with more tools to get fair pay in the \nworkplace.'' There is an overwhelming level of support for fair pay \nacross the political spectrum.\n  The goal of the Paycheck Fairness Act is simple: close the loopholes \nthat exist in current law to ensure that men and women are paid fairly \nand accurately in the workplace. No longer will an employer be able to \npay women and men different wages if they are doing the same or \nequivalent jobs. No longer will an employer be allowed to retaliate \nagainst employees for discussing their wages with other employees. No \nlonger will we allow pay discrimination to be tolerated.\n  As an original cosponsor of this bill, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and join our colleagues in the House by passing the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is nearing 2 years since we passed the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act protecting the principle of equal pay for \nequal work by allowing workers to pursue pay discrimination cases \nbeyond the arbitrary window established by the Supreme Court. \nUnfortunately, while the Lilly Ledbetter Act was an important step in \neliminating pay discrimination, a sizable pay gap remains between \nworking men and women.\n  The numbers are astounding. Nearly 50 years after the passage of the \nEqual Pay Act, a recent GAO report shows that managers who are women \nmake 81 cents to every dollar of their male counterparts. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau report, the gap grows even larger--77 cents to \nevery dollar--when looking at the entire working population.\n  In Illinois, for a median income household, that is a difference of \n$11,000 each year. This is a significant difference in compensation. \nImagine, for a family where the woman is the primary or only wage-\nearner how much difference $11,000 a year could make.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would help narrow this pay gap by amending \nthe Equal Pay Act to reduce discrimination in the workplace. It would \nbar retaliation against workers for disclosing wages, so that workers \ncan identify pay discrimination when it happens.\n  The bill would clarify what constitutes valid justification for pay \ndifferentials so that employers know what factors are lawful \nconsiderations. The law would clarify that gender difference alone is \nnot adequate pay differential must be based on legitimate, job-related \nrequirements. It would create incentives for good behavior by providing \ntechnical assistance and employer recognition awards.\n  Finally, the legislation would amend the Equal Pay Act to ensure that \nwomen facing discrimination have access to the same wage discrimination \nremedies as are available for racial or ethnic wage discrimination.\n  These commonsense solutions can help narrow the wage gap. Women \ncannot afford, quite literally, to wait for\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nthis legislation any longer. We cannot ignore that the gender wage gap \nis unacceptably large and shrinking much too slowly. We owe working \nwomen of America and their families--more. I look forward to casting my \nvote to proceed to the Paycheck Fairness Act and urge my colleague to \njoin me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7926-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOOD SAFETY\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the paycheck unfairness \nbill that is before us. A better title for this bill should be the \n``jobs for trial lawyers act.''\n  I am confident that there is no Member of this Senate who would \ntolerate paying a woman less for the same work simply because she is a \nwoman. As husbands, fathers, and mothers of working women, I believe we \nall recognize the gross inequity of discrimination in pay based on \ngender. Congress has put two laws on the books to combat such \ndiscrimination--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal \nPay Act of 1963. These are both good laws that have been well utilized \nto combat discrimination where it exists, and I support the full \nenforcement of these laws. Businesses that discriminate against a \nfemale employee because of her gender must be corrected and penalized.\n  But what the majority is trying to push through here today is of a \nvery different nature. The so-called Paycheck Fairness Act is actually \na ``jobs for trial lawyers act.'' The primary beneficiary of this \nlegislation will be trial lawyers. They will be able to bring bigger \nclass action lawsuits--which usually result in coupons for the people \nthat were disadvantaged--without even getting the consent of the \nplaintiffs, and they will have the weapon of uncapped damages to force \nemployers to settle lawsuits even when they know they have done nothing \nwrong. The litigation bonanza this bill would create would extend even \nto the smallest of small businesses, only further hampering our \neconomic recovery.\n  There are a number of other concerning provisions of this \nlegislation, such as authorizing government to require reporting of \nevery employer's wage data by sex, race, and national origin. Had this \nbill gone through committee markup under regular Senate order, we may \nhave been able to address some of these concerns. But this bill--like \nso many other labor bills in the HELP Committee jurisdiction of this \nCongress--has circumvented regular order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of letters from a total of 44 groups opposing this legislation \nand 4 newspaper op eds.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Groups Opposing PFA, 11/17/2010\n\n       1.

But while parts of the bill would be \n     useful, the measure as a whole is too broad a solution to a \n     complex, nuanced problem.\n       The bill is meant to address a troublesome wage gap between \n     women and men, which has decreased over time, but still \n     persists; today, most women earn roughly 77 cents for every \n     dollar earned by men in equivalent jobs. The reasons for this \n     discrepancy are under dispute, and the Paycheck Fairness Act \n     would take some steps to protect against blatant \n     discrimination. Most notably, it would bar businesses from \n     retaliating against employees who share information about \n     their salaries with their coworkers. The bill would also \n     provide funds to train businesses to improve their pay \n     practices and train women to negotiate their salaries more \n     effectively.\n       But the controversial meat of the bill is the changes it \n     would make to the legal process, amending the Equal Pay Act \n     of 1963. Where women today can only sue for back pay, the new \n     bill would allow them to seek both compensatory damages and \n     unlimited punitive damages. The bill would also make it \n     easier for workers to join class-action suits. Most \n     problematically, it would alter the burden on businesses, \n     requiring them to prove that any difference in pay is the \n     result of a business necessity, and to demonstrate why they \n     didn't adopt a plaintiff's suggested ``alternative remedy'' \n     that wouldn't result in a pay gap.\n       But what if a company offers a higher salary for retail \n     workers in a more dangerous location, and more men sign up? \n     What if a male worker leverages a job offer into a higher \n     salary? Should these be illegal acts? The bill would create \n     too strong a presumption in favor of discrimination over \n     other, equally plausible explanations for disparities in \n     salaries. In addition, the threat of much higher damage \n     awards by juries might lead businesses to make quick \n     settlements for frivolous claims. (Today, about 60 percent of \n     discrimination claims tracked by the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission are found to have no merit.)\n       Proponents of the bill note that today's penalties for wage \n     discrimination are so anemic that there's no incentive for \n     businesses that discriminate to change their ways. A narrower \n     bill that would stiffen some penalties and ban retaliation \n     would be helpful. But companies are right to be concerned \n     that this bill, as written, is too deep an intrusion.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 12, 2010]\n\n                           Paycheck Fairness?\n\n       Equal pay for equal work stands as a cornerstone of the \n     American workplace, and we support the principle \n     wholeheartedly. But Congress is moving toward a fix that \n     would be grossly intrusive on decision-making by private \n     businesses.\n       At least one group would get a fatter paycheck from the \n     Paycheck Fairness Act: trial lawyers.\n       The proposed law says that in cases where a pay disparity \n     between men and women is challenged in court, an employer \n     would have to prove there is some reason for the gap other \n     than discrimination. The employer would also have to prove \n     that the gap serves a necessary business purpose. And even \n     then, the employer could be in trouble if a court determines \n     that an ``alternative employment practice'' would serve the \n     same purpose without skewing the salaries.\n       Those judgment calls go by another name: management \n     decisions. The legislation would open businesses to wide \n     second-guessing of decisions they made to hire and promote \n     the most effective work force in a competitive environment. \n     It would leave businesses with one eye on the competition and \n     one eye on what a judge might decide in\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n     hindsight is a preferable ``alternative employment \n     practice.''\n       Uncle Sam to the nation's employers: We'll tell you how to \n     run your business.\n       Imagine a company that pays more to workers with greater \n     experience. If women haven't been on the job as long as men, \n     they would likely earn less. The burden would be on the \n     employer to prove that experience not only yielded a \n     measurably better quantity and quality of work, but also that \n     it was the best yardstick to use. ``How are you going to \n     prove that?'' asks Camille Olson, an attorney at Chicago's \n     Seyfarth Shaw LLC who has testified against the legislation \n     on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``It would be \n     very, very difficult.''\n       Making matters worse, under the new law, damage awards \n     would be uncapped, and class-action procedures loosened. \n     Bring on the trial lawyers.\n       The nation already has strong legal protections for women \n     in the workplace, even for cases of unintentional \n     discrimination. Under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, employers \n     can justify wage differentials only if they're based on \n     gender-neutral factors, such as education, experience, \n     productivity and market conditions.\n       This bill has its heart in the right place. It even has \n     some worthwhile, less-intrusive provisions, such as \n     protection from company retaliation for workers who share \n     information about wages.\n       It has been approved by the House and is slated to reach \n     the Senate floor next week. It is a high priority for the \n     Obama administration. But it is much too intrusive, and the \n     Senate should reject it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 21, 2010]\n\n                    Fair Pay Isn't Always Equal Pay\n\n                      (By Christina Hoff Sommers)\n\n       Among the top items left on the Senate's to-do list before \n     the November elections is a ``paycheck fairness'' bill, which \n     would make it easier for women to file class-action, \n     punitive-damages suits against employers they accuse of sex-\n     based pay discrimination.\n       The bill's passage is hardly certain, but it has received \n     strong support from women's rights groups, professional \n     organizations and even President Obama, who has called it ``a \n     common-sense bill.''\n       But the bill isn't as commonsensical as it might seem. It \n     overlooks mountains of research showing that discrimination \n     plays little role in pay disparities between men and women, \n     and it threatens to impose onerous requirements on employers \n     to correct gaps over which they have little control.\n       The bill is based on the premise that the 1963 Equal Pay \n     Act, which bans sex discrimination in the workplace, has \n     failed; for proof, proponents point out that for every dollar \n     men earn, women earn just 77 cents.\n       But that wage gap isn't necessarily the result of \n     discrimination. On the contrary, there are lots of other \n     reasons men might earn more than women, including differences \n     in education, experience and job tenure.\n       When these factors are taken into account the gap narrows \n     considerably--in some studies, to the point of vanishing. A \n     recent survey found that young, childless, single urban women \n     earn 8 percent more than their male counterparts, mostly \n     because more of them earn college degrees.\n       Moreover, a 2009 analysis of wage-gap studies commissioned \n     by the Labor Department evaluated more than 5o peer-reviewed \n     papers and concluded that the aggregate wage gap ``may be \n     almost entirely the result of the individual choices being \n     made by both male and female workers.''\n       In addition to differences in education and training, the \n     review found that women are more likely than men to leave the \n     workforce to take care of children or older parents. They \n     also tend to value family-friendly workplace policies more \n     than men, and will often accept lower salaries in exchange \n     for more benefits. In fact, there were so many differences in \n     pay-related choices that the researchers were unable to \n     specify a residual effect due to discrimination.\n       Some of the bill's supporters admit that the pay gap is \n     largely explained by women's choices, but they argue that \n     those choices are skewed by sexist stereotypes and social \n     pressures. Those are interesting and important points, worthy \n     of continued public debate.\n       The problem is that while the debate proceeds, the bill \n     assumes the answer: it would hold employers liable for the \n     ``lingering effects of past discrimination''--``pay \n     disparities'' that have been ``spread and perpetuated through \n     commerce.'' Under the bill, it's not enough for an employer \n     to guard against intentional discrimination; it also has to \n     police potentially discriminatory assumptions behind market-\n     driven wage disparities that have nothing to do with sexism.\n       Universities, for example, typically pay professors in \n     their business schools more than they pay those in the school \n     of social work, citing market forces as the justification. \n     But according to the gender theory that informs this bill, \n     sexist attitudes led society to place a higher value on male-\n     centered fields like business than on female-centered fields \n     like social work.\n       The bill's language regarding these ``lingering effects'' \n     is vague, but that's the problem: it could prove a legal \n     nightmare for even the best-intentioned employers. The theory \n     will be elaborated in feminist expert testimony when cases go \n     to trial, and it's not hard to imagine a media firestorm \n     developing from it. Faced with multimillion-dollar lawsuits \n     and the attendant publicity, many innocent employers would \n     choose to settle.\n       The Paycheck Fairness bill would set women against men, \n     empower trial lawyers and activists, perpetuate falsehoods \n     about the status of women in the workplace and create havoc \n     in a precarious job market. It is 1970s-style gender-war \n     feminism for a society that should be celebrating its success \n     in substantially, if not yet completely, overcoming sex-based \n     workplace discrimination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2010]\n\n          Paycheck Fairness Act: A Flawed Approach to Job Bias\n\n       There should be no tolerance for gender-based \n     discrimination in the workplace, and the Paycheck Fairness \n     Act contains sensible provisions on the issue, including \n     protections against retaliation for employees who challenge \n     pay schedules. But the proposal, which builds on the existing \n     Equal Pay Act, would allow employees and courts to intrude \n     too far into core business decisions.\n       The bill, which is pending in the Senate, would allow \n     employers to defend against equal-pay lawsuits by proving \n     that pay disparities between men and women were based on \n     ``bona fide'' factors, such as experience or education, and \n     that these factors are ``consistent with business \n     necessity.'' This provision would codify the current state of \n     the law as developed in the courts over the past 30 years. \n     During that time, judges pressed employers to prove the need \n     for educational requirements that had no nexus to advertised \n     jobs. Such requirements were often used to deny employment to \n     minority applicants.\n       But the bill does not stop there. It also mandates that the \n     business necessity defense ``shall not apply'' when the \n     employee ``demonstrates that an alternative employment \n     practice exists that would serve the same business purpose \n     without producing such differential and that the employer has \n     refused to adopt such alternative practice.'' But what if the \n     employer has refused because it has concluded that the \n     alternative is--contrary to the employee's assertion--more \n     costly or less efficient? What if the employee and employer \n     disagree on what the business purpose is or should be?\n       This approach also could make employers vulnerable to \n     attack for responding to market forces. Take an employer who \n     gives a hefty raise to a valued male employee who has gotten \n     a job offer from a competitor. Would a court agree that the \n     raise advanced a legitimate business purpose or could the \n     employer be slammed unless he also bumps up the salary of a \n     similarly situated female employee?\n       Discrimination is abhorrent, but the Paycheck Fairness Act \n     is not the right fix.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the newspaper articles I have submitted for \nthe Record were written by the editorial boards of the Boston Globe, \nthe Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post, while the other op ed, \nwritten by a guest columnist, appeared in the New York Times. I don't \nthink any of these would be considered to be conservative newspapers, \nbut they have taken a strong stand in the same direction and position \nthat I have been speaking here.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation will insert the Federal \nGovernment into workplace management decisions like never before. This \nintrusion will benefit trial lawyers and harm job growth and \nemployment, which will affect both women and men.\n  Supporters of this bill cite wage data that the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics itself says ``do not control for many factors that can be \nsignificant in explaining earning differences.'' In fact, studies show \nthat if you factor in observable choices, such as part-time work, \nseniority, and occupational choice, the pay gap stands between 5 to 7 \npercent. Let me repeat: Part-time work, seniority, and occupational \nchoice reduces the pay gap to between 5 and 7 percent. Some of these \nchoices are certainly personal prerogatives, and I would not question \nthe choices anyone makes with regard to family obligations or job \nsecurity and the quality of fringe benefits, such as health, \nretirement, and child care. But to a large extent, this remaining gap \nis due to occupational choice.\n  It is unfortunate that this Congress has not done more to foster a \njob growth environment and improve job training programs, such as the \nWorkforce Investment Act, which could train 100,000 people to be hired \nin skilled jobs--sometimes in the nontraditional roles. So instead of \nbeing a waitress, they might be a brick mason. We have heard that \nexample in hearings. Such training under the Workforce Investment Act \nproduces significantly higher wages, and that would prepare more women \nto enter higher earning occupational fields. Surely this would be a \nmore reasonable solution\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nthan a trial lawyer bonanza sure to disadvantage all employers and \ndepress job growth to the disadvantage of all employees, which results \nin disadvantaged employees getting coupons while the trial lawyers keep \nmost of the money.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this cloture vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time during the quorum be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 58, the nays are \n41. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that the Paycheck \nFairness Act was filibustered today.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act passed the House on January 9, 2009, by a \nvote of 256-163 and Senate passage is long overdue.\n  This critical legislation will strengthen the Equal Pay Act and close \nthe loopholes that have allowed employers to avoid responsibility for \ndiscriminatory pay.\n  Although the wage gap between men and women has narrowed since the \npassage of the landmark Equal Pay Act in 1963, gender-based wage \ndiscrimination remains a problem for women in the workforce.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women only make 77 cents for \nevery dollar earned by a man. The Institute of Women's Policy Research \nfound that this wage disparity will cost women anywhere from $400,000 \nto $2 million over a lifetime in lost wages. Today an average college-\neducated woman working full time earns as much as $15,000 less than a \ncollege-educated male. Working families lose $200 billion in income per \nyear due to the wage gap between men and women.\n  Pay discrimination is hurting our middle class families and hurting \nour economy. Loopholes created by the courts and weak sanctions in the \nlaw have allowed many employers to avoid liability for engaging in \ngender-based pay discrimination.\n  That is why the Paycheck Fairness Act is so important.\n  The bill closes loopholes that have allowed employers to justify pay \ndiscrimination and prohibits employers from retaliating against \nemployees who share salary information with their co-workers. It puts \ngender-based discrimination sanctions on equal footing with other forms \nof wage discrimination--such as race, disability or age--by allowing \nwomen to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. And it also \nrequires the Department of Labor to enhance outreach and training \nefforts to work with employers in order to eliminate pay disparities.\n  One of the 111th Congress's most important achievements was passing \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Restoration Act. That legislation, which \nis now law, ensures that women who have been the victims of pay \ndiscrimination get their day in court and can challenge employers that \nwillingly pay them less for the same work.\n  The Equal Pay Restoration Act honors the legacy of Lilly Ledbetter, a \nsupervisor at a Goodyear Tire Plant in Alabama, who after 19 years of \nservice discovered she had earned 20 to 40 percent less than her male \ncounterparts for doing the exact same job.\n  Today we had another important opportunity to honor the legacy of \nwomen like Lilly Ledbetter by passing this legislation.\n  But instead of standing up for equal economic opportunity for women, \nRepublicans said no, and filibustered this important bill.\n  I am very disappointed by this outcome, but I want my colleagues to \nknow that we will not give up this fight.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment in the failure of the Senate to invoke cloture on the \nPaycheck Fairness Act. After our triumph 2 years ago in advancing \ngender equality through the Lilly Ledbetter Act, the first piece of \nlegislation signed by President Obama, the Paycheck Fairness Act would \nhave been another step towards ending gender discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  Four decades after the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, women still \nearn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. \nThat equates to almost $11,000 less per year. In Rhode Island, women on \naverage make approximately $36,500 where men make $49,000. For full-\ntime, college educated Rhode Island workers over 25 years old, women \nmake an average of $55,000, while men average $70,000. This is simply \nunacceptable and shows that the\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\nremedies provided by current law are not adequate. Those who dismiss \nthe disparity as a consequence of women's ``choice of work'' ignore the \nfact that the wage gap exists even in highly skilled industries such as \naerospace engineering and network systems and data communications \nanalysis.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would have required employers seeking to \npay women less money than their male counterparts to justify the \ndifference with legitimate business factors. It would also have allowed \nwomen to compare their wages to those of their colleagues in the same \ncounty, not just their own office, providing a larger and fairer pool \nof comparative examples. And the bill would have allowed women to \nreceive punitive and compensatory damages equal to those in cases of \nrace-based discrimination. We owe it to the hard-working women of the \nUnited States, especially in these difficult economic times, when every \npenny of every paycheck counts, to continue to fight for equality.\n  I commend the bill's original sponsor, Secretary Clinton, as well as \nSenator Dodd and Senator Mikulski, who have worked so hard to bring \nattention to the issue of gender discrimination in the workplace. I \nwill continue to fight alongside my colleagues for the passage of the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7929-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7929-S7933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of S. 510, \nthe bill we just invoked cloture on, and as I said before the vote, I \nwas going to actually have to vote against cloture and I would speak \nafter the vote as to why because we were up against a timeline. I wish \nto take a minute to say I regret to have had to vote against cloture. \nNow that cloture has been invoked, I guess we will go to the bill, and, \nhopefully, we can make the necessary changes in it to improve this \nbill. But, frankly, the bill I originally cosponsored is not the bill \nthat is coming to the floor today. It has been changed in some material \nways. As late as this morning there were changes being made, and I \nunderstand there are discussions going on right now that may even \nchange it again.\n\n  First, let me say that the issue of food safety is an issue that is \nof primary importance. We need to make sure the food that is put in the \nretail stores as well as in restaurants and every other location in \nAmerica is absolutely the safest, highest quality food product anywhere \nin the world. That has always been our reputation.\n  But there are some gaps in the food safety inspection program in the \nUnited States today that have allowed some things to happen. We had a \nsituation in Georgia 2 years ago where we found salmonella in some \npeanut butter in a location in south Georgia--a manufacturing location. \nAnd while FDA had the authority to go in and make an inspection, the \nway they actually inspected it was on a contract basis through the \nGeorgia Department of Agriculture. They didn't have the resources to do \nthe real oversight that needed to be done. Here we had a company that \nhad found salmonella in peanut butter with their own inspections and \ntheir own product had been sent to their contractor and salmonella was \nfound to be positive, and yet they didn't have to report that to FDA. \nThat has been changed in this bill, but those are the types of gaps it \nis important to see changed.\n  What is a problem to me right now is a number of things, not the \nleast of which is the definition of what is a small farmer. Small \nfarmers have been granted an exemption, but that provision was changed \nas recently as this morning. I understand, also, that it is up for \ndiscussion again now. But the definition currently in the bill is that \na small farmer is determined to be a farmer with gross receipts smaller \nthan $500,000. Well, unfortunately, or fortunately, in my part of the \nworld, cotton today is selling at $1.50 a pound. A bale is 500 pounds. \nIt doesn't take many bales to reach $500,000 in gross receipts from the \nsale of cotton, and that doesn't count peanuts and wheat and corn and \nwhatever else may go along with it. So trying to put an arbitrary \nnumber such as that, and saying if you have gross receipts in excess of \nthat number the FDA has the authority to come on your farm, but if you \nhave less than that they do not have the authority, I think it is not \nthe proper way to go.\n  Secondly, with respect to that issue, even if they are exempt as a \nsmall farmer, they still have a mandate of a huge amount of paperwork \nthat has to go along with their production on an annual basis. So I \ndon't know what is going to happen with respect to the amendment \nprocess. We have heard there may be a filling of the tree and there \nwill be no amendments. I hope that is not the case. I hope we have the \nopportunity to have an unlimited amount of amendments and that we can \nget the bill corrected and can then make it, at the end of the day, a \ngood bill that will generate a significant vote on this floor. We have \nalso heard there may be no amendments that are\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\ngoing to be allowed and, obviously, without a definite understanding on \nthat, I had to be opposed to the bill.\n  Let me say one other issue that concerns me is an amendment that was \nfiled by Senator Tester. I know his heart is in the right place, but no \nless than about 30 national agricultural groups wrote a letter to \nChairman Harkin, as well as to Ranking Member Enzi, on Monday saying \nthey were opposed to that amendment and, if it is included in the bill, \nthey are going to be opposed to the bill. That again is one of these \neleventh-hour issues that remains undecided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the letter to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 15, 2010.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman--Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member--Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi: The safety of \n     this nation's food supply is the highest priority for the \n     food and agricultural organizations represented on this \n     letter. As the Senate advances sound public policy to \n     maximize public health and ensure consumer confidence in our \n     food safety system, we understand the Senate may consider \n     amendments to S. 510, the ``Food Safety Modernization Act,'' \n     that would exempt certain segments of the food industry from \n     food safety requirements contained in this legislation. In \n     particular, we understand that these amendments target \n     exemptions based on the size of farms and type of marketing \n     operation.\n       The undersigned organizations represent the vast majority \n     of growers, producers, shippers, distributors, processors, \n     packers, and wholesalers, and the vast majority of our \n     members are small businesses. We believe an operation's size, \n     the growing practices used, or its proximity to customers \n     does not determine whether the food offered is safe. What \n     matters is that the operation implements prudent product \n     safety practices, whether the product is purchased at a \n     roadside stand, a farmers' Market, or a large supermarket. We \n     support FDA food safety programs developed through a \n     scientific, risk-based approach and that benefit public \n     health.\n       For the public to have confidence in the food safety \n     system, Congress and federal regulators must bring all \n     segments of the food production and processing system into \n     compliance with national safety standards. We believe \n     technical assistance, training, extended transition \n     timeframes for compliance, and financial support are more \n     appropriate ways to assist small businesses throughout the \n     food distribution chain to comply with important food safety \n     standards. We urge the Senate to incorporate these types of \n     provisions into the final bill rather than provide blanket \n     exemptions.\n       We urge the Senate to reject the notion of providing \n     blanket exemptions for segments of the food industry based \n     solely upon size, location, or type of operation. Consumers \n     should be able to rely on a federal food safety framework \n     that sets appropriate standards for all products in the \n     marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Feed Industry Association; American Frozen Food \n           Institute; American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and \n           Growers Coalition; American Meat Institute; American \n           Mushroom Institute; California Grape and Tree Fruit \n           League; Corn Refiners Association; Florida Tomato \n           Exchange; Fresh Produce Association of the Americas; \n           Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association; Idaho \n           Potato Commission; International Dairy Foods \n           Association; National Council of Farmer Cooperatives; \n           National Chicken Council; National Farmers Union; \n           National Grain and Feed Association; National Meat \n           Association; National Milk Producers Federation; \n           National Oilseed Processors Association; National Pork \n           Producers Council; National Potato Council; National \n           Turkey Federation; National Watermelon Association; Pet \n           Food Institute; Produce Marketing Association; Shelf-\n           Stable Food Processors Association; Texas Produce \n           Association; United Egg Producers; United Fresh Produce \n           Association; U.S. Apple Association; Western Growers \n           Association.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I hope that at the end of the day \namendments will be allowed; that we can come up with a bill that is \npositive and that closes these gaps we have in the food safety \ninspection program in this country.\n  Senator Klobuchar and I have worked very hard on a provision that is \nincluded in the base bill that will improve the inspection process and \nmake it easier and give more authority and, more importantly, more \nteeth to the folks who are charged with doing the inspections. If that \nis the case, and we can get the right amendments done, then perhaps we \ncan get a true bipartisan bill passed and one we can all feel good \nabout supporting.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, Americans voted. \nThey voted for more jobs, for less spending and, of course, for smaller \ngovernment. As you know, I have come to the Senate floor week after \nweek to give a doctor's second opinion about the health care law. \nPolling shows that 58 percent of Americans voting on election day still \nwant to repeal and replace the President's new health care law.\n  Americans have made it clear they oppose this new policy that put \nWashington between patients and their doctors. The day after the \nelection, President Obama was asked about his health care law's impact \non the election. He didn't seem to understand the message from the \nAmerican people. It appears to me that the President continues to \nbelieve the American people liked his policy but just didn't like his \nsales pitch.\n  Well, in the President's first year alone, he participated in 42 \npress conferences, gave 158 interviews--including 5 Sunday shows all in \n1 day--held 23 townhall meetings and had 7 campaign rallies. In fact, \nthere were only 21 days in that entire first year when the President \nhad no public or press events. Clearly, the American people heard the \nPresident's sales pitch; they just didn't want to buy his product. \nNevertheless, the President and this Congress proceeded to force this \nnew health care law upon the American people, and they paid a heavy \nprice in the 2010 elections when Americans voted for candidates who \nvowed to overturn the President's new law.\n  Republicans have listened to the American people and are committed to \nensuring that America's health care system continues to remain the best \nin the world. As a physician, as well as a Member of the Senate, I \nlistened carefully to the discussions and the debate during the entire \ncampaign season. I listened to what candidates had to say on both sides \nof the aisle, I listened to what Americans had to say all over the \ncountry, and I put together something called United Against Obamacare. \nIt is a compendium of comments and statements made by the 13 newly \nelected Republican Senators to this body who will take office within \nthe next 2 months. Let me read sentences taken from statements each of \nthem made about health care.\n\n       I view the health care bill as the single greatest assault \n     to our freedom in my lifetime.\n       The thing that worries me the most about this bill, 2,000 \n     pages of all kinds of mandates, huge new government control \n     of health care, is that in time--and it won't be much time--\n     the government is going to intervene between patients and \n     their doctor.\n\n  That first sentence was by Senator-elect Johnson and the next \nsentence was from Senator-elect Toomey.\n\n       I don't want the government to tell me what is acceptable \n     and unacceptable about my health care options. I want my \n     doctor to tell me what's best for my care.\n\n  That statement was made by Senator-elect Boozman.\n\n       It is not supported by the American people. They do not \n     want one size fits all health care.\n\n  A statement made by Senator-elect Coats.\n\n       Government control of health care will reduce competition, \n     limit personal choices, and increase overall costs.\n\n  A statement made by Senator-elect Hoeven.\n\n       I think premiums will rise, and as people begin to deal \n     with the penalties of Obamacare, we will have more loss of \n     jobs.\n\n  That was Senator-elect Rand Paul. Next:\n\n       We're becoming less competitive every time government \n     increases the cost of being in business--and if it's a \n     problem for a large business, my small business men and women \n     will have even greater struggles to overcome.\n\n  That was Senator-elect Moran. Next:\n\n       I do not think that 12 new taxes and cuts to Medicare are \n     in the interest of the people.\n\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\n\n  That was Senator-elect Kirk.\n\n       It's going to bankrupt America, it adds $2.5 trillion to \n     our debt in the long term.\n\n  That is Senator-elect Rubio.\n\n       That's why it's important to keep the repeal effort alive. \n     What we owe is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. \n     It is an American issue.\n\n  Senator-elect Ayotte.\n\n       Every possible means must be applied within Congress as \n     well as through the application of the Constitution and the \n     law to stop full implementation of this legislation.\n\n  Senator-elect Lee.\n\n       I have proposed over a dozen health care solutions to help \n     reduce the cost of health care.\n\n  Senator-elect Blunt. And in conclusion:\n\n       I can tell you at least one thing coming . . . When it \n     comes time to vote to repeal health care, I vote yes.\n\n  Senator-elect Portman.\n  That is United Against Obamacare and statements made by the men and \nwomen who were recently elected to the Senate on the Republican side of \nthe aisle.\n  We will fight to repeal the law and replace it with legislation that \nwill help patients and providers and taxpayers.\n  During his recent press conference, President Obama also said that if \nRepublicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system, he \nwould now be happy to consider them. Well, it would have been nice if \nhe had considered our ideas during the last 2 years but better late \nthan never. Since the President was sworn in, Republicans have proposed \na host of proposals that will improve health care in America. Today, I \nwish to walk through some of the Republican ideas that are strongly \nsupported by a majority of the American people.\n  First, if Congress wanted to truly demonstrate that it got the \nmessage--if it truly wanted to demonstrate that it got the message--the \nHouse and the Senate would immediately repeal the President's new \nhealth care law. Senator DeMint currently has a bill that would repeal \nthe health care law in its entirety. By passing this law, we could \nensure that the American people will get the reform they want.\n  It is unlikely that Democrats will vote for a straight up-or-down \nrepeal bill, and even less likely that the President would sign it into \nlaw. So I wish to talk about other Republican proposals that would \neliminate some of the most egregious portions of the President's new \nhealth care law.\n  Senator Hatch of Utah proposed the American Job Protection Act. It \nrepeals the health care law's job-killing employer mandate. It strikes \nrelevant sections in the health care law forcing employers to provide \nhealth insurance to their employees or face a penalty.\n  Senator Hatch has also introduced the American Liberty Restoration \nAct. It repeals the health care law's individual mandate--the mandate \nrequiring all Americans to buy health insurance. The Federal Government \nhas never before forced the American people to purchase a product, a \ngood, or a service they may not want. We should overturn this \nunconstitutional mandate.\n  Senator Johanns introduced the Small Business Paperwork Elimination \nAct. It repeals section 9006 of the health care law. Section 9006 \nrequires business owners to submit separate 1099 reporting forms for \neach business-to-business transaction totaling more than $600 over the \ncourse of a year. Small business owners now, with this law, have to \nfile 1099 forms for basic business expenses, such as phone service, \nInternet service, shipping costs, and office supplies. This only serves \nto increase the cost to own and to operate a business. Why? Because, \naccording to the law, they will then be able to provide $17 billion \nmore in taxes to pay for this unwanted health care law.\n  Senator Cornyn introduced the Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination \nAct. It repeals the health care law's Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard. This bill would remove the unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats \nfrom their position of making Medicare payment and reimbursement \ndecisions.\n  Senator Enzi offered the grandfather regulation resolution of \ndisapproval. This resolution overturns a new Obama administration \nhealth care law regulation. President Obama repeatedly promised: If you \nlike what you have, you can keep it. This so-called grandfather \nregulation breaks that promise. The new regulation was supposed to \nspare businesses already providing health insurance to their workers \nmany of the higher costs of new mandates imposed by the health care \nlaw. If businesses lose this so-called grandfathered status, then they \nwill be required to comply with all the new insurance mandates in the \nlaw. This includes requirements to offer a Federal minimum benefit \npackage and to waive copayments for certain services. This will force \nour small businesses to change plans and increase costs.\n  In fact, the regulation--and it is a regulation where they took two \npages of the law and blew it into 121 pages of regulations--the \nregulation estimates that fully 80 percent of small businesses can \nexpect to lose their grandfathered status based on the extensive \nregulations the administration wrote. This is a job-killing, wage-\ncutting regulation. Certainly, this is not the reform the American \npeople were promised.\n  Also, just this week, Leader McConnell is filing an amicus brief \nregarding the health care litigation that is currently pending in \nFlorida's Federal court. His brief argues that the individual mandate \nis not authorized by Congress and that the Government cannot use the \ncommerce clause to force citizens to buy a product.\n  This list of ideas represents only a fraction of the Republican ideas \ncurrently on the table. If the President is serious about working with \nus, he will consider our constructive proposals. If not, he will \ncontinue to see the American people strongly speak out against his \nexpensive, overreaching, and ideological agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I know Senator Barrasso is \nrelatively new in Washington, House or Senate. I appreciate his words. \nI am not talking about him. But there are so many opponents of this \nhealth care legislation.\n  First of all, regarding some of the partisan opponents of this law--\nthe American people do not want to see us relitigate and redebate the \nhealth care legislation. They want some focus on job growth. But what \nstrikes me as a bit hypocritical--again, I am not singling out Senator \nBarrasso because he has not been here very long--there are so many \nMembers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate who have \nenjoyed government health care for a decade or two or three, where \ntaxpayers paid for their health care. Those conservative Members did \nnothing, zero, to help those people without insurance, to help those \npeople who had preexisting conditions, to help those people close the \ndoughnut hole, help senior citizens to get help on their drug costs.\n  Now they want to repeal the health care bill. In other words, they \nwant to keep their government insurance for themselves, but they don't \nseem to want to help anybody else out there. It just sickens me.\n  More important, I don't think the public wants us to continue \ndebating health care. The public wants us to work on job growth, to \nfocus on things like I did in Ohio Monday where I gathered 300 small \nbusinesses, people who make things, who want to sell to major aerospace \nmanufacturers, in this case Airbus in my State, putting people to \nwork--because that is what it is all about.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about food safety. It is \ntempting to take the safety of our food supply as given, but it is \nactually more a goal, one that continues to elude us. Each year in the \nUnited States 76 million people contract a foodborne illness. Some get \nmildly sick, some get very sick, a few actually die. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention estimates that more than a few, 5,000 \npeople a year, die from foodborne illness. These are mostly not people \nin their thirties who are healthy. It is the very young, very old, \nthose whose health may be frail, whose health may not be as strong as \nothers'. Nonetheless, 5,000 people die a year.\n  Over the last few years we faced melamine in infant formula, harmful \nseafood from China, tainted peppers from Mexico, E. coli in spinach, \nSalmonella in peanuts. Sometimes it is international problems. \nSometimes it is domestic problems. International problems mean we ought \nto be looking at\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\ntrade policy closer than we have, but that is a debate for another day.\n  A few months ago we had a nationwide recall of eggs due to Salmonella \ncontamination. Just this week we saw a recall of smoked turkey breast \nproducts because of Listeria contamination. The safety of Americans is \nthreatened by a regulatory structure that has failed to keep pace with \nmodern changes in food production, processing, and marketing.\n  We have at our grocery stores a wonderful thing. We have all kinds of \nselections: fresh fruits and vegetables and fish and all kinds of foods \nwe didn't have when I was growing up in the 1960s in Mansfield, OH. We \ndid not have that kind of selection in food stores, especially in the \nwinter months. Now we do. That is a great thing, but we don't do what \nwe need to do to guarantee its safety.\n  It is time to fix this broken system once and for all. The time has \ncome for Congress to pass legislation that will in fact improve our \ncountry's food safety system. America's families should be able to put \nfood on the table without fearing any kind of contamination. We \nshouldn't worry that the food in the school cafeterias, ballparks, \ngrocery stores, or local restaurants will send a child to the hospital \nand spread panic throughout the community.\n  That is why I am so pleased we are considering the Food Safety \nModernization Act. This legislation will address--I will talk briefly \nabout it and then yield to my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper--\nsome of the problems with our current food safety system. It will \nrequire facilities to conduct an analysis of the most likely food \nsafety hazards and design and implement risk-based controls to prevent \nthem. It would increase the frequency of plant inspections. It would \nstrengthen recordkeeping requirements and food traceability systems so \nwe know where the food came from before it gets to the grocery store. \nIt provides the FDA with the authority to mandate food recalls, \nsomething that is voluntary now.\n  Most companies step forward and do it. Some do not. Some delay before \nthey do, imposing health risks. It would ensure further study by the \nFDA on enhanced safety and sanitary methods for the transportation of \nfoods, and we must ensure this includes an examination of the pallets \non which our food is shipped.\n  At home you don't use the same cutting board for chicken that you use \nfor vegetables, or at least you should not, because of potential food \nsafety problems. It is the same thing with these wooden pallets because \nthey can collect--especially wooden pallets--way more bacteria than you \ncan imagine. We require more extensive provisions for heightened \nsecurity of imports which account for an increasing share of our fresh \nfruits and vegetables, an increasing share of U.S. food consumption.\n  This bill is here today because of the strong work especially of \nSenator Durbin of Illinois and Representative John Dingell of Michigan. \nAlso, I commend Ranking Member Enzi on the HELP Committee and Chairman \nHarkin and Senators Dodd, Burr, and Gregg for their work.\n  I also commend the Kroger Company based in Cincinnati, OH, for the \nwork they and other grocery store chains and other food processing \ncompanies have done collectively to make sure this legislation works \nfor them on the traceability issue. Many of them, many of these \ncompanies, have already set up good traceability provisions by \nthemselves without government involvement. I think Kroger is especially \nto be commended for doing that. The best way to ensure the FDA can \ndecisively respond to foodborne outbreaks is to authorize a \ncomprehensive food tracing system, as I mentioned.\n  Earlier this year I introduced S. 425, the Food Safety and Tracing \nImprovement Act. It would improve the ability of Federal agencies to \ntrace the origins of all contaminated food. I am very pleased that \nimportant components and goals of my legislation are included in the \nmanagers' amendment. With the addition of these stronger traceability \nprovisions, the FDA will be tasked with establishing a tracing system \nfor both unprocessed and processed food, such as peanut butter. The \n2008-2009 peanut butter Salmonella outbreak which sickened more than \n700 people and resulted in 9 deaths demonstrates exactly why the FDA \nneeds expanded authority to trace foods.\n\n  One victim of the peanut butter Salmonella outbreak was Nellie Napier \nof Medina, OH. Ms. Napier was an 80-year-old mother of 6 children, 13 \ngrandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren. She got ill in January of \n2009, almost 2 years ago, after eating a peanut butter product tainted \nwith Salmonella. When she got sick, doctors told her family there was \nnothing they could do and she died shortly thereafter.\n  The FDA was able to identify the source of the outbreak in a short \nperiod of time, but it was incredibly difficult and time consuming for \nthe FDA to determine where all the contaminated peanut butter ended up. \nThe source company sold to 85 other companies. They sold to another \n1,500 companies, and many of those companies sold to other companies. \nThere were no trace-back provisions to be able to help and warn others \nof potential contamination.\n  Last year, the Inspector General released a report entitled \n``Traceability in the Food Supply Chain.'' This report identified \nsignificant and unacceptable difficulties in tracing food through the \nsupply chain. The report attempted to trace 40 products through each \nstage of the food supply chain. They were able only to trace 5 of the \n40. That is why we know how important this legislation is. We required \nthe FDA to establish a product tracing system and develop additional \nrecordkeeping requirements for foods the FDA determines to be high \nrisk. We require the Comptroller General to examine and provide \nrecommendations regarding how to further improve the product tracing \nsystem. We don't know everything yet that we need to do. This gives the \nFDA and the Comptroller General guidance and leadership and the \nauthority, in addition to what we have done, to do it in the right way.\n  I thank Senators Harkin, Enzi, Durbin, Burr, Dodd, and Gregg for the \nwork they have done, and Representative Diana DeGette from Denver and \nSenators Merkley and Franken, who have been particularly strong \nadvocates working with me.\n  The goal is to make food safety a foregone conclusion. It is what \nAmericans expect. It is what we have had through many years. We have \nmoved away from that. This puts us right on course to do it right.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Thanking Senator Burris\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, first, let me say I have had the pleasure \nany number of times, as I think have most all of our colleagues, to be \nrecognized by the Presiding Officer. Many times it is you. I know you \nwill be leaving us soon--2 days--but it has been a real pleasure to \nserve with you. I appreciate not only having the opportunity to work in \nthe Senate with you but on our committees and subcommittees. You have \nbeen a great colleague. We are going to miss you.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Senator Barrasso was speaking earlier, talking about the health care \nlegislation. One of the means of paying for part of the health care \nreform--you may recall the Congressional Budget Office has said health \ncare reform is expected to actually reduce the budget deficit by about \n$100 billion over the next 10 years and by about another $1 trillion in \nthe 10 years following that. Part of our challenge is to make sure we \ndo that, that potential for deficit reduction is realized.\n  One of the provisions in the health care bill calls for businesses, \nlarge and small, to submit form 1099s when they make a purchase of a \nservice or a good from some other business. That can be an \nadministrative burden for businesses.\n  The reason it was put in the bill was because it is a big cash \neconomy and there is a huge tax gap of money that is owed to the \nTreasury. Last time the IRS estimated, they said it was about $300 \nbillion in moneys owed to the Treasury not being paid, in many cases by \nbusinesses--in a lot of cases where they work on a for-cash basis. The \nIRS\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\nhas asked us forever to do something about that problem. We tried to do \nit in the context of health care reform and use it for part of the way \nto pay for the health care costs.\n  We are going to come back and fix that issue--particularly the \nconcerns raised by smaller businesses that this is an administrative \nburden--to see if there is a way to make it a lot less burdensome but \nat the same time to see if there is a way to close the tax gap.\n  The idea that those of us paying our fair share of taxes know a \nnumber of folks and businesses are not is enough to make our blood \nboil. We have to fix that and at the same time not create an unneeded \nburden for businesses in complying.\n  We just had a hearing in the Finance Committee this morning. The \nhearing was one sought by Republicans but also looked forward to by \nDemocrats. Our speaker was Dr. Donald Berwick, whom you may know is the \nnew administrator appointed by the President--a recess appointment \nbecause he expected that we would have a very difficult time getting \nhim confirmed. We still have holes in the current administration where \nwe cannot get people confirmed on the floor, whether it is for \nAssistant Secretary or Under Secretary--all kinds of provisions. I call \nit administration Swiss Cheese, and it is hard to try to govern. The \nadministration realized that early on in a place like CMS, which stands \nfor Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  In that position, we needed someone--we needed someone like \nyesterday--and it looked as if we would have a tough and probably a \nlong confirmation fight with Dr. Berwick. We just went ahead and made \nthe recess appointment when we were in recess. So he is on the job now.\n  I did not know what to expect in the hearing. Would it be vitriolic? \nDr. Berwick did not ask to be a recess appointee. He said the President \nasked him to serve and he said he would serve. I think he hit the deck \nrunning and is doing a very nice job. I think the hearing today was \nmore positive, more focused on issues and results than I had expected \nit would be.\n  When we passed health care reform earlier this year, for me, having \nworked on it with my colleagues on the Finance Committee for about, \ngosh, over a year, my focus at the time was, How do we get better \nresults for less money? And we have a lot of people, as we know, who do \nnot have health care coverage at all. We need to extend coverage to \nthem or as many of them as we can. But unless we also figure out how to \nget better health care outcomes for less money, we are not going to be \nable to sustain extending coverage to people who do not have it. So we \nhave to do both. And a good deal of what Dr. Berwick testified to today \nwas, How do we provide better results for less money?\n  One of the aspects of the legislation he spoke to which is about to \nbe implemented in less than 2 months focuses on Medicare and it focuses \non our senior citizens.\n  As many of us know, since 2006 there has been a Medicare prescription \ndrug program. We call it Part D. Medicare has Parts A and B, which is \ndoctor care and hospital care, it has Part C, which is Medicare \nAdvantage, and it has Part D, which is the prescription drug program. \nIn Part D, when we actually adopted it, we said that the first roughly \n$3,000 of name-brand drugs Medicare recipients take in a year--Medicare \npays roughly 75 percent of the first $3,000. The individual pays the \nrest. Everything over $6,000 in name-brand drugs that a person takes in \na year in this program--Medicare covers about 95 percent of everything \nover $6,000. For most people, everything between $3,000 and $6,000 in a \nyear, Medicare pays zero. That is called the doughnut hole.\n  Come January 1, the doughnut hole is going to be about half filled, \nand we will find that instead of Medicare paying zero for name-brand \ndrugs bought by Medicare recipients purchasing between $3,000 and \n$6,000 per year, Medicare will pay 50 percent. Over the next 10 years, \nMedicare will pay more each year. When we get to 2020, Medicare will be \ncovering 75 percent of the cost of those name-brand drugs. That will \naccomplish a couple of things. One, you and I know, Mr. President, that \nthere are people in Illinois, Delaware, and other States who stop \ntaking their medicines. They stop taking their medicines in the \nMedicare prescription drug program because they fall in the doughnut \nhole and Medicare, for them, is providing zero. That is going to \nchange. And a lot of people who don't take their medicines, \nunfortunately, get sick, they end up in hospitals, and it becomes very \nexpensive for us to take care of them, instead of taking maybe a \nrelatively inexpensive medicine. We are going to begin to address that \nin a very substantial way on January 1.\n  Who pays that 50 percent? The pharmaceutical companies. Not the \ntaxpayers, not the Treasury, the pharmaceutical companies. And as we \nmarch from 50 percent up to 75 percent in 2020, the pharmaceutical \ncompanies have agreed to meet those costs. We are happy about that, \ngrateful for that. They deserve some credit for that.\n  Another benefit Dr. Berwick talked about is annual physicals. Right \nnow a person reaches age 65, they are eligible for Medicare, and they \nget a one-time-only welcome-to-Medicare physical. They can live to be \n105 and they will never get another one.\n  Under the law, beginning in January, 2 months from now, Medicare \nrecipients will be eligible for an annual physical for the rest of \ntheir lives. If they live to be 105, if they start at 65, they will get \n40 of them. The idea is--and they include cognitive screening as well, \nthe physical by their own doctors and nurses--the idea there is to \ncatch problems when they are small and can be fixed and cared for \nrather than when people get really sick and end up in hospitals, which \ncosts, as we know, a boatload of money.\n  The third thing he mentioned to all of us, in addition to the \ndoughnut hole and the annual physicals, is copays. In Medicare, there \nis a copay for a lot of preventive screening--colonoscopies, \nmammographies, those kinds of things--and a lot of the time these \nMedicare recipients do not have the money. They do not have the money \nto pay for the copays, so they do not get the colonoscopies or they do \nnot get the mammographies, they do not get the preventive screening, \nand then they get very sick, and the rest of us pay the tab. That is \nnot smart.\n  Starting in January, the copays for those preventive screenings go \naway. We want the people to get the mammographies, we want them to get \nthe colonoscopies when they are due to get them. In doing that, we are \ngoing to save money in the long haul.\n  The last thing I wish to mention is that there is a lot of fraud in \nMedicare. There is a lot of fraud in Medicaid. There are great \nprovisions in the legislation that will enable us to go after fraud in \nMedicare, in Parts A and B, which is doctor care and hospital care; \nPart C, which is Medicare Advantage; and in Part D.\n  We have been given a little start to this in working on Medicare \nfraud cost recovery in about five States for the last couple of years. \nLast year, I think we recovered about $1 billion in five States. Next \nyear, we are going to start doing Medicare cost recovery in all 50 \nStates. We hire private contractors. Out of every dollar they collect \nfrom fraud, 90 cents goes back into the Medicare trust fund and the \nprivate company keeps 10 cents. That is how they get paid. We are going \nto be able to extend the life of Medicare a whole lot because of this.\n  Not only are we going to be going after waste, fraud, and abuse in a \nvery smart way, recovering money in a very smart way, we are also going \nto do it in Medicaid. We are also doing the same kind of thing in \nMedicaid. We have asked senior citizens from across the country to sign \nup and be part of a posse almost and to go out and help us identify the \nfraud. As we do that, we will be able to recover more money still.\n  So that is a little bit of what Dr. Berwick talked about today. I \nthought it was a very good exchange and a very encouraging exchange as \nwe go forward in health care reform.\n  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. It is a \nvery special privilege to do it with you sitting in that seat today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7933-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7933-S7934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes, with the time to be charged \nagainst the debate postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Intelligence Perspectives\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have had the distinct privilege over the \npast 8 years of serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nserving as the committee's vice chairman for the past 4 years. In this \nrole I have been privy to our Nation's deepest secrets, including great \nsuccesses and some failures. Unfortunately, the failures usually get \nleaked to the media while most of the successes go unheralded. While I \nam not at liberty to discuss those successes here, I can witness to the \nfact that we have an outstanding fleet of intelligence personnel who \nselflessly sacrifice their time, and sometimes their lives, to protect \nour great Nation. Those professionals deserve our undying gratitude, \nand we all can be proud of their service. It has been a distinct \nprivilege to me to oversee their work, and for their dedication to our \nNation, I am ever grateful.\n  As I leave the Senate, having served in this privileged capacity as \nvice chair of the Intelligence Committee, I leave for my colleagues \nsome thoughts, and recommendations on improvements that can be made on \nintelligence matters going forward, which I believe will enhance our \nnational security.\n  First, let me start with the Congress. Members of Congress often like \nto criticize the executive branch, as is appropriate, but Congress \nneeds to get its own house in order as well. I joined the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence in 2003, and during the past 8 years the \ncommittee has had three chairmen: Senators Roberts, Rockefeller, and \nFeinstein; and two vice chairmen: Senator Rockefeller and me. It has \nbeen a challenging time, and we have had our highs and our lows. After \nDecember 2004, the committee failed to pass an annual authorization \nbill that could become law for almost 6 years; this was due purely to \npolitics in the Congress.\n  Although the committee was able to pass unanimously results from an \ninvestigation on pre-Iraq war intelligence failures, it was by and \nlarge hindered by political infighting for several years. In 2003, a \nmemo was found written by a committee staffer that advocated attacking \nintelligence issues for political gain to damage the Republican \nadministration and the Republican majorities. That memo was ultimately \ndiscredited by my friends on the other side of the aisle, but it marked \na low point in the committee's history, and it should never happen \nagain. Chairman Feinstein and I have worked hard to bring the committee \nback into bipartisan operation of intelligence oversight. We hope that \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act that the President signed into law \nrecently has helped in getting the committees back on track.\n  One area where I strongly believe the Congress has yet to heed the \nwarnings of the 9/11 Commission and other study groups is in reforming \nits approach to appropriations for intelligence. That is why in 2008, \nthe SSCI passed a resolution to establish an appropriations \nsubcommittee on intelligence, something the full Senate had already \npassed in 2004. Yet the Appropriations Committee has failed to act. I \ncontinue to believe this is vital to improving oversight and funding of \nour Nation's intelligence, and I urge the Senate in the next Congress \nto make this happen.\n  The past 8 years have been ground-breaking years in Intelligence, \nparticularly as the war on terrorism has played out in Afghanistan and \nIraq. As I speak today, U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan \ncontinue to fight terrorists--al-Qaida, the Taliban, Haqqani, and \nothers who threaten the stability and future of the region. They fight \nnot only to bring stability to the region but to disrupt the \nsanctuaries and dismantle the organizations that can and do facilitate \nterrorist attacks against the United States at home, our troops in the \nfield, and our allies abroad.\n  My profound respect and gratitude goes out to those serving in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and across the globe. We have asked so much of them and \ntheir families. They have made enormous, in some cases ultimate, \nsacrifices, and our Nation is forever in their debt.\n  As we learned in Iraq, fighting the enemy is not enough. A \ncomprehensive counterinsurgency strategy is required. It must combine \nkinetic power--military attacks against terrorists and insurgents--with \n``smart power''--the development of host nation capabilities and \ninfrastructure, and a sensible mix of economic, development, \neducational, and diplomatic strategies. We know that understanding the \ncomplexities of the region and the forces at play puts additional \nburdens on the resources and capabilities of the intelligence \ncommunity. But we also know that without a viable and appropriately \nresourced counter-insurgency strategy, we will not see success in \nAfghanistan, and the future of Pakistan will remain in doubt. Driving \nterrorist safe havens out of Afghanistan is crucial but insufficient if \nal-Qaida and Taliban militants continue to find sanctuary in the remote \nborder regions of western Pakistan.\n  Eliminating the terrorist threat to the United States that emanates \nfrom terrorist sanctuaries in the region is our No. 1 goal. A U.S. \nwithdrawal, in whole or in part, from Afghanistan in the near term \nwould be a tacit, yet unambiguous, approval for the return of Taliban \ncontrol of Afghanistan. In turn, this would lead to the establishment \nof more safe havens for many of the world's most violent and feared \nterrorists.\n  But what happens when our forces eventually pull back? Replacing \nthose sanctuaries with secure environments and stable governance is the \nkey to ensuring that terrorists do not gain another foothold in the \nfuture.\n  As we have fought this war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, we have \nlearned a lot about al-Qaida, terrorism, and our own intelligence \ncapabilities. On July 9, 2004, the committee unanimously issued its \nphase I report on the prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq. I view \nthis truly bipartisan effort as one of the committee's most successful \noversight accomplishments.\n  The comprehensive 511-page Iraq WMD report identified numerous \nanalytic and collection failures in the intelligence community's work \non Iraq's WMD programs. These underlying failures caused most of the \nmajor key judgments in the Iraq WMD National Intelligence Estimate to \nbe either overstated or not supported by the underling intelligence \nreporting. In turn, American policymakers relied, in part, on these key \njudgments in deciding whether to support the war against Iraq.\n  The committee's Iraq WMD Report served as a valuable ``lessons-\nlearned'' exercise. It has had a profound impact on the way the \nintelligence community does business and interacts with Congress and \nthe White House. It also set the standard for future committee reviews. \nIn my opinion, the committee members and staff who completed the \nproject performed a great service to our Nation.\n  At the end of 2004, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act. The Governmental Affairs Committee had the \nlead on this bill, and the act implemented a number of recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission, including the creation of the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence.\n  After 6 years, the jury is still out on the ODNI. Some have argued \nthe office is an unnecessary bureaucratic layer. Others have said the \noffice is too big and needs to be downsized. Still others are concerned \nthat the DNI's authority is being undermined by decisionmakers in the \nWhite House and the Department of Justice--a point with ample evidence \nover the past several years. While these observations have some merit, \nI believe the ODNI serves an important leadership function within the \nintelligence community and should not be abandoned.\n  There is, however, room for improvement, so I sponsored a number of \nlegislative provisions that should enhance the DNI's authorities with \nrespect to accountability reviews and major system acquisitions. While \nsome of these\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\nprovisions were recently signed into law, more will need to be done to \nstrengthen the effectiveness of the ODNI.\n  Turning to battlefield intelligence, the committee has spent a \nconsiderable amount of time conducting oversight of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program. Intelligence from detainees has proven to be \na most effective source of intelligence to protect the Nation. That is \nwhy we must capture the enemy if at all possible, instead of just \nkilling them. I am concerned lately that due to our lack of effective \ndetention and interrogation policies today our operators in the field \nfeel compelled to kill vice capture. This is understandable, for unless \nyou are in Iraq or Afghanistan, where would you detain enemy combatants \nto the United States? More troubling to me, we seem to be releasing a \nnumber of individuals whom we have already detained, only to see more \nthan 20 percent of them take action against us on the battlefield \nagain. I have a comprehensive approach to this issue that I have been \nworking on with other members that will be introduced on the floor.\n\n  Regarding the CIA's interrogation program, I believe the program \nproduced valuable intelligence information. My opinion is not a \npartisan one. Recently, we learned that the Obama Justice Department \nand Judge Kaplan, a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of \nNew York, agree with my assessment. Judge Kaplan is presiding over the \nFederal trial of Ahmed Ghailani, an alleged member of al-Qaida indicted \non charges of participating in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in \nEast Africa. Last July, Judge Kaplan agreed with the Department of \nJustice and found that ``on the record before the Court and as further \nexplained in the [classified] Supplement, the CIA Program was effective \nin obtaining useful intelligence from Ghailani throughout his time in \nCIA custody.''\n  In March 2009, the committee began a bipartisan review of the CIA's \ninterrogation program, based upon carefully negotiated terms of \nreference. Unfortunately, later that year, the Attorney General decided \nto re-open criminal investigations of the CIA employees involved in the \nCIA's detention and interrogation program. I believed then that the \nAttorney General's decision would impede the committee's ability to \nconduct interviews of key witnesses, thereby diminishing the value of \nthe review. As a result, I withdrew minority staff from the committee's \nreview. The majority pressed ahead and has refused to comply with \ncommittee rules to keep the minority fully and currently informed, but \nit soon ran into the obstacles I foresaw, with CIA personnel declining \nto speak with them based on the advice of counsel. And who would blame \nthem?\n  The majority has spent valuable time and resources on this matter, \nand the CIA has conveyed that it had to pull personnel off current \nmission requirements to support their effort. I believe that limited \ncommittee and government resources would be better spent on topics of \noversight interest on programs that are in operation today.\n  One of the most disturbing leaks that I have witnessed during my \ntenure on the committee occurred in December 2005, when the New York \nTimes published a story describing the President's Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, or TSP. Some view the leakers as heroes. I do not \nshare that view. In fact, intelligence operators in the field at the \ntime told me that their ability to gain valuable information was \nreduced dramatically. Michael Hayden, then Director of the CIA, stated \nthat we had begun to apply the Darwinian theory to terrorism because \nfrom then on we would only be catching the dumb ones. Frankly, I am \namazed the Department of Justice has yet to prosecute Thomas Tamm, a \nDOJ attorney who openly bragged in a Newsweek article that he \nintentionally revealed information about this highly classified and \ncompartmented program. Tamm and his fellow leakers are traitors who \nhave done serious damage to our national security. Yet this \nadministration refuses to prosecute this open and shut case. Why?\n  In order to ease concerns of critics, the President's TSP was \nsubmitted to and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt. Unfortunately, in May 2007, this new arrangement started to \nunravel when the FISA Court issued a ruling that caused significant \ngaps in our intelligence collection against foreign terrorists.\n  Although DNI Mike McConnell pleaded to Congress for help, the \nCongress failed to respond. Under the looming pressure of the August \nrecess, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and I co-sponsored the \nProtect America Act which Congress passed in the first week of August \n2007.\n  The act did exactly what it was intended to. It closed the \nintelligence gaps that threatened the security of our Nation and of our \ntroops. But it was lacking in one important aspect. It did not provide \ncivil liability protections from ongoing frivolous lawsuits to those \nprivate partners who assisted the intelligence community with the TSP.\n  Following the passage of the Protect America Act, I worked to come up \nwith a bipartisan, permanent solution to modernize FISA and give those \nprivate partners needed civil liability protections. The committee \nworked closely for months with the DNI, the Department of Justice, and \nexperts from the intelligence community to ensure that there would be \nno unintended operational consequences from any of the provisions \nincluded in our bipartisan product.\n  In February 2008, after many hearings, briefings, and much debate on \nthe Senate floor, the Senate passed the FISA Amendments Act by a \nstrong, bipartisan vote of 68-29. The Senate's bill reflected the \nIntelligence Committee's conclusion that those electronic \ncommunications service providers who assisted with the TSP acted in \ngood faith and deserved civil liability protection from frivolous \nlawsuits. The Senate bill also went further than any legislation in \nhistory in protecting the potential privacy interests of U.S. persons \nwhose communications may be acquired through foreign targeting.\n  After months of protracted and difficult negotiations with the House, \nCongress finally passed the FISA Amendments Act on July 9, 2008, and \nthe President signed it into law the very next day. The final law \nachieved the goals of the original Senate bill, albeit less elegantly. \nWhile the act is more burdensome than I would prefer, we did preserve \nthe intelligence community's ability to keep us safe, and we protected \nthe electronic communications service providers from those frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I consider my involvement in the passage of the Protect America Act \nand the FISA Amendments Act to be two of the highlights of my \nlegislative career. There is, however, still work to be done. A number \nof provisions in the FISA Amendments Act are set to sunset at the end \nof next year. Also, there are three additional FISA provisions related \nto roving wiretaps, business records court orders, and the lone wolf \nprovision, that are set to expire on February 28, 2011. I urge Congress \nand the President to work closely together to ensure that the \nprovisions are made permanent, without adding unnecessary requirements \nor limitations that will hamper our intelligence collection \ncapabilities.\n  I mentioned earlier that recently the Intelligence Authorization Act \nof 2010 was signed into law. When I became vice chairman of the \ncommittee in 2007, my top priority was to get an intelligence \nauthorization bill signed into law, and I am thankful that with the \nleadership of Senator Feinstein, we finally met that goal. The 2010 \nintelligence authorization bill, while light on authorization, was \nheavy on legislative provisions. I am pleased that a number of good \ngovernment provisions which I sponsored were included in the bill.\n  The law imposes new requirements on the intelligence community to \nmanage better their major systems acquisitions. Too often, we have seen \nIC acquisitions of major systems, i.e., over $500 million, balloon in \ncost and decrease in performance. These provisions will operate \ntogether to address the long-standing problem of out-of-control cost \noverruns in these acquisitions. Modeled on the successful Nunn-McCurdy \nprovisions in title 10 of the United States Code, these provisions \nencourage greater involvement by the DNI in the acquisitions process \nand help the congressional intelligence committees perform more \neffective and timely oversight of cost increases.\n\n[[Page S7936]]\n\n  Another good government provision established a requirement for the \nintelligence community to conduct vulnerability assessments of its \nmajor systems. A significant vulnerability in a major system can impede \nthe operation of that system, waste taxpayer dollars, and create \ncounterintelligence concerns. This provision requires the DNI to \nconduct initial and subsequent vulnerability assessments for any major \nsystem, and its items of supply, that is included in the National \nIntelligence Program. These assessments will ensure that any \nvulnerabilities or risks associated with a particular system are \nidentified and resolved at the earliest possible stage.\n  A third good government provision gives the DNI the authority to \nconduct accountability reviews of intelligence community elements and \npersonnel in relation to their significant failures or deficiencies. It \nalso encourages IC elements to address internal failures or \ndeficiencies, something they at times have been reluctant to do. In the \nevent these elements are reluctant or unable to do so, this provision \ngives the DNI the authority he needs to conduct his own reviews.\n\n  Finally, my future budget projection provision requires the DNI to do \nwhat every American family does on a regular basis--map out a budget. \nThe DNI, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, \nmust provide congressional Intelligence Committees with a future year \nintelligence plan and a long-term budget projection for each fiscal \nyear. These important planning tools will enable the DNI and the \ncongressional intelligence communities to ``look over the horizon'' and \nresolve significant budgetary issues before they become problematic.\n  As I leave the Senate and contemplate what I have learned during my \nservice in Congress and on the Intelligence Committee, I have a number \nof recommendations for future members and leaders of the committee.\n  One of the intelligence community's greatest failures was its \ncomplete waste of billions of dollars spent to develop satellites that \nnever took a single picture. Senator Feinstein and I have strongly \nvoiced our abiding concern to all four DNIs that the Intelligence \nCommunity is still spending far too much money on imagery satellites \nthat are too big, too few, and too costly. We have put forth solid \nalternatives that would produce more satellites at far less cost, be \nless fragile, and perform as well or better than the unaffordable plan \nin the President's budget.\n  Just this month, an independent analysis by some of the country's \nvery best astrophysicists confirmed that such an alternative, based on \na combination of commercial and classified technologies, was \nessentially as capable, but about half as expensive as the \nadministration's program. Sadly, our ideas have met with ``NIH'' \nresistance--``not invented here.''\n  Even worse, it appears that this resistance has been based in part on \nthe NRO's unhealthy reliance upon, and apparent subordination to, the \ncontractor that builds these incredibly expensive satellites. In spite \nof this resistance, Congress saw fit to appropriate over $200 million \nto explore a better path forward, and I urge my colleagues in both \nHouses of Congress to sustain that effort. I also urge the new DNI, in \nthe strongest terms, to reconsider this issue afresh, and with an open \nmind. Our committee recommended his confirmation on the hope and \nexpectation that he would do so.\n  The committee has been following the cyber threat issue for a long \ntime. Cyber attacks happen every day. Our government, businesses, \ncitizens, and even social networking sites all have been hit.\n  In an ever increasing cyber age, where our financial system conducts \ntrades via the Internet, families pay bills online, and the government \nuses computers to implement war strategies, successful cyber attacks \ncan be devastating. Unless our private sector and government start down \na better path to protect our information networks, serious damage to \nour economy and our national security will follow.\n  Senator Hatch and I introduced a legislative proposal that takes the \nfirst step by creating a solid infrastructure that is responsible and \naccountable for coordinating our government's cyber efforts. The bill \nis built on three principles. First, we must be clear about where \nCongress should, and, more importantly, should not legislate. Second, \nthere must be one person in charge--someone outside the Executive \nOffice of the President who is unlikely to claim executive privilege, \nbut who has real authority to coordinate our government cyber security \nefforts. Third, we need a voluntary public/private partnership to \nfacilitate sharing cyber threat information, research, and technical \nsupport.\n  We believe that once this infrastructure is established, the \nassembled government and private sector experts will be able to provide \nguidance on the next steps--including any further legislation--needed \nto enhance our our cyber safety.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, we captured hundreds of al-Qaida terrorists \nand associates. Many of these could be called low-level fighters--of \nthe same type as the 9/11 hijackers but no less dangerous to our \nsecurity. Others, such as 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and \nsenior al-Qaida operative Abu Zubaydah, were identified as high-value \ndetainees and placed in the CIA's interrogation and detention program.\n  After details about the program were leaked in the Washington Post, \nthe President announced, in September 2006, that these high-value \ndetainees would be transferred to the detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay. Since 2002, Gitmo has housed terrorists picked up on the \nbattlefield or suspected of terrorist activities. Today, 174 detainees \nremain at Gitmo.\n  In 2008, in a sharply divided opinion and despite clear language from \nCongress to the contrary, the Supreme Court gave Gitmo detainees the \nconstitutional right to challenge their detention in our courts. Since \nthen, 38 detainees have successfully challenged their detention.\n  With the recidivism rate for former Gitmo detainees at over 20 \npercent, Congress must step in once again and draw some boundaries. We \ncannot afford to let more potentially dangerous detainees go free. We \nneed a clear, consistent framework for these habeas challenges with a \nstandard of proof that takes into account the wartime conditions under \nwhich many of these detainees were captured. It is unreasonable to hold \nthe government to the standards and evidentiary tests that apply in \nordinary habeas cases. There is nothing ordinary about war and our \nhabeas laws must reflect that.\n  Now that the President has abolished the CIA's program and ordered \nthe closure of Gitmo, we need clear policies for holding and \nquestioning suspected terrorists, especially overseas. We must abandon \nthe automatic impulse to Mirandize terrorists captured inside the \nUnited States. Prosecution can be a very effective response to \nterrorism, but it must never take precedence over getting potential \nlifesaving intelligence.\n  I have been working with several of my colleagues on legislation that \nwould set clear lines for law of war detention and habeas challenges. \nOur Nation should not risk another Gitmo detainee rejoining the fight. \nWe cannot risk losing more and timely intelligence because we have no \nsystem for detaining and interrogating terrorists. These are critical \nnational security issues and Congress's voice must be heard as soon as \npossible.\n  Last December, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to blow up a \nNorthwest Airlines flight as it headed to Detroit. Shortly after the \nfailed attack, al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula claimed \nresponsibility. AQAP counts among its senior leadership and members \nformer Gitmo detainees who have returned to their old ways. As the \nChristmas Day attack reminded us, rising recidivism rates for Gitmo \ndetainees are more than just a statistic and claims that a 20-percent \nrecidivism rate ``isn't that bad''--as one senior administration \nofficial put it--must be challenged.\n  As part of its goal to close Gitmo, the administration continues its \nefforts to persuade other countries to accept detainees. Whatever one's \nviews on closing Gitmo, we all have an interest in making sure that no \nformer Gitmo detainee kills or harms us or our allies. As these \ntransfers continue, the Intelligence Committee--and Congress--must pay \nclose attention to these and earlier transfer decisions.\n\n[[Page S7937]]\n\n  As part of the committee's oversight responsibilities, staff have \nbeen traveling to those countries that accepted detainees under the \ncurrent and previous administrations. They have also been reviewing \nassessments prepared by the intelligence community and the Guantanamo \nReview Task Force and other documents. A lot of work has been done, but \nthere is more to do.\n  Thus far, our review has raised some significant concerns. We all \nknow that transfers to Yemen are a bad idea, but other countries may \nnot have either the legal authority or capability to keep track of \nthese detainees effectively. Still others simply view these former \ndetainees as being free. If we do not know what these detainees are \ndoing, we end up relying on luck that we will catch them before they \nact.\n\n  Having luck on your side is always a good thing, but it stinks as a \ncounterrorism policy. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto pay close attention to this issue. Unfortunately, it is one that I \nthink will continue to be around for a very long time.\n  I hope these reflections, observations, and recommendations will be \nof use to the members of the next Congress. I have been deeply honored \nto serve on the Intelligence Committee with my distinguished and \ntalented colleagues. I also salute the fine men and women of the \nintelligence community who have given so much for the safety of our \ncountry. I wish them all well in their future endeavors.\n  In addition, I wish to address an obvious problem--leaks. I have \nalready made reference to some of the more disastrous leaks that \noccurred during my tenure, but unfortunately, these were just the tip \nof the iceberg. There are simply too many to list. I shudder to think \nabout the sources and methods that have been disclosed, and the lives \nthat will likely be lost, as a result of the obscene amount of \nclassified information compromised by Wikileaks. Of course, to call \nthis a leak case is gross mischaracterization; it is more like a tidal \nwave.\n  We are blessed with our open society and our many freedoms. However, \nour ability to protect these freedoms and preserve our national \nsecurity depends upon our ability to keep our secrets safe.\n  This problem needs a multifaceted solution. We must first deter and \nneutralize the leakers. There should be significant criminal, civil, \nand administrative sanctions that can be imposed on leakers. Leakers \nshould face significant jail time, pay heavy fines, forfeit any \nprofits, lose their pensions, and be fired from their jobs. We should \nalso not allow the first amendment to be used as a shield for criminal \nactivity. It should be a crime to knowingly solicit a person to reveal \nclassified information for an unauthorized purpose or to knowingly \npublish or possess such information. Leaks will not stop until a \nsignificant number of leakers have been appropriately punished.\n  Other steps may lessen the problem. Government agencies in possession \nof classified information should ensure that information is properly \nclassified in the first instance and that their employees are \nthoroughly trained in security procedures. Also, we should explore \ntechnological solutions for tracking classified documents and \nestablishing singular audit trails.\n  On a related issue, we also need to ensure that the security \nclearance process is repaired. An excellent interagency reform process \nhas applied more resources and better processes to increase the \nefficiency of the system, eliminate backlogs, and in many cases, \nshorten the time required to process a security clearance. Although \nsignificant progress has been achieved in recent years, there is still \na lot of room for improvement. We must continue to use technology to \nwring more efficiency from the security clearance system, and make it \nless of an obstacle to success for our intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Just as importantly, we must modernize the security clearance system \nto make it a more useful measure of suitability for serving in \nsensitive government positions. The interagency security clearance \nreform process is studying a new process, called ``continuous \nevaluation,'' which seeks to use automated records checks and other \nsimilar processes to assess risk in populations of cleared personnel on \na regular basis, rather than waiting five years to conduct a \nreinvestigation, as we currently do.\n  The devil will be in the details, but I believe a ``continuous \nevaluation'' system could be much more effective than our current \npractices in detecting security threats in our agencies before they \nbecome a problem.\n  The use of biometrics--fingerprints, DNA, facial recognition scans, \nand the like--has yielded dramatic dividends on the battlefields of \nIraq and Afghanistan, and is a vital tool for detecting terrorist \nthreats before they arrive on our shores. Biometrics help us separate \nthe good guys from the bad guys on the battlefield, and can ensure that \nwe know that the foreign tourist, businessman, or student who wants to \nvisit the United States is not actually a dangerous terrorist.\n  We have made significant progress in the collection and use of \nbiometric data in the last decade, but there are still too many policy \nand procedural obstacles to sharing biometric data between U.S. \nGovernment agencies. Moreover, far too much of the funding for these \nimportant biometric efforts is contained in supplemental funding \nrequests.\n  We need to continue breaking down the barriers to sharing biometric \ndata. We need a roadmap in the base intelligence budget for the \npermanent sustainment of our biometric efforts in the decades to come. \nBiometrics must remain an important tool for dealing with national \nsecurity threats well beyond the end of combat operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The committee spent much of 2005 and 2006 working on legislation \nrelated to the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. We held \nnumerous hearings and reported out a bill that contained a number of \nprovisions that were ultimately included in the USA PATRIOT Improvement \nand Reauthorization Act.\n  Among other things, the act made permanent 14 of the 16 USA PATRIOT \nAct provisions that were set to expire at the end of 2006. It extended \nthe sunsets of three FISA provisions--roving wiretaps; business record \ncourt orders; and lone wolf--until the end of 2009. Also, it created a \nnew National Security Division within the Department of Justice, \nsupervised by a new assistant attorney general, with the goal of \nensuring that the information sharing walls that existed prior to 9/11 \nare never reconstructed.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, the size and budget of \nthe intelligence community has nearly doubled, and much of that growth \nhas been in the IC's analytic community. Even as we hire more and more \nanalysts to focus on national intelligence priorities, most of them \nwork on current and tactical missions--answering questions and giving \nbriefings on near-term issues--without ever producing a deep \nunderstanding of longer term critical issues.\n  Furthermore, the intelligence community continues to operate as a \nloose confederation, with no universal standards for analytic training, \ntools, technology, and personnel policies. These issues, coupled with a \nlack of a federated communitywide analytic work plan, often result in \nredundant or conflicting analyses, and in some cases, a major gap in \ncoverage or understanding of issues of significant concern. It is time \nfor the ODNI to bring analytic direction and standards to the IC so \nthat the analytic community can become a true community of analysts.\n  I have often voiced my concern about the abysmal state of the \nintelligence community's foreign language programs and the slow pace of \nprogress in correcting deficiencies. The collection of intelligence \ndepends heavily upon language, whether information is gathered in the \nfield from a human source or from a technical collection system.\n  More than 9 years after 9/11, and more than a year after a major \nshift in focus in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the cadre of intelligence \nprofessionals capable of speaking, reading, or understanding critical \nregional languages such as Pashto, Dari, or Urdu remains in critically \nshort supply. In spite of significant congressional interest and \nfunding, progress has been disappointing.\n  Persistent critical shortages in some languages could contribute to \nthe loss of intelligence information and affect the ability of the \nintelligence community to exploit what it does collect. I\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\nencourage IC leaders to make foreign language learning and maintenance \na priority mission and a ``must fund'' for resource allocation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Coach Dan Callahan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an \nextraordinary man, a friend of mine, who died this week in Carterville, \nIL. Dan Callahan was the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois \nUniversity at Carbondale for the last 16 years. He died Monday at the \nage of 52.\n  Dan Callahan was not only a good coach, he was a great man. His \nconduct on and off the field inspired just about everybody who ever met \nhim.\n  Dan died of neurotropic melanoma, a very rare and very serious form \nof skin cancer. His struggle with cancer began almost 5 years ago when \nhe detected a little black spot on his lower lip. The spot was \nsuccessfully removed, but the cancer remained and grew.\n  After receiving his diagnosis, Dan Callahan silently endured the \nrigors of his treatment while continuing to coach his baseball team. In \nthe 2007, 2008 seasons there were times he probably should have stayed \nhome because he was too weak to do much but sit in the dugout, but he \ncame to work and he came to that ball yard every day. He didn't miss a \nsingle game.\n  The next season Dan endured more intense treatment, including a \nsurgery that removed part of his right jaw. It was only then that he \nwent public with his illness. Eventually, the cancer cost Dan not only \nhis job but the sight in his right eye and the hearing in his right \near. But it didn't stop the coach. The losses damaged his depth \nperception and hearing. But if Dan Callahan, once a pitcher in his own \nright, wasn't able to throw a fastball with quite the same speed and \ncontrol, he taught his players an even more important lesson: how to \npush through adversity.\n  The chemo and surgery forced him to miss all of his team's road trip \ngames during the 2009 season, and that bothered him even more than the \ncancer. He believed a coach should be with his players. Somehow, this \npast season--his last season--Dan was able to be on the bench for \nnearly every game. He considered that a great victory, and it was.\n  The president of Southern Illinois University, Glen Poshard, a former \nCongressman, said about Danny Callahan: ``As far as I'm concerned, he \nwas the face of courage.''\n  The Missouri Valley Conference recognized that fact a year ago when \nit awarded Dan Callahan its ``Most Courageous Award,'' an award that \nhonors those who have demonstrated unusual courage in the face of \npersonal illness, adversity, or tragedy. In announcing Dan's selection, \nthe Missouri Valley Conference Commissioner Doug Elgin said:\n\n       Dan Callahan personifies professionalism in the face of \n     personal adversity, and he's been an inspiration to his \n     baseball student-athletes, and really all those who know him. \n     We feel honored to be able to recognize him.\n\n  Dan had a great sense of humor. He used to joke that he led the \nleague in one category: surgeries. In fact, he leaves a rich record of \nathletic achievement. In 22 seasons as an NCAA Division I head coach, \nDan Callahan compiled an impressive record of 595 wins and 695 losses, \nand 442 of those nearly 600 victories were at Southern Illinois, making \nhim the second winningest coach in SIU's history.\n  Dan Callahan was one of just five coaches in Missouri Valley \nConference history to win over 200 league games. In his time at \nCarbondale, he produced 23 Major League draft picks and 19 First-Team \nAll-MVC selections.\n  Baseball was Dan's lifelong love and passion. As an athlete, he \npitched two seasons at the University of New Orleans, two at Quincy \nCollege, from which he graduated. After college, he pitched \nprofessionally in both the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners' \norganizations.\n  His first coaching job was in my hometown at Springfield High School, \nhis alma mater. He also coached at Eastern University for 5 years \nbefore heading down to Carbondale.\n  Last October, Dan began chemotherapy. His doctors prescribed a three-\ndrug cocktail that includes Avastin, one of a new generation of \nanticancer drugs that works by preventing the growth of new blood \nvessels that support tumors. Avastin can buy time and a better quality \nof life for the people with advanced cancer, but it is very expensive. \nIn Dan's case, it cost $13,686 a treatment--about $100,000 a year.\n  Unfortunately, Dan's health insurance company, the largest health \ninsurer in America, a company that had paid for surgery to remove the \ninitial spot from his lip and the second surgery to remove part of his \njaw, refused to pay for the Avastin. The chemo drug was FDA-approved \nand something of a wonder drug in treating advanced colon, lung, \nbreast, and other cancers. But the insurance company said its use to \ntreat cancers like Dan's was experimental so they wouldn't cover it.\n  With the support of family and friends, Dan and his wife Stacy found \n$27,000 to pay for the first two treatments. Washington University in \nSt. Louis provided another $50,000; that bought him four more \ntreatments. Through all the chemo and radiation treatments and all the \npainful surgeries, Dan Callahan never complained. He was never bitter \nand he never felt sorry for himself. But he worried about other people \nand other families who needed expensive drugs and couldn't afford them. \nDan thought it was unfair that patients could be denied treatment that \ncould extend and maybe even save their lives simply because of the \ndrug's high price. We talked about that last year while the Senate was \ndebating America's broken health care system. I thought about Dan \nCallahan when I voted for the Affordable Health Care Act.\n  In his prime, Dan Callahan stood 6 feet 4 and weighed 225 pounds. The \ncancer took its toll. The last couple of months were rough. He spent \nmost of them at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. A little more than a week \nago, he told his doctors he needed to take a break so he could attend a \nThanksgiving get-together with his team. He went home for hospice care \nand died 3 days later surrounded by the people he loved.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Stacy, Dan's wife of 21 years, and \ntheir daughters Alexa and Carly, and his parents Ann and Gene. Gene and \nAnn are my closest friends and I have known Dan since he was 9 years \nold. I also wish to say to Sherry and Lynn, his sisters, he couldn't \nhave come from a better family. My thoughts are also with the student-\nathletes whom Dan coached and inspired over the years. Dan's passing is \na deep loss for so many people.\n  On Monday, Dan is going to have a send-off. It is going to be at the \nbaseball diamond. Dan's family and his SIU family are hosting a \ncelebration of his life at the SIU baseball diamond where he spent so \nmany years. There will be a party afterwards with hot wings and beer. \nThe invitation says, ``Please dress casually. No suits. No ties.'' That \nis exactly what Dan would have wanted.\n  Jim Ruppert, the sports editor for my hometown newspaper, the State \nJournal Register in Springfield, was also Dan Callahan's brother-in-\nlaw. In his column the day after Dan died he said:\n\n       When the official scorer in the sky makes his final ruling, \n     he will say Dan Callahan lost his nearly 5-year battle with \n     cancer Monday afternoon at his home in Carterville. But the \n     52-year-old Callahan was a baseball guy who went down \n     swinging, battling the dreaded disease to the bottom of the \n     ninth inning.\n\n  Dan Callahan coached the sport he loved, and it is a unique sport. It \nis one of the few team sports that has no timeclock. Baseball is only \nover when it is over, and that is the way life is too. At the end of \nhis life, Dan Callahan still sits in that dugout and with a watchful \ncoach's eye, he scans the field and sees hundreds of young men whose \nlives he touched, players and families who will never forget him. He \ntaught them more than baseball. He taught them about life and courage, \nabout themselves and their relationships with others.\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\n  I have known Dan all his life. I consider it a blessing to have \ncounted him as a friend. Lou Gehrig, when he learned of his illness, \nsaid he was still the luckiest man on the face of the Earth. Dan \nCallahan felt the same way about himself and for the same reasons. \nWhether he was the luckiest man on Earth, I don't know, but I do know \nthat all of us who had the good fortune to know Dan Callahan were \nlucky. We were inspired by his courage and his dignity and we will miss \nhim.\n\n\n                 Congratulating Stan ``The Man'' Musial\n\n  This is another baseball-themed speech which I didn't expect to give \non the floor of the Senate, but today is a happy day for me.\n  I grew up in East Saint Louis, IL. I learned about God and church, \nbut the only god I was sure of played for the St. Louis Cardinals and \nhis name was Stan Musial. The first baseball glove I ever owned was a \nRawlings leather glove that had Stan Musial's name written on the edge \nof it. I used to do what kids my age did. We would wrap rubberbands \naround the glove with the baseball in it to get that pocket just right \nand then we would pull that ball out and we would rub it with \nGlovolium, some kind of oil concoction that we thought made it supple \nand made it easier to catch the ball. I rubbed that oil on my glove so \nhard so many times I was the only one who would still read his name on \nthat glove. I kept it forever until my wife said, What are you doing \nwith this old thing, and I said it was my prized possession when I was \nabout 10 years old, and it still is.\n  The good news is that my feelings for Stan Musial are shared by the \nPresident of the United States. He may be a Chicago White Sox fan, but \nhe knows a great champion when he sees one. That is why the \nannouncement today that Stan ``The Man'' Musial is going to receive the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom makes me feel so good.\n  The one thing about Stan that I found so interesting is here was one \nof the most public figures in baseball of his time and I never heard a \nnegative word about him, not about his professional life or his public \nlife. He served this country not only as a hero on the baseball \ndiamond, but he left his team to serve in the military. He went back as \nthe Presiding Officer did--to entertain the troops and serve as well. \nHe cared about this country. He was a champion on and off the baseball \nfield.\n  After playing 22 seasons in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis \nCardinals from 1941 to 1963, Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of \nFame in 1969. Over that time, he compiled a lifetime batting average of \n.331--how about that--with 3,630 hits, 475 home runs, and 1,951 RBIs, \nappearing in 23 World Series games and 24 All-Star games. He is one of \nonly three players to have run over 6,000 bases in his career, right \nbehind Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.\n  A sign of his great sportsmanship, Stan was never once ejected during \nhis career spanning more than 3,000 games. Both in and out of a \nCardinal uniform, Stan exemplifies the values of sportsmanship, \ndiscipline, hard work, grace, consistency, excellence, and humility. He \nis truly deserving of this Medal of Freedom.\n  Let me say a word about my colleague Claire McCaskill. No one has \nworked harder to impress upon the White House how important this \nPresidential Medal of Freedom is, not only to Stan Musial but Cardinal \nfans alike and those of us who think he is one of the greatest \nAmericans. I salute Claire McCaskill's dogged determination to convince \nthe White House the President is well served by awarding this man an \nhonor for his life on the baseball diamond and off the diamond, and \nserving this country in so many ways.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Parity for Hispanic Farmers\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak of what I have addressed \nin the past about injustice. It is about the reality that it is no \nsecret that decades of discrimination in lending practices at the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture have made it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for minority farmers--specifically Hispanic and women \nfarmers--to make a living at what they love to do, leaving many no \nchoice but to lose their farms and ranches they have tended all their \nlives, in many cases from generation to generation. That is why I rise \ntoday in support of parity for Hispanic and women farmers. I rise so \nthat all the victims of discrimination in this case are treated \nequally, fairly, and are adequately compensated for the damages they \nsuffered regardless of their race or gender.\n  The Department of Justice's proposal to Hispanic and female victims \nis certainly a first step toward closing the entire book on the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's discrimination. But, frankly, there appears \nto be some contradiction between the proposal given to these two groups \nand the declared objectives of providing parity among the different \ngroups who suffered discrimination.\n  Here is the situation. African-American victims of discrimination are \non a path to receive approximately $2.25 billion to resolve their \nclaims. Victims who filed on time were afforded the opportunity to \nchoose from two different tracks. First, they could present substantial \nevidence of discrimination which, if valid, entitled the victim to a \nmonetary settlement of $50,000 plus relief in the form of loan \nforgiveness and offsets of tax liability or they could prove their \nclaims using evidence which was reviewed by a third-party arbitrator \nwho decided how much damages to award, if any.\n  This system took into account the fact that many if not most of the \ndocuments from this era were destroyed by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, making it extremely difficult for victims to prove their \nclaims, while also giving claimants the opportunity to seek more than \n$50,000 if their case was especially egregious and their losses were \nsevere. There was not a cap on the amount of money awarded. There was \nnot a cap on the number of claimants who could recover damages, which \nallowed the merits of each individual's claims to be the sole basis for \ndetermining what they received. That process appears to be right in \nline with the stated goal of determining the appropriate course of \naction for each claim based on the merits of the case and only on the \nmerits. I certainly commend that approach.\n  However, when it comes to Hispanic and women farmers, the Justice \nDepartment has used legal maneuvers to prevent Hispanic and women \nfarmers from achieving class status. Legal maneuvers should not be what \nthe Department of Justice is all about; justice is what the Department \nshould be all about.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe the proposal which has been presented \nto the Hispanic and female victims meets that standard of justice, nor \ndoes it employ the fair method utilized in the Pigford I settlement or \nthe equity that is needed. Instead, it puts a cap on the damages each \nvictim could receive and on the total amount that can be awarded to all \nvictims. This is not in parity with the Pigford I settlement and could \npotentially leave thousands of Hispanic and female victims with only a \nmodicum of relief and far less justice than their counterparts.\n  Specifically, while Pigford I awarded a minimum of $50,000 to \nvictims, the proposals to Hispanics and females will only award victims \nup to that amount. What this means is that Hispanic and female victims, \neven if they suffered millions of dollars in damages, lost their farms, \nlost their families' heritage in the process, lost their livelihoods, \nwill not receive more than $50,000 and will not be made whole. Farmers \nwho were denied a loan and, as a result, in the words of then-Secretary \nof Agriculture Glickman, ``lost their family land, not because of a bad \ncrop, not because of a flood, but because of the color of their skin,'' \nwill never be able to rebuild their lives and recover the land with a \nfraction of $50,000.\n  If that is not enough, the Department of Justice-imposed cap on the \ntotal amount of money that can be awarded to Hispanic and women victims \ncould arbitrarily reduce each claimant's award far below the $50,000 \nindividual cap. You may ask why. Here is the reason: because there are \nlikely to be far more claims filed by Hispanic and women farmers than \nwere filed by African-American farmers. Yet the amount allocated for \nHispanic and female\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nclaims is almost $1 billion less than provided to African-American \nclaimants. This is despite the fact that, according to the Department \nof Agriculture census, in the years in question--from 1982 to 1997--\nHispanic- and female-operated farms far outnumbered African-American-\noperated farms by almost 7 to 1.\n  If the Department of Justice estimates are correct and approximately \n80,000 valid claims will be made by African Americans through Pigford I \nand Pigford II, it is safe to assume that at least this many and likely \nmany more Hispanic and female farmers who were discriminated against \nwill file valid claims. Even using the very conservative estimate of \n80,000 valid claims for Hispanics and females, a $1.3 billion overall \ncap will provide each claimant with about $16,625. This amount will \nshrink even further if there are more than the 80,000 claimants and tax \nforgiveness funds are counted against the $1.3 billion cap.\n  Think about this. Under this method, the amount each victim will \nreceive will depend on how many other victims there were, not on the \nmerits of each individual case. Not only is that not fair, but it is \nperverse because each victim will actually be punished the more the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture discriminated since the more valid \nclaims there are, the less each victim will receive. A structure has \nbeen set up that, instead of pursuing justice and equity, actually \nworks to the detriment of those who have already been discriminated \nagainst because the more that have been discriminated against and prove \ntheir case, the less each one will receive because of this cap.\n  Finally, the process proposed for administering Hispanic and female \nclaims seems arbitrary and needlessly complicated. In contrast to \nPigford claimants, Hispanic- and women-owned farms would not have the \nbenefit of a court-approved notice or any of the procedural protections \nassociated with a class action process.\n  The underlying facts of the claims made by African Americans, \nHispanics, females, and Native Americans are nearly identical.\n  I commend the President and his administration for making some effort \ntoward delivering justice to women and Hispanic farmers. That is why I \nurge the administration to guarantee that the relief to be provided to \nwomen and Hispanic farmers be just and consistent with that provided to \nAfrican-American victims who filed on time. In the words of Timothy \nPigford, the lead plaintiff in the Pigford case, Hispanics and females \n``suffered the same discrimination by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture as African American farmers.'' They suffered the same \ndiscrimination by the Department of Agriculture as African-American \nfarmers.\n  Again quoting Mr. Pigford:\n\n       . . . class certification is a procedural matter that does \n     not address the underlying discrimination that is in fact \n     admitted.\n\n  It is, in fact, admitted. There is not a dispute about whether \ndiscrimination took place. It is, in fact, admitted. The indisputable \nfact remains that farmers and ranchers--particularly women, African \nAmericans, Hispanics--were denied access to U.S. Department of \nAgriculture loans, to farm benefits and credit services due to their \nrace, their ethnicity, their gender. They were not given proper \nopportunity for recourse. In the process of being denied those \nopportunities, they lost, in many cases, their land or sold parts of \ntheir land to keep a little piece of it. The only thing that could be \nworse than the original discrimination, ironically, is if it were to \ntreat the victims of that discrimination differently based on their \nrace, ethnicity, or gender.\n  Justice for one cannot masquerade as justice for all. I applaud the \nUSDA for taking a big step toward universal justice in this case by \nrecognizing the need to put aside technical questions about class \ncertification and address the underlying valid claims of \ndiscrimination.\n  I understand that this administration inherited this problem, like so \nmany others, and is now in the position of cleaning up the mess left by \nits predecessors. I applaud them for seeking to right an injustice. But \nI do not think, nor can I accept that you can dispense justice when you \nknow that the facts are such that, in fact, there is no dispute as to \nthe discrimination, that you can dispense justice piecemeal, or that \nyou can treat victims similarly situated, almost identically situated \nand harmed, with justice for some and not for all. We need to make this \nright. We need to make the victims whole. We need to do it fairly, \njustly, and soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                        The San Francisco Giants\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill before us. \nBut before I do, one thing I was remiss in not doing, listening to \nSenator Durbin speak about Stan Musial, is pointing out what has \nhappened in San Francisco, and that is that the San Francisco Giants \nhave won the World Series with a team that was just amazing. To see a \nteam, I think, that were essentially outcasts--and some would say \nmisfits--come together, play with teamwork, develop a world-class \npitching staff, a defense where double and triple plays would happen, \nis really quite amazing. I had the pleasure of going to the playoff \ngames during the recess, as well as the World Series games, and it was \na very special treat. I wish to offer my commendation to that great \nteam. It was quite wonderful.\n  Now down to business.\n  Mr. President, it appears that I will be blocked from offering an \namendment on bisphenol A, to the food safety bill. So I come to the \nfloor to express my disappointment and my very serious concern about \nthe continued use of this chemical in children's products.\n  There is mounting scientific evidence that shows that BPA is linked \nto harmful health effects. Over 200 scientific studies show that even \nat low doses, BPA is linked to serious health problems, including \ncancer, diabetes, heart disease, early puberty, behavioral problems, \nand obesity. I know there is not yet consensus on the science and there \nis still research to be done. But I also know this chemical is so \nwidespread--it has been found in 93 percent of Americans. I know BPA is \nthought to alter the way the body chemistry works. Babies and children \nare particularly at risk because when they are developing, any small \nchange can cause dramatic consequences.\n  To put it simply, the fact that so many adverse health effects are \nlinked to this chemical, the fact that this chemical is so present in \nour bodies, and the fact that babies are more at risk from its harmful \neffects leads me to believe there is no good reason to expose our \nchildren to this chemical.\n  My great concern for its continued use, particularly in children's \nproducts, is the reason Senator Schumer, my cosponsor, and I, who \nintroduced a bill a year and a half ago--why he and I have been willing \nto compromise, to be flexible, and to try to work out an agreement to \nmove this forward. For 7 months, we have been negotiating with Senator \nEnzi, the distinguished ranking member handling this bill on the floor, \nhoping for a compromise that would enable this amendment on BPA to be \nplaced in the food safety bill. It looks as if there will not be \namendments; therefore, I have no opportunity to offer an amendment.\n  But last evening at about 6:15, Senator Enzi and I reached an \nagreement which would ban the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups \nwithin 6 months of the enactment of this legislation. It would require \nthat the FDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to issue a revised \nsafety assessment on BPA by December 1, 2012--this is important because \nit would make certain the date that the FDA has to assess the safety of \nBPA. And third, it would include a savings clause to allow States to \nenact their own legislation.\n  I wish to thank the ranking member for his agreement. It meant a \ngreat deal to me. I thought, aha, we are really close to making a \nbeginning step on this problem. Unfortunately, today it became clear \nthat the American Chemistry Council has blocked and obstructed this \nagreement from being added to the food safety bill. Therefore, language \ncannot be in the bill. I regret that the chemical lobby puts a higher \npriority on selling chemicals than it does on the health of infants. I \nam stunned by this.\n  This agreement was but a small step forward, a simple movement to ban \nBPA in baby bottles and sippy cups, a simple move to protect children.\n  All it did was ban BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups until the FDA's \nsafety assessment could be revised. The\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nchemical lobby came in at the 11th hour opposing this ban, which is \nsomething my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had agreed to.\n  Now, because of this, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare pulling their support. My goodness. This is so simple. How can \nanybody put a priority on selling chemicals above the health of \ninfants? Major manufacturers and retailers are already phasing out BPA \nfrom their food and beverage products for children. So why should this \nbe stopped?\n  The products used to give food and drink to children all have safe \nalternative BPA packaging available. At least 14 manufacturers have \nalready taken action against BPA. Here they are: Avent, Born Free, \nDisney First Years, Evenflo, Gerber, Dr. Brown's, Green to Grow, Klean \nKanteen, Medala, Nuby Sippy Cups, Munchkin, Playtex, Thinkbaby, Weil \nBaby. All these manufacturers are taking BPA voluntarily out of their \nbaby bottles and sippy cups, but we cannot get it into a simple bill.\n  Retailers are taking actions not to sell these products with BPA in \nthem: CVS, Kmart, Kroger, Rite Aid, Safeway, Sears, Toys ``R'' Us and \nBabies ``R'' Us, Walmart, Wegmans, and Whole Foods have already taken \nthis action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. At this point, seven States have moved to enact laws \nbanning BPA from children's products: Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, \nNew York, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin. The city of Chicago also has \na ban. These entities have already taken action. California is just a \nfew votes short of taking this action and I hope will come back this \nnext legislative session and take it.\n  Bills are also pending in Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, \nPennsylvania, and Washington, DC, and numerous companies are marketing \nBPA-free products. Other countries are moving forward. Canada declared \nBPA toxic and banned it from all baby bottles and sippy cups. Denmark \nand France also have national bans on BPA in certain products.\n  So here is the point. The problem has been recognized, and steps are \nbeing taken by countries, States, companies, and retailers. Yet the \nchemical lobby in this country is keeping this amendment out of the \nfood safety bill. Why? Only one reason. Because the chemical companies \nwant to make money to the longest point they can by selling a chemical \nwhich is linked to all these harmful health effects.\n  Their resistance to accept this very small proposal is astounding. We \nhave compromised in the negotiations with Senator Enzi. The bill \nSenator Schumer and I introduced was much more comprehensive. But we \nare down to just the three things I mentioned earlier. This is a food \nsafety issue, and it profoundly affects children's health.\n  But some in the industry are fighting tooth and nail to make sure BPA \nremains a staple in the American diet and even for children. Because of \nthis opposition, it appears I have no option to move this amendment \nforward. Again, I tried for a year and a half, 7 months of \nnegotiations. I can put a hold on the bill, stop it, and make a fuss, \nas some others have done over other issues, or I can wait to fight \nanother day by allowing this food safety bill to go forward while \ncontinuing to build the case against BPA. That latter is what I intend \nto do beginning now.\n  This battle may be lost, but, rest assured, I do not intend to quit. \nI have a deep abiding concern regarding the presence of toxins and \nchemicals with no testing in all kinds of products and all kinds of \nsolutions that build up in our bodies. There is no precautionary \nstandard in this country when it comes to chemicals.\n  You have to prove that a chemical is harmful before that chemical can \nbe banned. But the evidence against BPA is mounting and especially its \nharmful effects on babies and children who are still developing.\n  Here is the argument. Here is what BPA is. It is synthetic estrogen. \nIt is a hormone disruptor. It interferes with how the hormones work in \nthe body, and this chemical is used in thousands of consumer products. \nIt is used to harden plastics, line tin cans, and even make CDs. It is \neven used to coat airline tickets and grocery store receipts. It is one \nof the most pervasive chemicals in modern life.\n  As with so many other chemicals in consumer products, BPA has been \nadded to our products without knowing whether it is safe. Alternatives \nexist because concern has been growing about the harmful impact. The \nchemical industry has tried to quiet criticism by reassuring consumers \nthat BPA is safe and that more research still needs to be done.\n  Well, that argument simply does not hold water. Over 200 studies show \nthat exposure to BPA, particularly during prenatal development and \nearly infancy, are linked to a wide range of adverse health effects in \nlater life. Because of their smaller size and stage of development, \nbabies and children are particularly at risk from these harmful \nimpacts.\n  What do these include? Increased risk of breast and prostate cancer, \ngenital abnormalities in males, infertility in men, sexual dysfunction, \nearly puberty in girls, metabolic disorders such as insulin-resistant \ntype 2 diabetes and obesity and behavioral problems such as attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.\n  Industry continues to insist that BPA is not harmful. But one study \nshows us why we should be skeptical about research funded by the \nchemical industry. In 2006, the journal Environmental Research \npublished an article comparing the results of government-funded studies \non BPA to BPA studies funded by industry. The difference is stark. \nNinety-two percent of the government-funded studies found that exposure \nto BPA caused health problems. Overwhelmingly, government studies found \nharm.\n  None of the industry studies identified health problems as a result \nof BPA exposure--not one. That is 92 percent of the government studies \nand not one of the industry studies. So I ask: How can this be? \nClearly, questions are raised about the validity of the chemical \nindustry's studies.\n  The results also illustrate why our Nation's regulatory agencies \nshould not and cannot rely solely on chemical companies to conduct \nresearch into their own products. Consumers are worried about BPA. They \nare pushing in States for restrictions and bans. Over 75 organizations \nthat represent almost 40 million Americans, support getting BPA out of \nfood packaging for children.\n  Support comes from national groups such as the BlueGreen Alliance, \nConsumers Union, Breast Cancer Fund, National WIC, and United \nSteelworkers of America. State groups such as Alaska Community Action \non Toxics, California Environmental Rights Alliance, Environment \nIllinois, the Tennessee Environmental Council, and the Massachusetts \nBreast Cancer Coalition back this amendment.\n  The broad coalition of environmental and consumer advocates know BPA \ncannot be good for our babies. I wish to underscore the importance and \nthe urgency of withdrawing BPA from baby products.\n  Well-known and respected organizations and Federal agencies have \nexpressed concern about BPA. The President's Cancer Panel Annual Report \nreleased in April of this year concluded that there is growing evidence \nof a link between BPA and several diseases such as cancer. The panel \nrecommended using BPA-free containers to limit chemical exposure.\n  A 2008 study by the American Medical Association suggested links \nbetween exposure to BPA and diabetes, heart disease, and liver problems \nin humans. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, \nNHANES, linked BPA in high concentrations to cardiovascular disease and \ntype 2 diabetes.\n  In addition to the over 200 scientific studies showing exposure to \nBPA is linked to adverse health effects, there are a number of studies \nthat link BPA and other environmental toxins to early onset puberty and \nother hormonal changes. This is serious. This emphasizes how \ndetrimental this chemical can be during development.\n  I would like to discuss three of these studies. The Endocrine \nSociety, comprised of over 14,000 members from more than 100 countries, \npublished a scientific statement in 2009, expressing\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nconcern for the adverse health impacts of endocrine-disrupting \nchemicals such as BPA. The adverse health impacts included infertility, \nthyroid problems, obesity, and cancer. A study published in \nEnvironmental Health Perspectives studied 715 men, ages 20 to 74 years \nold, and found that men who had high levels of BPA in their bodies also \nhad higher levels of testosterone. This study demonstrates that higher \nBPA levels in the body are associated with altered hormone levels.\n  A study in the Journal of Pediatrics in September 2010 demonstrated \nthat puberty in girls is occurring even earlier, by ages 7 and 8. The \nresearchers studied 1,239 girls in 2004 and 2008, so there was \nfollowup, in Cincinnati, East Harlem, and San Francisco. They found \nthat at age 8, 18 percent of Caucasian girls, 43 percent of African-\nAmerican girls, and 31 percent of Hispanic girls had signs of puberty. \nThat is at 8 years old.\n  The researchers suspected that environmental chemicals such as BPA \ncould influence the onset of puberty. Early puberty can cause a host of \nproblems later on in life, such as increased rates of breast cancer, \nlower self-esteem, eating disorders, and certainly depression.\n  Given these conclusions, it is critical we act to protect just the \nmost vulnerable, our infants and toddlers, from this chemical.\n  How are children benefitted by having a baby bottle or a cup that \nthey sip from that is coated with BPA? How is that bottle any better? \nHow is that cup any better? Fact: It isn't. Yet the American Chemistry \nCouncil puts their need to sell these chemicals above all of the \nexisting studies, above all the science that is emerging, and would not \neven say: Just in case this is true, yes; we agree with you. We should \nprotect our young and our youngest. They would not do even that.\n  Our original bill was much broader. BPA is not just in plastic \nbottles, it is also used in the epoxy resin that lines tin cans. I no \nlonger buy tin cans because of it. My family, I have asked them not to \nbuy things in tin cans. Buy them in glass. Then we don't have to worry \nabout the BPA that is in the lining of the can.\n  This amendment doesn't ban BPA in the lining of cans. It doesn't ban \nBPA in all containers. It just bans BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups, \njust for infants, just for toddlers. The chemical industry says no. And \nI guess the other side of the aisle bows.\n  I am amazed. BPA has been linked to developmental disorders, cancer, \ncardiovascular complications, and diabetes by credible scientific \nbodies. The evidence that BPA is unacceptably dangerous is mounting. \nYet it remains in thousands of household and food products. In an \neffort to reach a bipartisan compromise, which we did do last night, \nthe amendment I wanted only restricted the use of BPA in baby bottles \nand sippy cups because, as the science shows, babies and young children \nare the most susceptible to the harmful effects of this toxic chemical. \nThis amendment would have ensured that all babies, in whatever State \nthey happen to be or wherever they buy their baby bottles, are safe. We \ncan't even do this in a food safety bill.\n  It would have ensured that parents no longer have to wonder whether \nthe products they buy for their babies will harm them now or later in \nlife. I have on my Blackberry a picture of a new grandchild born \nearlier today, a little boy by the name of Benjamin. So even if one is \na grandparent like me, this is so relevant. If we can't take care of \nour babies, what can we take care of in this country?\n  Despite the loss of this amendment, the American people can still \nvote with their pocketbooks by refusing to buy products made with BPA. \nAsk the question in your grocery store. Go where they are not sold. Buy \nthe products that do not use BPA. Public knowledge and awareness is \nimportant.\n  In 2008, as part of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, \nCongress accepted my proposal to ban phthalates, and President Bush \nsigned it. It banned phthalates, a plasticizing chemical, from \nchildren's toys. Like BPA, phthalates are linked to a variety of health \nproblems in young children. I was proud to lead that fight and protect \nchildren from these chemicals.\n  I truly believe the unrestricted use of chemicals in products, \nwhether it be makeup for women, lotions that go on bodies, coatings in \ncans, coverings of plastic, softeners and hardeners, chemicals that \nleach into food, are a problem. When we do a food safety bill, we ought \nto consider this. Well, not even this baby step to protect babies is \ngoing to be taken.\n  I very much regret it, but the battle is joined. Once I start, I do \nnot stop. We will fight another day.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Leading Retailers & Manufacturers Phasing Out Bisphenol A (BPA)\n\n       In response to growing scientific and public concern, over \n     the past few years, leading U.S. retailers, baby bottle and \n     water bottle manufacturers pledged to phase out bisphenol A \n     (BPA) in favor of safer cost-effective alternatives.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sickle Cell Disease\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a very important \nhealth issue--sickle cell disease--that highlights the tremendous \nprogress the scientific community has made over the years. This is a \ntimely opportunity to bring up sickle cell disease because this month \nmarks the 100th anniversary of its discovery.\n  On November 16 and 17, the National Institutes of Health will host a \nresearch symposium on sickle cell disease to commemorate the \naccomplishments of scientists and clinicians over the past century. The \nsymposium, named after the scientist who discovered the gene, Dr. James \nB. Herrick, will bring to Maryland more than 30\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nexperts from around the world to discuss sickle cell disease research \nand treatment.\n  Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder in which red blood \ncells contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin and frequently take on a \nsickle, or crescent, shape. These defective blood cells can block small \nblood vessels, which can in turn lead to tissue damage or stroke. A \ncommon complication of this condition is severe pain in the limbs, \nchest, abdomen, and back. Other complications are anemia, jaundice, \nsevere infection, and spleen, liver, and kidney damage.\n  The life expectancy for sickle cell patients is shortened, with \nstudies reporting an average life expectancy of 42 years for males and \n48 years for females. Sickle cell disease occurs most commonly in \npeople of African descent, though individuals of Middle Eastern, \nMediterranean, Central and South American, and Asian Indian heritage \ncan inherit the disease as well. About 1 in 12 African Americans \ncarries the gene for sickle cell disease, and 1 in 400 Americans has \nthe full-blown disease. It is estimated that over 80,000 Americans have \nsickle cell disease, with about 2,000 babies born with the disease each \nyear.\n  Sickle cell disease can result in tremendous personal difficulties. \nNatasha Thomas is a 36-year-old African-American woman from Baltimore, \nMD. She considers herself fortunate to have access to quality care. \nDespite some setbacks, she was able to complete middle school, high \nschool, and college, and she has been working consistently for 15 \nyears. She has had employers who have allowed her to take leave when \nshe has had sickle cell pain crises. Natasha admits that most of the \npeople she knows with sickle cell disease are not as fortunate as she \nis.\n  Even though she has access to specialized care, Natasha is \nhospitalized at least once a year with paralyzing pain from the \nocclusion of her blood vessels with sickle cells. In the hospital, she \nhas to undergo IV therapy with fluids and narcotic pain medicine. \nNatasha is grateful for the Maryland medical assistance program, which \nhas provided her with the necessary resources to get through difficult \nfinancial times when her condition flares up. She admits that if she \ndid not have coverage for specialized care, she would have likely had \nmany more pain flares and may have had to receive blood transfusions.\n  Sickle cell disease is not a new phenomenon. People have been living \nwith the disease for literally thousands of years. But in the last \ncentury, there have been remarkable advancements in diagnosis and \ntreatment of sickle cell disease.\n  In 1910, Dr. James B. Herrick, an attending physician at Presbyterian \nHospital and professor of medicine at Rush Medical College in Chicago, \npublished an article on the case of an anemic West Indian patient. \nHerrick's clinical and laboratory findings of the patient's ``peculiar \nelongated and sickle-shaped'' red blood corpuscles represent the first \ndescription of sickle cell disease in Western medical literature.\n  Since the discovery of the mutation responsible for sickle cell \ndisease in the 1950s, there has been a rapid expansion of technological \nand policy advances.\n  In 1975, the first statewide newborn screening was established in New \nYork.\n  In 1986, penicillin was found to be effective as a preventive \nstrategy against pneumococcal infection, a particularly dangerous \ninfection for people with sickle cell disease.\n  In 1995, the first effective drug treatment for adults with severe \nsickle cell anemia was reported in a multicenter National Heart, Lung, \nand Blood Institute study, including a team led by physicians from \nJohns Hopkins. The anticancer drug hydroxyurea was found to reduce the \nfrequency of painful crises, and patients taking the drug needed fewer \nblood transfusions.\n  In 1996, bone marrow transplantation was discovered to improve the \ncourse of sickle cell disease for select patients. A year later, blood \ntransfusions were found to help prevent stroke in patients.\n  At the turn of the millennium, the introduction of pneumococcal \nvaccine revolutionized the prevention of lethal infections in children \nand adults with sickle cell disease.\n  And in 2001, the first mouse model was developed demonstrating the \nusefulness of genetic therapy for sickle cell disease.\n  More recently, in 2007, scientists from the University of Alabama \nBirmingham and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed an \nanimal model for curing sickle cell disease. These scientists used skin \nstem cells to reprogram the bone marrow of mice to produce normal, \nhealthy blood cells.\n  I am proud to say that other scientists from Maryland have played an \nimportant role in advancing sickle cell disease research. Dr. Morton \nGoldberg, former head of the Wilmer Eye Institute in Baltimore, is \nconsidered the world's foremost expert in the diagnosis and treatment \nof eye disease due to sickle cell disease. Drs. Jim Casella and Robert \nBrodsky, both from Johns Hopkins, have made great strides toward \npreventing strokes in young children and searching for cures through \nstem cell transplants, respectively.\n  Improvements in sickle cell disease treatments have led to an \nincrease in life expectancy from 14 years in 1973 to the mid to late \n40s now. Innovation continues. As of October 2010, there were 240 \nongoing or recently completed NIH-funded trials exploring better \ndiagnosis or treatment of the disease. Under the leadership of its \nDirector, Dr. Francis Collins, the NIH is poised to continue to push \nthe envelope of scientific innovations toward finding a cure for sickle \ncell disease.\n\n  Despite all of these technological advances, sickle cell disease \nremains a significant problem. The annual cost of medical care for the \nnearly 80,000 individuals with sickle cell disease in the United States \nexceeds $1.1 billion. The average cost of care per month per patient is \nnearly $2,000. Studies show that for an average patient with sickle \ncell disease reaching age 45, the total health care costs are estimated \nto reach $950,000. What is worrisome is that additional costs \nassociated with reduced quality of life, uncompensated care, lost \nproductivity, and premature mortality push the costs well beyond $1 \nmillion per patient.\n  The enormous human and financial cost of this disease underscores the \nimportance of finding a safe cure for sickle cell disease. A worrying \nfinding in research is that conscious or unconscious racial bias \nadversely affects the availability of resources for research, delivery \nof care, and improvement of that care. I am particularly concerned \nbecause there is a significant gap in funding for more publicized but \nless prevalent diseases as compared to sickle cell disease.\n  This gap in funding was first addressed in 1970 by Dr. Robert Scott \nwhen he published landmark articles in the New England Journal of \nMedicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. \nScott's articles spurred congressional hearings that led to the passage \nof the first major legislation concerning sickle cell disease \ntreatment, the National Sickle Cell Disease Control Act of 1972.\n  Since passage of that act, the number of research grants for sickle \ncell disease has risen by a factor of 10. Despite increased research \ndollars for sickle cell disease and major advances in treatment, \nimportant gaps still exist in the equity of Federal funding allocation \nand in the provision of highly qualified clinical care. The disparity \nin funding sickle cell disease in the private sector is even more \npronounced than it is in the Federal Government.\n  But solely funding additional research is not enough. We need to be \nsure that the tools we develop for improving patients' lives are \navailable to everyone who needs them. Unfortunately, that is not \ncurrently the case.\n  For example, there is a sixteenfold mortality rate difference between \nStates with the highest and lowest death rates due to sickle cell \ndisease. In other words, depending on where you live, you may be 16 \ntimes more likely to die from sickle cell disease in one State than \nanother. I am proud to say that interventions such as mandatory newborn \nscreening developed by Dr. Susan Panny at the Maryland Department of \nHealth and Mental Hygiene have helped Maryland attain the lowest child \nmortality rate due to sickle cell disease in the Nation, with 1/10 the \nnumber of deaths compared to the national average.\n  Earlier, I mentioned Natasha Thomas. She is fortunate to have access \nto specialized treatment centers and rarely gets hospitalized for pain \ncrises.\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nShe's been able to maintain a job and says that she has a pretty good \nquality of life. She is a testament to the benefits of having access to \nnecessary treatments in Baltimore.\n  Natasha has a friend who is not so lucky. He wished to remain \nanonymous. Natasha's friend can't keep a job because he is frequently \nabsent from work due to hospitalizations from pain crises.\n  His condition is poorly controlled because he does not have access to \nspecialized care as does Natasha. Like so many others with sickle cell \ndisease, he is in catastrophic debt from medical bills due to his \ncondition. The difference between Natasha and her friend does not have \nto be a matter of luck. High quality treatments for sickle cell disease \nexist. We just need to make sure they are available to everyone that \nrequires them.\n  Besides our moral obligation to ensure that patients receive \nappropriate care, there is also an economic argument. Research showing \nthe high proportion of sickle cell disease costs associated with \ninpatient hospitalization suggest that interventions that reduce \ncomplications such as pain crises could be cost-saving.\n  We have made significant progress toward broadening coverage for all \nAmericans. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must \nensure that the implementation of health policy as it pertains to \nsickle cell disease is done with emphasis on high-quality, equitable \ncare. We need to make sure the standard of care is available to all and \nthat the guidelines permeate throughout the specialty and primary care \ncenters caring for patients with sickle cell disease.\n  We need to make sure that patients like Natasha's friend can get the \ncare they need. After all, of the nearly $112 billion spent annually on \nhospitalization for sickle cell disease, a significant portion can be \nreduced by lowering the complications resulting from hospitalization if \nexcellent care is uniformly provided.\n  With the recent codification of the Office of Minority Health at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, we can ensure that our \ninvestment in producing new knowledge is balanced by a similarly robust \ncommitment to universal and equitable diffusion of this knowledge. This \nway, all patients will reap the full benefit of our investment in \nresearch. In addition to sickle cell disease, the Office of Minority \nHealth will help us address many other issues pertaining to health \ndisparities.\n  Health disparities in our health care delivery system are a huge \nissue. Health disparities are differences in health among social, \neconomic, and racial or ethnic lines. Many disparities exist in our \ncountry. Let's look at disparity through the lens of life expectancy.\n  The life expectancy for African Americans is 5.3 years lower than \nWhites. Education also affects life expectancy. Individuals with \ncollege education can expect to live on average 6 years longer than \npeople who have never graduated from high school. The life expectancy \nof people over 400 percent of the Federal poverty level is on average 7 \nyears longer than those at or below the Federal poverty level.\n  These differences are stark, and we need to have a strategy to deal \nwith them. We need to know how we can reach out to the minority \ncommunities to deal with their special needs. In addition to codifying \nthe Office of Minority Health, the recently enacted health care reform \nbill supports a network of minority health offices located within HHS, \nand it elevated the National Center on Minority Health and Health \nDisparities at NIH from a center to an institute. The Offices of \nMinority Health will be essential for addressing health disparities in \nAmerica by monitoring health status, health care trends, and quality of \ncare among minority patients and evaluating the success of minority \nhealth programs and initiatives.\n  Over the next year I plan to return to the Senate floor to highlight \nhow we as a nation and the Office of Minority Health in particular can \ntackle health disparities. Through a series of presentations, I hope to \nraise awareness about the major health disparity issues in our country, \nand I hope to direct our attention to the proper implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act so the full potential of this legislation can be \nrealized.\n  I am proud of the progress we have made with the health care reform \nlegislation. I am proud of the creation of the Office of Minority \nHealth, and on this 100th anniversary of the discovery of sickle cell \ndisease, I commend the scientific and medical communities for their \ncontributions to diagnosis and treatment of this important condition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for perhaps 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nlegislation that will be required in order to bolster our Nation's \ncyber defenses and to protect our Nation's intellectual property from \npiracy and from theft.\n  In the course of my work on the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees, it has become all too clear that our laws have not kept \npace with the amazing technological developments we have seen, many \ninformation technologies over the past 15 or 20 years. Earlier this \nyear, I had the privilege of chairing the Intelligence Committee's \nbipartisan cyber task force, along with my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Snowe and Senator Mikulski, who made vital contributions and \nwere great teammates in that effort. We spent 6 months conducting a \nthorough review of the threat and the posture of the United States for \ncountering it.\n  Based on that review and my work on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nhave identified six areas in which there are overarching problems with \nthe current statutory framework for protecting our country. The first \nis a really basic one; that is, that current law does not adequately \nfacilitate or encourage public awareness about cyber threats. The \ngovernment keeps the damage we are sustaining from cyber attacks secret \nbecause it is classified. The private sector keeps the damage they are \nsustaining from cyber attacks secret so as not to look bad to \ncustomers, to regulators, and to investors. The net result of that is \nthat the American public gets left in the dark.\n  We do not even have a good public understanding of how extensive and \nsophisticated the cyber forces arrayed against America are. Between the \nefforts of foreign governments and international organized crime, we \nare a long way from the problem of hackers in the basement. It is a big \noperation that has been mounted against us, and I would like to be able \nto describe it more fully, but it is both unhelpfully and unnecessarily \nclassified, and so I can't even talk about that.\n  Americans are sadly uninformed about the extent of the risk and the \nextent of the capacity that is being used against us. If Americans \nunderstood the threat and the vital role they themselves can play in \nprotecting themselves and the country, I think we would all be more \nlikely to engage in the cyber equivalent of routine maintenance. People \nwould understand and they would support legislative changes which we \nneed to protect our intellectual property and our national \ninfrastructure.\n  One of the principal findings of our cyber task force was that most \ncyber threats--literally the vast majority of cyber threats--can be \ncountered readily if Americans simply allowed automatic updates to \ntheir computer software, ran up-to-date antivirus programs, and \nexercised reasonable vigilance when surfing the Web and opening e-\nmails. So we need far more reporting from the government and the \nprivate sector to let Americans know what is happening out there on the \nwild Web. Disclosures can be anonymized, where necessary, to safeguard \nnational security or protect competitive business interests. But\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nbasic facts, putting Americans on notice of the extent of the present \ndanger and harm, need to be disclosed.\n  Second, we need, beyond just public information, to create a \nstructure of rights and responsibilities where the public, consumers, \ntechnology companies, software manufacturers, and Internet service \nproviders are all able to take appropriate roles for us to maintain \nthose basic levels of cyber security. The notion that the Internet is \nan open highway with toll takers who have no responsibility for what \ncomes down the highway, no responsibility no matter how menacing, no \nresponsibility no matter how piratical, no responsibility no matter how \ndangerous can no longer be valid. We protect each other on our physical \nhighways with basic rules of the road and we need a similar code for \nthe information highway.\n  Australia's ISPs have negotiated a cyber security code of conduct, \nand ISPs in compliance with the code can display a trust mark. That is \none idea worth exploring. But one way or the other, there needs to be a \ncode of conduct for safe travel on the information highway just as \nthere is on our geographic highways.\n  Third, we need to better empower our private sector to defend itself. \nWhen an industry comes together against cyber attackers to circle the \nwagons, to share information, and to engage in a common defense against \nthose cyber attackers, we should help and not hinder that private \nsector effort. Legal barriers to broader information sharing among \nprivate sector entities and between the private sector and government \nmust be lowered. I believe we can encourage cyber security in this \nway--common defense within the private sector--without undermining \nother areas of public policy. But it is not going to be a simple task, \nand we will have to work our way through it because those other areas \nof public policy are serious areas--antitrust protection, the \nsafeguarding of intellectual property, protecting legal privileges, \nliability concerns, and even national security concerns in those areas \nwhere the government may be asked to share classified information.\n  Bear in mind that there are three levels of threat. As I have said, \nthe vast majority of our cyber vulnerabilities can be cured by simple \npatches and off-the-shelf technology. That is the lowest level--just \nfollow basic, simple procedures and we can rid ourselves of most of the \nattacking. The next is a more sophisticated set of threats that require \nthe best efforts of the private sector to defend against. Those private \nsector efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated and capable. As \nto those types of attacks, the private sector can handle them alone and \nparticularly so if we have empowered the private sector, industry by \nindustry, to engage in more effective common defense and information \nsharing. The most sophisticated threats and attacks, however, will \nrequire action by our government. The notion that we can leave our \nNation's cyber defense entirely to the private sector is no longer \nvalid.\n  This brings us to a fourth question--the increasingly important issue \nof cyber 911. When the CIO of a local bank or electric utility is \noverwhelmed by a cyber attack, whom do they call and under what terms \ndoes the government respond? Right now, the answers to those questions \nare dangerously vague. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act--or \nECPA--is a vitally important statute. In 1986, 25 years ago, Chairman \nPatrick Leahy worked hard to establish statutory privacy protections in \na domain where constitutional privacy protections were weak.\n  It is an enduring legislative accomplishment and we must preserve its \ncore principles. Since ECPA was enacted, however, the threat has \ndramatically changed. Imagine how technology has changed in 25 years. \nIt is no longer true that private firms are capable of defending their \nnetworks from sophisticated thieves and spies on their own.\n  As we found in the Cyber Task Force, there is now a subset of threats \nthat cannot be countered without bringing to bear the U.S. Government's \nunique authorities and capabilities. There always needs to be strong \nprivacy protections for Americans against the government. But we do let \nfiremen into our house when it is on fire and the police can come into \nour house when there is a burglar. A similar principle should apply to \ncriminals and cyber attacks when private capabilities are overwhelmed.\n  There is one more step, and here is where it gets a little bit more \ntricky. You call 9-1-1 and the police or the ambulance rushes right \nover. But in cyber security, by the time you call cyber\n9-1-1, it may be too late. Attacks in cyberspace happen at light speed, \nas fast as electrons flow. Not all the risks and harms that imperil \nAmericans can be averted by action after the fact. Some attacks are \nactually already there, in our networks, lying in wait for the signal \nto activate.\n  We as a country are naked and vulnerable to some forms of attack if \nwe have not predeployed our defenses. Because the viruses and cyber \nattack nodes can travel in the text portion of messages, we have to \nsort out a difficult question: whether, and if so how and when, the \ngovernment can scan for dangerous viruses and attack signals.\n  In medieval times, communities protected their core infrastructure \nfrom raiders by locating the well, the granary, and the treasury inside \ncastle walls. Not everything needs the same level of protection in \ncyberspace, but we need to sort out what does need that kind of \nprotection, what the castle walls should look like, who gets allowed to \nreside inside the walls, and what the rules are.\n  That leads to the question of a dot-secure domain. I have mentioned \nthis before, but I would like to highlight it as an option for \nimproving cyber security, particularly of the critical infrastructure \nof our country.\n  Recently, General Alexander, Director of the NSA and commander of \nU.S. Cyber Command, has echoed this as a possibility. His predecessor \nat NSA, and a former Director of National Intelligence, Admiral \nMcConnell, is also an advocate of such a domain for critical \ninfrastructure. This doesn't have to be complicated or even mandatory. \nThe most important value of a dot-secure domain is that, like dot-gov \nand dot-mil, now we can satisfy consent under the fourth amendment \nsearch requirements for the government's defenses to do their work \nwithin that domain, their work of screening for attack signals, \nbotnets, and viruses. Critical infrastructure sites could bid for \npermission to protect themselves with the dot-secure domain label and \nbe allowed in if they could show that lives and safety for Americans \nwould be protected by allowing them entry. Obviously, core elements of \nour electric grid, of our financial, transportation, and communications \ninfrastructure would be obvious candidates. But we simply cannot leave \nthat core infrastructure on which the life and death of Americans \ndepends without better security.\n  Fifth, we must significantly strengthen law enforcement against cyber \ncrooks. There is simply no better deterrent against cyber crime than a \nprospect of a long stretch in prison. We need to put more cyber crooks \nbehind bars. It is not for want of ingenuity and commitment by our \nprofessionals that there are not more cyber crooks behind bars.\n  During my work on the Cyber Task Force, I received a number of \nbriefings and intelligence reports on cyber crime. The FBI and the \nDepartment of Justice have some real success stories under their belts, \nsuch as the arrests of the alleged perpetrators behind the Mariposa \nbotnet this summer, and our agencies are beginning to work together \nbetter and better over the lines of turf defense that separate them.\n  The problem is, the criminals are also ingenious and they are greedy \nand they are successful and they are astoundingly well funded. Again, \nwe are not talking about hackers in the basement. We are talking about \nsubstantial criminal enterprise with enormous sums of money at their \ndisposal and at stake.\n  Many enterprises appear to work hand-in-hand with foreign \ngovernments, which puts even greater assets for attack at their \ndisposal. They have a big advantage. The architecture of the Internet \nfavors offense over defense. Technologically, it is generally easier \nfor savvy criminals to attack a network and to hide their trail than it \nis for savvy defenders to block an attack and trace it back to the \ncriminals. We are not on a level playing field against cyber criminals. \nThat is the\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\nproblem not easily overcome. What we can overcome, however, are the \ngaps, the weaknesses, the outdated strategies, and the inadequate \nresources in our own legal investigative processes.\n  One example: the most dangerous cyber criminals are usually located \noverseas. To identify, investigate, and ultimately prosecute those \ncriminals under traditional law enforcement authorities, we have to \nrely on complex and cumbersome international processes and treaties \nestablished decades ago that are far too slow for the modern cyber \ncrime environment.\n  We also need to resource and focus criminal investigation and \nprosecution at a level commensurate with the fact that we, America, are \nnow on the losing end of what is probably the biggest transfer of \nwealth through theft and piracy in human history.\n  I will say that again: We are at the losing end of what is probably \nthe biggest transfer of wealth through theft and piracy in human \nhistory.\n  I am pleased that in fiscal year 2010 the FBI received an additional \n260 cyber security analysis and investigative positions. DOJ's Computer \nCrimes and Intellectual Property Section has not received new resources \nin 5 years. With the FBI poised to ramp up its investigatory actions \nagainst our cyber adversaries, I am concerned the DOJ may not have the \nresources to keep up.\n  Sixth, we need clear rules of engagement for our government to deal \nwith foreign threats. That is, unfortunately, a discussion for another \nday since so much of this area is now deeply classified. But here is \none example: Can we adapt traditional doctrines of deterrence to cyber \nattacks when we may not know for sure which country or nonstate actor \ncarried out the attack? If we can't attribute, how can we deter?\n  With respect to any policy of deterrence, how can it stand on rules \nof engagement that the attacker does not know of? Not only do we need \nto establish clear rules of engagement, we need to establish and \ndisclose clear rules of engagement if any policy of deterrence is to be \neffective in cyberspace.\n  Finally, as we go about these six tasks, the government must be as \ntransparent as possible with the American people. I doubt very much \nthat the Obama administration would abuse new authorities in cyberspace \nto violate Americans' civil liberties. But on principle, I firmly and \nstrongly believe that maximum transparency to the public and rigorous \ncongressional oversight are essential. We have to go about this right.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and with the \nadministration as the Congress moves toward comprehensive cyber \nsecurity legislation to protect our country before a great cyber attack \nshould befall us.\n  Let me close my remarks by saying the most somber question we need to \nface is resilience.\n  First, resilience of governance: How could we maintain command and \ncontrol, run 9-1-1, operate FEMA, deploy local police and fire \nservices, and activate and direct the National Guard if all of our \nsystems are down?\n  Second, resilience of society: How do we make sure people have \nconfidence during a prolonged attack that food, water, warmth, and \nshelter will remain available? Because the Internet supports so many \ninterdependent systems, a massive or prolonged attack could cascade \nacross sectors, compromising or taking over our communications systems, \nour financial systems, our utility grid, and the transportation and \ndelivery of the basic necessities of American life.\n  Third, our American resilience as individuals: Think about it. Your \npower is out and has been for a week. Your phone is silent. Your laptop \nis dark. You have no access to your bank account. No store is accepting \ncredit cards. Indeed, the corner store has closed its doors and the \nowner is sitting inside with a shotgun to protect against looters. \nGasoline supply is rationed with National Guard soldiers keeping order \nat the pumps. Your children are cold and hungry and scared. How, then, \ndo you behave?\n  I leave this last question, our resilience as a government, as a \nsociety, and as individuals to another day. But I mention it to \nhighlight the potentially catastrophic nature of a concerted and \nprolonged cyber attack. Again, such an attack could cascade across \nmultiple sectors and could interrupt all of the different necessities \non which we rely.\n  When your power is down, it is an inconvenience but you can usually \ncall somebody on the phone. Now the phone is out, so you can go to the \nlaptop and try to e-mail somebody, but there is no signal on the \nlaptop. You need cash. You go to the ATM. It is down. The bank is not \nopen because a run would take place against its cash assets, given the \nfact that it can no longer reliably electronically let its customers \nknow what their bank account balances are.\n  We are up against a very significant threat. I hope some of the \nguideposts I have laid out will be helpful in designing the necessary \nlegislation we need to put in place to empower our country to \nsuccessfully defend against these sorts of attacks.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Robert ``Bob'' \nForbuss for his service to the people of Nevada. Tomorrow evening, at \nits Annual Convention and Tradeshow in Las Vegas, the American \nAmbulance Association will honor Mr. Forbuss for his many years of work \non behalf of ambulance services in Nevada and throughout the Nation. \nToday I am happy to call the attention of the Senate to the selfless \nservice that my good friend has rendered to the State of Nevada.\n  Bob is a native Nevadan who has served this community for nearly four \ndecades as an educator, elected official, businessman, and community \nadvocate. After earning his degrees in political science and public \nadministration from Long Beach State University, Bob returned to Las \nVegas and began his professional career as a teacher at Bishop Gorman \nHigh School from 1972-1979. He then served on the Clark County School \nBoard of Trustees for 8 years and was an influential advocate for \neducation initiatives in Southern Nevada. For his many years of service \nto education in Nevada, Bob was eventually honored by the Clark County \nSchool District in the naming of the Robert L. Forbuss Elementary \nSchool. It is fitting that such a fine educator will forever have his \nname stamped on the hearts of the students that attend Forbuss \nElementary School.\n  During his tenure at Bishop Gorman, Bob became an emergency medical \ntechnician, EMT, and worked during his summer breaks for Mercy Medical \nServices. He quickly worked his way through the managerial ranks of \nMercy and eventually became an owner of the company. Mercy soon became \na flagship and model operation in the United States for paramedic \nservices and Bob became a recognized leader in EMS Services, winning \nnumerous awards and becoming a popular speaker at national conferences.\n  One of his greatest achievements, and the one for which he is being \nrecognized tomorrow evening, has been his work on behalf of the \nAmerican Ambulance Association, AAA. The AAA was formed in response to \nthe need for improvements in medical transportation and emergency \nmedical services. Bob was an original founder of the AAA, and he later \nserved as the organization's president. I have no doubt that throughout \nhis presidency, and the subsequent years of service that followed, he \nhas labored diligently to ensure that our Nation's ambulatory systems \nhave the resources they need to serve our families, friends, and \ncommunities.\n  Today, I express my sincere thanks to my dear friend for the noble \nwork that he has performed over the years.\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nBob Forbuss has touched the lives of countless Nevadans and others \nthroughout our Nation, and in so doing has established a legacy of \nservice for all to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, this past weekend produced the first \nheartening news out of Burma in recent memory. Coming just days after \nthe junta held its charade-like elections, this past Saturday Aung San \nSuu Kyi was released from house arrest where she had spent 15 of the \npast 21 years.\n  While fellow advocates of democracy in Burma rightly rejoice in her \nbeing freed, our feelings of joy and relief are tempered by several \nsobering concerns. First, there is the matter of her safety. We all \nremember the brutal attack against her in 2003. That must not be \npermitted to happen again. Second, we know Suu Kyi has been released in \nthe past only to be later detained on trumped-up charges. We want her \nrelease to be permanent, not temporary. Third, although she was granted \nunconditional release, it remains to be seen whether the regime will \ntolerate her active participation in public affairs. And that is \nessential for Burma to undertake any meaningful progress toward \ndemocracy. Finally, while Suu Kyi has been released from detention, \nmore than 2,000 other prisoners of conscience remain imprisoned in \nBurma. Only when all are unconditionally freed can the people of Burma \ntruly begin the process of democratic reform and reconciliation.\n  Make no mistake, the release of Suu Kyi is a positive step forward in \nBurma. Yet it is only the first--and by no means the final--step that \nmust take place in that beleaguered country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7947-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7947-S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of a \nfriend and former colleague, former Senator Ted Stevens, who passed \naway this August in a plane crash. I know that I speak for all of my \ncolleagues when I say how difficult it was to receive news of Ted's \npassing this summer, and I would like to take this moment to convey my \nheartfelt condolences to everyone who knew, worked with, and enjoyed \nTed during his life.\n  I believe that Ted will long be remembered as a man of the Senate. \nFirst appointed to his seat more than four decades ago, Ted Stevens \nbecame the longest-serving Republican in the history of this body in \n2007. Throughout his tenure in Washington, Ted served in a number of \nkey leadership positions, including as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and as President pro tempore.\n  Over the years, I had the pleasure of being able to collaborate with \nTed on a number of critically important issues, including, perhaps most \nrecently, legislation that I introduced during the 110th Congress to \nprovide paid leave to workers under the auspices of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. And while Ted and I did not substantively agree on \nmuch, he didn't shy away from reaching out across the partisan divide \nto get things done. In fact, it was his willingness to work with \nDemocrats--to seek out common ground and compromise on areas of \ncontention when necessary--that made him such a prolific, effective, \nand well-respected member of this body.\n  The incredibly strong bonds Ted forged with his colleagues over the \nyears were in full display at his memorial service in Alaska over the \nsummer. I made the trip up north to attend his funeral, and I found it \nincredibly moving to hear the words of Ted's longtime friend, my \ncolleague Senator Inouye, who delivered Ted's eulogy, and our Vice \nPresident Joe Biden, who also made some remarks during the service. \nClearly, this was a person who left not only an indelible mark on the \nSenate as a body, but on many of the individual Senators who had the \nopportunity to serve with him over the years.\n  That was certainly the case for me. Years ago, Ted Stevens and I \nparticipated in the U.S.-Canadian interparliamentary meeting together. \nIt was one of the most enjoyable 4 days I spent in my 30 years in the \nSenate for one simple reason--in addition to all his substantive \ntalents, Ted Stevens was great fun--he loved his family, Alaska, his \ncountry and his friends.\n  And on that last point, while it is true that Ted was a creature of \nthe Senate, I believe Ted Stevens will be remembered far into the \nfuture first and foremost as a man of Alaska. Ted truly loved his home \nState, and over the years, he cultivated a strong reputation as one of \nits greatest champions.\n  Indeed, Ted's own life was inextricably linked to many of the major \nevents and advancements that occurred in Alaska's history over the past \nhalf century. Having served with distinction in World War II as a pilot \nfor the U.S. Army Air Corps in Asia, Ted graduated from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1950 and moved to Fairbanks to practice law. Several years \nlater, Ted was brought on to work for the Interior Department under \nPresident Eisenhower. In that capacity, Ted advocated very persistently \nfor Alaskan statehood, finally helping make that goal a reality in \n1959. Later on, as a Senator, Ted once again worked hard on behalf of \nhis State, its people and interests, fighting to direct federal \nresources to that vast, sparsely populated, and incredibly beautiful \ncorner of our country.\n  Ted viewed himself as Alaska's chief advocate here in Washington, and \nthroughout his four decades in the Senate, he never deviated from that \nmission. Known by many of the Alaskans he helped over the years simply \nas ``Uncle Ted,'' Ted Stevens was singularly devoted to serving his \nconstituents and ensuring their needs and concerns were given a voice \non Capitol Hill. And it is that level of dedication to the people who \nsent him here to represent their interests that will ultimately be Ted \nStevens' greatest legacy.\n  Once again, I would like to express my sincere condolences to Ted's \nwife Catherine; his children Susan, Elizabeth, Walter, Theodore, Ben, \nand Lily; and his 11 grandchildren. And I would also like to take this \nopportunity to thank Ted for his years of tireless and selfless service \non behalf of his State and country.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this past summer the people of Alaska lost \none of its favorite sons, and many of us in the U.S. Senate lost one of \nour mentors and friends. His name was Senator Ted Stevens.\n  By the time I took my seat in this Chamber, Senator Stevens had \nalready held his for more than three decades. He chaired numerous \ncommittees, served as President pro tempore, and was widely regarded as \none of the most gifted parliamentarians on our side of the aisle. His \nforty years of service is the longest tenure of any Republican in the \nhistory of the United States Senate.\n  Senator Stevens championed landmark legislation that has transformed \nAlaska, America, and the world. He helped settle land claims of Native \nAmericans, guard fisheries and protect natural wonders of his home \nState. He helped guide the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act into law, which \nhas dramatically improved our Nation's energy security. He helped \nstrengthen our Armed Forces to defend America's interests and values. \nHe helped reform the United States Olympic Committee, and has given \ngenerations of American athletes the chance to succeed at the highest \nlevels of international competition.\n  Ted Stevens' devotion to his adopted home State extended well beyond \nhis service in Washington. After earning a Distinguished Flying Cross \nin World War II and graduating from Harvard Law School, he served as \nU.S. attorney in Fairbanks. In 1958, as legislative counsel for the \nDepartment of the Interior here in Washington, he helped shepherd \nAlaska's Statehood Act into law. In 1999, his State's legislature named \nhim the ``Alaskan of the Century.'' As one of his family members put \nit, the legacy of Ted Stevens is the 49th star on the American flag.\n  Four other individuals perished in the plane crash that claimed the \nlife of Senator Ted Stevens on August 9, and we pray for all those who \nlost loved ones on that night. Sandy and I especially keep in our \nhearts those whom Ted Stevens loved most: his wife Catherine, his 6 \nchildren, his 11 grandchildren, and the nearly 700,000 Alaskans who \ncherish the memory of ``Uncle Ted.''\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7948-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Ingles DosReis\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SSG \nIngles DosReis, who was tragically killed on August 28, 2009, while \nserving at Aviano Air Base in Italy.\n  Staff Sergeant DosReis enlisted in the Air Force in February 2005, \nimmediately following his graduation from high school. He was a member \nof the 51st Security Forces Squadron stationed out of Osan Air Base in \nSouth Korea from August 2005 until August 2006. He was subsequently \ntransferred to the 31st Security Forces Squadron at Aviano Air Base, \nwhere he started as an installation entry controller. He deployed to \nIraq in August 2007 and received the Army Achievement Medal for his \nservice. Staff Sergeant DosReis served in Iraq until February 2008 and \nupon his return he became a certified desk sergeant at Aviano Air Base. \nHe was posthumously promoted by the Air Force to the permanent grade of \nstaff sergeant in August 2009.\n  Staff Sergeant DosReis' family fondly remembers him as an intelligent \nand kindhearted man and a loving husband to his wife Katherine and \nfather to his son Christian. A great athlete, Staff Sergeant DosReis \nspent much of his childhood playing basketball and had a passion for \nsports. He was also a natural student, earning honors in high school \nand later going on to take classes at the Community College of the Air \nForce with a major in political science.\n  Over a year has passed since SSG Ingles DosReis was tragically taken \nfrom those who love him. Today, I join Staff Sergeant DosReis' family \nand friends in commemorating his life by entering his name in the \nRecord. As a member of the Air Force, he showed his loyalty and \ncommitment to freedom and peace and today we honor his service and \nsacrifice for our country.\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Irvin M. Ceniceros\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor of LCpl Irvin M. \nCeniceros, 21, of Clarksville, who died on October 14, 2010, while \nsupporting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n  My heart goes out to the family of Lance Corporal Ceniceros, who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. Along with all \nArkansans, I am grateful for his service and for the sacrifice he and \nhis family have made. I am committed to ensuring that all of our \nveterans always have the full support they need and deserve, and I can \nassure our brave soldiers and their families that our grateful Nation \nwill not forget them when their military service is complete.\n  More than 11,000 Arkansans on active duty and more than 10,000 \nArkansas Reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September \n11, 2001. These men and women have shown tremendous courage and \nperseverance through the most difficult of times. As neighbors, as \nArkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent upon us to do everything \nwe can to honor their service and to provide for them and their \nfamilies, not only when they are in harm's way but also when they \nreturn home. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.\n  Lance Corporal Ceniceros was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine \nRegiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp \nPendleton, CA.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Carlos A. Benitez\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SSG Carlos A. Benitez. Staff \nSergeant Benitez, who was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Division, in Fort Carson, CO, died on October 14, 2010, from \ninjuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near \nhis vehicle. Staff Sergeant Benitez was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom in Afghanistan. He was 24 years old.\n  A native of Carrollton, TX, Staff Sergeant Benitez graduated from \nCreekview High School and joined the Army in October 2004. He served \nthree tours of duty: two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan--all with \ndecoration. His wife and young daughter and son moved to Colorado for \nStaff Sergeant Benitez's most recent assignment.\n  During 5 years of service, Staff Sergeant Benitez distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any job. He was awarded numerous awards and medals, including \ntwo Army Commendation Medals, the Valorous Unit Award, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, and \nthe Iraq Campaign Medal with four Campaign Stars.\n  Staff Sergeant Benitez worked on the front lines of battle, serving \nin the most dangerous areas of Iraq and Afghanistan. He is remembered \nby those who knew him as a consummate professional with an unending \ncommitment to excellence. Friends and loved ones remember his \ncommitment to his wife. His mother, Imelda, remembers how her son \nwanted to enlist in the Army when he was just 17. She made him wait an \nextra year.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Staff \nSergeant Benitez's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Iraq and Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield \nwas uncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Staff Sergeant Benitez will forever be remembered as one of \nour country's bravest.\n  To Staff Sergeant Benitez's wife, their children, and his entire \nfamily--I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, \nin time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in Carlos's \nservice and by your knowledge that his country will never forget him. \nWe are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7948-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7948-S7949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the following letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding S. 2925, Domestic \n     Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of \n     2010.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe \n     slavery, in any form, is morally reprehensible. Sex \n     trafficking is a global epidemic, and we should endeavor to \n     eliminate this industry, especially due to its effects on \n     minors who are victims of this practice. However, I believe \n     we can and must do so in a fiscally responsible manner that \n     upholds the Constitution. My concerns are included in, but \n     not limited to, those outlined in this letter.\n       While the Judiciary Committee considered and amended this \n     bill in its Executive Business Meeting, making some positive \n     changes, I still have several concerns with the committee-\n     reported language. First, although the new grant program \n     created by this legislation will be inserted into existing \n     trafficking law, the bill extends the current funding \n     authorization period. The Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) established the current \n     law regarding trafficking, but its funding authorizations \n     expire in 2011. However, in combining this bill's new grant \n     program with existing TVPRA grants, it also extends the \n     grant's authorization through 2014. Thus, the bill authorizes \n     new spending of $15 million per year from 2012-2014, totaling \n     $45 million that is not offset by reductions in real spending \n     elsewhere in the federal government.\n       It is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future \n     standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $13 trillion. \n     That means over $43,000 in debt for each man, woman and child \n     in the United States. A year ago, the national debt was $10.2 \n     trillion. Despite pledges to control spending, Washington \n     added $4.6 billion to the national debt every single day last \n     year--that is $3.2 million every single minute.\n       Second, the Sex Trafficking Block Grants in S. 2925 go \n     beyond the responsibility of the federal government by \n     allowing grantees to use grant money for activities that are \n     rightly the responsibility of individual states. The grants \n     may be used to provide clothing, daily necessities, \n     counseling and legal services to trafficking victims. They \n     may also be used to provide training for state and local law \n     enforcement officers and social service providers. Finally, \n     the grants may be used to fund salaries for state and local \n     law enforcement officers and prosecutors, as well as \n     investigation expenses for\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\n     minor sex trafficking cases prosecuted by the state. All of \n     these expenses can and should be provided by the states, not \n     the federal government.\n       I agree the problem of sex trafficking, particularly when \n     the victims are children, is an important issue both state \n     and federal governments should address. As ranking member of \n     the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee, I have seen the \n     effects of the sex trade industry both internationally and \n     domestically. As it pertains to domestic child sex \n     trafficking victims, however, I believe the federal \n     government should not be the primary provider of services for \n     these victims.\n       Most cases involving child sex trafficking are prosecuted \n     at the state level, while the federal government typically \n     only joins cases involving large sex trafficking rings that \n     often include other federal criminal activity. As a result, I \n     have concerns that this legislation places too great of a \n     burden on the federal government to provide funding for \n     trafficking victims' services. In addition, the bill allows \n     grant funds to be used in many ways beyond basic services \n     that I believe both detract from the goal of assisting \n     victims and duplicates funding already provided by other \n     federal grant programs.\n       Third, only 50% of the grant funds are required to go \n     toward actual victims' services. The other 50% can be used \n     for salaries for state law enforcement officers and \n     prosecutors, as well as state trial and investigation \n     expenses. While I do not support the federal funding of food, \n     clothing and other daily necessities for these victims, by \n     refusing to require a higher percentage of the grant to go \n     toward these types of direct victims' services, the bill does \n     not fulfill its goal.\n       Finally, while I was encouraged by some of the compromise \n     language that was included in the bill the Judiciary \n     Committee ultimately passed, such as inserting the bill's \n     grant program into an existing federal program to avoid some \n     of the overlap and direct duplication it initially created, \n     there remain several broad Justice Department grant programs \n     that can be used for the purposes outlined in this bill's \n     grant program. All of the Edward Byrne Grant programs, \n     including the Discretionary Grants or earmarks, the Community \n     Oriented Policing Service (COPS) grants and multiple juvenile \n     justice grants offered through the Office of Juvenile Justice \n     and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) contain broad language \n     that would allow these grants to be used for the purposes \n     outlined in S. 2925.\n       While there is no question that the sex trafficking \n     industry has lifelong, horrific effects on its victims, \n     particularly minors, both federal and state governments bear \n     the burden of addressing this issue. It is the states who \n     should provide funding for the permissible purposes under \n     this bill's grant program, as it is state and local agencies \n     which have the responsibility to carry out these services. \n     Furthermore, the federal government already provides funding \n     to address trafficking issues, and grant programs are \n     available to state and local governments that can be used to \n     help sex trafficking victims. Congress should, like many \n     American individuals and companies do with their own \n     resources, evaluate current programs, determine any needs \n     that may exist and prioritize those needs for funding by \n     cutting from the federal budget programs fraught with waste, \n     fraud, abuse and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A.

Mr. President, last June, Senator Hatch and I introduced S. \n3538, the National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act. This bill \nresponds to the concern expressed by former Director of National \nIntelligence Mike McConnell that ``[i]f we were in a cyber war today, \nthe United States would lose.''\n  The bill is built on three principles. First, we must be clear about \nwhere Congress should, and, more importantly, should not legislate. \nSecond, there must be one person in charge--someone outside the \nExecutive Office of the President who is unlikely to claim executive \nprivilege, but who has real authority to coordinate our government \ncyber security efforts. Third, we need a voluntary public-private \npartnership to facilitate sharing cyber threat information, research, \nand technical support.\n  Since filing the bill, we have continued to work with government, \nindustry, and privacy experts in making sure that the solutions \nidentified in this bill are effective. There are many different \nopinions out there on how best to tackle the cyber security problems we \nface, and so we remain open to looking at ideas for improving the bill. \nEarlier today, we filed a substitute amendment to S. 3538 that \nincorporates a number of these suggested improvements. It has been \nreferred to committee.\n  The original bill would have housed the National Cyber Center \nadministratively in the Department of Defense so as to reduce start-up \ncosts and logistics. We appreciate the concerns some may have with the \nappearance we are militarizing cyber security, so our substitute \ncreates the center as a stand-alone entity, like the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence. In this way, it will be clear we are \nnot militarizing cyber security and one department does not have the \ninside track over any other when it comes to securing our government \nnetworks. In order to make sure there is appropriate input from DOD and \nDHS, we are also creating two deputy directors, instead of one, with \neach appointed by the respective Secretaries with the concurrence of \nthe Director of the National Cyber Center.\n  Second, the Cyber Defense Alliance is a pivotal component for \nencouraging government and the private sector to collaborate and share \ninformation on cyber-related matters. We recognize that the private \nsector is often on the front lines of cyber attacks, so any information \nthey can provide to increase government awareness of the source and \nnature of cyber threats will make both government and the private \nsector stronger. The corollary to this is that the government must \nshare its own cyber threat information, including classified or \ndeclassified intelligence, with the private sector.\n  All of this sharing can raise significant privacy concerns. So, in \nresponse to suggestions we have heard, our substitute bill adds \nlanguage to clarify that at least one of the private sector members of \nthe board of directors must have experience in civil liberties matters. \nWe believe this will ensure that privacy concerns are taken seriously \nat the very top levels of the Alliance. We all have an interest in \nmaking sure that threat information is shared, but we also have an \ninterest in making sure that no one's privacy rights are violated.\n  The next Congress needs to focus on passing effective cyber \nlegislation. I believe that S. 3538, as amended, provides a solid \nstarting point for that effort. The bill addresses the most pressing \nneeds: it puts someone outside the White House in charge of cyber \npolicy and the Federal cyber budget; it provides a national cyber \ncenter that can oversee and coordinate cybersecurity for dot.gov and \ndot.mil; and it creates a public-private partnership that will harness \nthe creativity of the private sector to better protect our dot.com \nnetworks.\n  Congress should avoid the temptation to overlegislate in this area. \nWe need to walk before we can run. Once this basic cyber infrastructure \nis established, it will bring the leading public and private cyber \nexperts together to shape cyber activities and policies. These experts \nwill then be in an ideal position to advise Congress and the \nadministration on the need for any additional steps to ensure our \ncybersecurity.\n  I thank my good friend Senator Hatch for his close collaboration on \nthis legislation. I know he will be an effective advocate for this \napproach when the bill is filed in the next Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7949-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7949-S7952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently I spoke to the Senate on the \noccasion of the consideration of the nomination of Jane Branstetter \nStranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit. It was nearly 10 months \nafter her nomination was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that Senate Republicans finally consented to a time agreement \nand vote, despite the support of the senior Senator from Tennessee, a \nmember of the Republican leadership. Nevertheless, I said then that if \nconsideration of the Stranch nomination, after months of needless \ndelay, represented a bipartisan willingness to return to the Senate's \ntradition of offering advice and consent without extensive delays, I \nwelcomed it. I urged the Senate to consider the other 16 judicial \nnominations then on the Senate Executive Calendar favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee without further delay.\n  Regrettably, since Judge Stranch was approved by a bipartisan \nmajority on September 13, the Senate has not considered a single \nadditional judicial nomination, although some were reported as long ago \nas January. Indeed,\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nduring the rest of this work period the list of judicial nominations \nstalled on the calendar has grown to 23, including 16 that were \nreported by the committee unanimously. Meanwhile judicial vacancies \naround the country continue to rise and now number 104. These include \n48 vacancies that the Judicial Conference has designated as judicial \nemergencies.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace set by a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate considering President Bush's nominations during his first 2 \nyears in office. Republicans have allowed the Senate to consider and \nconfirm only 41 of President Obama's circuit and district court \nnominations over the last 2 years. In stark contrast, by this date in \nPresident Bush's second year in office, the Senate with a Democratic \nmajority had confirmed 78 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominations. That number reached 100 by the end of 2002, all considered \nand confirmed during the 17 months I chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  During those 17 months, I scheduled 26 hearings for the judicial \nnominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee worked \ndiligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama \nadministration, I have tried to maintain that same approach, and the \ncommittee has held 25 hearings for President Obama's Federal circuit \nand district court nominees. I have not altered my approach and neither \nhave the Senate Democrats.\n  One thing that has changed is that we have been able to hold hearings \nfor nominees more regularly because we now receive the paperwork on the \nnominations, the nominee's completed questionnaire, the confidential \nbackground investigation and the America Bar Association, ABA, peer \nreview almost immediately after a nomination is made, allowing us to \nproceed. During 2001 and 2002, President Bush abandoned the procedure \nthat President Eisenhower had adopted and that had been used by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, President Reagan and all Presidents for \nmore than 50 years. Instead, President George W. Bush delayed the start \nof the ABA peer review process until after the nomination was sent to \nthe Senate. That added weeks and months to the timeline in which \nhearings were able to be scheduled on nominations.\n  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee midway through \nPresident Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked very hard to \nmake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the ``judge wars'' as \ntit-for-tat. Despite that fact that Senate Republicans pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nand refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed \nduring the Clinton administration to more than 110, in 2001 and 2002, \nduring the 17 months I chaired the committee during President Bush's \nfirst 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his \njudicial nominees.\n  By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations while \njudicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled the \npace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed vacancies to rise to \nmore than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of \ntheir strategy, Federal circuit court vacancies doubled. When Democrats \nregained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year \nin office, we turned away from these bad practices. As a result, \noverall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more \nthan 10 percent to less than four percent. During the Bush years, the \nFederal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit \ncourt vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.\n  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in \noffice. Instead, Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy they \nused during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a \nDemocratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last \nyear the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court \njudges, the lowest total in 50 years. This year we have yet to confirm \n30 Federal circuit and district judges. We are not even keeping up with \nretirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies are, again, \nover 100 and, again, more than 10 percent.\n  This trend should alarm the American people who expect justice from \nthe Federal courts. I will ask consent to have printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my statement a recent column by Attorney General Eric \nHolder about the cost to the American system of justice. He writes:\n\n       The federal judicial system that has been a rightful source \n     of pride for the United States--the system on which we all \n     depend for a prompt and fair hearing of our cases when we \n     need to call on the law--is stressed to the breaking point.\n       Last year, 259,000 civil cases and 75,000 criminal cases \n     were filed in the federal courts, enough to tax the abilities \n     of the judiciary even when it is fully staffed. But today \n     there are 103 judicial vacancies--nearly one in eight seats \n     on the bench. Men and women who need their day in court must \n     stand in longer and longer lines.\n\n  I will also ask consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement a recent article that appeared on Slate by \nDahlia Lithwick and Professor Carl Tobias, pointing out that thousands \nof hard-working Americans seeking justice in our courts bear the cost \nof justice delayed and denied as a result of vacant courtrooms and \noverburdened judges. Many senior and retired judges continue to try to \ncarry the workload, but we fall farther behind. They write:\n\n       It stands to reason that if you can't get into a courtroom, \n     if the docket is too packed for your case to be heard \n     promptly, or if the judge lacks sufficient time to address \n     the issues raised, justice suffers. This will directly affect \n     thousands of ordinary Americans plaintiffs and defendants \n     whose liberty, safety, or job may be at stake and for whom \n     justice may arrive too late, if at all. In some \n     jurisdictions, civil litigants may well wait two to three \n     years before going to trial. In jurisdictions with the most \n     vacancies, it will often take far longer for published \n     opinions to be issued, or courts will come to rely on more \n     unpublished opinions. More worrisome still, because the \n     Speedy Trial Act requires that courts give precedence to \n     criminal cases, some backlogged courts have had to stop \n     hearing civil cases altogether.\n\n  Earlier this month, I spoke to the Senate about the serious warning \nissued by Justice Anthony Kennedy at the Ninth Circuit Conference about \nskyrocketing judicial vacancies in California and throughout the \ncountry. He said, ``It's important for the public to understand that \nthe excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.'' He noted that \n``if judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional \nindifference, the rule of law is imperiled.'' A recent editorial in the \nLos Angeles Times focuses on the acute problems in the Ninth Circuit \nand urges the Senate to act on three nominations to fill vacancies in \nFederal courts in California.\n  President Obama has not made nominations opposed by home State \nSenators but has, instead, reached out and worked with home State \nSenators from both parties. Likewise, I have respected the minority. We \nhave tried to develop and improve the cooperation between parties and \nbranches. It is disappointing to see others take the opposite approach. \nWe could help to address this vacancies crisis just by acting on the \njudicial nominations ready for action but which remain stalled on the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  I have worked closely with the ranking Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee while serving as its chairman. I have enjoyed my relationship \nwith the current Ranking Republican, and I have often thanked Senator \nSessions for his cooperation in working with me to hold hearings and \nconsider nominations in committee. I was disappointed by his statement \nto the Senate last week, however. He is entitled to his own perspective \non these matters, of course. I feel very strongly that Democrats in the \nSenate treated President Bush's judicial nominations better and more \nfairly than Republicans had those of President Clinton, and certainly \nbetter than President Obama's nominees are currently being treated. The \ncomparison of vacancy rates and the number of judges confirmed in \nPresident Bush's first 2 years with a Democratic majority--100, \nincluding 17 circuit court nominations--bear that out. I also believe \nthat there was a clear difference in the smaller number of judicial \nnominees opposed by Democratic Senators and the open manner in which \nDemocrats made clear the basis of their opposition in contrast to the \nsecret holds and across the board nature of the Republican opposition. \nAnother indisputable fact is the judicial vacancy crisis during the \nClinton administration that has been recreated since President Obama \nwas elected. By contrast, during the Bush administration\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\nSenate Democrats worked to reduce vacancies and the result was that we \ndid so dramatically.\n  Indeed, much of Senator Sessions' statement last Wednesday reads like \nan attempted justification for some sort of payback. He does concede \nthat we proceeded promptly to confirm President Bush's district court \nnominations, but unfortunately attributes a sinister cast even to those \nactions. Sometimes the statement does not merely attribute the wrong \nmotive or mischaracterize what happened, but is a misstatement of the \nfacts. For example, the Senator suggested that the Senate confirmed \nonly 6 of President Bush's 25 circuit court nominees. In fact, we \nworked hard to confirm 17 circuit court nominees in the 17 months that \nI chaired the committee during 2001 and 2002.\n  By contrast, only 11 of President Obama's circuit court nominees have \nbeen confirmed these 2 years--this, despite the fact that 17 have, so \nfar, been reported by the Judiciary Committee. Five of the six circuit \ncourt nominations stalled and still being prevented from being \nconsidered were reported unanimously, one as long ago as January. This \nis another good illustration of the difference in how Republican and \nDemocratic Senators have treated judicial nominations by the President \nof the other party.\n  Democratic Senators did not stall such consensus nominations for \nspite or payback. And when we opposed nominations we said why. Unlike \nPresident Bush, President Obama has not made a series of judicial \nnominees designed to pack the courts with ideologues. Instead, he has \nworked with home State Senators and selected highly qualified, \npredominately moderate nominees.\n  Nor have we sought to force through nominations by ignoring the rules \nand traditions of the Senate or the committee, as Republicans did. \nThose practices are detailed in my contemporaneous statements at the \ntime but ignored in the statement made last Wednesday. For example, \nwhen I became chairman in 2001, I made home State Senators' ``blue \nslips'' public for the first time, preventing Senators from anonymously \nblocking committee action on judicial nominees. That was a bad practice \nthat led to the pocket filibusters of more than 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees. Also ignored in last Wednesday's statement \nwas the history of earlier filibusters, such as that of the Supreme \nCourt nomination of Abe Fortas to be the Chief Justice and of President \nClinton's nominations to the Ninth Circuit.\n  The statement was in many regards ahistorical or anti-historical. In \ncomplaining about a handful of Fourth Circuit nominees in the last 2 \nyears of President Bush's administration, the statement ignored the \nfact that we had broken the logjam caused by 8 years of Republican \nobstruction of President Clinton's nominations to that circuit and that \nthe examples cited were after vacancies had been reduced and in light \nof opposition from home State Senators to some of the nominees. Indeed, \nwe might have made even more progress had President Bush not proceeded \nfor years to make several extreme nominations. The statement also seems \nunaware of the work we did to resolve the impasse in the Sixth Circuit, \nresulting in every single vacancy in the circuit being filled by \nPresident Bush.\n  Regrettably, the Senate this year is not being allowed to consider \nthe consensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the \nJudiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President \nBush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of \nthe Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by \nthe Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 \ndays. By contrast, the average time for the 41 Federal circuit and \ndistrict and circuit court judges confirmed since President Obama took \noffice is 90 days and the average time for circuit nominees is 148 \ndays--and that disparity is increasing.\n  Senate Republicans have refused to allow prompt consideration even to \nthose consensus nominations that are reported unanimously and without \nopposition by the Judiciary Committee. There is no good reason to hold \nup consideration for weeks and months of nominees reported without \nopposition from the Judiciary Committee. I have been urging since last \nyear that these consensus nominees be considered promptly and \nconfirmed.\n  In 2001 and 2002, the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the \nSenate with a Democratic majority confirmed 100 judicial nominees. We \nobviously will not reach that level or reduce judicial vacancies as \neffectively as we did in those 2 years. What we can do is consider the \n23 judicial nominations already on the calendar. That could bring us to \n64 Federal circuit and district court confirmations. If we also \ncompleted action on the 11 additional judicial nominees who \nparticipated in September hearings, that could bring us to a \nrespectable total of 75 circuit and district court confirmations. That \nwould be in the range of judicial confirmations during President \nReagan's first 2 years (88) and President George H.W. Bush's, 72, but \npale in comparison to the 100 confirmed in the first 2 years of the \nGeorge W. Bush administration or those confirmed during President \nClinton's first 2 years, 126.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthose materials to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Sep. 28, 2010]\n\n            Now Vacant: A Confirmation Crisis in our Courts\n\n                        (By Eric H. Holder, Jr.)\n\n       More than a year ago, President Obama nominated Jane \n     Stranch, a respected Nashville labor lawyer, to a seat on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. That vacancy had \n     been declared a ``judicial emergency'' because the Sixth \n     Circuit does not have enough judges to promptly or \n     effectively handle the court's caseload, leading to serious \n     delays in the administration of justice to people in \n     Tennessee and other parts of the 6th Circuit. Yet despite the \n     fact that Judge Stranch enjoyed the support of both of her \n     Republican home-state senators and bipartisan support in the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, she was forced to wait almost 300 \n     days for an up-or-down vote by the full Senate. When she \n     finally received that vote earlier this month, she was \n     confirmed overwhelmingly.\n       Unfortunately, her story is all too typical. Nominee after \n     nominee has languished in the Senate for many months, only to \n     be confirmed by wide bipartisan margins when they finally do \n     receive a vote. As Congress finishes its last week in session \n     before the November elections, our judicial system \n     desperately needs the Senate to act.\n       Today, 23 judicial nominees--honest and qualified men and \n     women eager to serve the cause of justice--are enduring long \n     delays while awaiting up-or-down votes, even though 16 of \n     them received unanimous bipartisan approval in the Judiciary \n     Committee. The confirmation process is so twisted in knots \n     that we are losing ground--there are more vacancies today \n     than when President Obama took office. The men and women \n     whose confirmations have been delayed have received high \n     marks from the nonpartisan American Bar Association, have the \n     support of their home-state senators (including Republicans), \n     and have received little or no opposition in committee. These \n     outstanding lawyers and jurists deserve better, as do \n     litigants who bring cases to increasingly understaffed \n     courts.\n       In the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento, there \n     are 1,097 cases filed per judge annually. Six months ago, the \n     president nominated California Judge Kimberly Mueller to help \n     relieve that workload. Judge Mueller is a distinguished \n     jurist with seven years' experience as a magistrate judge, a \n     unanimous rating of well qualified from the American Bar \n     Association and the unanimous backing of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. Yet she has still not been confirmed.\n       For the 4th Circuit, the president nominated Albert Diaz, \n     an experienced state court judge and former Marine and \n     officer in the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps, to a seat \n     on the U.S. Court of Appeals that has been vacant for more \n     than three years. He was approved unanimously by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in January and is strongly backed by both \n     of North Carolina's senators. Yet Judge Diaz has waited 242 \n     days for a vote by the full Senate.\n       In the rotunda outside my Justice Department office, it is \n     inscribed that ``The United States wins its point whenever \n     justice is done its citizens in the courts.'' As attorney \n     general, I have the privilege of leading a strong department \n     in which public servants seek justice every day. But the \n     quotation that has greeted attorneys general for the past 70 \n     years serves as a reminder that justice depends on effective \n     courts. The federal judicial system that has been a rightful \n     source of pride for the United States--the system on which we \n     all depend for a prompt and fair hearing of our cases when we \n     need to call on the law--is stressed to the breaking point.\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n       Last year, 259,000 civil cases and 75,000 criminal cases \n     were filed in the federal courts, enough to tax the abilities \n     of the judiciary even when it is fully staffed. But today \n     there are 103 judicial vacancies--nearly one in eight seats \n     on the bench. Men and women who need their day in court must \n     stand in longer and longer lines.\n       The problem is about to get worse. Because of projected \n     retirements and other demographic changes, the number of \n     annual new vacancies in the next decade will be 33 percent \n     greater than in the past three decades. If the historic pace \n     of Senate confirmations continues, one third of the federal \n     judiciary will be vacant by 2020. If we stay on the pace that \n     the Senate has set in the past two years--the slowest pace of \n     confirmations in history--fully half the federal judiciary \n     will be vacant by 2020.\n       As Justice Anthony Kennedy recently noted, the ``rule of \n     law is imperiled'' if these important judicial vacancies \n     remain unfilled. In 2005, Senate Republican leader Mitch \n     McConnell called on Congress to return to the way the Senate \n     operated for over 200 years, and give nominees who have \n     majority support in the Senate an up-or-down floor vote.\n       I agree. It's time to address the crisis in our courts. \n     It's time to confirm these judges.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From Slate.com, Sep. 27, 2010]\n\n  Vacant Stares--Why Don't Americans Worry About How an Understaffed \n              Federal Bench is Hazardous to Their Health?\n\n                  (By Dahlia Lithwick and Carl Tobias)\n\n       The prospect of a federal bench with nearly one out of \n     every eight judicial seats vacant should scare the pants off \n     every American. Yet few Americans are as worked up about it \n     as those of us who think and worry about it a lot. Our \n     argument was already a tough sell before the threat of global \n     terrorism and a collapsed economy ate up every moment of the \n     national political conversation. Now a 10 percent judicial \n     vacancy rate seems like a Code Beige emergency in a Code Red \n     world.\n       Part of the problem is politics: It has often seemed that \n     the only people screaming for speedy judicial confirmations \n     are panicked because it's their judges being blocked. The \n     party not currently in control of the White House and Senate \n     often sees less crisis than opportunity in a dwindling bench. \n     Moreover, when the entire judicial selection process has been \n     as fiercely politicized as it is has become lately, most \n     Americans may suspect that empty benches might be better for \n     democracy than full ones. But judicial vacancies are \n     disastrous for Americans, all Americans, and not merely for \n     partisan reasons, but also for practical ones. That's why in \n     a recent speech, Justice Anthony Kennedy warned: ``[I]t's \n     important for the public to understand that the excellence of \n     the federal judiciary is at risk. If judicial excellence is \n     cast upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of \n     law is imperiled.''\n       Yet this issue, which seems to light up editorial writers \n     and Brookings scholars with such ease, appears to leave the \n     rest of you cold. So here we are taking one last crack at \n     scaring your pants off with some strictly nonpartisan facts \n     about the dangers of judicial vacancies.\n       Justice delayed truly is justice denied. There are \n     approximately 850 lower-court federal judgeships, of which \n     more than 100 are currently vacant, while 49 openings in 22 \n     states are classified ``judicial emergencies.'' Eighty-three \n     of these are on the district courts--the trial courts that \n     decide every important federal question in the country, on \n     issues ranging from civil rights to environmental, economic, \n     privacy, and basic freedoms. Whereas judicial obstruction \n     once reached no further than the federal appeals courts, for \n     the first time even noncontroversial district court nominees \n     are being stalled by arcane Senate reindeer games. It stands \n     to reason that if you can't get into a courtroom, if the \n     docket is too packed for your case to be heard promptly, or \n     if the judge lacks sufficient time to address the issues \n     raised, justice suffers. This will directly affect thousands \n     of ordinary Americans--plaintiffs and defendants--whose \n     liberty, safety, or job may be at stake and for whom justice \n     may arrive too late, if at all. In some jurisdictions, civil \n     litigants may well wait two to three years before going to \n     trial. In jurisdictions with the most vacancies, it will \n     often take far longer for published opinions to be issued, or \n     courts will come to rely on more unpublished opinions. More \n     worrisome still, because the Speedy Trial Act requires that \n     courts give precedence to criminal cases, some backlogged \n     courts have had to stop hearing civil cases altogether.\n       Overtaxed federal judges can't do justice at some point. \n     Take, for instance, the federal court based in Denver, where \n     five active judges are doing the work that ought to be done \n     by seven. The Judicial Conference of the United States \n     suggests the court needs another judgeship and has labeled \n     the two vacancies a ``judicial emergency'' because the judges \n     there each carry 593 instead of the 430 cases deemed optimal. \n     Alliance for Justice today put out a new report on the \n     jurisdictions designated as judicial emergencies. Among their \n     findings: Judicial emergencies have more than doubled over \n     the first 20 months of the Obama administration, and judicial \n     emergencies now exist in 30 states. In many jurisdictions, \n     judges who should have retired years ago are still actively \n     hearing cases on courts that can't afford to lose even one \n     more judge. This places unfair, undue pressure on every \n     federal judge now sitting. Most judges have been stoic in the \n     face of mounting work and caseloads. Few openly complain, \n     lest they appear to be taking sides in the confirmation wars. \n     Still the crisis is so urgent that some judges have begun to \n     speak out: In May, Chief Judge Wiley Daniel of the U.S. \n     District Court in Denver wrote to the majority and minority \n     leaders in the Senate urging prompt confirmation and \n     explaining that lingering vacancies impede public access to \n     justice. Six highly regarded retired federal judges at the \n     same time wrote to the senators that the current gridlock is \n     not tenable for a nation ``that believes in the rule of \n     law.'' In 1997 and again in 2001, Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist admonished the White House and Senate, then in \n     control of opposite parties, to fill the many vacancies for \n     the good of the nation. Imagine how you would feel if your \n     heart surgeon had to perform thousands of surgeries each day. \n     That's how worried you should be about federal judges forced \n     to manage ever-expanding caseloads.\n       Potential judges won't agree to be nominated. Depending on \n     who's doing the calculations, the average length of time \n     between being nominated and confirmed has more than \n     quadrupled in the Obama administration. As a result of \n     procedural shenanigans in the Senate, nominees may remain in \n     limbo for months, with careers and law practices stuck on \n     hold as they await a vote that may never come. Indeed, 6th \n     Circuit Judge Jane Stranch waited 13 months for a 71-21 vote, \n     while Judge Albert Diaz, a 4th Circuit nominee, has waited \n     nearly 11. As the wait for confirmation drags on ever longer, \n     the best nominees will be inclined to start to wonder whether \n     it's worth the bother. Many excellent potential nominees may \n     not even entertain the prospect of judicial service anymore. \n     As President Stephen Zack, president of the American Bar \n     Association, recently put it: ``The current gridlock \n     discourages anyone from subjecting themselves to the judicial \n     nomination process.''\n       The more seats remain vacant, the greater the incentive to \n     politicize the process. In the George W. Bush administration, \n     the judicial-vacancy rate dropped to 4 percent. Now it's up \n     to 10 percent again. The stakes become higher and higher as \n     the opportunity to significantly reshape the federal bench \n     becomes more real. The incentive for a Senate minority to \n     obstruct nominees also grows with the vacancy rate. The party \n     not in control of the White House invariably believes it will \n     recapture the presidency in the next election and thus has \n     the opportunity to appoint judges more to its liking. \n     Accordingly, each nominee obstructed now is another vacancy \n     reserved for the out-of-power party's president. These \n     dynamics are evident with the midterm elections approaching: \n     The process has now essentially shut down. That's why only \n     one appellate nominee even received floor consideration \n     between April 23 and Sept. 12 of this year.\n       The rampant politicization of the selection process is \n     undermining public respect for the co-equal branches of \n     government. President George W. Bush's use of the White House \n     for a ceremony introducing his first 11 appellate nominees \n     and his promotion of his judicial nominees exacerbated the \n     sense that federal judgeships were a political prize for the \n     winning party. Obama has attempted to depoliticize the \n     confirmation process by naming judges generally regarded as \n     centrist and moderate--much to the dismay of many liberals. \n     But it has changed nothing. When the Senate confirmation \n     process degenerates into cartoonish charges of judicial \n     unfitness, name-calling, recriminations, and endless \n     paybacks, the consequences go far beyond the legitimacy of \n     Congress, to the legitimacy of the courts themselves. As \n     courts are batted around for partisan political purposes, \n     nominees and judges appear to be purely political actors--no \n     different than members of Congress or the president. That \n     doesn't just hurt judges. It hurts those of us who rely on \n     judges to deliver just outcomes.\n       Americans watching the confirmation wars won't ultimately \n     recall which president named which judge or what the final \n     vote was. But they may begin to accept as normal an \n     inaccurate and deeply politicized vision of judges as a bunch \n     of alternating partisan hacks and a federal bench that is \n     limping, rather than racing, to do justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7952-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7952-S7953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL HOME CARE AND HOSPICE MONTH\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our country strives to provide exceptional \nsupport for the sick, elderly and terminally ill in home and hospice \nsettings. These vulnerable individuals, as well as their family \ncaregivers, are indebted to the many professionals and volunteers who \nhave made it their life's work to serve those in greatest need. Nearly \n83,000 hospice professionals, 46,000 hospice volunteers and 1 million \nhome health providers, nationally, contribute significantly to our \nhealth care system through their compassion and commitment.\n  Hospice care provides humane and comforting support for over 744,000 \nterminally ill patients and their families each year. These services \ninclude pain control, palliative medical care and social, emotional and \nspiritual services.\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\nHospice supports the basic human needs for feeling comfortable, in a \nfamiliar environment, surrounded by loving caregivers and family during \nthe later stages of life. Hospice care is an effective model for the \ninteraction of interdisciplinary teams of health professionals, family \nmembers and volunteers in providing care for those needing care in our \ncommunities.\n  The movement to provide health care and supportive services in the \nhome environment has evolved rapidly over the past few decades. Home \ncare services typically bring the expertise and compassion of providers \nin numerous disciplines into the setting where most sick patients \nprefer to reside--the home. More than 11 million Americans benefit each \nyear from this approach.\n  We have made great strides in advancing care for all Americans \nthrough the recently enacted Affordable Care Act. A key provision in \nthis effort is the establishment of a Medicare hospice concurrent care \ndemonstration program, which would allow patients who are eligible for \nhospice care to also receive all other Medicare covered services during \nthe same period of time. Following establishment of this program, I am \nhopeful that this country will move in a direction where individuals \nand families do not have to make the difficult choice between hospice \nand curative care in the Medicare Program.\n  On behalf of Oregon home health and hospice providers celebrating \nNovember as home care and hospice month, I thank the thousands of \neveryday heroes such as home health nurses, therapists, and aides, who \nwork tirelessly to provide professional health and palliative care and \nsupport to millions of Americans in need of quality health services. \nTheir efforts allow families to stay together, and provide greater \ncomfort and dignity to those in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7953-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE JOHN HANSON NATIONAL MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a fellow Marylander, \nJohn Hanson, whose statue graces Statuary Hall here in the U.S. \nCapitol. George Washington is properly revered as the ``Father of our \nCountry'' and the Nation's first President. But we mustn't overlook \nJohn Hanson's seminal contributions to the birth of the United States. \nIn October 1781, the British surrendered at Yorktown, VA, and the \nAmerican Revolution was over. A month later, Hanson became the first \nelected President of the Continental Congress established under the \nArticles of Confederation. He was unanimously elected and served one \nterm, from November 5, 1781 to November 3, 1782.\n  John Hanson's administration began the task of creating the \ngovernmental infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing, diverse \nnation. Under his leadership, the Nation's first central bank was \ncreated, along with the post office, the departments of State, War and \nTreasury, the diplomatic corps, the national seal, and the annual \nobservance of Thanksgiving Day. As the first elected President of our \nindependent Nation, President Hanson began the task of unifying the \nformer colonies and providing for their common defense, communication, \nand economic growth.\n  The John Hanson National Memorial Association now seeks to \nmemorialize John Hanson and recognize his contributions to our Nation. \nThe association proposes to create a national memorial on the Frederick \nCounty Courthouse courtyard, overlooking the site of the John Hanson \nHouse in Frederick, MD. Funds also will be raised to establish a public \neducation program regarding President Hanson's contributions to our \ndemocracy. Funding also will be used to support the John Hanson \nInstitute, which would restore and preserve President Hanson's first \nhome, Mulberry Grove, on the banks of Port Tobacco River in Charles \nCounty, MD.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the efforts of the \nassociation to recognize our first elected President, John Hanson of \nMaryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7953-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECOGNIZING EUHOFA\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize and congratulate EUHOFA, \nan international association of hotel and hospitality schools, on the \noccasion of its 49th Congress, which was held in Providence, RI, from \nNovember 7 through November 12, 2010.\n  EUHOFA International was founded in Europe in 1955 with the mission \nof enhancing the quality of the training for the tourism industry \nthroughout the world. Its members represent the world's top hotel and \nhospitality colleges and universities in 45 countries. Representatives \nfrom 19 of these countries attended this year's congress in Providence.\n  The 2010 EUHOFA Congress marks only the second time this event has \ntaken place in the United States. This year, as in 1994, the EUHOFA \nCongress was hosted by Johnson & Wales University in Providence, which \nis home to one of our Nation's premier hospitality schools.\n  The tourism industry is a vital part of my State and our Nation's \neconomy. Many people associate tourism solely with vacations. But at \nits heart, tourism provides an important bridge between countries and \ncultures, and at a time of great change, this kind of understanding is \nessential for our national security and economic recovery.\n  I am very proud that Rhode Island and Johnson & Wales University are \nhosting this great event. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, it is my \npleasure to congratulate the 49th EUHOFA International World Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7953-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7953-S7954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARGOT ALLEN\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to pay tribute \nto Margot Allen, an exceptional employee, a dedicated patriot, an \nextraordinary woman, and a treasured friend, in celebration of her 70th \nbirthday. Margot has been an invaluable part of my congressional team \nsince our first campaign in 1994.\n  Raised in Alabama, Margot has the charm and grace of a true southern \nbelle. Add to that her demand for precision and professionalism and her \nquick wit, and it explains why she has been known to elicit a, ``Why, \nthank you!'' from an obtuse obstructionist who has quite politely been \ntold to ``take a long walk off a short pier'' in that captivating \nsouthern drawl.\n  Margot's work on behalf of veterans and seniors in Nevada has earned \nher a stellar reputation as the authority among her peers and a miracle \nworker among those constituents who have benefited from her tenacious \nadvocacy. She has gained the respect and admiration of those both in \nand out of government agencies with whom she collaborates. As a \nRegional Representative in my Las Vegas office, Margot has been a \nchampion for Nevada's servicemen and women, working tirelessly to \nresolve problems arising from bureaucracy or errors--often times being \nable to bring relief and hope to battle weary constituents. Her \nassociation with active duty and retirees from all branches of service \ncoupled with her deep appreciation for the ``Tradition of Honor and \nLegacy of Valor'' has earned her profound admiration from privates and \ngenerals alike. At Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, NV, the \nCommanding Officer of the 99th Airbase Wing is often referred to as the \n``Mayor of Nellis.'' However, anybody who has been stationed at Nellis \nwill definitely concede that it is Margot who is the mayor. She knows \neverybody and everybody knows her.\n  Her passion for accuracy in grammar and written composition took her \nto the University of Alabama where she worked as a professor. Margot \nalso taught English language skills to Panamanians while she and her \nbeloved husband Leonard were living in Panama where he worked for the \nDepartment of Defense. Her love of the English language and her \ncommitment to scholarship has not only served her well over the years \nbut also become an unequaled resource for my staff and me. Margot \nprovides the final inspection for every document that is sent from any \nof my offices. She calmly, methodically, and repeatedly teaches the \nplacement of commas, patiently explains when healthcare is one word or \ntwo, and has been known to ask staff on more than one occasion, \n``Honey, why don't you just tell me what you meant to say.''\n  I am very privileged as a United States Senator to work with a team \nof highly skilled, capable, and dedicated staff members who are \ncommitted to\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\nthis great country and the people of Nevada, and any measure of \nexcellence that we achieve will bear the distinct handprint of Margot \nAllen.\n  It is truly my pleasure and my honor to recognize the outstanding \ncontribution Margot Allen has made to my organization and to the people \nof Nevada in the years she has been part of my congressional team and \nto wish her a very blessed and happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7954-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JANET YELLEN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to briefly explain for the record \nmy votes on the nomination of Janet Yellen to be a member of the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System and to be Vice-Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  Dr. Yellen is qualified to sit on the Board of Governors. She has \nalready been a member of the Board, and is currently the president of a \nregional Fed--the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has more \nmonetary policy experience than most recent nominees and certainly \nunderstands what the job requires.\n  However, I have serious concerns about her views on monetary policy \nand her actions during the credit and housing bubble. In reviewing \nFederal Open Market Committee, FOMC, meeting minutes and transcripts, \nit is clear to me that Dr. Yellen will support easy money policies and \nI am afraid she will not take inflation seriously. I do not believe she \nwill stand up to Chairman Bernanke or break the groupthink that exists \nat the Fed. The FOMC transcripts and minutes I reviewed only strengthen \nmy concerns. I am also concerned that as president of the San Francisco \nFed she did not spot or take action to address the housing and credit \nbubble while overseeing one of the most affected regions of the \ncountry. These reasons are why I oppose Dr. Yellen's nomination to be \nVice-Chairman and will vote against her for that position when the vote \nis called.\n  The Record will thus reflect my vote against Dr. Yellen to be Vice-\nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7954-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL PREMATURITY AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the issue \nof babies born prematurely, an area Senator Dodd and I have been \nworking on together for many years. November is Prematurity Awareness \nMonth and today, November 17, is Prematurity Awareness Day. This year, \nin the U.S., approximately 28,000 babies will die before their first \nbirthday. In Tennessee, 236 babies are born preterm per week on \naverage, and, in 2007, 12,256 babies or 14.2 percent of all live births \nwere premature.\n  According to the CDC, babies who died from preterm birth-related \ncauses accounted for more than 36 percent of infant deaths in 2006. In \naddition to being the leading cause of newborn death, prematurity can \ncause those who do survive a lifetime of health challenges and \nintellectual disabilities. Even infants born just a few weeks early \nhave higher rates of hospitalization and illness than full-term \ninfants. The last few weeks of pregnancy are critical to a baby's \nhealth because many important organs, including the brain and lungs, \nare not completely developed until then.\n  We are making incredible advances in how we treat these children, but \nwe need to do a lot more. This is a critically important issue. It is \nthe kind of issue that deserves more attention. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Dodd in introducing the PREEMIE Act, which \nreauthorizes and builds upon our legislation from 2006. It is supported \nby the March of Dimes, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Association of Women's \nHealth, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, to name a few. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I am pleased to join my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Tennessee, in this effort. Five years ago, we \nstood on this floor discussing the risks, costs, and toll of premature \nbirth. Following three decades of increases, in 2008, the Nation \nachieved the first 2-year decline in the preterm birth rate to 12.3 \npercent. This rate is still too far from the Healthy People 2010 goal \nof 7.6 percent and our Nation earns only a ``D'' on the March of Dimes \nannual prematurity report card. According to the National Center for \nHealth Statistics, in an average week in Connecticut, 84 babies are \nborn preterm. More than half a million babies still are born preterm \neach year, a serious health problem that costs the United States more \nthan $26 billion annually, according to the Institute of Medicine. I \nbelieve that the recent 2-year nationwide decline, albeit small, is \nencouraging and this should be the beginning of a positive trend. The \nrecent developments must be supported by access to better health care, \nnew research and new programs to lower the risk of preterm birth.\n  This is why the Senator from Tennessee and I have introduced the \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers Who Deliver \nInfants Early Act. This important bill expands research into the causes \nand prevention of prematurity and increases education and support \nservices related to prematurity. The March of Dimes has been an \nimportant partner through its leadership of a national prematurity \ncampaign, but they cannot combat this serious and costly public health \ncrisis alone. The Federal Government must partner with them to increase \nresearch on the causes of preterm birth. I hope more of my colleagues \nwill join us in supporting this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7954-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VICTOR PEREZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

At one point during the pursuit, he noticed a young \ngirl in the passenger seat, which strengthened his resolve to track \ndown the vehicle. After seeing her, he said he had only one thought in \nhis mind, ``I've got to get that little girl out of there.''\n  He bravely pursued the suspect with selfless disregard for his \npersonal safety until he successfully cut off the vehicle, forcing the \nsuspect to stop.\n  Sensing that he was cornered by Mr. Perez, the suspect pushed the \nyoung victim out of the car and sped off. Mr. Perez immediately tended \nto the young victim and called 911 so that law enforcement officials \ncould continue to pursue the kidnapper. When the young girl told Mr. \nPerez that she was scared, he assured her that she was out of harm's \nway.\n  As a result of Mr. Perez's heroic actions and the speedy response by \nhundreds of law enforcement officers from multiple jurisdictions, the \nsuspected kidnapper was apprehended. Most importantly, the young girl \nhas been reunited with her mother and her family.\n  I am thankful for Mr. Perez's altruism and courage. His selfless \nactions that led to the rescue of this little girl represent the best \nideals of being a good neighbor, a Good Samaritan and a responsible \nmember of a community.\n  We shall always be grateful for his heroic deeds on the morning of \nOctober 5, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7954-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7954-S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LOUIS HENKIN\n\n Mr. CARDIN.

By 1940, Louis had obtained his law degree from Harvard \nUniversity after receiving his undergraduate degree from Yeshiva \nUniversity.\n  Much can be said about Mr. Henkin's contributions to our Nation. As a \ncivil servant, Mr. Henkin worked as law clerk for two of the sharpest \nAmerican legal minds, Judge Learned Hand of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nand, later, for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Louis also \nserved in World War II. He earned a Silver Star, the third highest \nmilitary decoration that can be awarded, for his role in negotiating \nthe surrender of 78 German soldiers to his 13-man artillery observation \nunit.\n  These accomplishments notwithstanding, it has been Mr. Henkin's \nunquestionable devotion to the cause of human rights which prompts me \nto speak in his memory. It would not be an overstatement to say that \nMr. Henkin is a pillar in the field of human rights. From 1948 to 1956 \nMr. Henkin worked for the State Department's United Nations Bureau and \nits Office of European Regional Affairs. He is considered one of the \narchitects of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, where the \ndefining terms of what it means to be a refugee and the international \ncommunity's responsibility in providing asylum to these individuals \nwere set forth. At Columbia University, Professor Henkin helped \nestablish the Center for the Study of Human Rights in 1978 and created \nthe Human Rights Institute 20 years later. Mr. Henkin was also a \nfounder of the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, which we know now \nas Human Rights First. As a mentor, his influence has been felt by \ngenerations of legal scholars, including Supreme Court Justices Ruth \nBader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. \nOur colleague on the Helsinki Commission, Assistant Secretary of State \nMichael Posner, is a protege of Professor Henkin.\n  Mr. Henkin was a prolific legal scholar. He published more than a \ndozen books on the Constitution, international law, and human rights. \nHis scholarship has helped inform and shape the United States \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The international human rights community mourns the loss of Louis \nHenkin, and we at the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe \njoin that mourning. Our deepest and most sincere condolences and \nprayers go out to his family and friends. He shall be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7955-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING HOWARD COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the 40th \nanniversary of Howard Community College in Howard County, MD. In 1970, \nHoward Community College began with 1 building and 600 students in the \nplanned community of Columbia. Since then, Howard Community College has \ngrown into a sprawling campus and cultural magnet that draws nearly one \nout of every four Howard County high school graduates to its \nclassrooms.\n  In fiscal year 2010, Howard Community College enrolled more than \n12,851 credit students and 16,780 noncredit continuing education \nstudents. Nearly 30 percent of its faculty has doctorates and the \ncommunity is able to choose from more than 7,056 classes each year.\n  The Howard Community College administration works closely with the \nbusiness community and county government to ensure that the college's \ncourses are preparing students for careers and/or educational \nadvancement in areas that will result in employment and respond to \nbusiness needs. For example, in response to the national nursing \nshortage, Howard Community College has developed a nursing program with \na reputation for excellence--90 percent of last year's nursing students \npassed the licensing exam on the first try.\n  The Horowitz Visual and Performing Arts Center, which opened in 2006, \nhas added a community cultural dimension to the college by offering \nthree performance venues, two dance studios, and instructional space \nfor art and music classes. The Children's Learning Center serves as a \nchild care center as well as a lab school for students in the Early \nChildhood Development Program, an important resource for working \nparents.\n  Howard Community College can be proud of its rapid growth and its \noutstanding reputation. The college offers an important resource to the \ncommunity and works hard to deliver on its pledge: ``You Can Get There \nFrom Here.''\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Howard Community \nCollege on its success and join me in wishing President Kathleen B. \nHetherington, the Board of Trustees, and the Howard County community \ncontinued success in educating students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7955-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND M. KIGHT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the outstanding \ncareer and service of Raymond M. Kight, who is the longest-serving \nelected sheriff of Montgomery County. Ray Kight was an Army veteran \nwhen he joined the Montgomery County Police Department in 1963. He was \nsworn in as deputy sheriff in 1967 and was elected sheriff in 1986.\n  During his tenure, Sheriff Kight transitioned the office into a \nmodern, professional law enforcement agency. In addition to the \ntraditional role in the service of legal process, protecting the \ncourts, transporting prisoners and apprehending fugitives, the \nSheriff's Office now provides responsive services to the community, \nincluding a family law unit that provides immediate law enforcement and \nsocial service intervention in domestic violence situations. Sheriff \nKight was part of the strategic planning responsible for designing and \nimplementing the interagency Montgomery County Family Justice Center, \nwhich opened in May, 2009, and has since served over 2,000 domestic \nviolence victims.\n  Under Sheriff Kight's administration, the Montgomery County Sheriff's \nOffice became the first Sheriff's Office in Maryland to be nationally \naccredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement \nAgencies, CALEA. Sheriff Kight has also brought professionalism and \nrecognition to the office by requiring uniforms for all deputies, \nmarked Sheriff's office vehicles, and standardized training. He \nestablished the Sheriff's Office SWAT team, K-9 explosive detection \nteams, and hostage negotiators. These units are deployed throughout \nMontgomery County in cooperation with the Montgomery County Police \nDepartment. The sheriff's deputies maintain partnerships and serve in \nmajor regional Federal, State, and county law enforcement task forces, \nincluding the U.S. Marshal Service's Capitol Area Regional Fugitive \nTask Force, CARFTF, as well as the Firearms and Gang Task Forces.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Sheriff Raymond Kight for \nhis 50 years of public service. I ask you to join me in thanking him \nfor his dedication to the safety of the residents of Montgomery County, \nMD, and in sending him best wishes for a well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7955-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7955-S7956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CLINT STENNETT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Clint \nStennett. I join Clint's wife Michelle, his family and friends in \nmourning his loss and honoring his distinguished life. There is deep \nsadness associated with the passing of Clint Stennett, who was a good \nfriend and dedicated associate.\n  Clint Stennett had numerous accomplishments in his life that was cut \noff far too short. Clint knew the meaning of hard work, and he made \ngreat use of his sense for business. Clint grew up in Idaho and \ngraduated from Idaho State University, where he served as student body \npresident. He worked for the Idaho Statesman selling advertising. He \nlater went to work as a publisher for the Wood River Journal, and he \nserved as president of a company that owned various Idaho television \nstations. He also had multiple Idaho ranches. Clint served in the Idaho \nState House of Representatives for 4 years before he began serving in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\nState senate in 1994, where he represented Blaine, Camas, Gooding, and \nLincoln Counties. For a decade, he also served as former Democratic \nminority leader for the Idaho State Senate.\n  Clint always kept his mind and heart open as he worked hard for \nIdahoans. Clint was a principled, considerate and devoted leader. With \nan unequalled dedication, he had a love for natural resources, \nagricultural efforts and the beauty of the State. Clint was a \nsuccessful, hard-working and fair businessman. He loved his family very \nmuch, and he will be remembered as a loving husband and brother.\n  My condolences and heart-felt prayers go out to his wife Michelle, \nhis extended family, friends and loved ones. Clint Stennett will be \ngreatly missed, and his immense contribution to the State of Idaho will \nnot be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7956-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN W. KLUGE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to John \nKluge, a very close friend of mine who passed away on September 7, \n2010, at the age of 95. I would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my heartfelt condolences to his wife Maria; his children John \nand Samantha; and his stepchildren Joseph, Diane, Jeannette, and Peter. \nFor all of us who had the privilege of getting to know him, this is a \ntremendous loss.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that John led a truly remarkable life. \nHaving made a substantial fortune from a communications empire that \nincluded everything from television and radio stations to mobile phones \nand the Harlem Globetrotters, John regularly graced Forbes magazine's \nannual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.\n  But John was not born with the proverbial ``silver spoon'' in his \nmouth. He didn't inherit his wealth. John Kluge built his company, \nMetromedia, on his own, through nothing more than hard work, spot-on \nbusiness instincts and, as John himself often freely admitted, a little \nbit of good luck.\n  Indeed, John's life reads like a pitch-perfect version of a classic \nAmerican success story--a potent reminder of what individuals can \naccomplish with dedication, tenacity, and a healthy dose of self-\nconfidence and optimism.\n  Born in Chemnitz, Germany, in 1914, John moved with his family to \nDetroit in 1922 and took his first job as a payroll clerk for his \nstepfather's business when he was just 10. From a very early age, John \nwas driven to make the most of the educational opportunities available \nto him. During his teenage years, when his stepfather asked him to drop \nout of school so he could work full time at the family business, John \ninstead opted to leave home and live with his typing teacher so he \ncould continue his education.\n  That decision ultimately paid off. During his high school years, John \nworked extremely hard to get good grades and eventually won a \nscholarship to college, later graduating from Columbia University with \na degree in economics.\n  In the 1950s, following a brief stint working for a Michigan paper \ncompany and several years of service in the U.S. Army during World War \nII, John started purchasing radio stations throughout the country. By \nthe time he founded Metromedia, the country's first major independent \nbroadcasting company, in 1961, he had already made a small fortune from \nhis radio stations and a regional food distribution business he founded \nin Baltimore. When he sold Metromedia two decades later, John increased \nhis net worth even more substantially, making nearly $4.7 billion in \nthe process.\n  Clearly, it would have been incredibly easy for John to have simply \ntaken his money ``. . . and joined the country club and gotten into \nthis pattern of complaining about the world and about the tax law,'' as \nhe once put it in an interview for the New York Times. But John Kluge \nnever had any desire to spend the rest of his life sitting around and \nfrittering away his wealth. He placed a tremendous amount of value on a \nhard, honest day's work. And it was the sense of fulfillment he derived \nfrom his own work that ultimately served as the driving force behind \nhis numerous accomplishments.\n  Indeed, John Kluge was the consummate workhorse. More inclined to \navoid the trappings of fame and recognition than many contemporary \ncorporate executives, John never retained a public relations staff. He \nwas content to work behind the scenes, building his telecommunications \nempire and cementing his position as one of America's most gifted \nbusiness strategists with little fanfare.\n  But John was much more than a talented entrepreneur who rose from \nhumble beginnings to strike it rich. In large part, I believe, because \nhe was not born into a life of privilege, John was absolutely committed \nto putting his largesse to work for others. He was a prolific \nphilanthropist, and among the many worthy causes and organizations that \nbenefitted from his generosity over the years, the presence of John's \ncontributions can probably be most clearly felt at his alma mater, \nColumbia.\n  Throughout his life, John donated substantial sums of money to \nColumbia, primarily to fund scholarships for underprivileged and \nminority students. But in 2007, John surprised everyone when he pledged \nthat, upon his death, the university would receive a gift of $400 \nmillion from his estate. To provide a sense of scale here, that single \ngift is the largest Columbia has ever received, and by far the largest \never given to an institution of higher learning specifically to help \nstudents afford tuition.\n  And that is exactly the way I think John would have wanted to be \nremembered as an individual who used his good fortune to make sure \nothers would be able to benefit from the same opportunities he had \ngrowing up. As someone who worked to ensure that bright, hard working \nstudents from low-income families who were accepted to one of the \ncountry's most prestigious universities would be able to make the most \nof their college educations. As someone who gave back to the people and \ninstitutions that helped make his meteoric rise in the corporate world \npossible.\n  For my part, I will certainly remember John Kluge for his uncanny \nbusiness acumen and singular dedication to philanthropy. But at the end \nof the day, I will also recall John as a wonderful, dear friend who was \nalways a pleasure to be around.\n  You see, in spite of everything, John never let his wealth or \nposition in life get to his head. During the time that I knew him, John \nwas always an extremely kind, good-natured, and genuinely fun person. \nHe was always accessible and easy to talk to, and I will miss his \ncompany immensely.\n  And so it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to say goodbye to \nsuch a special individual. Once again, I would like to extend my \nsincere condolences to his loving family and to all those individuals \nwho, like me, were so lucky to have John in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7956-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7956-S7957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RICHARD ROOT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I recognize the accomplishments \nof Colonel Richard Root, of the U.S. Army, who was recently promoted \nfrom the rank of lieutenant colonel. Until his recent transfer to the \nhighly competitive Senior Service College, Colonel Root worked for more \nthan 3 years in the Army's Legislative Affairs Office as a Senate \nliaison officer. I had the pleasure of working with Colonel Root \nfrequently during that time, and was therefore proud to be able to join \nmy colleague and good friend Senator Corker in hosting his promotion \nceremony in the Capitol. I would like to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to Colonel Root and his family for this well-deserved \nrecognition.\n  For more than 21 years, including 3 in combat, Colonel Root has been \nfaithfully serving our Nation as a member of the Armed Forces. \nBeginning in 1989, when he was commissioned as a field artillery \nlieutenant, Colonel Root's assignments have taken him around the \ncountry and the world, including several deployments during Operation \nDesert Storm in 1991 and, more recently, during Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Throughout his more than two decades in the Army, Colonel Root \nhas been recognized on a number of occasions for his superior service \nand valor, receiving, among other decorations, the Bronze Star, Purple \nHeart, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army \nAchievement Medal, Air Assault Badge, Army Staff Badge, and Combat \nAction Badge.\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n  Most recently, in his role as a liaison officer to the U.S. Senate, \nColonel Root once again distinguished himself, developing outstanding \nrelationships with Senators and staff members alike. During his 3 years \nof service in the Office of Legislative Affairs, Colonel Root escorted \n40 congressional and staff delegations, accompanying Members to more \nthan 50 countries, including active combat theaters.\n  I myself travelled with Colonel Root on a number of occasions during \nhis time in the Senate, and was always extremely impressed by his close \nattention to detail, flexibility, and unflinching dedication to his \nwork. I know many of my colleagues felt the same way, and it is \ntherefore no surprise that Colonel Root was often requested by name to \nhelp assist in the planning and coordination of congressional fact-\nfinding and oversight delegations.\n  And so, once again, it is a great honor to be able to congratulate \nColonel Root today on this seminal achievement. His unwavering \ncommitment to serving his country as a professional soldier in the Army \nis truly laudable, and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to him \nfor his years of service. Colonel Root, and all of the men and women of \nour Armed Forces, are an indispensable asset to this country, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me today in honoring this top-notch \nsoldier and dear friend, and wonderful human being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7957-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JONES CENTER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the 15th \nanniversary of the opening of the Jones Center For Families in my home \nState of Arkansas. The Jones Center, located in Springdale, is a \n220,000 square foot facility that provides educational, recreational, \nhealth, and community programs and various services to individuals and \nfamilies across northwest Arkansas.\n  The center will celebrate its 15th birthday with a public festival on \nSunday, October 24, featuring a proclamation by Springdale mayor Doug \nSprouse and family activities including children's crafts and games, \npumpkin painting, live music, birthday cake, and ice cream. The event \nwill be open to the community free of charge, including access to all \nswimming pools and the ice skating rink.\n  The Jones Center opened in 1995 as a gift to the community from the \nlate Mrs. Bernice Young Jones, wife of Harvey Jones, founder of the \nJones Truck Lines. According to its mission statement, the center is \nproud to provide a place where ``all are welcome'' in the heart of \nnorthwest Arkansas. In keeping with Mrs. Jones' wish that no one be \nturned away, the center offers facilities and services at minimal or no \ncost to everyone regardless of age, race, gender, religion, or economic \nstatus.\n  Under the leadership of Rick McCullough, executive director, the \nJones Center welcomes more than 1 million visitors per year, with an \noperating budget of $2.4 million. Programs and amenities at the center \ninclude an ice rink, junior Olympic competition swimming pool, fun pool \nwith slide, fitness room, a chapel/auditorium, a computer center, and \nnumerous other meeting rooms, playgrounds, and athletic courts.\n  I have visited the Jones Center often, and I commend the staff and \nvolunteers for their efforts to better their community and provide \nrecreational and social opportunities in a safe, modern facility. I \nsalute the entire Springdale community as they celebrate the 15th \nanniversary of this unique gathering place in the heart of northwest \nArkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7957-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING THE WEST FAMILY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize the West Family \nof Prairie Grove as they celebrate 150 years in Arkansas farming. I \ncommend them for achieving this significant milestone. As a seventh-\ngeneration Arkansan and farmer's daughter, and as chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand and appreciate the \nhard work and contributions of our farm families. I am proud to share \nthe story of the West Family Farm with you today.\n  One hundred and fifty years ago, Robert J. West homesteaded land two \nmiles north of Prairie Grove, AR, in a community called Viney Grove \nafter moving to Arkansas from Tennessee in 1860.\n  On December 7, 1862, the family watched from the hilltop of their \nfarm as the Battle of Prairie Grove played out in the valley less than \na mile away. Union soldiers used their home as a make-shift hospital \nfollowing the bloody battle. Historical records indicate that the West \nFarm was even considered as a location for the University of Arkansas \nbefore it was founded in Fayetteville in 1871.\n  Generation after generation, the West family has dedicated itself to \nbecoming a successful Arkansas farming operation. Current owner and \noperator Randy West has lived and worked on the farm his whole life, \njust as his father, grandfather and great grandfather did before him. \nHe has committed his life to improving the farm's profitability, \nsustainability and efficiency while raising a family with the lessons \nand values of rural living.\n  Randy and his wife Cheryl work together on the farm as they operate a \nBermuda grass hay business that produces between 50,000 and 70,000 \nsquare bales annually on the farm's 455 total acres. They also run a \npoultry operation consisting of three broiler houses.\n  In 1991, the farm was recognized as the Washington County Farm Family \nof the Year and the Northwest District Farm Family of the Year. In \n2003, the farm was recognized by Tyson Foods as one of five national \nEnvironmental Stewardship Award winners for its commitment to best \nmanagement practices. Tyson Foods continually uses the farm as a model \nfor environmental stewardship.\n  A lot has changed in Prairie Grove and in northwest Arkansas over the \npast 150 years, but the West Family Farm remains a constant. From the \ntime Robert J. West founded the farm on the dawn of the Civil War, \nthrough the great depression in the 1930s, to the modern age of \nagriculture in the 2000s, the West Farm has withstood the test of time \nand has remained committed to preserving the farming way of life.\n  Arkansas's farm families are critical to our nation's economic \nstability. We must work to continue the farm family tradition, so \nfamilies such as the West Family are able to maintain their livelihoods \nand continue to help provide the safe, abundant, and affordable food \nsupply that feeds our own country and the world and that is essential \nto our own economic stability. I salute the West Family and all \nArkansas farm families for their hard work and dedication. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7957-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EUREKA SPRINGS, ARKANSAS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

JOHN AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to \na historic church in Omaha, NE, which celebrated its 145th anniversary \non November 13, 2010. St. John African Methodist Episcopal--A.M.E.--\nChurch was founded in 1865 and continues to host a thriving \ncongregation in north Omaha's minority community.\n  The current church structure is listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places, having been designed by Clarence W. Wigington, who \ngrew up in Omaha, becoming Nebraska's first African-American architect. \nHe later went on to become the first municipal African-American \narchitect in the United States.\n  St. John A.M.E. Church was organized at the end of the Civil War, 2 \nyears before Nebraska became a State.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my \ngood friend, Betty Rives Allen Callaway, whom I have known for many \nyears.\n  Betty was born January 17, 1928, in Selma, AL, to Carolyn Young and \nVickers Rives Allen. Raised in Old Town, Betty attended Byrd Elementary \nSchool, Selma Junior High School, and later, Albert G. Parrish High \nSchool. As a young woman in Selma, Betty quickly became a fixture in \nthe community by donating her time and energy to various civic causes.\n  In 1943, while Betty was a student at Selma Junior High School, the \nUnited States was in the midst of World War II. In towns across \nAmerica, civilians were mobilizing scrap drives to collect metal for \nwar material. Betty, taking an active role in Selma's drive, secured \nthe gift of the old Cahaba Bridge from Dallas County, a locomotive and \ntrack from the local railroad, and old buses from Clarence Agee Bus \nCompany.\n  Her success in the scrap metal drive earned her the privilege of \nbeing selected to travel to Mobile to christen the William C. Gorgas, a \nLiberty Ship named by the students at Selma Junior High School. The \ntrip was memorable for Betty, as she once recalled christening the \nship, ``[E]xcept it took me more than once to smash the bottle of \nchampagne.''\n  Following her graduation from Albert G. Parrish High School, Betty \nembarked on her professional career. Her penchant for business and \nsense of style quickly earned her a position in Louise Martindale's \ndress shop. As a self-described ``conscientious mother and housewife,'' \nBetty proved to be more than capable of balancing her home and her \nwork. While raising her three sons, Johnny, Vick, and Jimmy, Betty also \nworked as a receptionist in several local offices and businesses, and \nlater served as the social editor at the Selma Times-Journal.\n  In 1970, Betty began her career as an aide to some of Alabama's \npolitical figures, including U.S. Representatives Bill Nichols, Walter \nFlowers, and Earl Hilliard. Betty also served with distinction for 8 \nyears in my office during my time in the U.S. House of Representatives. \nAs a member of my staff, Betty helped countless Alabamians navigate \nFederal bureaucracy, many times going above and beyond her call of \nduty.\n  Betty's service to her community extended far beyond her duties as a \nlegislative aide. As an expert on Selma history, Betty was instrumental \nin the effort to restore Cahawba, Alabama's first capital. She also \nworked to revitalize Selma's Water Avenue, one of the Nation's most \nhistoric riverfront streets. A true civic leader, Betty served on the \nAlabama Sheriffs' Boys Ranch Advisory Committee and as a member of the \nboard of directors of the Selma-Dallas County United Way. She was also \nthe first woman named to the Selma-Dallas County Chamber of Commerce's \nboard of directors.\n  In 1997, Betty moved from Selma to Point Clear. However, in May, her \nlifelong friends from Selma were glad to see her return home to live. \nToday, Betty enjoys spending time with her son, Johnny, and daughter-\nin-law, Teresa, as well as with her six grandchildren, Caroline, Allen, \nBen, Michael, Rachel Holt, and Clare.\n  I wish Betty much luck on the next phase of her life, and I ask this \nentire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life and \ncareer of my good friend Betty Callaway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7958-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING ELISEO ``CHEO'' LOPEZ\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, for many of those who \nexperienced it, the Bataan Death March marked the end of lives that \nmade up in courage what they lacked in length. For Eliseo ``Cheo'' \nLopez a native of Springer, NM, this atrocity was only the beginning of \na life lived to the fullest. That life ended on November 11 after 92 \nyears. Fittingly, November 11 is Veterans Day, a day where our Nation \npauses to honor and remember the veterans who sacrificed so much to \nkeep our country safe.\n  The brave Americans who fought at Bataan were heroes in a story that \nwas central to the broader story of Allied victory in World War II. It \nis a story too few Americans know. The soldiers who fought at Bataan \nhelped slow the Japanese advance at the beginning of the war in Asia, \nwhich would eventually give Allied troops the time to reorganize and \nreverse Japan's progress. Thanks to the heroism of these troops, \nAmerica was able to recover from Pearl Harbor and take the fight to the \nAxis powers in Asia and the Pacific Islands, leading to V-J day in \n1945.\n  When the troops in Bataan were finally forced to surrender, they \nfaced inhumane conditions and atrocities at the hands of their captors. \nBy the time they were rescued, toward the end of the war, half of New \nMexico's 1,800 soldiers had died. Another 300 would die within a year \nof returning to the U.S. as a result of complications related to their \ncaptivity. Mr. Lopez was forced to work in copper mines as a slave \nlaborer and spent time in several Japanese prison camps until he was \nrescued in September 1945 nearly 3\\1/2\\ years after he was captured. He \nwas part of a brotherhood of troops belonging to the 515th Coast \nArtillery Unit, of whom only 69 are known to still be living. The \n515th, and all who fought in Bataan, played a crucial role in our \ncountry's history, showing valor that I believe is deserving of a \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  When he returned to New Mexico, Mr. Lopez went to work for a bank in \nhis hometown of Springer. He later left the bank for a job with a \nmanufacturing company in California, where he worked for more than 30 \nyears. In 2003, Mr. Lopez was recognized as Alabama Ex-POW Veteran of \nthe Year by the National Veterans Day Organization of Birmingham, AL.\n  Mr. Lopez leaves behind his wife Katherine Young, who was raised in \nLas Vegas, NM, along with two daughters, two grandchildren, a brother, \nand two sisters. He will be buried with full military honors this week \nat Santa Fe National Cemetery.\n  Today, the town of Springer and all of New Mexico mourn a dear friend \nand America marks the passing of a true hero. I wish to honor Mr. \nLopez's memory. It will live on in the hearts of all who knew \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7958-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7958-S7959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7959-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7959-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6397.

Rept. 111-6)]\n\n       The text of the committee-recommended resolution of advice \n     and consent to ratification is as follows:\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advises and consents to the \n     ratification of the Treaty between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, \n     signed in Prague on April 8, 2010, with Protocol, including \n     Annex on Inspection Activities to the Protocol, Annex on \n     Notifications to the Protocol, and Annex on Telemetric \n     Information to the Protocol, all such documents being \n     integral parts of and collectively referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``New START Treaty'' (Treaty Document 111-\n     5), subject to the conditions of subsection (a), the \n     understandings of subsection (b), and the declarations of \n     subsection (c).\n       (a) Conditions.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following conditions, which shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) General Compliance.--If the President determines that \n     the Russian Federation is acting or has acted in a manner \n     that is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the New \n     START Treaty, or is in violation of the New START Treaty, so \n     as to threaten the national security interests of the United \n     States, then the President shall--\n       (A) consult with the Senate regarding the implications of \n     such actions for the viability of the New START Treaty and \n     for the national security interests of the United States;\n       (B) seek on an urgent basis a meeting with the Russian \n     Federation at the highest diplomatic level with the objective \n     of bringing the Russian Federation into full compliance with \n     its obligations under the New START Treaty; and\n       (C) submit a report to the Senate promptly thereafter, \n     detailing--\n       (i) whether adherence to the New START Treaty remains in \n     the national security interests of the United States; and\n       (ii) how the United States will redress the impact of \n     Russian actions on the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Presidential certifications and reports on national \n     technical means.--(A) Prior to the entry into force of the \n     New START Treaty, and annually thereafter, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that United States National \n     Technical Means, in conjunction with the verification \n     activities provided for in the New START Treaty, are \n     sufficient to ensure effective monitoring of Russian \n     compliance with the provisions of the New START Treaty and \n     timely warning of any Russian preparation to break out of the \n     limits in Article II of the New START Treaty. Following \n     submission of the first such certification, each subsequent \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report to the Senate \n     indicating how United States National Technical Means, \n     including collection, processing, and analytic resources, \n     will be utilized to ensure effective monitoring. The first \n     such report shall include a long-term plan for the \n     maintenance of New START Treaty monitoring. Each subsequent \n     report shall include an update of the long-term plan. Each \n     such report may be submitted in either classified or \n     unclassified form.\n       (B) It is the sense of the Senate that monitoring Russian \n     Federation compliance with the New START Treaty is a high \n     priority and that the inability to do so would constitute a \n     threat to United States national security interests.\n       (3) Reductions.--(A) The New START Treaty shall not enter \n     into force until instruments of ratification have been \n     exchanged in accordance with Article XIV of the New START \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If, prior to the entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President plans to implement reductions of United \n     States strategic nuclear forces below those currently planned \n     and consistent with the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive \n     Reductions, signed at Moscow on May 24, 2002 (commonly \n     referred to as ``the Moscow Treaty''), then the President \n     shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no such reductions until the President submits to \n     the Senate the President's determination that such reductions \n     are in the national security interest of the United States.\n       (4) Timely warning of breakout.--If the President \n     determines, after consultation with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, that the Russian Federation intends to break \n     out of the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall immediately inform the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate, with a view to \n     determining whether circumstances exist that jeopardize the \n     supreme interests of the United States, such that withdrawal \n     from the New START Treaty may be warranted pursuant to \n     paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the New START Treaty.\n       (5) United states missile defense test telemetry.--Prior to \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the New START Treaty does not \n     require, at any point during which it will be in force, the \n     United States to provide to the Russian Federation telemetric \n     information under Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part \n     Seven of the Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric \n     Information to the Protocol for the launch of--\n       (A) any missile defense interceptor, as defined in \n     paragraph 44 of Part One of the Protocol to the New START \n     Treaty;\n       (B) any satellite launches, missile defense sensor targets, \n     and missile defense intercept targets, the launch of which \n     uses the first stage of an existing type of United States \n     ICBM or SLBM listed in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New \n     START Treaty; or\n       (C) any missile described in clause (a) of paragraph 7 of \n     Article III of the New START Treaty.\n       (6) Conventional Prompt global strike.--(A) The Senate \n     calls on the executive branch to clarify its planning and \n     intent in developing future conventionally armed, strategic-\n     range weapon systems. To this end, prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall provide a \n     report to the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate containing the following:\n       (i) A list of all conventionally armed, strategic-range \n     weapon systems that are currently under development.\n       (ii) An analysis of the expected capabilities of each \n     system listed under clause (i).\n       (iii) A statement with respect to each system listed under \n     clause (i) as to whether any of the limits in Article II of \n     the New START Treaty apply to such system.\n       (iv) An assessment of the costs, risks, and benefits of \n     each system.\n       (v) A discussion of alternative deployment options and \n     scenarios for each system.\n       (vi) A summary of the measures that could help to \n     distinguish each system listed under clause (i) from nuclear \n     systems and reduce the risks of misinterpretation and of a \n     resulting claim that such systems might alter strategic \n     stability.\n       (B) The report under subparagraph (A) may be supplemented \n     by a classified annex.\n       (C) If, at any time after the New START Treaty enters into \n     force, the President determines that deployment of \n     conventional warheads on ICBMs or SLBMs is required at levels \n     that cannot be accommodated within the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty while sustaining a robust United \n     States nuclear triad, then the President shall immediately \n     consult with the Senate regarding the reasons for such \n     determination.\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n       (7) United states telemetric information.--In implementing \n     Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part Seven of the \n     Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric Information to the \n     Protocol, prior to agreeing to provide to the Russian \n     Federation any amount of telemetric information on a United \n     States test launch of a conventionally armed prompt global \n     strike system, the President shall certify to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate that--\n       (A) the provision of United States telemetric information--\n       (i) consists of data that demonstrate that such system is \n     not subject to the limits in Article II of the New START \n     Treaty; or\n       (ii) would be provided in exchange for significant \n     telemetric information regarding a weapon system not listed \n     in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New START Treaty, or a \n     system not deployed by the Russian Federation prior to \n     December 5, 2009;\n       (B) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to provide such telemetric information; and\n       (C) provision of such telemetric information will not \n     undermine the effectiveness of such system.\n       (8) Bilateral consultative commission.--Not later than 15 \n     days before any meeting of the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission to consider a proposal for additional measures to \n     improve the viability or effectiveness of the New START \n     Treaty or to resolve a question related to the applicability \n     of provisions of the New START Treaty to a new kind \n     of strategic offensive arm, the President shall consult \n     with the Chairman and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate with regard \n     to whether the proposal, if adopted, would constitute an \n     amendment to the New START Treaty requiring the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, section \n     2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) United states commitments ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.--\n       (A) The United States is committed to ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces. It is the \n     sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining and \n     modernizing the nuclear weapons production capabilities and \n     capacities, that will ensure the safety, reliability, and \n     performance of the United States nuclear arsenal at the New \n     START Treaty levels and meet requirements for hedging against \n     possible international developments or technical problems, in \n     conformance with United States policies and to underpin \n     deterrence;\n       (ii) to that end, the United States is committed to \n     maintaining United States nuclear weapons laboratories and \n     preserving the core nuclear weapons competencies therein; and\n       (iii) the United States is committed to providing the \n     resources needed to achieve these objectives, at a minimum at \n     the levels set forth in the President's 10-year plan provided \n     to the Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law \n     111-84).\n       (B) If appropriations are enacted that fail to meet the \n     resource requirements set forth in the President's 10-year \n     plan, or if at any time more resources are required than \n     estimated in the President's 10-year plan, the President \n     shall submit to Congress, within 60 days of such enactment or \n     the identification of the requirement for such additional \n     resources, as appropriate, a report detailing--\n       (i) how the President proposes to remedy the resource \n     shortfall;\n       (ii) if additional resources are required, the proposed \n     level of funding required and an identification of the \n     stockpile work, campaign, facility, site, asset, program, \n     operation, activity, construction, or project for which \n     additional funds are required;\n       (iii) the impact of the resource shortfall on the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of United States nuclear forces; \n     and\n       (iv) whether and why, in the changed circumstances brought \n     about by the resource shortfall, it remains in the national \n     interest of the United States to remain a Party to the New \n     START Treaty.\n       (10) Annual report.--As full and faithful implementation is \n     key to realizing the benefits of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall submit a report to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate not later than \n     January 31 of each year beginning with January 31, 2012, \n     which will provide--\n       (A) details on each Party's reductions in strategic \n     offensive arms between the date the New START Treaty entered \n     into force and December 31, 2011, or, in subsequent reports, \n     during the previous year;\n       (B) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the New START Treaty, or a \n     detailed discussion of any noncompliance by the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (C) a certification that any conversion and elimination \n     procedures adopted pursuant to Article VI of the New START \n     Treaty and Part Three of the Protocol have not resulted in \n     ambiguities that could defeat the object and purpose of the \n     New START Treaty, or--\n       (i) a list of any cases in which a conversion or \n     elimination procedure that has been demonstrated by Russia \n     within the framework of the Bilateral Consultative Commission \n     remains ambiguous or does not achieve the goals set forth in \n     paragraph 2 or 3 of Section I of Part Three of the Protocol; \n     and\n       (ii) a comprehensive explanation of steps the United States \n     has taken with respect to each such case;\n       (D) an assessment of the operation of the New START \n     Treaty's transparency mechanisms, including--\n       (i) the extent to which either Party encrypted or otherwise \n     impeded the collection of telemetric information; and\n       (ii) the extent and usefulness of exchanges of telemetric \n     information; and\n       (E) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance exists \n     that endangers the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following understandings, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) Missile defense.--It is the understanding of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) the New START Treaty does not impose any limitations on \n     the deployment of missile defenses other than the \n     requirements of paragraph 3 of Article V of the New START \n     Treaty, which states, ``Each Party shall not convert and \n     shall not use ICBM launchers and SLBM launchers for placement \n     of missile defense interceptors therein. Each Party further \n     shall not convert and shall not use launchers of missile \n     defense interceptors for placement of ICBMs and SLBMs \n     therein. This provision shall not apply to ICBM launchers \n     that were converted prior to signature of this treaty for \n     placement of missile defense interceptors therein.'';\n       (B) any additional New START Treaty limitations on the \n     deployment of missile defenses beyond those contained in \n     paragraph 3 of Article V, including any limitations agreed \n     under the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, \n     would require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may \n     enter into force for the United States only with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article \n     II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States; and\n       (C) the April 7, 2010, unilateral statement by the Russian \n     Federation on missile defense does not impose a legal \n     obligation on the United States.\n       (2) Rail-mobile icbms.--It is the understanding of the \n     United States that--\n       (A) any rail-mobile-launched ballistic missile with a range \n     in excess of 5,500 kilometers would be an ICBM, as the term \n     is defined in paragraph 37 of Part One of the Protocol (in \n     the English-language numbering), for the purposes of the New \n     START Treaty, specifically including the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty;\n       (B) an erector-launcher mechanism for launching an ICBM and \n     the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted would be an \n     ICBM launcher, as the term is defined in paragraph 28 of Part \n     One of the Protocol (in the English-language numbering), for \n     the purposes of the New START Treaty, specifically including \n     the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty;\n       (C) if either Party should produce a rail-mobile ICBM \n     system, the Bilateral Consultative Commission would address \n     the application of other parts of the New START Treaty to \n     that system, including Articles III, IV, VI, VII, and XI of \n     the New START Treaty and relevant portions of the Protocol \n     and the Annexes to the Protocol; and\n       (D) an agreement reached pursuant to subparagraph (C) is \n     subject to the requirements of Article XV of the New START \n     Treaty and, specifically, if an agreement pursuant to \n     subparagraph (C) creates substantive rights or obligations \n     that differ significantly from those in the New START Treaty \n     regarding a ``mobile launcher of ICBMs'' as defined in Part \n     One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty, such agreement \n     will be considered an amendment to the New START Treaty \n     pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article XV of the New START Treaty \n     and will be submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification.\n       (3) Strategic-range, non-nuclear weapon systems.--It is the \n     understanding of the United States that--\n       (A) future, strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems that \n     do not otherwise meet the definitions of the New START Treaty \n     will not be ``new kinds of strategic offensive arms'' subject \n     to the New START Treaty;\n       (B) nothing in the New START Treaty restricts United States \n     research, development, testing, and evaluation of strategic-\n     range, non-nuclear weapons, including any weapon that is \n     capable of boosted aerodynamic flight;\n       (C) nothing in the New START Treaty prohibits deployments \n     of strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems; and\n       (D) the addition to the New START Treaty of--\n       (i) any limitations on United States research, development, \n     testing, and evaluation of strategic-range, non-nuclear \n     weapon systems, including any weapon that is capable of \n     boosted aerodynamic flight; or\n       (ii) any prohibition on the deployment of such systems, \n     including any such limitations or prohibitions agreed under \n     the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission,\n     would require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may \n     enter into force for the United States only with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the New\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\n     START Treaty is subject to the following declarations, which \n     express the intent of the Senate:\n       (1) Missile defense.--(A) It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it is the policy of the United States \n     ``to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an \n     effective National Missile Defense system capable of \n     defending the territory of the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, \n     or deliberate)'';\n       (ii) defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail; and\n       (iii) further limitations on the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States are not in the national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (B) The New START Treaty and the April 7, 2010, unilateral \n     statement of the Russian Federation on missile defense do not \n     limit in any way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, \n     activities that the United States Government currently plans \n     or that might be required over the duration of the New START \n     Treaty to protect the United States pursuant to the National \n     Missile Defense Act of 1999, or to protect United States \n     Armed Forces and United States allies from limited ballistic \n     missile attack, including further planned enhancements to the \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system and all phases of the \n     Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe.\n       (C) Given its concern about missile defense issues, the \n     Senate expects the executive branch to offer regular \n     briefings, not less than twice each year, to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on all \n     missile defense issues related to the New START Treaty and on \n     the progress of United States-Russia dialogue and cooperation \n     regarding missile defense.\n       (2) Defending the united states and allies against \n     strategic attack.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) a paramount obligation of the United States Government \n     is to provide for the defense of the American people, \n     deployed members of the United States Armed Forces, and \n     United States allies against nuclear attacks to the best of \n     its ability;\n       (B) policies based on ``mutual assured destruction'' or \n     intentional vulnerability can be contrary to the safety and \n     security of both countries, and the United States and the \n     Russian Federation share a common interest in moving \n     cooperatively as soon as possible away from a strategic \n     relationship based on mutual assured destruction;\n       (C) in a world where biological, chemical, and nuclear \n     weapons and the means to deliver them are proliferating, \n     strategic stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive \n     measures;\n       (D) accordingly, the United States is and will remain free \n     to reduce the vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges;\n       (E) the United States will welcome steps by the Russian \n     Federation also to adopt a fundamentally defensive strategic \n     posture that no longer views robust strategic defensive \n     capabilities as undermining the overall strategic balance, \n     and stands ready to cooperate with the Russian Federation on \n     strategic defensive capabilities, as long as such cooperation \n     is aimed at fostering and in no way constrains the defensive \n     capabilities of both sides; and\n       (F) the United States is committed to improving United \n     States strategic defensive capabilities both quantitatively \n     and qualitatively during the period that the New START Treaty \n     is in effect, and such improvements are consistent with the \n     treaty.\n       (3) Conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems.--\n     Consistent with statements made by the United States that \n     such systems are not intended to affect strategic stability \n     with respect to the Russian Federation, the Senate finds that \n     conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems not co-\n     located with nuclear-armed systems do not affect strategic \n     stability between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (4) Nunn-lugar cooperative threat reduction.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction (CTR) Program has made an invaluable contribution \n     to the security and elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction, including nuclear weapons and materials in \n     Russia and elsewhere, and that the President should continue \n     the global CTR Program and CTR assistance to Russia, \n     including for the purpose of facilitating implementation of \n     the New START Treaty.\n       (5) Asymmetry in reductions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the New START \n     Treaty, the President should regulate reductions in United \n     States strategic offensive arms so that the number of \n     accountable strategic offensive arms under the New START \n     Treaty possessed by the Russian Federation in no case exceeds \n     the comparable number of accountable strategic offensive arms \n     possessed by the United States to such an extent that a \n     strategic imbalance endangers the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n       (6) Compliance.--(A) The New START Treaty will remain in \n     the interests of the United States only to the extent that \n     the Russian Federation is in strict compliance with its \n     obligations under the New START Treaty.\n       (B) Given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch to offer regular briefings, not \n     less than four times each year, to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on compliance \n     issues related to the New START Treaty. Such briefings shall \n     include a description of all United States efforts in United \n     States-Russian diplomatic channels and bilateral fora to \n     resolve any compliance issues and shall include, but would \n     not necessarily be limited to, a description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings; and\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Consultative Commission, within thirty days of such meetings.\n       (7) Expansion of strategic arsenals in countries other than \n     russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that if, during the \n     time the New START Treaty remains in force, the President \n     determines that there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the New START Treaty so \n     as to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the New START Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (8) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols (commonly referred to as the \n     ``INF Treaty''), approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and \n     condition (8) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Document Agreed Among the States Parties \n     to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of \n     November 19, 1990 (commonly referred to as the ``CFE Flank \n     Document''), approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (9) Treaty modification or reinterpretation.--The Senate \n     declares that any agreement or understanding which in any \n     material way modifies, amends, or reinterprets United States \n     or Russian obligations under the New START Treaty, including \n     the time frame for implementation of the New START Treaty, \n     should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification.\n       (10) Consultations.--Given the continuing interest of the \n     Senate in the New START Treaty and in strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States, the Senate expects the President to \n     consult with the Senate prior to taking actions relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article XIV of the New START Treaty.\n       (11) Tactical nuclear weapons.--(A) The Senate calls upon \n     the President to pursue, following consultation with allies, \n     an agreement with the Russian Federation that would address \n     the disparity between the tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles \n     of the Russian Federation and of the United States and would \n     secure and reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable \n     manner.\n       (B) Recognizing the difficulty the United States has faced \n     in ascertaining with confidence the number of tactical \n     nuclear weapons maintained by the Russian Federation and the \n     security of those weapons, the Senate urges the President to \n     engage the Russian Federation with the objectives of--\n       (i) establishing cooperative measures to give each Party to \n     the New START Treaty improved confidence regarding the \n     accurate accounting and security of tactical nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the other Party; and\n       (ii) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its tactical nuclear weapons.\n       (12) Further strategic arms reductions.--(A) Recognizing \n     the obligation under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow on July 1, 1968, ``to pursue negotiations in good \n     faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the \n     nuclear arms race at any early date and to nuclear \n     disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete \n     disarmament under strict and effective international \n     control,'' and in anticipation of the ratification and entry \n     into force of the New START Treaty, the Senate calls upon the \n     other nuclear weapon states to give careful and early \n     consideration to corresponding reductions of their own \n     nuclear arsenals.\n       (B) The Senate declares that further arms reduction \n     agreements obligating the United States to reduce or limit \n     the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in any \n     militarily significant manner may be made only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President as set forth in \n     Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       (13) Modernization and replacement of united states \n     strategic delivery vehicles.--In accordance with paragraph 1 \n     of Article V of the New START Treaty, which states that, \n     ``Subject to the provisions of this treaty, modernization and \n     replacement of strategic offensive arms may be carried\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\n     out,'' it is the sense of the Senate that United States \n     deterrence and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of \n     strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States \n     is committed to accomplishing the modernization and \n     replacement of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and \n     to ensuring the continued flexibility of United States \n     conventional and nuclear delivery systems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7968-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of a nomination was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DODD for the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n       * Peter A.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the application of a consistent Medicare part B premium for \nall Medicare beneficiaries for 2011; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, recently announced that nearly three-quarters of \nMedicare enrollees will see no increase in their Medicare Part B \npremium in 2011.\n  This group of beneficiaries is protected by a ``hold harmless'' \nprovision in the law for years when there is no increase in Social \nSecurity checks. As a result, these beneficiaries will continue to pay \nthe same monthly premium of $96.40 that they have paid since 2008.\n  Unfortunately, 27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries do not receive \nthis ``hold-harmless'' protection and will see their monthly premiums \ndisproportionately increase to $115.40 to shoulder the full load for \nthose beneficiaries who are held harmless. This represents an increase \nof nearly 19 percent over the past two years with no cost of living \nadjustment to their retirement pensions or annuities.\n  This inequity in the law negatively affects new Medicare enrollees, \nlow-income beneficiaries who receive Medicare and Medicaid, higher \nincome enrollees who already pay higher premiums, and seniors who do \nnot receive Social Security, such as federal, state, and local \ngovernment retirees.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to protect all Medicare \nbeneficiaries from premium increase, especially during these tough \neconomic times when every penny counts. A premium increase for many \nseniors would mean choosing between food and medicine and that's a \nchoice they should not have to make.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Medicare Premium Fairness Act. \nThis legislation would restore fairness to our Medicare system and put \nmoney in the pockets of 12 million seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities who desperately need it. It would correct this inequity in \nthe law by applying the ``hold harmless'' provision to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, so that no enrollee will pay a monthly premium more than \n$96.40 in 2011.\n  The Medicare Premium Fairness Act is cosponsored by Senator Dodd and \nSenator Casey, both of whom have been integral to the development of \nthis legislation. Our legislation is supported by twenty four \norganizations that represent retirees and senior citizens across the \ncountry. I would like to thank all of the number of organizations who \nhave endorsed our legislation today, including the American Federation \nof State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, the National Active \nand Retired Federal Employees Association, NARFE, and the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, NCPSSM.\n  Now is the time to protect all Medicare beneficiaries from \nsubstantial and unfair Part B premium increases next year. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass the \nMedicare Premium Fairness Act before the end of the year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3953. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nbenefits for children with spina bifida of veterans exposed to \nherbicides while serving in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam era \noutside Vietnam, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, today, I am introducing legislation that would \nexpand an existing VA benefit program for certain children with spina \nbifida. These benefits are currently provided under chapter 18 of title \n38, United States Code, to the natural children of veterans who were \nexposed to herbicides such as Agent Orange, in Vietnam or near the \nDemilitarized Zone, DMZ, in Korea during the Vietnam era.\n  Current law provides benefits for the natural children of veterans \nexposed to herbicides only if the veteran served in a specific \nlocation, during a specific time frame. VA reports that 1,222 childen \ncurrently receive these benefits and that only 10 of these receive them \nbased on the service of a parent who served in outside of Vietnam.\n  However, VA has conceded that certain veterans who worked on the \nperimeter of Air Force bases in Thailand outside of the locations \nprovided in current law during the Vietnam era were exposed to \nherbicides. As a result, children of those veterans suffering from \nspina bifida are excluded from the benefits provided based solely on \nwhere the exposure occurred.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would correct this inequity. \nBecause only a very small number of children whose veteran parent \nserved outside of Vietnam currently receive benefits, I expect only a \nsmall number of children would qualify for benefits under this bill. \nHowever, it is an inequity that should be remedied.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill and provide the exact same \nbenefit to all children who have spina bifida related to the veteran \nparent's exposure to herbicides regardless of the location of their \nparent's exposure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH:\n  S. 3955. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \nspace-available travel on military aircraft for members of the reserve \ncomponents, a member or former member of a reserve component who is \neligible for retired pay but for age, widows and widowers of retired \nmembers, and dependents; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Space Available \nEquity Act.\n  Members and retirees of the National Guard and Reserve, their \nfamilies, and surviving military spouses make great sacrifices for our \nNation. However, too often these individuals do not receive the \nbenefits they have earned for their service.\n  For instance, members of the reserve components and ``gray area'' \nretirees, National Guardsmen or Reservists eligible for retirement but \nunder the age of 60, have limited space-available travel privileges on \nDepartment of Defense aircraft under current regulation. Their space-\navailable travel benefits are restricted to the continental United \nStates and are not extended to their dependents, unlike active duty \nmembers and retirees.\n  Surviving spouses of a military member eligible for retired pay \nretain no space-available travel privileges at all after the death of \ntheir spouse, despite having made a lifetime commitment to the military \nor in many cases, lost their loved one in war.\n  To correct these inequities, I am introducing the National Guard, \nReserve, Gray Area Retiree, and Surviving Spouse Space-available Travel \nEquity Act. This bill will give these deserving individuals \ncomprehensive and equitable space-available travel privileges on \nDepartment of Defense aircraft.

Additionally, by granting \ncommissary and exchange privileges to these Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \nand Marines they will be able to stay connected to their military \ncommunities.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Guard Association of \nthe United States.

A bill to establish a medical education trust fund, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Graduate Medical \nEducation Reform Act of 2010 along with my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse.\n  During my tenure in Congress, I have worked to ensure that medical \nschools and teaching hospitals have adequate resources to train the \nnext generation of doctors. I have championed legislation to improve \nthe financing of GME payments to teaching hospitals and annually \nspearhead efforts to increase grant funding for health professions \nprograms through the appropriations process. In addition, the new \nhealth insurance reform law contains an entire title of workforce \nprovisions, many of which I helped to write. The consistent goal of \nthese efforts has been to support our future health care workforce and \nimprove the care that patients receive. The GME Reform Act is an \nextension of those efforts.\n  The legislation challenges recent statements by some experts that \nMedicare overpays teaching hospitals to train medical residents by \nincreasing federal oversight of medical residency programs. For most \nteaching hospitals, which incur higher costs than other hospitals, this \nfunding is essential to support residency programs and provide high-\nquality patient care. In addition, now is not the time to starve these \nimportant programs of the funding necessary to train our future health \ncare workforce since 30 million more Americans will gain access to \nhealth insurance in 2014.\n  First, the legislation would enhance GME payment transparency. New \ninformation about the amount of GME funding that teaching hospitals \nreceive respective to the costs to remain operational would demonstrate \nthat more could be done to support these important programs.\n  The GME Reform Act would also ensure that teaching hospitals and \nresidency programs spend GME funding to train residents in new models \nof care and updated technology. Some medical residents, including those \nin my state, are already trained in these areas, but that is not the \ncase in programs throughout the country. This legislation would \nencourage reform in every program by linking three percent of indirect \nmedical education payments to teaching hospitals to the performance of \nresidency programs. Medical colleges, accrediting bodies, and other \nstakeholders that are most familiar with how to train residents would \nset the specific performance measures. This new oversight would help to \nbreak down the silos in medicine and ensure that physicians work \ntogether to provide patients with comprehensive health care.\n  These are important and sensible reforms. As I said, many programs \nthroughout the country have already acted in this manner. But, since it \nis often most effective to have a reasonable balance of oversight and \nincentives, this legislation would provide a bonus payment to programs \nthat train at least one-third of all residents in primary care.\n  In addition, this legislation would transform the way that children's \nhospitals receive payments for training the future health care \nworkforce by\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\ntaking those payments out of the discretionary appropriations process \nand providing mandatory, stable funding every year through a new trust \nfund.It would also extend residency training funds to children's \npsychiatric hospitals and women and infants hospitals. There are just a \nhandful of hospitals around the country that fall in these two \ncategories, including two in Rhode Island. Indeed, they should also \nhave access to the resources necessary to support the training of \nresidents.\n  I am pleased that the GME Reform Act is supported by the only medical \nschool in my state, the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown \nUniversity.\n  My colleagues, Leader Reid, Senator Nelson of Florida, and Senator \nSchumer have also taken great interest in supporting our future health \ncare workforce by championing legislation to increase the number of \nphysicians trained each year. This effort is vitally important to \nending the shortage of primary care providers in many areas, responding \nto the increased demand of a growing and aging population, and \npreparing for the implementation of the new health insurance reform \nlaw. I look forward to continuing to support their efforts and working \nwith them on the GME Reform Act as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 680\n\n       Whereas wild tiger populations have dwindled from \n     approximately 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to \n     as few as 3,200 in 2010, and only approximately 1,000 wild \n     tigers are breeding females;\n       Whereas tigers now occupy a mere 7 percent of the habitat \n     that tigers historically have occupied;\n       Whereas poaching, illegal wildlife trade, habitat \n     conversion, depletion of prey base, conflict between humans \n     and wildlife, and other pressures continue to threaten the \n     last wild tigers;\n       Whereas the remaining tiger habitat in Asia supports some \n     of the richest biodiversity and some of the poorest human \n     populations;\n       Whereas the remaining tiger habitat benefits local human \n     populations by providing watersheds and buffers against \n     natural disaster and contributing to livelihoods;\n       Whereas the remaining tiger habitat in Asia represents some \n     of the largest intact storehouses of terrestrial carbon on \n     Earth, containing an average of 3\\1/2\\ times more carbon than \n     areas outside of tiger habitat;\n       Whereas the tiger, an iconic species worldwide, can act as \n     both a catalyst and a symbol for the conservation of the last \n     great forests of Asia;\n       Whereas 2010, the ``Year of the Tiger'' in the Chinese \n     calendar and beyond, presents a global opportunity to commit \n     to halting the decline in tigers and to ensuring the doubling \n     of the numbers of tigers by the next ``Year of the Tiger'' in \n     2022;\n       Whereas the Government of Russia is hosting the Global \n     Tiger Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, on November 22 \n     through 24, 2010;\n       Whereas at the Summit, all 13 countries with remaining wild \n     tiger populations are expected to commit to a Global Tiger \n     Recovery Program;\n       Whereas the remaining tiger habitat is located in remote \n     transnational areas, providing an opportunity for \n     transboundary cooperation among countries with remaining wild \n     tiger populations;\n       Whereas countries with remaining wild tiger populations \n     need the support and cooperation of the global community to \n     protect and restore wild tiger populations;\n       Whereas the United States has been a consistent leader in \n     supporting international tiger conservation; and\n       Whereas strong United States support for remaining wild \n     tiger populations, the Tiger Summit, and the Global Tiger \n     Recovery Program will be central to the success of tiger \n     conservation efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of the Tiger Summit, as such goals \n     reinforce the interests of the United States in recovering \n     tigers in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Rhinoceros and Tiger \n     Conservation Act of 1994 (16 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.), and the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Wild Fauna and Flora, done at Washington March 3, 1973 (27 \n     UST 1087;

and\n       (9) urges concerted coordination among all relevant United \n     States agencies to provide support to countries with \n     remaining wild tiger populations in a manner that enables \n     United States resources to provide maximum conservation \n     benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "17", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/17/senate-section/article/S7979-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 681--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 15 THROUGH 19, \n             2010, AS ``GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK/USA''\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution;
