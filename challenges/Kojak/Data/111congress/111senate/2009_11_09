Mr. President, our Nation mourns every death of an American \nservicemember. We grieve alongside the families who sacrifice so much \nwhile their loved ones serve and hurt even more when loved ones give \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  I can remember the many calls I have made to Nevadans as a result of \nthe deaths of their loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are \ndifficult calls to make when that Nevadan does not come home.\n  I remember the first call. A young man, a star athlete in high \nschool, was killed. I spoke with his coach, his friend who took care of \nhim. That was the first. I remember the last, just a couple of days \nago, a death in Afghanistan.\n  We are especially heartbroken by last week's tragedy that occurred \ndeep in the heart of Texas. The entire Senate sends its deepest \ncondolences to those who have lost mothers and fathers, sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives at Fort Hood. Our thoughts are with the \ntroops who have lost their friends and fellow soldiers and those who \ncontinue to heal as I speak. These men and women died in the Soldier \nReadiness Processing Center. This is supposed to be the last place our \ntroops go before they are deployed, in this instance to Afghanistan and \nIraq. No one ever suspects it will be the last place they would ever \ngo.\n  As we mourn, we honor the lives of those who died on that base. We \nhope for the full and speedy recovery of those who have been injured, \nand we are thankful for the men and women who came to the aid of the \nwounded and exhibited the kind of heroism that makes our Armed Forces \nthe best in the world. And, of course, we are especially grateful to \nKimberly Munley, who stopped the gunman.\n  The 13 who died at Fort Hood were from 11 different States, States \nthat border the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Great Lakes, States high \nin the Rockies and in the Great Plains. These public servants ranged in \nrank from private to colonel and even included an\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\nArmy civilian. The oldest was a husband, a father, and a grandfather \nfrom Spokane, WA. He was a civilian, a physician assistant who worked \nin rural clinics and veterans hospitals. He was 4 years away from his \nretirement. The youngest was just barely 19 years old, a private first \nclass from northern Utah, who was just months away from deploying to \nAfghanistan. A 29-year-old sergeant from Wisconsin joined her Nation's \nmilitary after the September 11 attacks. A 21-year-old from outside \nChicago enlisted in the Army to help him afford college, where he \ndreamed of an education studying music. A 22-year-old specialist from \nOklahoma had been married for just 2 months. A 21-year-old private \nfirst class from Chicago was 3 months pregnant. A 55-year-old \nlieutenant colonel was the grandmother to six. A 52-year-old major \nspoke very little English when he came to this country from Mexico in \nhis teens, but he earned a Ph.D. in psychology, became a teacher, and \nultimately chose to serve his country in the military. And Kimberly \nMunley, a woman who was shot several times. Kimberly was a sergeant and \na civilian police officer. She took down the alleged shooter with her \npistol, even as she suffered wounds of her own from the gunman. Yes, \nFort Hood is home to truly remarkable, selfless Americans.\n  Our Nation misses those who were murdered, and our thoughts are with \nthose who are now healing as a result of having been wounded in that \nsenseless crime. The appropriate officials both inside and outside the \nArmy will continue to investigate how such a tragedy occurred. The \nSenate will support them in every way we can.\n  In the meantime, one of the ways we can support the brave Americans \nwho volunteer for duty is to give them the resources they need when \nthey come home. We are trying to move forward on a package of bills \nthat will make wounded veterans' lives a little easier. Sadly, these \nbills are being inexplicably held up by the minority. We have a number \nof very important bills that have been reported out of the Veterans' \nCommittee, and we have not been able to move forward on them. Among \nother things, these bills will help veterans to get access to the \ncaregivers they need for even the smallest task they cannot handle on \ntheir own. These bills will support veterans' mental health services \nand other health benefits, and they will make sure our veterans do not \nhave to live on the streets.\n  Right now, a Republican Senator is singlehandedly standing in the way \nof these bills. Under the rules of the Senate, that is what he decided \nto do, but that doesn't make it right. I hope he will drop his \nobjection so we can put our veterans' health ahead of whatever issues \nhe is concerned about. The same Senator did this for months on a number \nof very important environmental bills, some lands bills. In that \ninstance, we gathered all the bills together and put them into one bill \nand on a bipartisan basis got them out of here. We have done the same \nwith these veterans bills.\n  These are extremely important, popular pieces of legislation, and we \nare going to move forward on these as quickly as we can. It would be \nnice if we could do them before Veterans Day, which is the day after \ntomorrow. I also look forward to moving ahead the Military \nConstruction-Veterans Affairs appropriations that will fund housing for \nour military families, improve our bases, and support veterans \nprograms.\n  Tomorrow morning when the Senate convenes, we will have a moment of \nsilence to honor the fallen at Fort Hood. I encourage all Senators to \ncome to the Senate at the time the Senate opens tomorrow for this most \nimportant time.\n  I have spoken with the Republican leader today. He is going to be as \nhelpful as possible in making sure we move forward on this Military \nConstruction-Veterans Affairs appropriations bill at the earliest \npossible time. I hope we can do it tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11260-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last Saturday evening, Democratic \nleaders in the House passed by the narrowest of margins a massive bill \nwith a simple goal: to vastly expand the Federal Government's role in \nthe health care decisions of every American. This bill is strongly \nopposed by most Americans, which is why one out of seven Democrats \nvoted against it. These Democrats have gotten the message that \nAmericans are fed up with all the spending and all the debt and that \nthey do not support a so-called health care reform that raises \npremiums, raises taxes, and slashes Medicare. Americans don't want a \n2,000-page, trillion-dollar government experiment in health care. They \nwant commonsense reforms that increase access and lower costs.\n  Soon, Senate Democrats will propose their version of a health care \nbill. We don't yet know all the details, but we do know that at its \ncore, this bill would also lead to higher premiums, higher taxes, and \nmassive cuts to Medicare to fund new government programs. This is not \nthe reform the American people were looking for. This is not the reform \nthey were told they could expect.\n  Americans feel as though they have been taken for a ride in this \ndebate. I don't blame them. It is time we listen to the American \npeople. At a time of double-digit unemployment and record deficits and \ndebt, the views of ordinary Americans should not be cast aside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11260-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11260-S11261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today marks a very important day in the \ncause of freedom. On this day 20 years ago, the Berlin Wall, which for \ndecades had divided the free people of West Berlin from the captive \nGermans in the Soviet-controlled East Berlin, finally came down.\n  In anticipation of this anniversary, we had the rare honor last \nTuesday of hearing German Chancellor Angela Merkel address a joint \nmeeting of Congress. She was the first German Chancellor to do so in \nmore than 50 years. Chancellor Merkel spoke about the experience of \ngrowing up with millions of others behind the Iron Curtain. She spoke \nof how it was impossible for herself and anyone else she knew to travel \nto America. Yet even as a child she knew that tyranny was wrong and \nthat the answer to tyranny could be found across the ocean in America.\n  Now decades later, Chancellor Merkel's country has gained that \nfreedom, and a little girl who grew up under a repressive regime is the \nfreely elected leader of a united Germany. Here is what Chancellor \nMerkel had to say about what made that extraordinary journey possible. \nShe said just last week:\n\n       Twenty years have passed since we were given this \n     incredible gift of freedom. But\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\n     there is still nothing that inspires me more, nothing that \n     spurs me on more, nothing that fills me more with positive \n     feelings than the power of freedom.\n\n  Chancellor Merkel also spoke very graciously of her gratitude, of \nGermany's gratitude to America. ``I know, we Germans know,'' she said, \n``how much we owe to you, our American friends.'' She recalls President \nKennedy's trip to Berlin shortly after the construction of the Berlin \nWall when he declared his solidarity with the people of Germany with \nhis famous words: ``Ich Bin ein Berliner.'' And she recalled President \nReagan's 1987 trip to Berlin when he made a clear and direct appeal to \nthe Soviet Premier for openness with the equally famous words ``Tear \ndown this wall.''\n  Freedom has its own imperatives. It demanded that the Berlin Wall \ncome down, and 20 years ago it did. It was a remarkable time. After \ndecades of oppression, which the United States met with a sustained \nstrategy of containment, the world witnessed the relatively peaceful \nliberation of a continent. But for most of us, the most remarkable \nmoment from those days was the moment we saw one of the most potent \nsymbols of the Communist era, the Berlin Wall, come down, piece by \npiece. We celebrate this great anniversary with all the free peoples of \nthe world, mindful of those who still yearn for the same freedom \nChancellor Merkel dreamed of as a young girl. May they all know the \nfreedom that is the birthright of every man and every woman.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11261-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before the Republican leader leaves the \nfloor, let me thank him for his comments about the Berlin Wall, which \nare very appropriate. I still have on my desk in my office in the \nCapitol a large piece of stone from the Berlin Wall. I was there a few \nweeks after the wall came down. It took a long time for it to come \ndown. The symbol of that I look at every single day as a reminder of \nwhat all of us knew for so many years; that is, there is something \nterribly wrong about a system that creates a wall to keep in its \npeople.\n  So I appreciate the comments on the 20th anniversary, and I think it \nis appropriate to recognize the great achievement that occurred 20 \nyears ago when that wall did come down, much to the surprise of many \nthat something like that could ever occur.\n  Today, Mr. President, I want to speak, if I may, for a couple of \nminutes and to share some brief thoughts in honor of our veterans on \nVeterans Day. It is a day, of course, to acknowledge the sacrifice of \nthose who have served and those who have given their lives to secure \nthe very liberty we enjoy as Americans.\n  Forty-three members of the U.S. military from my home State of \nConnecticut have made that ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan \nover the past several years. They are all deeply missed, and today our \nthoughts are with them and their families and friends. This Veterans \nDay, we feel an additional sense of loss in the wake of the shocking \nslaughter at Fort Hood last week. Our anger and bewilderment at this \nhorrific act of violence are matched only by the sadness of the loss of \nthese young, brave men and women. We keep the wounded and the families \nof the victims in our prayers and our minds.\n  Mr. President, we are proud to be a nation with an All-Volunteer \nmilitary. No one comes to your door and tells you that you have been \nchosen to shoulder the burden of protecting that which we all hold \ndear. It is a burden welcomed by our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, and coastguardsmen. If all they did was to raise their hands, \nwe would owe them a profound debt of gratitude. But for those who do \nvolunteer, military service isn't just a patriotic obligation, it is an \nhonor, and it is a way of life.\n  Our men and women in uniform fulfill their duties with unparalleled \nskill and pride. They represent the greatest fighting force the world \nhas ever known, but also the finest core of infantrymen, pilots, \ndrivers, mechanics, and logistical support staff you will find anywhere \nin any enterprise. If you visit with our troops, you meet all kinds of \nmen and women: first generation Americans, those with a long family \nhistory of service, members of every race, religion, and, yes, even \ngays and lesbians serve as well, as we all know. Most of them seem \nimpossibly young to me. All of them are unmistakably proud to be \nserving the United States of America.\n  Some of them will come home to a hero's welcome, applauded at the \nairports and greeted by the warm embrace of children who seem to have \ngrown a foot while their mother or father was overseas. Some will come \nhome with wounds that will require a lifetime of recovery; sometimes \nthey are wounds we cannot see. Some of them will come home to find that \nthe home they once knew is gone, and they will need a tremendous amount \nof our help and support to get back on their feet. All of them, of \ncourse, Mr. President, deserve our gratitude. All of them need our \nsupport, and all of them deserve to know, as they risk their lives, \nthat the benefits they have earned will be there for them when they \nreturn.\n  Although I know we all share a deep appreciation for our men and \nwomen in uniform, the sad truth is that some in Washington have in \nprevious years treated veterans' benefits as a line item like any \nother, subject to the political whims of the annual budget battles we \nhave.\n  Let's be clear, if we can. Those benefits aren't a gift from a \ngenerous Congress. Those benefits are earned by our veterans, earned \nwith sweat and blood and tireless duty. They represent the most sacred \nof promises, and they are promises we must keep.\n  That is why I have always fought for funding of veterans' benefits, \nincluding the best health care we have to offer, so that when our \ntroops incur medical costs in defense of our Nation, they do not have \nto pay them out of their own pockets. That is why I have supported the \npost 9/11 GI bill, so that troops can continue their education, and \nfought to include military families under the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, so the burden of caring for a loved one doesn't crush a family who \nhas already sacrificed so much.\n  We make these commitments to our troops in recognition of the \ncommitment they have made to us. Today is a day to celebrate that \ncommitment and to mark the many sacrifices it entails. Today, we think \nof young men and women across our Nation, just out of high school in \nmany cases, sitting down with their parents to tell them they have \nheard the call to serve, pushing through the difficult days of basic \ntraining, facing that very first deployment to the battlefield. Today \nwe think of those families they leave behind, as they pray for the safe \nreturn of their loved ones.\n  Today we will all think of those who have come home draped in the \nflag they have sacrificed their lives to defend, and those whose lives \nhave been forever changed by the injuries they have suffered in defense \nof our liberties and freedoms. These are our sons and daughters, our \nfathers and mothers. They are neighbors of ours and friends and \ncolleagues. They are truly our fellow heroes.\n  Today we thank them for their service, we mark their sacrifice, we \ntake pride in their remarkable courage, and we reaffirm our commitment \nto keeping the promise we made when they raised their hands and \nvolunteered.\n  Mr. President, I know I am not alone in my gratitude for our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coastguardsmen. I certainly know \nI am not alone in my pride in our talented and dedicated military.

Mr. President, on this 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall's \ncollapse, I would like to say a few words about the Cold War and the \nlessons we should take from it.\n  It is often said that President Ronald Reagan won the Cold War \nwithout firing a shot, and that is true. Unfortunately, the current \nadministration seems to have forgotten the overarching lesson of \nPresident Reagan's legacy.\n  Reagan's predecessor had urged Americans to abandon their inordinate \nfear of communism, but Reagan was determined to infuse U.S. foreign \npolicy with a sense of moral clarity, which had been lost during the \n1970s. The Reagan administration championed the cause of democracy \nactivists in Russia and Eastern Europe, and it did not shy away from \nhighlighting the Soviet Union's complete denial of personal freedom.\n  In 1982, when the United States was mired in its worst recession \nsince World War II, President Reagan defied the pessimism of the day, \nand he predicted:\n\n       The march of freedom and democracy which will leave \n     Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left \n     other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-\n     expression of their people.\n\n  Roughly a year later, he called the Soviet Union what it so obviously \nwas, an ``evil empire.'' The ``evil empire'' speech drew criticism from \nmany of Reagan's domestic political opponents, and it greatly angered \nthe Kremlin. But it also galvanized Soviet dissidents who were \nencouraged that a U.S. President had been bold enough to denounce the \nmoral bankruptcy of communism.\n  One particular Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky, found Reagan's \nspeech deeply inspiring. Sharansky read about it in the pages of \nPravda, the Soviet propaganda newspaper, while he was imprisoned in a \ngulag prison camp on the Siberian border. Years later, Sharansky \ndescribed his reaction to the speech and the reaction of his fellow \nprisoners:\n\n       Tapping on walls, word of Reagan's provocation quickly \n     spread throughout the prison. We dissidents were ecstatic. \n     Finally, the leader of the free world had spoken the truth--a \n     truth that burned inside the heart of each and every one of \n     us.\n\n  Mr. President, this past June, when prodemocracy rallies broke out in \nIran following a fraudulent election, I hoped the current \nadministration would follow President Reagan's example of American \nleadership and offer strong support for the Iranians who took to the \nstreets and risked their lives to oppose a tyrannical regime. But the \nPresident's statement at the time, expressing ``deep concerns about the \nelection,'' lacked the moral fortitude the world has come to expect \nfrom America, the world's standard bearer of freedom and democracy.\n  New antigovernment protests began last week to mark the 30th \nanniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Still, \nthe White House failed to use the opportunity to make the moral case \nfor freedom over totalitarian oppression. In a message to the White \nHouse, demonstrators could be heard chanting: ``Either you're with \nthem, or you're with us.''\n  The President's decision on how to respond should be easy: the \nadministration should stand with democracy and use this opportunity to \nunderline the moral failings of Iran's dictatorship.\n  Anthony Dolan, chief speechwriter for President Reagan, wrote in the \nWall Street Journal today:\n\n       Reagan spoke formally and repeatedly of deploying against \n     criminal regimes the one weapon they fear more than military \n     or economic sanction: The publicly spoken truth about their \n     moral absurdity, their ontological weakness--their own \n     oppressed people.\n\n  Moral clarity helped Ronald Reagan bring down Soviet totalitarianism \nduring the 1980s, and it can help us bring freedom to Iran today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning, I woke up in Chicago, got \ndressed, came downstairs, met a staffer, went off to a breakfast, out \nto the airport, and then here to work in Washington on Capitol Hill. It \nwas a fairly normal day for Members of the Senate and Congress. We move \nabout and don't think twice about restrictions on our movement or \nproblems that we might have in getting from place to place except for \ntraffic, perhaps a delayed airplane. But for 6,800 veterans, they woke \nup this morning in a hospital bed at home or went from that bed to a \nwheelchair and will stay in that house today and every day.\n  There are 6,800 seriously disabled veterans who are not in veterans \nhospitals or in nursing homes but at home--at home with someone who \nloves them very much.\n  Yesterday, in Chicago, I had a press conference with a young man \nnamed Yuriy Zmysly. Yuriy Zmysly is a veteran of both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, who came home, and during the course of a surgery at a \nVeterans Hospital, after he was home, had a serious complication--a \ndenial of oxygen to his brain--and he has become a quadriplegic. Yuriy \nhas no family, but he had a devoted and loving young woman in his \nlife--Aimee. After he faced quadriplegia, Aimee said she wanted to \nmarry him. So Aimee married Yuriy during his struggle with this health \nissue and now has given her life to him every day, every minute, every \nhour. She is a caregiver who is there for her husband, a veteran.\n  Mr. President, repeat that story 6,800 times, and you will find \nhusbands and wives, parents, brothers and sisters, who are giving their \nlives every single day to disabled veterans who are at home surviving \nbecause of the love and concern of people like Aimee Zmysly.\n  I think of Ed and Marybeth Edmondson, whose son Eric was the victim \nof a traumatic brain injury in Iraq. Ed quit his job, his wife gave \nhers up, and they moved in the house to take care of Eric and his wife \nand little baby. That is their life, their commitment to them.\n  I tell you these stories this week as we celebrate Veterans Day \nbecause I believe these caregivers deserve something special from us, \nfrom the American people, and from our government. That is why I picked \nup a bill introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton that provides a helping \nhand for caregivers such as those I have just described.\n  It isn't a lot, but it could make a big difference. It says we will \noffer them the very basics in training so that these home caregivers, \nthese family caregivers, know what to do--how to change dressings on \nwounds, how to administer an intravenous formula or prescription, how \nto give an injection, how to move a patient from a bed to a chair and \nback again.\n  It provides also a monthly stipend for them--not a lot of money but \nsomething to help them get by because, for most of them, this is their \nlife, this veteran they are working for every day to keep alive and as \ncomfortable and happy as that person can be. It gives them 2 weeks of \nrespite so they can take off and put themselves back together after all \nof the stress and strain, fiscally and mentally, of caring for this \nperson they love.\n  I was so glad that Danny Akaka, who is chairman of the Senate \nVeterans' Committee, not only considered this bill but made it his own, \nadded good things to it and reported it out of his committee and brings \nit to the floor where it sits on our calendar of business, a bill to \nhelp veterans caregivers, some 7,000 veterans caregivers who give each \nday to these veterans we treasure so much for their service to our \ncountry.\n  Sadly, this bill has been sitting on the calendar for weeks because \none Senator objects to it. That is the way the Senate works--one \nSenator. This Senator's objection has held up this bill and held up our \neffort to provide a helping hand to these veterans caregivers. I would \nsay to that Senator or any Senator, if you object to it, vote against \nit. If you want to offer an amendment, offer an amendment. But for the \nthousands of people who give this care, who sacrifice so much each day \nfor these veterans who gave our country so much, we owe them a vote. I \nhope this week, even this short week before Veterans Day, we can move \nthis bill for veterans caregivers across America, to give them a \nhelping hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11262-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11262-S11264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING COACH DAN CALLAHAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nperson in Illinois. His name is Dan Callahan. He is the head baseball \ncoach at Southern Illinois University. I have known\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\nDan since he was 3 years old. He is being honored by the Missouri \nValley Conference, receiving their ``Most Courageous'' award.\n  As Southern Illinois' baseball coach for the last 16 years, Callahan \nhas led his team to more than 414 victories, making him the second \nwinning-est coach in the school's history. Clearly, Coach Callahan has \nthe talent to help his players perfect their skills as batters, \npitchers and fielders.\n  But he has also coached them on some of life's harder lessons, \nshowing them what it means to live a life of persistence and \ncommitment.\n  You see, 3 years ago Coach Callahan was diagnosed with a form of \nmelanoma, a cancer he is still battling today. After receiving his \ndiagnosis, Callahan silently endured the rigors of his treatment while \ncontinuing to coach his team. He didn't miss a single game that season.\n  When the next season rolled around, Callahan was still battling his \nillness. This time he faced more intense treatment, including a surgery \nthat would take away part of his lower jaw.\n  It was only then that he went public with his illness and continued \nto coach as much as his treatment would allow.\n  While the surgery damaged Callahan's depth perception and hearing, \nhe's still leading his baseball team today. He may not be able to \ndemonstrate a fastball with the same intensity that he once had, but he \nhas certainly shown his players how to face adversity and not give an \ninch.\n  Last year, cancer or no cancer, Dan Callahan pushed through to record \nhis 400th win at SIU and 550th victory as a NCAA Division I head coach.\n  This year Coach Callahan will receive the Missouri Valley \nConference's Most Courageous Award, an award that honors those that \nhave demonstrated unusual courage in the face of personal illness, \nadversity or tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Coach Callahan on this award and wish \nhim continued success in his recovery as well as another winning \nseason. I salute his wife Stacy, his wonderful daughters Alexa and \nCarly, Dan's mom and dad, Gene and Anne Callahan, and the whole family \nwho is joining him in this battle.\n\n  Now--as a man used to say in Chicago in his radio show--for the rest \nof the story. One of the reasons Dan Callahan is alive today is because \nhe has extraordinarily good medical care and health insurance. Because \nof that care, his oncologist recommended a special drug, a biologic \ndrug. It is called Avastin. Avastin is a drug that is used to treat \nvarious forms of cancer but it has not been specifically tested for the \ntreatment of cancer that Dan Callahan has. They tried it and it worked. \nIt stopped the spread of the cancer.\n  Dan, of course, was heartened and relieved, a young man with a young \nfamily. Having gone through chemotherapy and radiation, having faced \nsurgery where his jaw was removed, having faced the disability and the \ndiscomfort, they found a drug. That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that his insurance company, WellPoint, announced they \nwould no longer pay for this drug. They decided it was an experimental \ndrug and even though Dan Callahan's oncologist wrote to the company and \nsaid: It works, I can show that it works, it stopped the spread of the \ncancer, they said, no, we won't cover it. The drug costs $13,000 a \nmonth. I need not tell you that a coach at a university in southern \nIllinois doesn't make the kind of money that he can afford to pay for \nthis drug. So his family and friends rallied and raised enough money, \nthrough their own savings and borrowing, to pay for two more \nadministrations of the drug. Washington University in St. Louis decided \nthey would make him part of a trial on this drug as well and added \nanother couple treatments with this expensive drug. But December will \nbe the last time Dan Callahan will be able to receive this drug because \nWellPoint, his health insurance company, has said that is the end, no \nmore.\n  You might wonder how WellPoint is doing as a company. They are doing \nvery well. When it comes right down to it, it is one of the most \nprofitable health insurance companies in America. It has the largest \nmembership of any company in the United States. Its enrollment has \nfallen off a little bit but it didn't stop WellPoint from posting $730 \nmillion in profits for the last 3 months.\n  Despite their profitability and their strength in the stock market \nand the increase in the share value, they have decided they will no \nlonger cover the use of this drug for Dan Callahan.\n  If this is a story that sounds as if it involves something far away, \nnot a part of our lives, stop and think twice. Each of us is one \ndiagnosis or one illness away from what Dan Callahan is facing today in \nhis battle with WellPoint. If these companies can turn us down for \nlifesaving drugs and treatments at these critical moments, then we are \nentirely at their mercy. If you cannot shop for another health \ninsurance company because you have a history of cancer or preexisting \nillness, you are stuck. You are at the mercy of them.\n  Is that as good as it gets in America? This still is the only \nindustrialized country in the world where a person can literally die \nfor lack of health insurance. That is what we face in this debate about \nhealth care reform. There are lots of opinions. I salute the House for \npassing the measure, sending it over here. We will hear those opinions \nexpressed in the Senate in the weeks and months to come. As I consider \nthis bill and what it means, I will be thinking about my friend, the \ncoach at Southern Illinois University. I watched him start off as a \nlittle kid playing baseball and he turned out to be a terrific coach \nand, more than that, a terrific person. He is well deserving of his \n``Most Courageous'' award.\n  The question now is will the Senate summon the courage to change this \nsystem and bring fairness to the system for the millions of Americans \nacross this country who run the very risk of this very same challenge.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which was published yesterday relating \nto Dan Callahan's case.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From stltoday.com, Nov. 6, 2009]\n\n     Costly New Drugs: A Crisis for One Family, a Quandry for U.S.\n\n                         (By: Editorial Board)\n\n       It began with a little black spot on Dan Callahan's lower \n     lip. He didn't think it was anything to worry about. His \n     doctor thought it was cancer. The doctor was right. It was \n     neurotropic melanoma, a very rare--and very serious--type of \n     skin cancer. Even after the little black spot was \n     successfully removed six years ago, the cancer remained. And \n     grew.\n       Last October, doctors at Barnes-Jewish Hospital began \n     chemotherapy. They used a three-drug cocktail that includes \n     Avastin, one of a new generation of anti-cancer drugs. It \n     works by blocking the formation of new blood vessels that \n     feed and nourish tumors. Until just a few years ago, that \n     kind of treatment was the stuff of science fiction.\n       For patients battling advanced cancer like Mr. Callahan, \n     Avastin represents something as important as food or water: \n     It is time in a vial.\n       This is what it cost: $13,686 per treatment. Mr. Callahan \n     has received six so far. Total price: $82,116. What's it \n     worth? That's a much more difficult question.\n       About 10 miles up Illinois Route 13 east of Carbondale, \n     Ill.--just above Crab Orchard Lake--lies a little town called \n     Carterville. Mr. Callahan lives there with his wife, Stacy, \n     and two daughters. Alexa, 18, is a student at the University \n     of Illinois. Carly, 13, is in eighth grade.\n       You can buy a three-bedroom house in Carterville for about \n     what Mr. Callahan's six infusions of Avastin cost. For about \n     $100,000--the price of a year's treatment--you can get a \n     classic bungalow with a screened-in front porch, a long, \n     shaded driveway and a two-bedroom cottage out back.\n       The Callahans both have good jobs and health insurance. \n     Stacy works for a credit union. Dan is the head baseball \n     coach at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.\n       Their insurance paid for minor surgery to remove the little \n     black spot from Mr. Callahan's lip. It paid for more \n     extensive surgery in April, when doctors removed the right \n     side of his jaw trying to stop the cancer's spread.\n       And it paid for yet another operation in September, when \n     infection forced doctors to remove the prosthetic device they \n     had implanted to replace his missing jaw.\n       But Mr. Callahan's insurance won't pay for Avastin.\n       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin in \n     2004 to treat advanced colon cancer. Since then, it has been \n     cleared for breast and lung cancers. Doctors are free to \n     prescribe it for other forms of cancer. It is being tried on \n     30 other cancers, including melanoma, but those uses \n     technically are experimental.\n       Because many experimental treatments don't pan out, \n     insurance companies in Illinois and most other states do not \n     have to\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\n     cover them. The major health care bills pending in Congress \n     would not change that. For the first time, they allow generic \n     versions of so-called biologic drugs like Avastin. But only \n     after 12 years on the market, twice as long as other drugs.\n       For thousands of Americans, including the Callahans, that \n     means many newer cancer drugs are out of reach. ``When they \n     told me the insurance wouldn't cover it, I said we'll just \n     pay for it ourselves,'' Mrs. Callahan recalled last week. \n     ``Then they told me how much it cost.''\n       The Callahans scraped together about $27,000 from friends \n     and family members--enough to cover the cost of two \n     treatments. They got a grant from Washington University to \n     pay for four more. They are appealing the insurance company \n     denial, so far without success. The grant expires at the end \n     of December. After that? Mrs. Callahan paused. ``We don't \n     know what we'll do.''\n       Despite the high prices and higher hopes, Avastin has been \n     shown to extend cancer patients' lives by only a few months. \n     Many patients and oncologists say it improves quality of life \n     and shrinks tumors--or at least prevents them from growing. \n     Mr. Callahan's doctor said it has slowed the progression of \n     his tumor. That is no small achievement for patients with \n     advanced cancer. But stopping the progression of cancer is \n     not the same as curing it. A study published in January \n     followed 53 melanoma patients who received Avastin. After 18 \n     months, 13 were alive.\n       The company that makes Avastin, Genentech, spent about \n     $2.25 billion to develop it. It spends another $1 billion a \n     year testing it on new cancers. Avastin has been a \n     blockbuster success. It had $2.7 billion in sales in the \n     United States last year and more than $3.5 billion worldwide.\n       Genentech says Avastin's price reflects its value. Another \n     cancer drug, Erbitus, costs even more, and it hasn't been \n     shown to extend life at all. In March, Swiss pharmaceutical \n     giant Roche agreed to buy Genentech for $46.8 billion. \n     Avastin is a big reason the company was sold for so much \n     money.\n       Not everyone agrees that Avastin is worth the price. \n     Experts in Britain recommended against covering it. A drug \n     that costs as much as a house and extends life for just a few \n     months isn't worth the money, they said.\n       Some people go to pieces when they find out they've got \n     cancer. Mr. Callahan went to work.\n       He has coached the Salukis for 14 years. ``I try to carry \n     on like I'm going to be here next week and next month,'' he \n     said. ``I think about coaching in 2010, about going to my \n     daughters' college graduations and their weddings.''\n       His 2009 team finished with 24 wins and 28 losses. Coach \n     Callahan was too sick to travel to away games. But he was in \n     the dugout each time the Salukis took the field in \n     Carbondale.\n       From the beginning, the Callahans have made it a point not \n     to ask doctors about his prognosis. ``We don't want to know \n     it, and we don't want our kids to know it,'' Mrs. Callahan \n     said. ``We just wanted to live our lives as normally as \n     possible, with no time line.''\n       Coach Callahan thinks it is inherently unfair that patients \n     can be denied treatment simply because of a drug's high \n     price. It's like giving one team an extra at-bat.\n       But the game is not over. Even with two outs in the ninth \n     inning, even with two strikes against you, there's hope. And \n     a question: Who sets the price of victory?\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about health care \nand the debate that is heading our way, especially now following the \naction of the House this last weekend. We all read the articles, we \nhear the debate, we hear the talk about trying to find a compromise \nwhen it comes to the government-run health insurance program. Some \noppose it with passion. Some say they will not support reform without \nit. There is a whole variety of opinions.\n  One idea that seems to be picking up steam in this effort to find a \ncompromise is the idea of a trigger, whatever that means. Proponents \ncall it a safeguard. They say it will trip only if insurance premiums \ngo up.\n  Here is the problem with that. Inherent in the underlying legislation \nis the sure-fire trip that could set off the trigger. You see, we \nalready know that current proposals in this health care reform \ninitiative itself will cause premiums to rise. The government mandates \nand taxes and all of the other things that are going to be burdened \nupon health insurance policies are going to cause the premiums to rise. \nWe are saddling policies with huge new fees and taxes and mandates.\n  The Finance bill piles $67 billion in new fees on the very policies \nthat the vast majority of Americans have. Can anyone claim with a \nstraight face that premiums will not go up under these circumstances, \ncaused by governmental action? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice--if you have any wonder about this--confirms it. Its analysis of \nthe Finance Committee bill says the fees imposed would, and I am \nquoting from the CBO, ``be passed on to purchasers and would ultimately \nraise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.''\n  This idea of a trigger that trips only if premiums rise is an \nillusory safeguard. It is because the trigger is rigged to shoot.\n  Further evidence is the fact that the trigger fires if health \ninsurance is deemed, and again I am quoting, ``unaffordable.'' Guess \nwho gets to decide that. The government will decide that. It will \ndecide what affordability is. So bureaucrats pull the trigger by simply \nlabeling premiums ``unaffordable'' after all of these fees and higher \ntaxes on these policies kick in. This illusory safeguard is meant to \nappease those of us concerned about making Washington the great czar of \nhealth care, but it doesn't work.\n  I believe the American people see through this. I urge those who \nsupport a trigger to be straightforward about what their stance is. If \nthey are for government-run health insurance, say let's go there.\n  Incidentally, I will passionately debate that position. I don't \nbelieve it is in the best interests of our Nation, but I will not \ncriticize them for holding that opinion. After all, that is what the \nSenate floor is for, to debate opinions. On the other hand, I take \nissue with disguising a government takeover of health insurance and \ncalling it a trigger. I take issue with laying additional taxes on \nhealth insurance policies and then calling a press conference to \ncomplain that premiums went up. The implication that the trigger will \nnever fire, quite honestly, gets to be folly.\n  I gave a speech a week or so ago on the floor and I talked about the \nopt-in and the opt-out. There is no real option if States will have to \nface the unfunded mandate's tax and fees. I pointed that out in that \nspeech. The only thing States can opt out of, or choose not to opt in \nto, I believe, when we see the actual language, will be the benefits. \nAll of the other burdens will fall upon the taxpayers of that State. It \nis an illusory option. It is a false promise, just like the trigger.\n  Just like the trigger. Some suggest the trigger is just like the \ntrigger in the part D, the Medicare prescription drug benefit. I have \nheard that argument too. But, boy, is there a world of difference \nbetween what happened there and what is being proposed here.\n  You see, Part D was designed to ensure competition in an entirely new \nmarketplace. It was measurable. It was not discretionary. It asked this \nquestion: Would private insurance companies enter into this \nmarketplace? Well, they did. The trigger being discussed now is very \ndifferent. It is set up to shoot. It is based upon the word \n``affordability,'' and the government holds the power of deciding that \nissue. Then the government holds the power to tax policies, and, of \ncourse, as the CBO pointed out, that is going to translate into higher \npremiums.\n  You see, what I see happening here is that the government is setting \nitself up to be both the pitcher and the umpire--the pitcher, who \nthrows the ball, and the umpire, who gets to call the strike. I do not \nthink the game is working fairly.\n  The goal of a trigger is to ensure competition. So let's drop the \nillusions, and let's enable real competition. Let's allow insurance \ncompanies to compete across State lines. The so-called trigger is just \ncamouflaging the true intent: to establish a government-run system.\n  I can't help but wonder, is the intention to confuse opt-in, opt-out, \ntriggers, co-ops, exchanges? But it all boils down to the same thing: \nyou are going to end up with a government-run health insurance industry \nand a government-run health care system. Whether it is opt-in, opt out, \ntrigger, co-ops, it really is no real option. There is no free \nmarketplace. Instead, it is government making your health care \ndecisions, forcing you, dictating to you not only to carry insurance \nbut dictating the kind of policy you will have and requiring that your \nplan be approved in Washington, causing many to be displaced from their \nprivate insurance.\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\n  Now is not the time to raise taxes, add mandates, and put jobs in \njeopardy. This massive, all-at-once approach is a very risky experiment \nwith 16 percent of our economy. It is a huge gamble. It is a dangerous \nrisk being taken with our health care.\n  Common sense tells us that change is needed in this arena, but how \nabout a step at a time to see if that change works, and then we can \nmove forward to the next step. We can take positive steps. But opt-\nouts, out-ins, co-ops, exchanges, triggers--they are illusions and not \nsolutions.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining \nin morning business.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask the Presiding Officer to inform me when I have \n30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives passed, by just five \nvotes, a health care reform bill over the weekend. Some said it was \nhistoric. It is, indeed, historic. It is a combination of higher \npremiums, higher taxes, Medicare cuts, and more Federal Government \ndebt.\n  Millions of Americans, if it were to pass, will be forced into \ngovernment plans when their employers stop offering health care \ninsurance.\n  As a former Governor of Tennessee, I simply do not see how Tennessee \ncan pay for its part of the Medicaid expansion without imposing a new \nState income tax and damaging higher education or both.\n  Health care reform is supposed to be about reducing costs, not \nincreasing costs. Instead of raising taxes, raising premiums, Medicare \ncuts, more debt, and transferring new costs to States, we should be \ntaking steps toward reducing health care costs.\n  On the Republican side, we proposed a number of those, starting with \nsmall business health plans which would allow small businesses to pool \ntogether their resources and offer insurance to their employees. That \nwould be a good place to start. The Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid that the small business health care plan which Senator Enzi has \nproposed and is waiting for us to pass would reduce the cost of \nMedicaid, would increase the number of insured by 750,000 at least, and \nwould lower the cost of insurance for 3 out of 4 small business \nemployees.\n  So instead of this 2,000-page bill that raises premiums, raises \ncosts, cuts Medicare, and increases the debt, why don't we start step \nby step to reduce costs?\n  I was privileged to attend the White House fiscal responsibility \nsummit in February. The President invited me, and I was glad to go. He \ntalked then about what is obvious about our country's fiscal situation \nand said that putting America on a sustainable fiscal course ``will \nrequire addressing health care.''\n  Then, at the President's White House health reform summit in March, \nthe President himself introduced the ``b'' word, the ``bankruptcy'' \nword, which I am beginning to hear more and more about as these bills \ncome toward us. The President said:\n\n       If we don't address costs, I don't care how heartfelt our \n     efforts are, we will not get this done. If people think we \n     can simply take everybody who is not insured and load them up \n     in a system where costs are out of control, it's not going to \n     happen.\n\n  This is President Obama talking in March:\n\n       We will run out of money. The Federal Government will be \n     bankrupt; state governments will be bankrupt.\n\n  Well, that is the ``b'' word. That is our President talking. I think \nwe should listen to those words and the repeated warnings from careful \nadvisers that the cost of these health care proposals is going to get \nus in a state of fiscal ruin.\n  Here in Washington, we hear more about the Federal deficit, not so \nmuch about the condition of our States. At one time, maybe half the \nSenators were former Governors, as the Presiding Officer is and I was. \nToday, I think it is 12. But those of us who can remember those days \nremember what it was like trying to control Medicaid costs.\n  Governor Bredesen, a Democrat of Tennessee, told us over the weekend, \nour State--he told all of us that the House-passed bill will add $1.4 \nbillion to the State budget over 5 years. If that is the case--and I \nknow it is hard to put billions, trillions, jillions together up here \nand make them make sense, but let me try to make sense of what that \ncould mean for our State, which is a conservative, well-run State. I \ndon't see how the State of Tennessee could pay for its State share of \nthe expanded Medicaid Program without instituting a new income tax or \nwithout seriously damaging higher education or both. And that is just \none part of the new cost.\n  So what we are saying to the American people is, let's read this \nbill, let's know what it costs, and let's see how it affects you.\n  We will be seeing a Senate bill coming out from behind the closed \ndoors of the majority leader within a few days. We look forward to \ndebating it. We look forward to moving ahead with health care reform. \nBut to us, raising premiums, costs, and taxes and cutting Medicare is \nnot health care reform. Reducing costs with small business health \nplans, competition across State lines, reducing junk lawsuits against \ndoctors--that is the direction we ought to go if we want to avoid \nseeing that ``b'' word show up on the front pages of our newspapers \nmore and more.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11265-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here to discuss a very important \nmatter that I had intended to bring up in the Judiciary Committee last \nweek but the agenda did not allow it. It is about the oversight of the \nDepartment of Justice and the responses provided by Attorney General \nHolder to questions from the Judiciary Committee. Two weeks ago, \nChairman Leahy--and I thank him for participating--and I sent a letter \nto the Attorney General asking him to stand by his statements made \nduring his confirmation and answer a number of outstanding requests for \ninformation. That list includes questions submitted by members of the \nJudiciary Committee to an FBI oversight hearing over 1\\1/2\\ years ago. \nWe all agreed no committee should have to wait that long to get answers \nto oversight questions.\n  Last Friday, the Judiciary Committee received answers from the \nAttorney General following his June 17,\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\n2009, testimony. I hoped he would uphold his commitment he made during \nhis confirmation hearing to ``fully and in a timely fashion'' answer \nJudiciary Committee inquiries.\n  The questions I submitted to Attorney General Holder addressed a \nnumber of important issues, including a series of 24 questions related \nto the Department's involvement with the termination of Inspector \nGeneral Walpin at the Corporation for National and Community Service. \nThe answers I received were totally inadequate. Instead of answering \nthe 24 questions, the Department responded with a five-paragraph \nrecitation of publicly available facts and information. The Department \nalso said it would respond under separate cover to the document \nrequests. I appreciate the Department's comments that it intends to \nrespond to my requests, but I am very concerned this is more of the \nsame problem Chairman Leahy and I were trying to get at with our letter \n2 weeks ago.\n  My questions were more than just requests for documents and asking \nfor a recitation of public facts. They were serious inquiries about the \nrole the acting U.S. attorney played in the termination of that \ninspector general. I requested specific answers to questions that have \narisen in my investigation. For example, I asked about communications \nbetween the U.S. attorney and the Office of Professional Responsibility \nand whether the referral by the U.S. attorney complied with the ethical \nrequirements outlined in the U.S. Attorneys' manual for misconduct by \nnon-Department of Justice attorneys and judges. While this is only one \nexample of the questions I asked, none of the questions were \nspecifically answered.\n  While the Department did say it was going to provide the documents I \nrequested under separate cover, the response seems to indicate that all \nmy questions were answered. They were not answered. I intend to get \nthese answers.\n  This is a prime example of what is wrong with the inadequate \nresponses to all our questions. They avoid the question and filibuster \nwith public facts.\n  I have previously stated that unless the Department of Justice starts \nanswering our questions completely and in a timely manner, I will start \nholding up nominees. I have done nothing but patiently work in good \nfaith with the chairman and the Department to get answers. Yet despite \nthese threats, it is business as usual.\n  This culture of not answering questions timely, in an evasive manner, \nand punting document requests to future separate cover letters is \nunacceptable. We have a constitutional duty to oversee the bureaucracy, \nand the executive branch is thumbing its nose at the Congress. I know \nChairman Leahy agrees oversight is an important part of what the \nJudiciary Committee does. I hope he will continue to work with all \nmembers to get answers from the Attorney General. He has surely helped \nme.\n  I am tired of wasting time having to raise these concerns publicly, \nbut shaming the Department seems to be the only way they will respond, \nand even that doesn't work all the time. This administration rode into \ntown on a campaign of accountability and transparency. Attorney General \nHolder told all of us he respected congressional oversight. Yet in his \nfirst set of oversight questions submitted by the committee, he gave us \nthe same nonresponse we have seen from the Department. That is not the \naccountability or transparency the American taxpayers deserve.\n  This is yet another public warning to the Department. It is time to \nstart responding fully to our requests in a timely manner or face the \nconsequences. I hope the Attorney General and his staff will hear this \nand provide complete answers to our questions prior to his scheduled \nappearance in the Judiciary Committee later this month.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Kyl. I think he has interest in this \noversight matter as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 \nminutes to continue the discussion Senator Grassley has commenced.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to join in the comments Senator \nGrassley has offered. I voted for Attorney General Holder, and we had \nseveral conversations about being forthcoming in responding to our \nrequests for information. I thought at the time he would be able to \nwork with us and provide those kinds of answers and support. I have \nbeen disappointed, as has Senator Grassley.\n  A couple of examples: June 17, we had a hearing at which Attorney \nGeneral Holder was present. It was an oversight hearing. He was asked a \nnumber of questions. He took many of those questions for the record \nwhich, of course, is perfectly fine. But his answers were not submitted \nto us for another 4\\1/2\\ months. It was October 29 when we received the \nanswers.\n  I wish to cite two examples of questions and answers which \ndemonstrate the unresponsiveness of the Attorney General.\n  I asked him to identify the legal basis the Department of Justice \ncould invoke to prevent a Gitmo detainee from being released into the \nUnited States if found not guilty in a Federal court--an important \nquestion because the administration apparently intends to bring Gitmo \ndetainees to the United States for trial. Here is the response:\n\n       Where we have legal detention authority, as the President \n     has stated, we will not release anyone into the United States \n     if doing so would endanger the national security of the \n     American people. There are a number of tools at the \n     government's disposal to ensure that no such detainee is \n     released into the United States, all of which are currently \n     being reviewed by the Special Interagency Task Force on \n     Detention Policy created pursuant to Executive Order 13493.\n\n  I asked the Attorney General to identify the operative legal \nauthority that could be used to detain acquitted detainees. He \nresponded by saying the administration probably would not release \nsomeone ``where we have legal detention authority.'' It is like a cat \nchasing its tail. What is legal authority? That was the question. Do \nyou have legal authority? Releasing a detainee into the United States \nobviously could have grave consequences. I think we deserve more than \njust the Attorney General's vague and rather meaningless reference to \ntools at our disposal.\n  Similarly, I asked the Attorney General to explain whether the crimes \ncommitted by those presently held in U.S. prisons for conviction on \nterrorism charges are comparable to the terrorist acts of high-value \ndetainees at Gitmo. The reason I asked was, they said we have several \nconvicted terrorists in our prisons here in the United States. My \nquestion was, Well, but are those really serious crimes as opposed to \nthe 9/11-related crimes committed by those we are holding at Gitmo?\n\n  His response was:\n\n       A number of individuals with a history of, or nexus to, \n     international or domestic terrorism are currently being held \n     in federal prisons, each of whom was tried and convicted in \n     an Article III court.\n\n  We knew that.\n\n       The Attorney General considers all crimes of terrorism to \n     be serious.\n\n  Well, so do I. I am glad the Attorney General considers all crimes of \nterrorism to be serious. But that does not answer my question: How do \nthese crimes compare to the crimes of those high-value detainees at \nGitmo?\n  So these are examples of the kind of nonresponses we get from the \nAttorney General when we ask questions.\n  Let me close with one final point, and then if Senator Grassley would \nhave anything else to say, I will certainly yield to him.\n  We know for several weeks we have had on the Judiciary Committee \nagenda a bill called the media shield bill. It is a bill that has a lot \nof problems with it. Many members of the past administration had \nwritten in opposition to the bill, pointing out the problem of \nconvicting people who were engaged in espionage or acts of terror \nagainst the United States, in the event this legislation were to be \npassed.\n  So I was curious about this Attorney General's views on that. He \nfinally got us a views letter last week, and he said ``the result of a \nseries of productive and cooperative discussions with the sponsors and \nsupporters of the legislation'' is how they put this latest draft \ntogether. Obviously, absent is any discussion with those of us who have \nexpressed our longstanding concerns.\n  This is one of those matters I had raised with the Attorney General \nat his confirmation hearing, and his reply was:\n\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\n\n       The concerns you raised are legitimate ones.\n\n  So I am glad my concerns were legitimate.\n  He also said at his hearing that he would--I am quoting now--``work \nwith both Republicans and Democrats on this Committee on a federal \nmedia shield law.''\n  Further, during my questioning of Attorney General Holder on the \nmedia shield bill, he again stated his willingness to ``work to address \nthe concerns raised in'' views letters issued in the 110th Congress.\n  In response to my questions, he testified:\n\n       I want to talk to you and to people who worked on this bill \n     and who might have a contrary view of it.\n\n  I never heard from him again. I met with him on May 4 to reaffirm my \nstrong interest in the legislation. I never heard from him after that \nmeeting.\n  This is despite the fact that in response to a question I asked, \nAttorney General Holder testified:\n\n       I want to talk to you and to people who worked on this bill \n     and who might have a contrary view of it. As I said before, I \n     guess in my opening statement, you know, knowledge doesn't \n     reside only in the executive branch. The experience that \n     you've had with this, the obvious knowledge that you have of \n     these issues are the kinds of things that I need to be \n     educated about. It may change my mind, frankly.\n\n  Well, maybe it would have. But by not talking to me, he was able not \nto change his mind.\n  I heard that a new version of the bill had been written, and I \nreviewed it. So, finally, on November 2 I called the Attorney General \nmyself to express my concerns about it. I asked if I could get an \nexplanation of why this version satisfied all of the objections that \nhad been previously raised, and I interpreted his response to be that \nhe would testify before the committee if he were called upon to do so.\n  Well, 2 days later, as I said, this views letter was sent to us. To \nput it charitably, it is extraordinarily light on analysis.\n  I, as I said in the beginning, voted for Attorney General Holder. I \nthought at the time he would keep the commitments he made to us under \noath at his confirmation hearing. He assured us he wanted to work with \nus and he would be forthcoming and cooperative.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for the Attorney General to keep \nthe commitments he made in his confirmation hearing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, two things. I thank the Senator from \nSouth Dakota for giving us this opportunity to make this point. I hope \nthe Attorney General will respond to our questions. We are just doing \nour constitutional job of oversight, checks and balances of our system \nof government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the MILCON-VA appropriations bill is very \nimportant to America's military forces and veterans.\n  On Wednesday, the Nation observes Veterans Day. There is no reason \nthis bill should not be completed before Veterans Day. But if we are to \nachieve that goal, we cannot wait until Tuesday to start the debate and \namendment process.\n  We have a choice. We can go home for Veterans Day with a speech in \nour pockets or we can go home for Veterans Day with a solid \naccomplishment for our veterans: passage of the fiscal year 2010 \nMILCON-VA appropriations bill, to our credit. I vote for the latter, \nand I urge my colleagues to join with me in working to make progress on \nthis bill today so we will be able to move to final passage tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2733 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase by $50,000,000 the amount available for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for minor construction projects for the \npurpose of converting unused Department of Veterans Affairs structures \n  into housing with supportive services for homeless veterans, and to \n                           provide an offset)\n\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229. (a)(1) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``construction, \n     minor projects'' is hereby increased by $50,000,000.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title under the heading ``construction, minor \n     projects'', as increased by paragraph (1), $50,000,000 shall \n     be available for renovation of Department of Veterans Affairs \n     buildings for the purpose of converting unused structures \n     into housing with supportive services for homeless veterans.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title I under the heading ``Homeowners Assistance Fund'' is \n     hereby reduced by $50,000,000.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this August I had the opportunity to \naccompany Secretary Shinseki in South Dakota to meet with the many \nSouth Dakotans who have served our Nation. During this trip, the \nSecretary outlined for me his ambitious plan to end homelessness among \nveterans and impressed upon me how this is one of his top priorities \nfor the VA.\n  The fiscal year 2010 MILCON-VA bill before us provides a significant \namount of resources to help him accomplish that goal, including over \n$500 million for direct homeless programs. However, after returning \nfrom the August recess, I began to look into other efforts the VA could \nundertake to further address this issue. As many of you know, the VA \nhas 153 hospitals, many on expansive campuses which include numerous \nbuildings, some used and others sitting empty.\n  The amendment I have just offered would add $50 million to the VA's \nminor construction account specifically for the VA to renovate unused, \nempty buildings sitting on VA campuses for the purpose of providing \nhousing with supportive services for homeless veterans. In today's \neconomic climate, many of the community organizations and nonprofits \nthat run homeless shelters for vets cannot come up with the capital \nneeded to renovate unused VA buildings. This amendment would allow the \nVA to make those renovations and then pursue public-private ventures \nthat address the problem of homelessness among vets.\n  The amendment is fully offset and does not exceed the subcommittee's \nallocation for budget authority or outlays. I would urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Byrd and \nFeinstein be added as cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up my amendment No. 2745.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, $5,000,000 shall be available for the study required \n     by section 1077 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2010.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would fund a \nvital new initiative within the Department of Veteran Affairs that was \nauthorized by the recent National Defense Authorization Act. This \ninitiative is a VA program and study for the provision of service dogs \nto disabled veterans, which began as an amendment I offered to the \nDefense authorization bill and is now a provision in the enacted law.\n  This 3-year program will study the benefit of using service dogs to \nhelp treat veterans with physical and mental injuries and disabilities. \nIt is meant to provide the VA with one more tool to raise the quality \nof life for those who have given so much to our Nation.\n  Under this program, the VA will partner with nonprofit organizations \nthat provide service dogs free of charge to veterans. The government \nwill offset some of the costs of providing the dogs, which are \ncurrently funded largely through private donations. This will allow \nroughly 200 veterans to be paired with dogs and to participate in the \nstudy. In this way, the program will amount to a public-private \npartnership where donors to those nonprofits will know their money will \ngo further, thanks to public matching funds.\n  The veterans who participate in the study will be veterans with \nphysical disabilities and with mental disabilities such as PTSD. It was \none such veteran, CPT Luis Montalvan, who initially sparked my interest \nin this effort. I met Luis, who had been injured while serving in Anbar \nin Iraq, along with his service dog Tuesday, at an inaugural event. \nLuis explained to me that he could not have been there if it weren't \nfor Tuesday who eases his PTSD in numerous and very impressive ways.\n  After meeting Luis, I undertook research and learned about all of the \nbenefits that service dogs can provide individuals with disabilities. I \nsaw the wonderful work of the nonprofits which give their time and the \ndonors who give their money to undertake the intensive training and the \nprovision of these dogs. I learned there were more veterans out there \nwho feel they could benefit from such a service dog if they had access \nto one.\n  I introduced my legislation shortly after coming to office. The VA \nprogram it establishes will study--scientifically--the benefits to \nveterans of the service dogs, so we are proceeding based on evidence. \nThe VA will also provide funds to veterans who participate in the study \nto cover some of the costs of maintaining their service dogs.\n  Today I am offering this amendment to the Military Construction and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs appropriations legislation so the fully \nauthorized VA initiative may now be fully funded. The amendment is \nstraightforward and reasonable. My amendment today would simply make $5 \nmillion available for this study that passed by unanimous consent. In \nthis way, we can both provide more service dogs to the veterans who \nwant them, and we can study the benefits they can provide to those \nveterans and the most effective ways to provide those benefits.\n  Our Nation owes a profound debt to those who have served in the \nmilitary. For those veterans with disabilities, we need to make sure \nthe VA has as many effective tools for raising their quality of life as \npossible. My amendment would make sure that one of those tools is \nfunded.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set side so I may say a few words.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, let me begin, first, by thanking Chairman \nJohnson and Senator Hutchison for their fine work in preparing this \nmeasure before us. Similar to the other appropriations bills for fiscal \nyear 2010, this bill, which provides the necessary funding for military \nconstruction and veterans programs, was prepared by the subcommittee on \na bipartisan basis.\n  I am very pleased to advise my colleagues in the Senate that the \ncommittee endorsed the bill unanimously and forwarded this matter to \nthe Senate for consideration.\n  As my colleagues are aware, we are already more than 1 month into the \nnew fiscal year, and we simply need to complete our work on this \nmeasure.\n  Moreover, Wednesday is Veterans Day. It would truly send the right \nmessage to our veterans for the Senate to pass this bill before \nNovember 11.\n  Again, I wish to commend the chairman and Senator Hutchison for their \nfine work on this measure and urge its adoption.\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2754\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 2754, which has been \ncosponsored by Senators Johnson and Cochran, to reallocate unobligated \nfiscal year 2009 military construction funding to support President \nObama's new European missile defense plan. The funding was appropriated \nin last year's appropriations bill for the European missile defense \nsites but can no longer be spent.\n  This amendment will enable the Missile Defense Agency to meet the \nPresident's timelines for defending Europe and the United States sooner \nagainst Iranian missiles.\n  I strongly endorse the President's European missile defense plan. \nThis new approach will enhance the protection of our allies in Europe, \nU.S. forces and their families deployed abroad, and the U.S. homeland \nfrom ballistic missile attack sooner than the previous program.\n  It is more robust and responsive to the increasingly pervasive short- \nand medium-range missile threats and is adaptable to longer range \nthreats in the future. The new architecture focuses on using the proven \nstandard missile-3 on Aegis ships and on land, together with additional \nsensor capability to provide more effective protection for ourselves \nand our allies.\n  In order to meet the timelines set out by the President to deploy a \ncapability in Europe in the 2015 timeframe, General O'Reilly, Director \nof the Missile Defense Agency, has requested the Congress to reprogram \n$68.5 million to construct an Aegis ashore test facility at the Pacific \nMissile Range Facility in Hawaii. This amendment responds to that \nrequest.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nGeneral O'Reilly requesting this transfer of funds.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                       Missile Defense Agency,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to request your support for \n     reauthorization and reappropriation of $68.5 million of \n     unobligated FY2009 MILCON funds, previously appropriated for \n     deployment of missile defense capabilities in Europe, to \n     support near-term requirements for the President's new Phased \n     Adaptive Approach for missile defense in Europe.\n       Our top priority is the establishment of an Aegis Ashore \n     test facility which could also provide an operational \n     ballistic missile defense capability when needed. Due to its \n     strategic location and multi-dimensional testing \n     capabilities, the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in \n     Hawaii has been selected as the proposed site for this test \n     facility, and placement of a test launcher at this site could \n     also provide continuous protection for this region. Our goal \n     is to complete this project in time to support the first \n     flight test of the land-based Standard-Missile 3 interceptor \n     in FY2012, which would require construction funding to be \n     available for obligation in FY2010.\n       Your support to make these FY2009 MILCON funds available \n     for the Aegis Ashore test facility is essential if we are to \n     implement the President's new Phased Adaptive Approach in \n     time to counter the growing ballistic missile threat. I am \n     prepared to provide you with any additional information you \n     may require.\n       Thank you for consideration of this request and your \n     steadfast support for the defense of our Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Patrick J. O'Reilly,\n                                 Lieutenant General, USA Director.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in the letter the general says that \nestablishing this test facility is his top priority for the President's \nnew plan for missile defense in Europe. He goes on to state:\n\n       Our goal is to complete this project in time to support the \n     first flight test of the land-based standard-missile 3 \n     interceptor in FY 2012, which would require construction \n     funding to be available for obligation in FY 2010.\n\n  I offer this amendment with some reservation. It is critical to \ngetting missile defense to Europe sooner, but it circumvents the normal \norder of business in the Senate under ordinary circumstances. This \nproject should have been authorized in the fiscal year 2010 National \nDefense Authorization Act and then appropriated in the Military \nConstruction bill. I take that process seriously and wish to explain to \nmy colleagues the special circumstances under which I offer this \namendment.\n  President Obama publicly announced his European missile defense \nstrategy on September 17 of this year. This announcement came well \nafter the House and Senate Armed Services Committees began the \nconference negotiation process.\n  In order to implement the President's new plan, General O'Reilly made \nthe request to Congress for an AEGIS ashore test facility on October 7, \nthe same day that the House and Senate completed the conference \nagreement on the Defense authorization bill. Due to conflicts in \ntiming, the conferees were not able to consider this late request from \nthe administration. Thus, an amendment on the fiscal year 2010 Military \nConstruction appropriations bill is the best path to get the facility \nstarted in order to meet the administration's timelines. If there was a \nbetter way to proceed, I would do so. Unfortunately, these unusual \ncircumstances have put us in this situation.\n  The fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act provided \nflexibility for the Missile Defense Agency to spend over $240 million \nof research and development funding in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to \npurchase equipment associated with the AEGIS ashore test facility and \nbegin the development of the new European ballistic missile defense \narchitecture. The military construction funding is needed at this time \nin conjunction with the research and development funding to begin \nimplementation of the European missile defense plan.\n  Let me also make clear that this amendment is not asking for \nadditional money. This funding is presently available. The Missile \nDefense Agency has over $150 million in fiscal year 2009 unobligated \nfunds that were appropriated for the missile defense sites in the Czech \nRepublic and Poland that are no longer needed. This amendment would use \na portion of those funds to begin construction of the AEGIS ashore test \nfacility in fiscal year 2010.\n  Lastly, let me comment on the site chosen for the AEGIS ashore test \nfacility. According to the Missile Defense Agency, the Pacific Missile \nRange Facility on the island of Kauai has been the center of excellence \nfor AEGIS ballistic missile defense testing for the last 12 years and \nwill continue in that regard for the next decade. Indeed, just 2 weeks \nago, the Pacific Missile Range Facility hosted the successful intercept \ntest of the Japanese AEGIS ballistic missile defense program. To date, \nthe Pacific Missile Range has supported 20 AEGIS tests. In addition, \nPMRF also has a proud track record of testing the Missile Defense \nAgency's Theater High Altitude Area Defense System, with five tests at \nthe range since 2007.\n  The Pacific Missile Range Facility is the world's largest \ninstrumented missile testing and training range. The Department of \nDefense and the Missile Defense Agency, in particular, utilize this \nrange due to its relative isolation and ideal year-round climate and \nencroachment-free environment. Furthermore, it is the only range in the \nworld where submarines, surface ships, aircraft, and space vehicles can \noperate and be tracked simultaneously. For these reasons, the Missile \nDefense Agency believes the Pacific Missile Range Facility is the ideal \nlocation to support AEGIS ashore testing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. If this test facility \ndoes not get started in fiscal year 2010, the Missile Defense Agency \nwill not be able to meet the flight test scheduled to demonstrate AEGIS \nashore capability prior to the administration's proposed 2015 \ndeployment date to Europe. It is a very important amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2754 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 2754 and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself, Mr. \n     Cochran, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 2754 \n     to amendment No. 2730.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\n (Purpose: To permit $68,500,000, as requested by the Missile Defense \nAgency of the Department of Defense, to be used for the construction of \n  a test facility to support the Phased Adaptive Approach for missile \n                   defense in Europe, with an offset)\n\n       On page 27, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 128. (a)(1) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``Military \n     Construction, Defense-Wide'' is hereby increased by \n     $68,500,000, with the amount of such increase to remain \n     available until September 30, 2014.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title under the heading ``Military Construction, \n     Defense-Wide'', as increased by paragraph (1), $68,500,000 \n     shall be available for the construction of an Aegis Ashore \n     Test Facility at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Hawaii. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such funds may be \n     obligated and expended to carry out planning and design and \n     construction not otherwise authorized by law.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by title I of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \n     Appropriations Act, 2009 (division E of Public Law 110-329; \n     122 Stat. 3692) under the heading ``Military Construction, \n     Defense-Wide'' and available for the purpose of European \n     Ballistic Missile Defense program construction, $69,500,000 \n     is hereby rescinded.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I set aside my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to, No. 1, offer \nan amendment, which I will do in 3 or 4 minutes, and then spend 3 or 4 \nminutes on that amendment and then ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes \nto talk on the Executive Calendar as well as speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2757 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside and that amendment No. 2757 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2757 to amendment No. 2730.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To require public disclosure of certain reports)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act and except as provided in subsection (b), any report \n     required to be submitted by a Federal agency or department to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of either the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives in this Act shall be posted on the \n     public website of that agency upon receipt by the committee.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a report if--\n       (1) the public posting of the report compromises national \n     security; or\n       (2) the report contains proprietary information.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a very straightforward \namendment. This is an amendment I have offered on all appropriations \nbills to date. We passed it on Housing and Urban Development-\nTransportation. We passed it on Energy and Water. We passed it on \nInterior. We passed it on the Defense appropriations bill. It is an \namendment that says that the reports that are asked for in this \nappropriations bill, unless there is reason to not yield to the people \nof this country the information contained in that report for either \nnational security or defense purposes, that those studies will be made \navailable to the American citizens and the rest of the Senate.\n  Each appropriations bill, in proper fashion and by a good job by the \nAppropriations Committee, asks for reports and reviews on how the money \nis spent. All this amendment does is require that the reports that are \nrequired to be submitted by a Federal agency in this act be posted on a \npublic Web site of that agency for all Members of Congress and all \nAmericans to see. There is an exception for reports that contain \nclassified or proprietary information.\n  In the House and Senate version of this bill, the following reports \nare--I won't go through all of them--what action DOD and the State \nDepartment have taken to encourage host countries to assume a greater \nshare of the defense burden--that is something that ought to be shared \nwith the American people; an annual report on operation and maintenance \nexpenditures for each individual general or flag officer quarters at \neach of our bases around the country during the prior year; a report of \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs on approved major construction \nprojects for which funds are not obligated within the timeframe \nprovided for in the act--in other words, to know what we are getting \nready to spend, what is obligated; a report detailing the current \nplanned use of property estimated to have greater than $1 million in \nannual rental costs; a detailed report on how the $3 billion that has \nalready been appropriated for information technology projects at the \nVeterans Administration' is spent, including operations and maintenance \ncosts, salaries, and expenses by individual project; and then finally, \na quarterly report on the financial status of the Veterans' \nAdministration, a health status.\n  This is just plain, good, open government. It creates transparency, \nand it allows the American people to hold us to account. By requiring \nthat Federal agencies produce reports funded in this bill and publicize \nthem on a Web site, everybody will have easy access to the reports. \nThat is not the case today in the Senate or in the Congress. Evaluating \nand reading these reports may prompt a congressional hearing, Federal \nlegislation, or even termination of a Federal program or policy.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. It is my hope our colleagues \nwill accept this amendment and it will become part of this \nappropriations bill as well.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Judge Andre Davis\n\n  Madam President, I now wish to spend a few moments talking about \nJudge Andre Davis, who is the nominee for the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I sit on the Judiciary Committee, and I voted against Judge Davis's \nnomination coming out of the Judiciary Committee. I thought the \nAmerican people ought to know why.\n  He is definitely an individual of integrity. He is a very pleasant \nindividual. I enjoyed the banter back and forth during the hearing. But \nas a Federal district judge, Judge Davis has been reversed by the \nFourth Circuit Court numerous times. A lot of judges get reversed, but \nthere is a trend with Judge Davis where we have seen the law \nmisapplied. So I have some real concerns. This is a lifetime \nappointment to this circuit court, No. 1. No. 2, the Supreme Court only \nhears 80 cases a year, so if a case comes to a circuit court, most \noften that is a final determination.\n  Let me spend a little bit of time on characteristics of these \nreversals because they are very concerning to me. He has been reversed \nby the Fourth Circuit Court in six different cases where he was noted \nto suppress evidence. For those of you like me who are not lawyers, let \nme explain what that means.\n  Suppressing evidence in a criminal case most often results in a \ndefendant not being convicted of a crime and a victim and their family \nnot receiving justice. Not only do the victim and victim's family not \nget justice but the government has to spend taxpayer dollars and \nresources to appeal the case to the next level. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  In the case of U.S. v. Kimbrough, Judge Davis suppressed the \nstatement of a defendant who, while in the presence of police, told his \nmother he had a gun in the room. The officer was trying to give him his \nMiranda warnings at the time when the mother asked him if there was \nanything else in the basement, besides the cocaine that was readily \nvisible to her and the officer.\n  In reversing Judge Davis's decision, the Fourth Circuit offered a \nharsh rebuke stating that since the mother ``is a private citizen, her \nspontaneous questioning of [the defendant] alone, independent of the \npolice officers, could never implicate the Fifth Amendment.'' The court \nfurther stated that Judge Davis's conclusion that `` `Miss Kimbrough's \ninvolvement in questioning her son was the equivalent of official \ncustodial interrogation,' . . . is at best incomplete and, taken \nliterally, is simply erroneous.'' The Fourth Circuit said that a \nstatement made in\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\nthese circumstances should ``never'' be suppressed and Judge Davis's \nreasoning was ``simply erroneous.''\n  In U.S. v. Siegel, Judge Davis suppressed evidence of the defendant's \n20-year history of scheming and plotting to take money from previous \nhusbands in a case where the defendant was accused of dating the \nvictim, taking his money, and then killing him. The facts of this case \nare particularly worrisome.\n  The defendant had met the victim and started dating him, eventually \ntaking his money and trying to have him institutionalized. After \nfailing at having him institutionalized, she killed the victim and hid \nhis body. Although the body was found in 1996, it was not identified \nuntil 2003. During that time, the defendant remarried and continued to \ncollect the man's Social Security checks. When the body was identified, \nFederal agents contacted her and she told them the victim was alive and \nhad run off with some other woman. She was arrested and charged with \nmurdering the victim to prevent him from reporting her fraud. When the \nprosecution sought to introduce the defendant's prior bad acts at \ntrial, Judge Davis refused. According to the Fourth Circuit, Judge \nDavis was concerned about the length of the trial. The Fourth Circuit \nreversed, finding that the evidence was admissible and, because the \ngovernment charged the defendant with committing murder to prevent \nbeing reported for fraud, this evidence was an essential element of the \ngovernment's case. As for Judge Davis's concern about a lengthy trial, \nthe Fourth Circuit concluded that was an improper basis for excluding \nwholesale this clearly probative and relevant evidence of other crimes. \nOn remand, the defendant was found guilty.\n\n  In the case of U.S. v. Jamison, Judge Davis suppressed the confession \nof a felon who shot himself, called out to police for help, and then \ngave the confession during the routine police investigation into his \ninjury. He was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. \nThe court of appeals reversed Judge Davis's ruling and said the man's \nconfession was admissible in the case.\n  In U.S. v. Custis, the defendant was prosecuted for several Federal \ndrug and firearm offenses. The evidence used against him included \nweapons and drugs that were seized by the police from his truck and \nresidence. The police search was based on a warrant obtained with \nevidence they compiled from an informant who had given them reliable \ndata on the defendant's drug operation. Judge Davis granted the \ndefendant's suppression motion, finding that the search warrant was \nfaulty. The Fourth Circuit reversed, stating that Judge Davis erred in \ngranting the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, and that if \nJudge Davis had read the supporting affidavit in a ``commonsense, \nrather than hypertechnical manner, as he was required to do,'' he would \nnot have excluded the evidence.\n  There are many other cases where Judge Davis has incorrectly \nsuppressed evidence that I will not go into at this time. There are \nmany other reasons, whether it be violating the sentencing levels \naccording to the Fourth Circuit, an abuse of discretion, remanding for \nresentencing, or being more than a neutral arbiter in terms of plea \narrangements. Here is what the Fourth Circuit said about Judge Davis's \nrole in terms of the plea arrangements:\n\n       We have not found a single case in which the extent of \n     judicial involvement in plea negotiations equaled that in the \n     case at hand. The district court repeatedly appeared to be an \n     advocate for the pleas rather than as a neutral arbiter, and \n     any fair reading of the record reveals the substantial risk \n     of coerced guilty pleas. We can only conclude that the \n     district court's role as advocate for the defendant's guilty \n     pleas affected the fairness, integrity, and public reputation \n     of judicial proceedings.\n\n  I won't go on, but those six cases I outlined are enough for me to \nnot be able to support this judge, who is obviously a very fine \ngentleman and a good man, but who I believe has made some significant \ninexcusable errors on the bench.\n  Finally, I want to spend a moment talking about a bill several of my \ncolleagues have brought up, and it is the veterans caregivers omnibus \nbill. Regardless of what the news reports say, and my colleagues say, I \nam not opposed to us making sure we keep each and every commitment we \nmake to veterans. I think many of the programs that are in this bill \nare ideally suited for the problems our veterans have. What I object to \nis the fact we are going to create $3.7 billion worth of spending--and \nthat is a CBO score, not my score, the $3.7 billion worth of spending--\nover the next 5 years and not make any effort whatsoever to eliminate \nprograms that don't have anywhere near the priority this program does.\n  The other thing I object to is the timing. There is no question we \nneed to do this, especially for our wounded warriors. But we are \nexcluding our Vietnam veterans from having access to this same care, \nand we are excluding the first gulf war veterans from having the same \naccess. They have the same needs. Nobody can deny they don't have some \nof the same needs, but we are excluding them, and from a constitutional \nstandpoint, I am not sure we can ever get to the point where we would \nagree that is fair treatment for our veterans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I wish to finish my statement first. I listened to the \nSenator's statement earlier today on the floor, so let me finish my \nstatement.\n  The other thing that is concerning is we have a bill before us right \nnow--this appropriations bill--that has no money for this in it, one, \nand authorizations aren't required. So $280 billion of the money we \nappropriate every year is not authorized. The fact there is no money in \nthis bill for this program tells me something, that the urgency of \ngetting a press release isn't near the urgency of the needs of our \nveterans. Because if we allow the normal process to happen, it will be \n18 months from now before any money comes forward for this bill.\n  Finally, we have offered up a list of programs we think have much \nlower priority than our veterans' health care, and so I think of my \nbrother, who is a veteran, and I ask myself: What did he serve for? \nWhat did he fight for? Did he fight so we could come back here and \nundermine the future by not making the same tough choices that are \nrequired for every family and, more importantly, not demonstrate the \ncourage in our service that the veterans demonstrate in their service--\nwhich is putting yourself at risk to do what is best for our country? \nThat is what they do, but we ought to be doing the same thing.\n  We ran a very large deficit this last year. Forty-three cents of \nevery dollar we spent this last year was borrowed. None of the people \nin this room will ever pay a penny toward that debt. It will be our \nchildren and grandchildren. And the fact is we will not make the hard \nchoices to pay for this so that tomorrow we can say, we are going to \neliminate these programs so this program can go forward, and we are \ngoing to take the money that is going for these programs so this \nprogram can go forward.\n  What this appropriations bill does, as a matter of fact, is ask for a \nstudy from the Veterans' Administration on the need of this bill. So if \nthis bill is certainly a priority, the funding for it should have been \nin this appropriations bill, and it is not. Nobody can deny it is not. \nSo I come to the question: When will enough be enough? When will we \nstop playing a game on dollars and ultimately make the same hard \nchoices and demonstrate the courage our veterans have demonstrated? I \ncan't think of many veterans who want now what is paid on the backs of \ntheir children or grandchildren. What they want to see us do is the \nhard work, as they do the hard work, to put ourselves at risk by \ntelling some people no so we can tell veterans yes. What we are doing \ntoday is we are going to tell veterans yes but we are going to tell our \nchildren no.\n  I can easily outline for my colleagues $300 billion--that is ``B'' \nfor billion--of waste, fraud, and duplication in the Federal budget. \nThey may disagree with some of that, but there is no question you could \nget a consensus on $3.7 billion of that. On 1 percent of it, you could \nget a consensus. But there is no effort made on this authorization bill \nto create priorities. What we hear all the time is: Well, that is not \nthe way it works up here. Authorization bills are simply that, and it \nhas to go through the appropriations, and you are not spending any \nmoney.\n  Well, if we are not spending any money on this bill, then we are not \nsolving the problems for our veterans.\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\nAnd if we don't have any money for this program in this appropriations \nbill, we are holding out a hollow promise.\n  I ask my colleagues to work with us. Let's offset the price for this, \ndemonstrate the same courage and the same level of commitment. There \nhas been no secret on who has said we should not pass this by unanimous \nconsent, and there has never been a time that we refused to talk to \nanybody about that.\n\n  My hope is the American people are listening. Sure, we do want to do \nthe right things for our veterans, but there has to come a time when we \nare forced to make hard choices, and we are not seeing that. We are not \nseeing that in this bill, and we are not seeing it in the authorization \nfor this veterans and caregivers omnibus bill.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from Illinois, and retain the time \nuntil he has finished asking whatever question he may have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, is the Senator \nsuggesting we should open this up to caregivers for veterans of all \nwars?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Oklahoma join me in that endeavor?\n  Mr. COBURN. If we are going to do this bill, yes, I would.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Oklahoma also agree that this bill \nwas on the calendar long before Veterans Day?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely, but when was the hold? Less than 3 weeks ago. \nIt wasn't brought to the floor before then.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It was brought to the floor on September 25.\n  Mr. COBURN. Okay, 5 weeks. Pardon me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Also, I would ask the Senator if he is suggesting we \nshould have included the appropriations for this bill before we \nauthorized it?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would answer my colleague that we do that 280 billion \ntimes a year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator would endorse that, and wants us to include \nthe appropriations before we set up authorizing language?\n  Mr. COBURN. What I would tell my colleague is you do it routinely on \nthe appropriations bill. So why is this any different?\n  My question to my colleague is: If in fact this is so important to \nget done today, knowing there is no money in this bill for this--my \ncolleague would agree with that, would he not, that there is no money \nin this appropriations bill for this act? Is that a correct statement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. To my knowledge, there is not.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is not. So we are going to say we are going to \nauthorize something in the hopes that we have to do it right now, \nknowing that unless we have an omnibus or a supplemental this won't \nactually happen until we get to this bill again next year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So is the Senator from Oklahoma conceding an authorizing \nbill does not spend money, since the passage of this authorizing bill, \nas you said, would not spend a penny?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, I will not concede that. Because what it does is it \ncauses us--and I enjoy debating my colleague from Illinois. Here is my \npoint on authorization bills. We can authorize and authorize and \nauthorize, and when we do, we are telling veterans they are going to \nget this. That is what we are telling them. We are communicating to \nevery veterans organization and we are telling them we are going to do \nthis. So if we are going to tell them we are going to do it, we ought \nto put in process the way to do it. And if we are saying it has to \nhappen right now, then where is the money? Show me the money to make it \nhappen right now.\n  The fact is--and I will reclaim my time--we play games, and the game \nwe are playing is that we can authorize and send out a press release \nbut then we are not held accountable to do what we have authorized. \nThere are a lot of good key components in this bill. My objection is \ntwofold: One, it discriminates against previous veterans, which I think \nis uncalled for; and two, we don't eliminate any of the waste in terms \nof authorizations so that we more focus the Appropriations Committee.\n  There is no question the Appropriations Committee has the power to \nfund money anywhere they want and they do it whether the bills are \nauthorized or not authorized. I will be glad to give the Senator from \nIllinois a list of the $280 billion we spend every year that is not \nauthorized. It is a spurious argument to state that we should not have \nfiscal accountability when we authorize programs. We should have and we \nought to make the tough choices. The problem is, we do not do any \noversight, to speak of, to cause us to know the programs that are not \nworking that we could eliminate so we will not have duplicate funding \nand so we will not spend it.\n  The question veterans ask me is what is our priority with our money. \nThe first priority has to be defending the country. The second priority \nought to be about taking care of veterans. What we do is we have $300 \nbillion a year in waste, fraud, and duplication on things that do not \ndo either of those and that are extremely wasteful. Nobody with common \nsense would say they ought to continue. Yet we continue down the \nprocess.\n  I have taken more than my time and I know my colleagues are going to \nvote. I would tell my colleague from Illinois we have had this debate a \nlarge number of times. We have a frank disagreement about the fiscal \ndiscipline that should be required of us as Senators. The fact is, we \nare going to authorize a bill and we are not going to make any tough \nchoices about anything else and we are not going to take away any \noptions from the Appropriations Committee when it comes to funding. To \nme, that abrogates our responsibility to be good authorizers. I will \nstand by that conviction as long as I am in the Senate. We had that \ndebate on the bridge to nowhere, which my colleague supported, which \nwas in an authorizing bill--and multiple times.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I am prepared to listen to my \ncolleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know we have a standing order for a \ntrigger to move to the Executive Calendar, but I ask unanimous consent \nfor 5 minutes for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request, a \nshort statement, and then to ask two other amendments which I have \nintroduced to this bill be called and be pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will speak briefly to the Senator from \nOklahoma. This is not my bill. This was a bill introduced by Senator \nHillary Clinton. It has been around for a long time. It is an effort to \nprovide some help to the 6,800 families who have in their homes today a \ndisabled veteran who needs a caregiver, someone who helps that veteran \nchange the dressings on their wounds, provides an IV change if \nnecessary, injections if necessary, move them from bed to chair and \nback again. For many of our veterans, that is their lifeline. It is a \nwife who is giving her life to her husband who has returned injured \nfrom a war. It is a mother, a father, a son, a daughter, a loved one in \nthe family. These people are as much a part of our veterans medical \nsystem as the great people who serve us at the veterans hospitals and \nveterans centers across America.\n  What Senator Clinton wanted to do and what I want to help her do is \nprovide some help for these caregivers. Many of them are giving their \nlives to this veteran. It is not too much to ask that we help them with \na small stipend each month, with training so they know how to do the \nthings that are necessary so they can provide the medical help these \nveterans need, with 2 weeks of respite so they can have a little time \noff by themselves and have someone else, such as a visiting nurse, step \nin for the veteran during that period of time.\n  We reported the bill out of the Veterans' Committee and brought it to \nthe floor. By custom in the Senate, regardless of what you just heard, \nwe first pass a bill authorizing a program and, if it is passed, we \nappropriate money to the program. I am trying to follow that regular \norder.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has objected. He is the only person \nobjecting. Because of his objection 6,800 veterans, those who served \nIraq and Afghanistan,\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\nare unable to get this additional care. I know we cannot give it to \nevery caregiver. I know it will be limited, and we will have to make \nthat decision as part of our deliberation as to what we can do. But to \nsay we should do nothing for these people is to make a mockery of this \nVeterans Day. If we truly care for these veterans, let us care for \nthese families who are giving their lives to help them.\n  I hope the Senator from Oklahoma will lift the hold on this bill, \ngive us a chance to debate it, offer his amendments. That is what we \nare here for. But to merely stand and say: No, stop, I will not allow \nit, I don't think is what the Senate should be about. Let us debate his \npoint of view, my point of view, other points of view, and try to reach \nsome conclusion.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2759 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  I ask that the clerk call up my pending amendment No. 2759.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2759.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To enhance the ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n   to recruit and retain health care administrators and providers in \n                        underserved rural areas)\n\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229. (a)(1)(A) Of the amount made available by this \n     title for the Veterans Health Administration under the \n     heading ``medical services'', $1,500,000 shall be available \n     to allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to offer \n     incentives to qualified health care providers working in \n     underserved rural areas designated by the Veterans Health \n     Administration, in addition to amounts otherwise available \n     for other pay and incentives.\n       (B) Health care providers shall be eligible for incentives \n     pursuant to this paragraph only for the period of time that \n     they serve in designated areas.\n       (2)(A) Of the amount made available by this title for the \n     Veterans Health Administration under the heading ``medical \n     support and compliance'', $1,500,000 shall be available to \n     allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to offer incentives \n     to qualified health care administrators working in \n     underserved rural areas designated by the Veterans Health \n     Administration, in addition to amounts otherwise available \n     for other pay and incentives.\n       (B) Health care administrators shall be eligible for \n     incentives pursuant to this paragraph only for the period of \n     time that they serve in designated areas.\n       (b) Not later than March 31, 2010, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs and Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report detailing the number of new \n     employees receiving incentives under the pilot program \n     established pursuant to this section, describing the \n     potential for retaining those employees, and explaining the \n     structure of the program.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2760 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside and the clerk call up amendment No. 2760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2760 to amendment No. 2730.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To designate the North Chicago Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter, Illinois, as the ``Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care \n                               Center'')\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. 229. (a) Naming of Health Care Center.--Effective \n     October 1, 2010, the North Chicago Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center located in Lake County, Illinois, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health \n     Care Center''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference to the medical center \n     referred to in subsection (a) in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, record, or other paper of the United States shall \n     be considered to be a reference to the Captain James A. \n     Lovell Federal Health Care Center.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam Presiding, during today's conversation, the Senator \nfrom Illinois stated that S. 1963 had been on the Senate calendar since \nSeptember 25, 2009. In fact, S. 1963 was read the second time and \nplaced on the calendar on October 29, 2009. A request was not made for \nunanimous consent to pass the bill on the minority side until Friday, \nNovember 6, 2009.\n  There are currently 35,000 veterans receiving aid and attendance \nbenefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides \nfunding for veterans who need extra help at home but do not need \ninstitutional care. The aid and attendance program assists all disabled \nveterans of all wars. Out of this population, around 2,000 veterans \nreceived their injuries after September 11 and would qualify for extra \ncaregiver assistance in this bill. However, caregivers for tens of \nthousands of veterans of prior wars would not. Of course, that assumes \nthat the House passes the Caregiver Assistance Act in its Chamber and \nthe President signs it into law. Then it assumes that next year, in the \ndiscussion on the fiscal year 2011 budget, the President requests \nfunding for caregiver assistance, or that both appropriations \ncommittees include funding, and that the President signs this into law. \nThe absolute earliest that a caregiver would receive assistance is \nOctober 1, 2010. However, that date is not likely given the performance \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs. Right now, the average \nprocessing of a disability claim is 162 days at the Department. Given \nthat the Department will have to make rules on this new benefit, it \nwill be well into 2011 before any caregiver benefits from this program. \nHowever, passing this bill before Veterans Day will give benefits to \npoliticians, who will have made an empty promise in 2009 that might not \nbe realized until 2011, and even then, would be paid for by our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11273-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11273-S11282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ANDRE M. DAVIS TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                             FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Andre M. Davis, of \nMaryland, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate, equally divided and controlled between the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am a little confused about the \norder. Parliamentary inquiry of the pending business: Are we now \nconsidering the nomination of Andre Davis?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as the senior Senator from Maryland, I \nhave been designated as the Democratic representative. Of course, I \nnote on the floor the distinguished ranking member, Senator Sessions. I \nwas going to lead off, if that does meet with the Senator's approval.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I say to the Senator from Maryland, I think that \nwould be quite appropriate and fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, this is an exciting day for me. It is \nan exciting day because I am here to present a distinguished jurist \nfrom Maryland to be nominated to sit on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Judge Davis is from my hometown of Baltimore. He has been nominated \nto sit on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. He comes before the \nSenate for a vote on his confirmation. His nomination has been approved \nby the Judiciary Committee, and I thank both the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator \nSessions, for moving this nomination through the committee process and \nthe majority and minority leaders for bringing this nomination to the \nfloor.\n  For 8 years as the Senator from Maryland, I have pressed for a \nqualified Marylander to fill the Maryland vacancy on the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I have worked with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, \nand now Senator Cardin. This seat was once held by the late Judge \nFrancis Murnaghan, a true legal giant, with deep roots of civic \nengagement as well as a record of extraordinary judicial competence. \nToday, we are presenting a nominee who is worthy to fill this seat.\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\n  I am honored to introduce Andre Davis to serve on the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He is a man of the highest caliber, one of judicial \nexperience, one of great integrity and also outstanding intellect. He \nhas received the American Bar Association's highest ratings.\n  When I consider a judicial nominee, and particularly one for the \ncircuit court of appeals, I have four criteria. No. 1, that person must \nbe someone of absolute personal integrity. They are, after all, a \njudge. They must bring judicial competence and a record demonstrating \njudicial competence and also a record showing judicial temperament. My \nthird criterion is they must have a commitment to core constitutional \nprinciples and also a history of civic engagement in Maryland. In other \nwords, they must be a real Marylander, not just a ``ZIP Code'' \nMarylander, meaning living in Maryland as a matter of convenience.\n  Judge Andre Davis passes all these tests with flying colors. When I \nintroduced Judge Davis at the Judiciary Committee hearing, I wished to \npresent to my colleagues then, as I do now, that he has a compelling \npersonal narrative. He comes from roots of very modest means. His \nfather was a teacher, his stepfather was a steel worker, he grew up in \nthe gritty neighborhood of east Baltimore in a family who valued hard \nwork and also community service.\n  He earned a scholarship to attend Phillips Academy, Andover, no small \nfeat for an African American. He was 1 of 4 African Americans in a \nschool of over 800 students, and even then, as a young man, he knew \nthat with opportunity came responsibility to help others who were not \nso fortunate.\n  He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Pennsylvania and \nthen graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at \nthe Maryland School of Law, he won the Myerowitz Moot Court \nCompetition. He chaired the Honor Board and the law faculty awarded him \nthe prestigious Roger Howell Award at graduation. He had a \ndistinguished career as an undergraduate and graduate.\n  He comes before us for this vote as someone who has judicial \ncompetence. He was originally nominated by President Clinton in the \nyear 2000 for the Fourth Circuit. At that time, the ABA unanimously \ngave Judge Davis its highest rating of ``well qualified.'' Why? \nBecause, for the last 22 years that Andre Davis has served as a judge, \nhe served at three different levels--at the State courts and at the \nFederal courts. He currently sits as a Federal district judge for the \nMaryland District, nominated by President Clinton and unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate. So he served in the State courts, where his \njudicial opinions, judicial behavior, judicial judgment could be \nobserved. People like him, they know him, they respect him.\n  His judicial record demonstrates an ability to handle difficult \nsituations with a calm, thoughtful, rational temperament. He is known \nfor thorough reasoning. He has not only served as a distinguished \njudge, but also he came to the courts as an experienced prosecutor. He \nwas with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and \nwith the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland.\n  In addition to being a judicial leader, he has also been a community \nleader. He, again, believes for every opportunity there is a \nresponsibility. He served on the board of directors of the Baltimore \nUrban League, which provides so many vital services to our underserved \ncommunities. He was the president of the Legal Aid Bureau and a \nfounding member and chair of the board of the Baltimore Urban Debate \nLeague, so that young people in our public schools could learn the \nexcitement of high school debate which, for many of our inner-city \nyouth, was a pathway not only to eloquence and rational argument and \nthe love of combat over the clash of ideas but gave them a taste of a \nworld outside their own community and even put them on the road to \nscholarships.\n  He served for 4 years as the president of Big Brothers and Big \nSisters of Central Maryland, knowing not everybody had a dad and not \neverybody has a mom. If we can come up, through the Big Brothers and \nSisters, with programs showing a caring adult, it also helps with our \nyoung people.\n  Judge Davis has great integrity, a strong work ethic, and a \ncommitment to public service. He presents uncompromising views on \njudicial independence. He is an independent thinker, dedicated to the \nrule of law and core constitutional principles. Well-respected \ncolleagues consider him a first-rate judge, with an unassailable record \nin the community as a lawyer and as a judge.\n  I hope the Senate will confirm him. I am proud to be here to speak up \nfor him and to stand for him and I will be proud to cast my vote in \nsupport of him.\n  With deep roots in the Maryland community, distinguished and \nexperienced as a judge, I think he would be an excellent addition to \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am going to thank my colleagues \ntoday for giving this matter their attention.\n  As I conclude my initial presentation with Judge Davis, I would like \nto take a moment and speak on personal privilege. This is a big day for \nme. It is a big day for Andy Davis. He has been waiting a long time \nsince he was first nominated by President Clinton. But now his time \nwill come to be judged by the Senate whether he is deemed worthy of \nsomeone on the Fourth Circuit.\n  But it is a special day for me. Today is the first day in over 124 \ndays since my accident coming out of Catholic Mass where I broke my \nankle. This is the first day that I can actually come to the floor of \nthe Senate and stand up for someone in whom I truly believe because I \nbelieve he will stand up for the Constitution that made our country \ngreat. I come with no space boot; I come with no props to hold me up. \nIt is a very big day. So I am very excited about the fact that I am \nable to do this.\n\n\n                        Fall of the Berlin Wall\n\n  It is also a special day in world history. Today is the day the \nBerlin Wall came down. I was filled with excitement on that wonderful \nday because the roots of my own heritage lie in Poland. We are proud \nAmerican citizens, but we kept the heritage of the old country alive in \nour home, particularly because Poland, after World War II, was sold out \nat Yalta and Potsdam through an agreement that was ill-conceived, and \nhistory bore the point.\n  We watched Poland fall as Hungary and the Czech Republic and others \nbehind the Iron Curtain. They were called captive nations. Then we saw \nin Berlin that another wall went up and began the famous Berlin Airlift \nwhere America came to the rescue. They themselves in East Berlin were \nbehind another version of the Iron Curtain called the Berlin Wall.\n  Today we commemorate that 20 years ago--through nonviolent \nparticipation and the efforts of people such as Ronald Reagan, Maggie \nThatcher, the world's prayers, a strong Democratic United States of \nAmerica saying, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall''--that wall came \ndown.\n  It started when an obscure electrician jumped over a wall in a \nshipyard in Gdansk. His name was Lech Walesa. It started the Solidarity \nmovement. It sparked all of Central Europe through dissidents such as \nHaval. It led finally, through political leadership--such as President \nReagan, such as Maggie Thatcher, such as all of us here--to bring down \nthat wall.\n  So today we commemorate bringing down the Berlin Wall, bringing down \nthe Iron Curtain. When we elect Andrew Davis as an African American to \nthe Fourth Circuit, that famous Fourth Circuit with roots deep in the \nSouth, we are going to bring down another wall. But is that not what a \ngreat democratic nation does? We bring down walls through democratic \naction, through commitment and resolve, and doing it through \nnonviolence.\n  This is indeed a great day for the world and a great day for Andrew \nDavis and a very special day for me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me first compliment my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, for her leadership in bringing forward the nomination \nof Judge Davis to the circuit court of appeals. I join her in her \ncomments about the fall of the Berlin Wall, the importance that meant \nnot just for Europe. The Berlin Wall represented not only a divided \ncity, a divided country, but a divided continent. And the fall of that \nwall that we commemorate of 20 years\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\nago has significance well beyond that one city.\n  I was privileged to be in Berlin as the wall came down and will never \nforget those moments.\n  It is also nice to see my colleague on the Senate floor without the \nneed of any aid. She has been a fighter all of her life. She has been a \nfighter during this episode. She never missed a beat as far as \nrepresenting the people of Maryland.\n  But I particularly want to point out to my colleagues how proud I am \nof Senator Mikulski for the manner in which she has handled judicial \nappointments in our State. She is interested, as I am, in getting the \nvery best on our Federal courts, and in the process that was set up for \nus to make recommendations to the President and make recommendations to \nour colleagues on the confirmation of judges from those who apply from \nMaryland. This represents an open process, a process that encourages \nour very interest to apply and become Federal judges, and one that is \nsolely aimed at getting the very best talent onto our Federal courts.\n  That is certainly true with Judge Davis. It is certainly true with \nthat nomination. Judge Davis had a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee in April. In June, our committee reported him out favorably \nwith a strong bipartisan vote of 16 to 3.\n  I am not going to go through all of the points that Senator Mikulski \nraised as far as his background. But I do want to underscore a few \npoints I think are very important in the filling of this particular \njudicial position.\n  Judge Davis has strong roots in Maryland. This is a Maryland seat on \nthe Fourth Circuit. He was born in and raised in Baltimore. He is still \na resident of Baltimore. Judge Davis has an exceptional record of legal \nexperience in our State, including working as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, as a State district court judge, as a State circuit court \njudge, and now as a U.S. district judge.\n  He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania \nand graduated cum laude with his J.D. degree from the University of \nMaryland School of Law where he still teaches classes as an adjunct \nfaculty member.\n  He served as a district judge for the U.S. District of Maryland since \nhis Senate confirmation in 1995. You see Judge Davis has deep roots in \nMaryland and deep roots in the judicial branch of government.\n  He has a longstanding record that he has demonstrated in protecting \ncivil rights and liberties. I agree with my colleague, Senator \nMikulski, that one of the principal standards we want to see in judges \non our courts is an understanding of our Constitution and the \nprotection it provides our citizens. That is particularly important on \nour circuit court of appeals.\n  To give you one example of Judge Davis's record in protecting the \nrights of our people, this was a landmark decision on civil rights, \nReid v. Glendening, where Judge Davis ruled that the Baltimore City \nCourthouses were not wheelchair accessible, in violation of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. He then ordered the city and State to \ncreate a plan to make the buildings accessible.\n  I think that is pretty gutsy when we realize that some of the support \nour judiciary needs comes from local government. Yet Judge Davis did \nwhat was required under our Constitution.\n  He has been praised by lawyers in Maryland as a smart, evenhanded, \nfair, and open-minded judge. He has served as a judge for 22 years. He \nhas handled somewhere around 5,300 cases. Judge Davis received a ``well \nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Standing Committee on the \nFederal judiciary.\n  If confirmed, Judge Davis would be the third African-American judge \nto serve in the Fourth Circuit, which has one of the highest \npercentages of minority populations of any circuit in the country.\n  As my colleague pointed out, the Fourth Circuit has one of the \nhighest vacancy rates of any court, any circuit in our Nation. Five out \nof the fifteen seats are vacant, which constitutes one-third of the \nappellate court. Indeed, Judge Davis is a replacement for Judge Francis \nMurnaghan, who died in August of 2000.\n  Judge Murnaghan also had a lifelong record as a Maryland resident who \nserved on the Federal bench for 20 years and was one of the most \nrespected lawyers and judges in our State. Judge Davis served as a law \nclerk for Judge Murnaghan on the Fourth Circuit from 1979 to 1980. So I \nthink this is a very appropriate appointment.\n  I am proud to join the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, in \nrecommending to our colleagues the confirmation of Judge Davis. We \nbelieve he will continue the great tradition, the great record he has \nestablished as a Federal judge, as a State judge, and he will continue \nthat when confirmed by this body to serve on the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\n  We are proud to recommend his confirmation to our colleagues. With \nthat, I see that the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Sessions, is on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would also like to speak on the \nDavis nomination and reluctantly I will speak in opposition to that \nnomination. There has been some discussion on the Senate floor today \nand previously in more detail about the need for the circuit judges. \nBut I would just point out, having been through this system quite a \nbit, that during the 110th Congress four highly qualified consensus \nnominees to that court were presented to the Senate by President Bush \nand were not confirmed: Judge Robert Conrad, Judge Glen Conrad, Mr. \nSteve Matthews, and Mr. Rod Rosenstein.\n  I remember Judge Conrad. He is the presiding judge of his district \nand had been a U.S. attorney. I remember him testifying during \nPresident Clinton's difficulties, and then Attorney General Janet Reno \nlooked all over the U.S. Federal prosecuting ranks to pick a U.S. \nattorney who would be a special prosecutor whom she would select to \nprosecute one of the allegations against President Clinton.\n  She chose Mr. Conrad. He concluded that there were no charges in that \nmatter to be brought against President Clinton and was later appointed \na Federal judge in the district and was confirmed, but he was blocked \nfor the court of appeals. I always knew he would be a good decisive \njudge since he was a point guard on the University of North Carolina \nbasketball team. They have to make decisions. They have to make \ndecisions quickly.\n  So I would say a lot of effort went into confirming judges for \nvacancies that are not there today. Mr. Rosenberg was nominated to the \nseat as a judicial emergency in November of 2007, the very seat to \nwhich Judge Davis has been nominated. He was not confirmed. In fact, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle succeeded in holding that \nvacancy, this vacancy, open for 9 years.\n  I find it breathtaking that people would suggest that the \nRepublicans, who tried to fill that vacancy for 9 years and had the \nnominees blocked, were responsible for vacancies which have been there \nfor a long time. I find that quite an odd thing.\n  The ABA reported Mr. Rosenstein unanimously ``well qualified.'' In \n2005 he was confirmed unanimously to be U.S. attorney for Maryland. \nPrior to his service as U.S. attorney, he held a number of positions in \nthe Department of Justice under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. Despite his stellar qualifications, he waited 414 days \nfor a hearing and never got one. So his nomination expired in January \nof this year.\n  The reason, one reason, given for blocking his nomination was that he \nwas doing a good job as U.S. attorney in Maryland, and that is where we \nneed to keep him. Well, forgive me if I think that is a bit much, and I \ncertainly do not think we need to have the outrage from the other side \nabout vacancies on this court since they are a direct product of the \nefforts of my colleagues to keep that vacancy open.\n  But Judge Davis has fared much better than those four nominees did in \nthe last Congress. He received a hearing a mere 27 days after his \nnomination. A committee vote occurred just 36 days later. Today the \nfull Senate will vote on his nomination.\n  I would just say I think we need to take time to look at nominees and \nask the tough questions. We are not a rubberstamp. Good nominees ought \nto\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nbe confirmed. Sometimes we just have a disagreement, like we will about \nJudge Davis, and we will have a vote. They will be confirmed or not \nconfirmed.\n  I would like to point out, however, that the average time from \nnomination to confirmation for nominees to the courts of appeals \nsubmitted by President Bush was 350 days, and that was the average. The \nmajority of President Bush's first nominees, the first group--and Judge \nDavis is part of President Obama's first group--waited years for \nconfirmation.\n  Some of them never even got a hearing, despite being highly \nqualified, outstanding nominees. So Judge Davis has done pretty well in \ngetting his case before the Senate and being able to get a vote. The \nfact is, nominees are moving much faster than they did during the Bush \nyears. But we do have a duty to fulfill in analyzing nominees because \nthey are being considered for a lifetime appointment, an appointment to \nthe court in which the only thing that constrains them in how they \nconduct their daily business is their personal integrity, their \npersonal restraint, and the only thing that reduces the number of \nerrors they might make is their ability and determination to do the \nright thing.\n  Judge Davis is currently a judge on the Federal trial court in \nMaryland. During his time on the bench, unfortunately, he has been \nreversed by the Fourth Circuit, the very court to which he is now being \nnominated, in a number of troubling cases. He has been criticized by \nthat appellate court for misapplying the law, for throwing out relevant \nand lawfully obtained evidence and wrongfully dismissing cases where \nthere were genuine unresolved issues between the parties.\n  If Judge Davis did not adequately assess the facts or apply the law \nin these fairly direct and simple cases, it raises a question as to why \nhe would be qualified to be promoted to the Fourth Circuit, the \nappellate court, one step below the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  One of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee argued that district \njudges are going to be reversed from time to time and that if we held \nevery reversal against a nominee, no judge would ever be elevated to \nthe court of appeals. That is a fair point. Even the best trial judge \noccasionally may be reversed by an appellate court. But I felt the \nresponsibility to look at these reversals and ask whether these are \nnormal kinds of reversals that could occur in tough cases. I have to \nsay, I believe the cases reveal a disturbing pattern of mistakes, \nmistakes that consistently favor criminal defendants and evidence an \nanti-law enforcement tendency. That, as a former prosecutor in Federal \ncourt, makes me a bit nervous. Many of the rulings a Federal judge \nmakes against a Federal prosecutor cannot be appealed. It is an awesome \npower they have.\n  These mistakes have real-world consequences for law enforcement \nofficers who are out on the streets doing their best every day to \nfollow the already complex body of law and rules required by the \ncourts. Police train and work hard to try to do the things they are \nrequired to do by courts. Sometimes the courts have caused them to do \nthings that are unwise, but they try to do them anyway. Yet in Judge \nDavis' courtroom, the rules seem to change from case to case. It is a \ndangerous thing. It leaves police unsure of how to comply with the law \nwhen they are trying to protect citizens from criminal activities. \nThese kinds of mistakes and rulings in effect allow criminals to go \nfree on technicalities.\n  Not only do the shifting ground rules make a police officer's job \nnearly impossible, these types of errors require appeals. Appeals cost \nmoney. They take time. They delay justice. Not only are many of Judge \nDavis' decisions wrong as a matter of law, they have an extremely \ndetrimental impact on the workings of the criminal justice system. \nWithin the last 5 years alone, the Fourth Circuit has reversed Judge \nDavis 13 times for errors that seem to consistently favor criminal \ndefendants. Even more troubling is that those errors are basic errors \nof law. I have studied the cases and the issues involved. It seems to \nme these are errors that should not have been made. They raise doubts \nin my mind about whether he should be elevated--he has a lifetime \nappointment on the Federal district court--to a lifetime appointment on \nthe court of appeals.\n  One of the most troubling cases he has ruled on was the case of \nUnited States v. Kimbrough. There the defendant was arrested in his \nmother's house. Police found him in the basement cutting cocaine, the \n``knife on the mirror'' type cutting of cocaine. After the arrest and \nbefore police could read the defendant his Miranda warnings, the \ndefendant's mother asked him if he had anything else in the basement--\nnot the police, his mother. The defendant said he had a gun. The police \nwent down and found the gun. They charged the defendant with unlawful \npossession of a firearm and possession of cocaine, both. The firearm \ncharge would normally carry a mandatory penalty in addition to the \ncocaine possession charge.\n  Apparently, the judge didn't like that. Judge Davis threw out the \ndefendant's statement that he had a gun because he said he had not been \ngiven his Miranda warning: You have a right to remain silent. The case \nwent to the court of appeals, and he was reversed. The court of appeals \nin Kimbrough, the court he wants to sit on, had this to state, which is \npretty obvious to me:\n\n       The defendant's mother ``is a private citizen, her \n     spontaneous questioning of [the defendant] alone, independent \n     of the police officers, could never implicate the Fifth \n     Amendment.''\n\n  Of course not. The Miranda warning is a court-created rule. It is not \nin the Constitution. Prior to its creation, police didn't give those \nwarnings. But it is designed to help deter police from incriminating an \nindividual and using the power of their badge to say something they \ndidn't want to voluntarily say. But this was a question by the mother, \nnot the police. It can, as the court said, never implicate the Fifth \nAmendment. The case was reversed after how many months and how much \nexpense, we don't know. I do find it difficult to understand how that \nmistake was made.\n  Another of Judge Davis' cases that I find extremely troubling is \nUnited States v. McNeill. In that case, the defendant threatened to \nkill his girlfriend while in the presence of a police officer. What did \nthe police officers do? They arrested him. At a minimum, this is a \nharassment charge, I submit, to threaten someone's life in the presence \nof the police. What would happen if the police officers hadn't arrested \nthe man and they had walked off and left him there with his girlfriend \nand he had killed her? What would the public say then about the police \nofficers? What would the average citizen say: Did you do your duty? \nDidn't you have the ability to make an arrest?\n  Judge Davis said he didn't. Judge Davis said he had no ability to \nmake an arrest, to intervene in that circumstance. This is how it \nhappened. They arrested him. They took him to jail. While he was in \njail, he confessed to robbing a bank. Once again, Judge Davis threw out \nthe confession, the whole case. If the arrest was bad and he was in \njail, that was a product, I guess, of the poisonous tree and the \nconfession was bad as to the bank robbery. So even though the police \nofficer witnessed the defendant threatening his girlfriend, Judge Davis \nheld the officer did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant. \nOnce again, Judge Davis, however, was reversed by the Fourth Circuit.\n  The judge's troubling pattern of errors in criminal cases is further \nreflected in United States v. Dickey-Bey. There the defendant was \ncharged with drug trafficking after he picked up packages that \ncontained two kilograms of cocaine. Police had more than enough \nevidence against the defendant. This is what they had: Before the \npackages were mailed or when they were being mailed, a drug-sniffing \ndog detected the cocaine. The police then obtained a warrant, searched \nthe packages and discovered two kilograms of cocaine in the package. \nThe police then resealed the packages and allowed the packages to \ncontinue through the mail, apparently to their destination in Maryland. \nThat is what we call--and hundreds of thousands of police officers \ncall--a controlled delivery. The cocaine is not allowed to get out on \nthe street, but they ship it. And let's see who comes up to pick it up. \nThis is a common police procedure.\n  The defendant fit the description they had of the person who \nroutinely picked up packages such as this from\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nthis specific mail box. At the time of his arrest, the defendant had \nkeys in his pocket to other mailboxes which had also been known to be \ndestinations for packages of cocaine. Pretty good case, it looked like \nto me. In spite of all this, Judge Davis ruled that the police lacked \nprobable cause. Probable cause to arrest is a low standard. If the \ndefendant had a defense, he could always present it later and go to \ntrial and be acquitted. But it certainly met the probable cause \nstandard to make an arrest. He had two kilos of cocaine in his hands, \napparently.\n  I will quote from the Fourth Circuit court he wants to sit on and \nwhat they said about his decision in Dickey-Bey:\n\n       In reaching its conclusion, . . . the district court failed \n     to step back and look at the totality of the circumstances \n     and the reasonableness of the officers' belief, in light of \n     those circumstances, that Dickey-Bey was a knowing part of a \n     larger drug operation.\n\n  Pretty simple case. The impact for every police officer in America \nwho might be listening today, the impact of this ruling, if that is not \nprobable cause, is that controlled deliveries of this kind that occur \nquite frequently in law enforcement would be eliminated.\n  How much cocaine is two kilograms? It is a lot. Under the sentencing \nguidelines, two kilograms of cocaine powder would yield an offense \nlevel of 28 which means a 78 to 97 months' sentence for a first-time \noffender, mandatory. That is the range the judge would have to sentence \nwithin the sentencing guidelines, 78 to 97 months.\n  A bulk package of 2 kilograms of cocaine would sell for anywhere from \n$20,000 to $50,000 on the street, depending on the geographic region. \nAccording to the Sentencing Commission's 2007 Cocaine and Federal \nSentencing Policy Report, the average ounce of cocaine sold on the \nstreets of America for $1,150 in 2005. If it is broken into 1-ounce \npackages for resale, the 2-kilogram package could sell for over \n$81,000. So this is not a little bitty deal. That amounts to 10,000 to \n20,000 dose units.\n  I am baffled how anyone could think there was not a crime being \ncommitted, how there was not probable cause to believe this individual \nwas involved in a crime. Once again, Judge Davis was reversed by the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, fortunately; and, presumably, this \ncase went on to trial.\n  Judge Davis threw out yet another confession in the case of United \nStates v. Jamison. In that case, the defendant, a convicted felon, shot \nhimself. He shot himself. He went to the hospital and called out to the \npolice for help and confessed that it was his gun that he shot himself \nwith. Well, he was a felon. He could not have a gun. So the police \ncharged him with being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  Judge Davis, however, threw out his confession, his statement he made \nto the police based on the finding that the defendant made the \nstatement while in police custody and without the police having given \nhim Miranda warnings. The Fourth Circuit reversed because the defendant \nwas not in police custody; he was in the hospital. He had pretty good \ncorroboration--the fact that he had a gun--because he had a bullet hole \nin himself, apparently.\n  This is what the court said, unanimously reversing this decision--the \ntrial stops. Prosecutors have to appeal. The case is thrown out. They \nfile the appeal. All this money is spent. The court pays for the \ndefendant's lawyer to go up and argue the case. They have to write \ncases. Months go by.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  This is what the court said, in reversing him unanimously:\n\n       [The defendant], and the court below, however--\n\n  The ``court below'': Judge Davis--\n\n     misunderstand the reach of Miranda. . . . Miranda and its \n     progeny do not equate police investigation of criminal acts \n     with police coercion. This distinction is especially salient \n     when the victim or suspect initiates the encounter with the \n     police.\n\n  He asked for them to come and help him.\n  Of course, this pattern has been noted by the lawyers who appear \nbefore Judge Davis. One assistant U.S. attorney--a Federal prosecutor--\nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       While Judge Davis is well-respected by the defense bar for \n     his patience and open-minded approach to legal arguments, \n     Assistant United States Attorneys are often frustrated by his \n     rulings in criminal cases . . . and have not hesitated to \n     appeal.\n\n  Apparently they have been pretty successful in their appeals.\n  This assistant U.S. attorney also said that ``some prosecutors \nbelieve Davis doesn't trust . . . [the] police. . . .\n  Well, that is what I would say the record seems to indicate.\n  As a district court judge, Judge Davis' errors have been reviewed by \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. If he is elevated to that court, \nonly the Supreme Court will then be able to review his decisions. But \nthe Supreme Court only hears a small fraction of cases from the \nappellate courts and cannot continually correct garden variety legal \nerrors.\n  If confirmed, Judge Davis will be the final avenue of appeal for many \nlitigants. Of all the possible nominees who could have been submitted \nto this court, is this the one we believe would be best?\n  Courts of appeal have great power through their rulings and can \ncreate serious problems for prosecutors. So I would say, just based on \nmy review of the cases I have mentioned, Judge Davis' decisions, if not \nreversed--fortunately, they were reversed--would have seriously \ndamaged, if not eliminated, a police technique of controlled delivery \nof drugs to persons who would pick them up.\n  He seems to ignore the requirement that an individual has to be in \ncustody by the police or be interrogated by the police before Miranda \nhas to be given. That is a fundamental principle of universal \nacceptance. But, apparently, the judge is not one who follows that, and \nhe has altered the standard for probable cause in a case that I think \nis troubling.\n  So the types of mistakes Judge Davis has made can indeed be a threat \nto public safety. Wasn't it fortunate they arrested the man who \nthreatened his girlfriend and then that he blurted out he committed a \nbank robbery? Aren't we happy? But if his ruling had been upheld, the \neffect of that would be to tell every police officer if a person \nthreatens their girlfriend in the presence of a police officer, they \ncannot make an arrest.\n  Our law enforcement officers work hard under dangerous conditions to \ninvestigate crimes and to apprehend and lock up criminals, many of whom \nare dangerous, carry guns, threaten girlfriends, shoot themselves. It \ncould well have been somebody else who got shot. Yet the President is \nnow seeking to elevate a judge who seems to have a real personal bias \nagainst the work that they do. He has nominated Judge Davis for \nelevation to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit--one step \nbelow the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I think he does seem to have, if not a bias against, a lack of \nrespect for clarity and consistency in the enforcement of criminal \njustice, and his errors tend consistently to favor the criminal \ndefendant.\n  I am sure this nominee is a fine man. He has been on the bench a \nnumber of years. I have nothing against him personally. I am not \nquestioning his integrity. But it does appear to me he has a cavalier \nor a lack of substantive commitment to get criminal justice matters \nright and has shown, by specific rulings against police and \nprosecutors, that he could do harm on the court of appeals.\n  So, Madam President, for the reasons I have stated, I am reluctantly \nvoting against the nominee and would ask my colleagues to consider \ndoing the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I rise in opposition to the \nnomination of Mr. Andre M. Davis to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit.\n  This position has been vacant since 2000, despite the previous \nadministration's best efforts to nominate a qualified candidate. For \nexample, President Bush nominated remarkable candidates when he sent \nMr. Rod Rosenstein before the Senate in 2007 for the Fourth Circuit \njudgeship. At the time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nargued that Mr. Rosenstein was ``too qualified'' to be appointed to \nthis position. Now, President Obama has nominated Mr. Andre Davis, who \nhas made very questionable rulings while enjoying the support from the \nsame\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nSenators who opposed more qualified candidates.\n  While I do not raise issue with Mr. Davis's character, I find his \njudicial record very troubling. His rulings have been overturned by the \nFourth Circuit numerous times. In over six different cases, Mr. Davis \nwas noted and reversed by the Fourth Circuit because he suppressed \nevidence. Because of his rulings, criminals could and have been allowed \nto walk. The U.S. Supreme Court only hears a limited number of cases, \nwhich means that the final ruling on many more cases are made at the \nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals level.\n  It is clear that President Obama and my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle care less about sending a good candidate to the Fourth \nCircuit bench and more about pushing their own agendas. After holding \nup several more qualified candidates for this position, my colleagues \nin the majority insist on appointing someone who was reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee just 36 days after being nominated by President \nObama. I urge my fellow Senators to oppose this nomination. Our justice \nsystem should not be compromised over political agendas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I came over here and listened to the \ndebate, and I was wondering just who was being considered. It is not \nthe description I would have of Judge Andre Davis of Maryland. I will, \nin a moment, go to that.\n  But, first, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \nconfirmation of Executive Calendar No. 185, the Senate remain in \nexecutive session and vote immediately on confirmation of Executive \nCalendar No. 471, the nomination of Charlene Edwards Honeywell to be \nU.S. district judge for the Middle District of Florida; that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; no further motions be in order, and any statements relating \nto the nomination be printed in the Record; the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Now, Madam President, let me tell you who Judge Andre \nDavis is because listening to this description, you would not recognize \nthe person. This is a nomination that should not have taken the Senate \n5 months to consider--5 months--after it was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee on a strong bipartisan vote of 16 to 3. The Republicans who \nvoted for him: Senator Hatch, Senator Kyl, Senator Graham, and Senator \nCornyn--are not people who are apt to give an easy pass to somebody who \nis not qualified.\n  In fact, he is a well-respected judge who has served for 14 years on \nthe Federal bench as a district court judge; and before that, 8 years \nas a Maryland State court judge.\n  Then, for an impartial review of who this person is--not a partisan \nreview but an impartial review--the American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary rated his nomination ``well-\nqualified.'' That is the highest rating they can give to anybody. So \nthere is no surprise Judge Davis enjoys the strong support of his home \nState Senators: Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. In fact, Senator \nCardin chaired his confirmation hearing back on April 21, and he has \nbeen a strong advocate for Senate action on his nomination.\n  While it is not surprising, it is nonetheless disappointing the \nSenate has been prevented from considering this nomination for 5 months \nby Republican objections. I am not surprised because Senate Republicans \nbegan this year threatening to filibuster President Obama's judicial \nnominations before he had made a single one. They have followed through \nwith that threat by obstructing and stalling the process, delaying for \nmonths the confirmation of well-qualified, consensus nominees. Last \nweek, the Senate was finally allowed to consider the nomination of \nJudge Irene Berger, who has now been confirmed as the first African-\nAmerican Federal judge in the history of West Virginia. The Republican \nminority delayed consideration of her nomination for more than 3 weeks \nafter it was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. When her \nnomination finally came to a vote, it was approved by an overwhelming \nvote of 97-0. That follows the pattern that Republicans have followed \nall year with respect to President Obama's nominations. I expect Judge \nDavis to be confirmed by a bipartisan majority, but only after a 5-\nmonth stall.\n  Last year, with a Democratic majority, the Senate reduced circuit \ncourt vacancies to as low as 9 and judicial vacancies overall to as low \nas 34, even though it was the last year of President Bush's second term \nand a presidential election year. That was the lowest number of circuit \ncourt vacancies in decades, since before Senate Republicans began \nstalling Clinton nominees and grinding confirmations to a halt. In the \n1996 session, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 17 judges \nand not a single circuit court nominee. Because of those delays and \npocket filibusters, judicial vacancies grew to over 100, and circuit \nvacancies rose into the mid-thirties.\n  When I served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first term, I did my best to stop this downward spiral \nthat had affected judicial confirmations. Throughout my chairmanship, I \nmade sure to treat President Bush's judicial nominees better than \nRepublicans had treated President Clinton's nominees. In fact, during \nthe 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee in President Bush's \nfirst term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of \nhis Presidency, although Republicans had run the Judiciary Committee \nfor more than half his tenure, more of his judicial nominees were \nconfirmed when I was the chairman than in the more than 4 years when \nRepublicans were in charge.\n  Instead of building on that progress, Senate Republicans are intent \non turning back the clock to the abuses they engaged in during their \nyears of resistance to President Clinton's moderate and mainstream \njudicial nomination. The delays and inaction we are seeing now from \nRepublican Senators in considering the nominees of another Democratic \nPresident are regrettably familiar. Their tactics have resulted in a \nsorry record of judicial confirmations this year--less than a handful--\nwith 10 judicial nominees currently stalled on the Senate Executive \nCalendar.\n  By November 9 in the first year of the Presidency of George W. Bush, \nthe Senate had confirmed 17 circuit and district court judges, four \ncircuit court nominees and 13 district court nominees. By contrast, \nJudge Davis is only the second circuit court nomination Republicans \nhave allowed to be considered all year. When his nomination is \nconfirmed, it will only bring the total to five--less than one third of \nwhat we had accomplished by this time in 2001. I know because in the \nsummer of 2001, I began serving as the chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We achieved those results with a controversial and \nconfrontational Republican President after a mid-year change to a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate. We did so in spite of the attacks of \nSeptember 11; despite the anthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate that \nclosed our offices; and while working virtually around the clock on the \nPATRIOT Act for 6 weeks. By comparison, this year, the Republican \nminority has this year allowed action on only four judicial nominations \nto the Federal circuit and district courts. Judge Davis will be the \nfifth, and only the second circuit court judge.\n  Now we face this. Look at the chart I have in the Chamber. It is \noutrageous what is happening, the few nominees they are allowing \nthrough. This is not for lack of qualified nominees. There are 10 such \nnominees who have been reported by the Judiciary Committee on the \nSenate Executive Calendar. Had those nominations been considered in the \nnormal course we would be on the pace I set in 2001 when fairly \nconsidering the nominations of our last Republican President.\n  Even though as Democrats we treated President Bush far more fairly \nthan they had treated President Clinton, even though we tried to turn \nback the clock from when there were 60 judges Republicans pocket-\nfilibustered during President Clinton's time, even though in 17 months \nDemocrats confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominations, it looks as \nthough, as far as President Obama is concerned: President Obama \nnominates them, then they have to\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\nstall them. Rather than continued progress, we see Senate Republicans \nresorting to their bag of procedural treats to delay and obstruct. They \nhave ratcheted up the partisanship and seek to impose ideological \nlitmus tests.\n  The obstruction and delays in considering President Obama's \nnominations is especially disappointing given the extensive efforts of \nPresident Obama to turn away from the divisive approach taken by the \nprevious administration. He has reached out to Members of both parties \nto select mainstream, well-qualified nominees. I have been at some of \nthose meetings. I know the job he has done in reaching out to both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  In a recent column, Professor Carl Tobias wrote about President \nObama's approach:\n\n       Obama has emphasized bipartisan outreach, particularly by \n     soliciting the advice of Democratic and Republican Judiciary \n     Committee members, and of high-level party officials from the \n     states where vacancies arise, and by doing so before final \n     nominations. Obama has gradually, but steadily, put forward \n     his nominees, typically naming a few on the same day. This \n     approach compares favorably with the approach of the two \n     prior administrations, which often submitted large packages \n     on the eve of Senate recesses, thus complicating felicitous \n     confirmation. To date, Obama has nominated 23 well-qualified \n     consensus candidates, who are diverse in terms of ethnicity, \n     gender and ideology. This is sufficient quantitatively and \n     qualitatively to foster prompt confirmation.\n\n  I will ask that a copy of Professor Tobias's column be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  Professor Tobias makes this point well and it is substantiated by the \nbipartisan support from Republican home State Senators for the \nPresident's nominees. Indeed, since he made these observations the \nPresident has nominated two North Carolinians for vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit after consulting with both Senator Hagan and Senator \nBurr.\n  His first nomination of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana to the \nSeventh Circuit came to the Senate with the strong endorsement of \nSenator Lugar, the senior Republican in the Senate. Senator Lugar \npraised the ``thoughtful, cooperative, merit-driven'' process he and \nSenator Bayh took in consulting on that nomination. Despite the \nbipartisan endorsement from his home State Senators, Judge Hamilton's \nnomination is the subject of a Republican filibuster and has been \nstalled since it was reported to the Senate in June.\n\n  Federal judicial vacancies, which had been cut in half while George \nW. Bush was President have already more than doubled since last year. \nThere are now 98 vacancies on our Federal circuit and district courts, \nincluding 22 circuit court vacancies. Justice should not be delayed or \ndenied to any American because of overburdened courts, but that is the \nlikely result of the stalling and obstruction.\n  Despite the fact that Senate Republicans had pocket filibustered \nPresident Clinton's circuit court nominees, Senate Democrats opposed \nonly the most extreme of President Bush's ideological nominees and \nworked to reduce judicial vacancies. That had led to a reduction in \nvacancies in nearly every circuit during President Bush's \nadministration. One of the circuits where we succeeded in reducing \nvacancies was the Fourth Circuit, the circuit to which Judge Davis has \nbeen nominated.\n  After Senate Republicans had refused to consider any of President \nClinton's four Fourth Circuit nominees from North Carolina, vacancies \non the Fourth Circuit had risen to five. All four of President \nClinton's nominees from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit were \nblocked from consideration by the Republican Senate majority. These \noutstanding nominees included United States District Court Judge James \nBeaty, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge J. Richard Leonard, \nProfessor Elizabeth Gibson, and North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge \nJames Wynn. Had either Judge Beaty or Judge Wynn been considered and \nconfirmed, he would have been the first African-American judge \nappointed to the Fourth Circuit. The failure to proceed on those \nnominations was never explained. Indeed, Senate Republicans refused to \nconsider any of President Clinton's highly qualified circuit court \nnominations from any of its States in the Fourth Circuit during the \nlast 3 years of his administration. That resulted in five continuing \nvacancies.\n  What followed was an effort by President Bush to pack the Fourth \nCircuit with ideologues. He nominated a political operative from \nVirginia for a vacancy in Maryland who was caught stealing from a local \nstore and pleaded guilty to fraud. There was his highly controversial \nnomination of William ``Jim'' Haynes II to the Fourth Circuit who as \ngeneral counsel at the Department of Defense was an architect of many \ndiscredited policies on torture and who never fulfilled the pledge he \nmade to me under oath at his hearing to supply the materials he \ndiscussed in an extended opening statement regarding his role in \ndeveloping these policies and their purported legal justifications.\n  Mr. Haynes nomination led the Richmond Times-Dispatch to write an \neditorial in late 2006 entitled ``No Vacancies,'' about President \nBush's counterproductive approach to nominations in the Fourth Circuit. \nThe editorial criticized the administration for pursuing political \nfights at the expense of filling vacancies. According to the Richmond \nTimes-Dispatch:\n\n       The president erred by renominating . . . and may be \n     squandering his opportunity to fill numerous other vacancies \n     with judges of right reason.\n\n  President Bush insisted on nominating and renominating Terrence \nBoyle, despite the fact that as a sitting U.S. district judge and while \na circuit court nominee, Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving \ncorporations in which he held investments. President Bush should have \nheeded the call of North Carolina Police Benevolent Association, the \nNorth Carolina Troopers' Association, the Police Benevolent \nAssociations from South Carolina and Virginia, the National Association \nof Police Organizations, the Professional Fire Fighters and the \nParamedics of North Carolina. Law enforcement officers from North \nCarolina and across the country opposed to the Boyle nomination. Civil \nrights groups opposed the nomination. Those knowledgeable and \nrespectful of judicial ethics opposed the nomination. Ultimately, \nPresident Bush withdrew the Boyle nomination.\n  I mention these ill-advised nominations because so many Republican \npartisans seem to have forgotten the reasons these ideological \nnominations did not proceed.\n  We did break the logjam in North Carolina. I worked to break through \nthe impasse and to confirm Judge Allyson Duncan of North Carolina to \nthe Fourth Circuit when President Bush nominated her. From the summer \nof 2001 through 2002, I presided over the consideration and \nconfirmation of three Fourth Circuit judges nominated by President \nBush. And in the Presidential election year of 2008, one of the final \nappellate court judges confirmed by the Senate was another Fourth \nCircuit nominee. Despite the confrontational approach taken by \nPresident Bush and additional retirements on the Fourth Circuit, we \nended up reducing the vacancies on the Fourth Circuit during the course \nof his administration.\n  Despite our good efforts, the right wing seems intent on repeating \nits mistakes of the past and obstructing President Obama's nominees to \nthe Fourth Circuit. That appears to be why Judge Davis has been delayed \nfor months. That appears to be why they are resisting consideration of \nthe nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan from Virginia. And that \nappears to be why following the announcement last week of the \nnominations of Judge James Wynn and Judge Albert Diaz to Fourth Circuit \nvacancies, the head of a right wing group urged Republican Senators to \nobstruct the nominees saying: ``I will predict . . . that life will not \nbe made easy for these two nominees'' the same way when the heads of \nthe Republican Party said they should block Eric Holder for Attorney \nGeneral, and they did. They delayed him for weeks. Finally, when we did \nget to vote, he got more votes than any of the last four Attorneys \nGeneral.\n  The Senate is finally being allowed to consider Judge Davis's \nnomination. He has had a long and distinguished legal career. During \nthe last 14 years, he served as Federal district judge in Maryland. He \nhas been a State judge. He has been a Federal prosecutor. He received \nhis bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated \ncum laude with his JD from the\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\nUniversity of Maryland School of Law, where he still teaches classes as \nan adjunct faculty member.\n  I congratulate Judge Davis and his family on what I know will be his \nconfirmation. I apologize to him for these unnecessary delays for such \na very fine man. I applaud the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, and my Senate partner from Maryland, Mr. Cardin, a member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, for their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article by \nProfessor Tobias to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   With Obama Proceeding Reasonably To Fill Federal Judgeships, the \n                        Bottleneck Is the Senate\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       A growing drumbeat of commentary has recently criticized \n     President Barack Obama for not acting quickly enough to fill \n     the 96 present vacancies on the federal appellate and \n     district courts. However, as I shall explain, closer \n     evaluation of the record compiled by President Obama shows \n     that these criticisms are actually unwarranted, and that \n     responsibility should more properly be assigned elsewhere. In \n     particular, blame should now be placed at the Senate's door.\n\n\n            Obama's Approach: Generally a Wise and Good One\n\n       Many observers have voiced numerous criticisms of Obama \n     Administration judicial selection. Some have suggested that \n     the President should nominate candidates more swiftly and in \n     greater numbers. Others have criticized the nominees' age \n     (saying they are too old), experience (saying there are too \n     many judges among them), and ideological perspectives (saying \n     they are too liberal or, in some instances, too \n     conservative). A few observers have also compared the number \n     of nominees (23) whom Obama has submitted with the number \n     (95) whom President George W. Bush had submitted at the \n     identical juncture of his administration.\n       Yet careful analysis of Obama's record shows that these \n     criticisms lack merit. Before Obama won the election, he had \n     already started planning for appointments. And when he was \n     elected, Obama quickly installed as White House Counsel \n     Gregory Craig, a respected attorney with much pertinent \n     expertise, who immediately enlisted several talented lawyers \n     to identify judicial designees. The administration also \n     capitalized on Vice President Joseph Biden's four decades of \n     Senate Judiciary Committee experience in the nomination \n     process. Accordingly, the selection group anticipated and \n     carefully addressed contingencies that might arise when \n     choosing judges. For example, it compiled ``short lists'' of \n     excellent candidates for possible Supreme Court vacancies, \n     should one arise.\n       Obama has emphasized bipartisan outreach, particularly by \n     soliciting the advice of Democratic and Republican Judiciary \n     Committee members, and of high-level party officials from the \n     states where vacancies arise, and by doing so before final \n     nominations. Obama has gradually, but steadily, put forward \n     his nominees, typically naming a few on the same day. This \n     approach compares favorably with the approach of the two \n     prior administrations, which often submitted large packages \n     on the eve of Senate recesses, thus complicating felicitous \n     confirmation. To date, Obama has nominated 23 well-qualified \n     consensus candidates, who are diverse in terms of ethnicity, \n     gender and ideology. This is sufficient quantitatively and \n     qualitatively to foster prompt confirmation.\n       Often before, and invariably following, nominations, the \n     administration and senators have cooperated. To facilitate \n     approval of nominees, Obama worked closely with Senators \n     Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chair, who \n     schedules hearings and votes, and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the \n     Majority Leader, who arranges floor consideration, and \n     their GOP analogues, Senators Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and \n     Mitch McConnell (Ky.).\n       Thus, the committee has swiftly assessed nominees, with \n     thorough questionnaires and hearings and prompt votes. \n     Indeed, Leahy convened hearings so fast that GOP members \n     complained they lacked sufficient preparation time, and he \n     quite reasonably responded with another session for a \n     nominee.\n\n\n The Real Problem Here Lies More with the GOP Senate Minority Than the \n                               President\n\n       The Democratic panel majority, thus, has expedited review, \n     but the Republican minority has delayed processing. For \n     instance, it routinely delays committee votes for a week with \n     no or minimal explanation.\n       This recently happened with four California District Court \n     nominees, three of whom the panel then unanimously approved. \n     And, last week, Senator Sessions held over Virginia Supreme \n     Court Justice Barbara Keenan, even though he had praised the \n     jurist's qualifications at her hearing two weeks earlier and \n     despite the fact that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit, to which she was nominated, desperately needs \n     more judges, as the court is operating with five of its 15 \n     judgeships vacant. In fairness, yesterday, Sessions explained \n     that Keenan's responses to some GOP written questions were \n     inadequate, but that she promptly furnished more complete \n     answers that were satisfactory, again lauded the jurist as a \n     ``fine nominee,'' and supported the panel decision to vote \n     her out without objection.\n       The committee has approved 14 federal court nominees, and \n     the real bottleneck has been Senate floor action. Of those 14 \n     nominees, only five have received floor debate and \n     confirmation; nine are pending without GOP consent to \n     consider them. Senator Reid has attempted to cooperate with \n     Senator McConnell and Republicans--but to no avail. For \n     example, McConnell insisted that the Senate consider no lower \n     court nominees until it had confirmed Supreme Court Justice \n     Sonia Sotomayor, which delayed the process until September.\n       The unanimous consent procedure allows one senator to stop \n     the entire body, and anonymous holds have delayed specific \n     nominees' consideration. Reid has been reluctant to employ \n     cloture, which forces votes, mainly because this practice \n     wastes valuable floor time. However, on Tuesday, Reid took \n     the unusual step of invoking cloture to secure a floor vote \n     on Southern District of West Virginia Judge Irene Berger. She \n     is the third uncontroversial judicial nominee on whom Reid \n     has been forced to seek cloture. Indeed, the GOP has \n     ratcheted up the stakes with the unprecedented action of \n     placing holds on noncontroversial nominees.\n\n\n      Obama's Nomination Record Thus Far Is Strong Given Unusual \n                             Circumstances\n\n       The fact that Obama has nominated only 23 persons thus far \n     to fill federal judgeships is not attributable to the White \n     House or the Senate majority. Nor is the fact that of these, \n     the Senate has confirmed only four lower court nominees. \n     Justice David Souter's May resignation meant that filling his \n     vacancy was a top priority, and that process consumed three \n     months, during which lower court selection had to be \n     temporarily frozen. The administration has, of course, also \n     encountered the ``start-up'' costs of instituting a new \n     government. Cabinet appointments consumed months, and the \n     Senate has yet to confirm several Assistant Attorneys General \n     nominees and many of the 93 U.S. Attorney nominees. There has \n     also been a pressing need for the Obama Administration to \n     address myriad intractable complications left by earlier \n     administrations, such as the deep, continuing recession; \n     Guantanamo; and the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.\n       For all these reasons, recent criticisms of President Obama \n     for submitting judicial nominees too slowly are unfounded. \n     Nor should the Senate Judiciary Committee majority be blamed: \n     The panel majority has expedited its nominee processing, but \n     the minority's virtually automatic reliance on holds has \n     caused some delay. The true bottleneck, however, has been the \n     nearly complete lack of floor consideration.\n       Senate Republicans must stop delaying floor action on the \n     President's well-qualified nominees--nominees who typically \n     have the blessing of the relevant states' senators. And, if \n     Republicans in the Senate continue to delay, Senate Democrats \n     should invoke cloture and related practices that will \n     facilitate expeditious approval of Obama's nominees.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I will use some leader time here to explain to everyone \nwhere we are.\n  At 10 o'clock in the morning when we come into session, there will be \na moment of silence in honor of the soldiers and the civilians who were \nkilled at Fort Hood.\n  I am working now with the Republicans to see if we can come up with \nan agreement to finish Military Construction. I would like to finish it \ntomorrow. It appears that it may not be doable, but we are going to \nhave votes tomorrow unless we can work something out to complete the \nlegislation on Monday.\n  If we can complete the legislation on Monday, the Military \nConstruction legislation, part of the agreement has to be something \nwith Judge Hamilton. Here is a man who has waited since April. We have \nagreed to give the Republicans all the time they want--if they want 30 \nhours to talk about him beforehand or 5 hours before and after--but we \ncan't work out anything that satisfies them. So it appears we can only \ndo cloture, which is such a shame. But that is fine. We are going to \nhave to work something out as an agreement; otherwise, we will have to \nhave some votes tomorrow. I know we have on this side a couple of \nSenators who, if there are no votes, would go down to Texas. We have \nKay Bailey Hutchison, who is the manager of the bill, who will not be \nhere, but there are other people on the subcommittee who could do the \nbill. I hope we can work something out, but, as we have learned during \nthis Congress, it is very difficult to work things out.\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n  We are going to have votes Monday, a week from today, in the morning. \nEveryone should understand that. Monday, a week from today, we will \nhave votes in the morning. We have to do that. The next week is \nThanksgiving. We are going to get on health care the week we come back \nbefore Thanksgiving. We are going to at least give it our utmost to get \non that bill.\n  We have a number of things that are very important. We have to do the \nhighway bill. The day after tomorrow is Veterans Day. We have a number \nof veterans bills the Republicans have held up. They are bills dealing \nwith homeless veterans, among other things. They are important pieces \nof legislation. Four or five of them are being held up. We put those \ntogether under rule XIV, and we are going to have a vote on them in the \nfuture. It is a shame that on Veterans Day we are not legislating for \nthe veterans, but we have been held up doing lots of things.\n  I hope we can work something out with the Republicans so we can \ncomplete the Military Construction bill, if not tomorrow, then on \nMonday, but we are not going--this isn't going to go over for many \nhours. I have asked to work something out. I hope we don't have to file \ncloture on this bill.\n  I will tell everyone, I quite doubt that I am going to file cloture \non Military Construction. If the Republicans don't want us to do that \nbill, then we will just do it some other time. It is Military \nConstruction, an extremely important piece of legislation. In years \npast, we have done that bill in an hour. I can remember when Dianne \nFeinstein and Kay Bailey Hutchison were managing that bill and we did \nthat bill in an hour. Over the years--Senator Leahy is on the floor, a \nlongtime member of the Appropriations Committee--this was not something \nto send political messages on. It was a bill to do something to help \nour military, to build new bases, new recreation facilities, to \nrenovate and repair facilities around the world.\n  So we have the situation here where it doesn't matter what we bring \nup, the Republicans stall it for time. That is why Senator Stabenow has \nbeen here with her charts indicating the--I think we are up to 87 now, \nor something like that--things they have held up in this Congress.\n  So I hope we can work something out so we don't have to have votes \ntomorrow, but I don't need the permission of the Republicans to have \nvotes tomorrow. We can have votes on amendments that are offered by \nDemocrats.\n  We are going to have a moment of silence. Everyone recognizes the \ntragedy of the event, and we want to be as positive as possible.\n  I hope we can work something out. I have two Democrats who have \nindicated they want to go, both freshman Senators, which doesn't \nmatter--they have a right to go just as do senior Members of the \nSenate--and three Republicans have indicated they would like to go. I \nhope that is possible. They can go, I won't stop them from going, but \nwe may have votes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree so much with our leader about the appropriations \nbills. I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, on the Senate floor. He is the \nonly person standing on this floor who has served longer in this Senate \nthan I have. I have been on that committee for 35 years. These are \nthings that are always done. Whether it is a Republican majority or a \nDemocratic majority, they have always been done, almost in a pro forma \nfashion. If somebody wants to vote against it, they can vote against \nit. But with all of the tremendous bipartisan work that is done in the \nAppropriations Committee--nobody has worked harder than the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. Nobody has worked harder than he has to \nget a bipartisan bill to the floor. To have it delayed, especially \nMilitary Construction, especially matters that help our military at a \ntime when they desperately need it, to have that held up just makes no \nsense. I share the leader's frustration.\n  I want to note for the record that nobody has worked harder to get a \nbipartisan bill on the floor than the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. In years past, that would go through in no \ntime at all. I cannot understand this kind of partisanship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nI didn't see the chairman on the floor. Everything my friend from \nVermont said about the Senator from Hawaii is true, and then multiply \nit by 10. Here is a man who has lived the military--a Medal of Honor \nwinner, an amputee. There is not a more bipartisan person in the whole \nbody than Senator Inouye from Hawaii.\n  In short, everyone here understand: Monday, a week from tomorrow, no \nmatter what happens tomorrow, we are going to have votes in the \nmorning. We have just a short week until Thanksgiving and we have a lot \nto do, including health care.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I also assume we will soon be voting \non Judge Honeywell for the U.S. district court in Florida. I enjoyed \nthe dialog I had with her during the confirmation hearings. I was \npleased to see good responses to questions for the record. She has \nserved as an assistant public defender and an assistant city attorney, \nan associate and partner in a law firm, as well as both a county court \njudge and a State circuit court judge. I will be supporting her \nnomination.\n  I wish to note that when I asked her about what role empathy should \nplay in deciding cases, she said:\n\n       Empathy does not play role in my consideration of cases. \n     Presently, I decide cases by applying the law to the facts of \n     the cases pending before me. If confirmed by the Senate to \n     serve as a District Court judge, I will decide cases in the \n     same manner.\n\n  I would expect, as I did for President Clinton, to vote for well over \n90 percent of the nominees who are submitted by the President. I hope \nto be able to do that for President Obama. But I will say, for the \nreasons I gave earlier, I must oppose Judge Davis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article written by Larry Margasak \nfrom the Associated Press, dated Monday, November 9, 2009, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Democrats Have Short Memory on Judge Nominees\n\n                          (By Larry Margasak)\n\n       Ten months into Barack Obama's presidency, Democrats are \n     accusing Republicans of creating ``a dark mark on the \n     Senate'' by delaying confirmation of his federal court \n     nominees.\n       The mark might not be as dark as Democrats make it seem.\n       Of the 27 judicial nominations Mr. Obama has made so far, \n     all five brought up for votes in the Senate have won \n     relatively quick confirmations, including new Supreme Court \n     Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n       So what is this ``dark mark'' that Senate Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, talks \n     about?\n       It's primarily two federal judges--one from Indiana, the \n     other Maryland--who've been waiting five months for Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, to bring their \n     nominations for appeals court promotions to the Senate floor.\n       Republicans contend that the nominees are activist judges, \n     and Mr. Reid hasn't forced the issue--although he said \n     Wednesday that he might do so by Veterans Day for at least \n     one of the nominees.\n       One other nominee has been waiting since Sept. 10. But \n     seven others have been waiting from only one to five weeks. \n     That's not a long time for the Senate, which prides itself as \n     a deliberative body, and Republicans say they're ready to \n     vote on most of them.\n       Democrats have a record of their own that is far from being \n     a bright light. Just three years ago, they were blocking \n     votes on some of President George W. Bush's more conservative \n     judicial nominees.\n       Several of Mr. Bush's nominees waited for years--two years \n     for eventual Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \n     when he was nominated for an appellate court post.\n       Priscilla Owen waited through four years of Democratic \n     blocking tactics before she was confirmed for the New \n     Orleans-based federal appeals court. Miguel Estrada withdrew \n     his bid for an appellate seat after a Democratic filibuster \n     lasting more than two years.\n       As an institution that lets the minority party use rules to \n     block legislation and nominations, the Senate often acts as a \n     filter for preventing the more politically strident bases of \n     each party from tilting the judicial branch too much one way \n     or the other.\n       Although moderate nominees win confirmation easily, both \n     parties use what is essentially the same argument to block or \n     at\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n     least delay action on others: The particular nominee would \n     substitute his or her own liberal or conservative philosophy \n     for the law and the Constitution.\n       ``It would be wrong for us to be a rubber stamp for each \n     nominee,'' Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior \n     Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in a recent \n     confirmation dustup in the Senate.\n       That sounds familiar.\n       After Mr. Estrada gave up, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, \n     Massachusetts Democrat, said, ``This should serve as a wake-\n     up call to the [Bush] White House that it cannot simply \n     expect the Senate to rubber-stamp judicial nominations.''\n       The Republican stall at this point is focused on two \n     appellate court judges whose nominations were sent by the \n     Judiciary Committee to the full Senate on June 4:\n       David Hamilton of Indiana, a U.S. district judge and nephew \n     of former Democratic Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, chosen for the \n     Chicago-based appeals court.\n       Mr. Reid said he wants a vote on Judge Hamilton by Veterans \n     Day. He'll probably need a supermajority of 60 to get one.\n       Judge Andre Davis, a district judge in Maryland, nominated \n     for a seat on the appellate court headquartered in Richmond.\n       Mr. Sessions made it clear that his party will put up a \n     fight against confirming either. He cited Judge Hamilton's \n     position in the late 1980s as a vice president for litigation \n     and board member of the Indiana chapter of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union. Mr. Sessions also complained about Judge \n     Hamilton's judicial rulings.\n       ``Instead of embracing the constitutional standard of \n     jurisprudence, Judge Hamilton has embraced this `empathy' \n     standard, this `feeling' standard. Whatever that is, it is \n     not law. It is not a legal standard,'' Mr. Sessions said.\n       In Judge Davis' case, Mr. Sessions made the delay sound \n     like a payback to Democrats, although he denied that was his \n     purpose.\n       ``We have had a number of battles over the failure to fill \n     some of the vacancies on that court,'' Mr. Sessions said, \n     referring to stalls of Mr. Bush's nominees for the Richmond-\n     based appeals court--once known for its conservatism.\n       Mr. Sessions said Republicans have a problem with only one \n     other current nominee before the Senate: Edward Chen, chosen \n     for a U.S. district court seat in California. But Mr. Chen's \n     nomination was only approved by the committee on Oct. 15, \n     hardly enough time to make the case for a stall.\n       ``Most of the nominees . . . will go through in an \n     expeditious manner,'' Mr. Sessions said. He said Republicans \n     are ready to support Beverly Martin, nominated for the \n     Atlanta-based appeals court, but Democrats have not scheduled \n     a vote. Her nomination reached the full Senate Sept. 10.\n       In the Senate's five judicial confirmation votes this year, \n     only Justice Sotomayor generated significant Republican \n     opposition, and she was approved 68-31.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Andre M. Davis, of Maryland, to be United \nStates circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the Honeywell nomination, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Charlene \nEdwards Honeywell, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Middle District of Florida.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell has been \nnominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District \nof Florida. Judge Honeywell's confirmation has been needlessly delayed. \nJudge Honeywell is a longtime State judge, last appointed by former \nRepublican Governor Jeb Bush. She was one of three district court \nnominees reported by the Judiciary Committee on October 1 without \ndissent. Yet Senate consideration has been delayed for 5 weeks.\n  After a 3-week wait, the Senate was allowed to consider the \nnomination of Roberto Lange, who was confirmed by the Senate 100 to 0--\nunanimously--to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of \nSouth Dakota after 2 hours of floor debate during which no Senator \nspoke in opposition. After a 4-week wait, the Senate was allowed to \nconsider the nomination of Irene Cornelia Berger, who was confirmed by \na vote of 97 to 0 to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of West Virginia after an hour of floor debate during which no \nSenator spoke in opposition. After more than 5 weeks, the Senate today \nfinally considers the nomination of Judge Honeywell, and I expect a \nsimilar result.\n  At the conclusion of the hearing to consider these nominations, \nSenator Sessions, the committee's ranking member, said:\n\n       It's a great honor that you've been given to be nominated \n     and I expect things should go forward in a timely manner. I \n     don't believe that any of you need to be held up based on \n     what I know at this time. So, we'd like to see you get your \n     vote as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n  I have been disappointed by Republican delays in bringing these well-\nqualified, noncontroversial nominees to a vote in the full Senate.\n  Judge Honeywell first served as a State court judge in 1994, and in \n2001 was appointed by Gov. Jeb Bush to serve as a State circuit court \njudge. Her legal career also includes working in private practice, \nserving as an assistant city attorney and as an assistant public \ndefender. She was unanimously rated ``well-qualified'' by the American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the \ncommittee's highest rating. She received the bipartisan support of \nFlorida Senators Bill Nelson and Mel Martinez.\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n  The Senate must restore its tradition of regularly considering \nqualified, noncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal \nbench without needless and harmful delays. This is a tradition followed \nwith Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents.\n  I congratulate Judge Honeywell and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Charlene Edwards Honeywell, of Florida, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Middle District of Florida?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN: I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, it was my intention to ask unanimous \nconsent to lay the pending amendment aside for consideration of \namendment No. 2758. However, I will not make that request right now. It \nis my understanding, however, and I ask unanimous consent, that I be \nrecognized for up to 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my intention to go ahead in the \nmorning and get this amendment in the queue. This amendment, No. 2758, \nis a simple, one-page amendment, and I will read the amendment because \nthere has been a lot of confusion as to what is happening down at \nGuantanamo Bay. Amendments have been introduced to withhold funds from \nconstruction, to withhold the opportunities for people to come to the \nUnited States, but this is a simple, one-page amendment which states \nthe following:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this act or any prior act may be used to construct or \n     modify a facility or facilities in the United States or its \n     territories to permanently or temporarily hold any individual \n     who was detained as of October 1, 2009, at Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  Some may ask: Why are we adding another Gitmo amendment? Hasn't \neverything been covered by previous amendments? The answer is clearly \nno. In 2007, the Senate voted 94 to 3 on a resolution declaring:\n\n       Detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be released into \n     American society, nor should they be transferred stateside \n     into facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n\n  Then, on May 20, 2009, the Senate passed my bipartisan amendment with \nSenator Inouye to the war supplemental bill prohibiting the transfer, \nrelease or incarceration of Gitmo detainees in the United States or its \nterritories. It passed 90 to 6.\n  Senator Inouye stated:\n\n       We have not provided funding for the closure of Guantanamo \n     because the administration has yet to produce a credible \n     plan.\n\n  Unfortunately, the supplemental conference deleted that language, \nallowing detainees to be transferred or transported to the United \nStates for trial.\n  Then, in October of 2009, the Senate voted 97 to 3 to pass the fiscal \nyear 2010 Senate Defense appropriations bill that included language \nthat prevents funding for any transfers, releases or incarcerations of \nGitmo detainees to the United States through fiscal year 2010. The bill \nis in conference now, and we don't know what is going to be happening \nto it.\n  On October 28, 2009, the fiscal year Defense authorization and \nHomeland Security bills were signed into law that would allow transfer \nof detainees 45 days after the President provides a plan.\n  That is kind of where we are right now. This amendment will put the \nMILCON-VA bill into sync with previous authorizations and \nappropriations of the bill. So I will be trying to get this in and \ntrying to get it passed. I will not go into any of the details.\n  I could probably talk for 3 hours on this floor, explaining why it is \nwe should not give up this valuable asset called Gitmo. There is no \nplace else to send these people, and I cannot imagine why there are \nsome people, including the President, who seem to be bent on bringing \nthose detainees into the United States. They have tried Fort \nLeavenworth, they have tried Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and some 31 States \nhave now passed legislation saying they are not going to be in any of \ntheir facilities. So I don't think it is going to happen, but we need \nto get language in there that is consistent to make sure we keep that \nresource open.\n  By the way, this is one of the rarer resources that is very \nworthwhile. We have had this since 1907, and there is no place else in \nthe world that is set up to both incarcerate and try detainees in a \nmilitary court.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 1963\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 190, S. 1963, at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader following consultation with the \nRepublican leader, and that when the bill is considered, it be under \nthe following limitations: that general debate on the bill be limited \nto 60 minutes equally divided and controlled between the chair\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nand the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee or their \ndesignees; that the only amendments in order be six first-degree \ngermane amendments, three each for the majority manager or his \ndesignee, and Senator Coburn; that debate on each amendment be limited \nto 40 minutes, equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that \nupon disposition of all amendments and the use or yielding back of all \ntime, the bill as amended, if amended, be read a third time and the \nSenate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill with no further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, first of all, let me tell \nmy good friend from Hawaii that I personally have no objection to the \nbill; however, I have been informed there are Members on our side who \nwant to work out something. They feel very confident they will be able \nto work it out with the Senator, but for the purpose of today, to this \nunanimous-consent request, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish today to honor Clair Earl for his \nservice to the people of Nevada. Very few people enjoy the privilege of \nservicing their community in both their professional and personal \npursuits. Yet Mr. Earl has labored diligently for over 40 years as a \ndentist and as an ecclesiastical leader in Reno.\n  Clair was born in Overton, NV, and raised on a farm in Moapa Valley. \nClair graduated from the University of Nevada--Reno, where he was the \nstudent body president his senior year, and did graduate studies at \nBrigham Young University. Mr. Earl also has degrees from Portland State \nUniversity and the University of Oregon Dental School.\n  Professionally Clair Earl has practiced as a dentist in Reno since \n1964. Over his 45 years of work he has gained a reputation as not only \nan excellent businessman, but also as a caring health professional to \nhis community. He has spent these many years providing his patients \nwith a high degree of service which has not gone unnoticed.\n  Clair Earl has a strong love for his family. His wife is the former \nMildred Meyer, and they were married in Logan, UT. They have 11 \nchildren and 50 grandchildren. All seven sons are Eagle Scouts. Eight \nof the children and seven of the spouses have served missions for the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Earl should be proud of \nthe job that he did as a parent raising these future leaders of the \ncountry.\n  Earl's values as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints are the solid foundation for his life and family. Clair has been \na force for much good among the LDS community in northern Nevada. He \nhas served as a bishop, a counselor in the Reno Nevada Stake, and also \nas the church director of public affairs for northern Nevada. \nCurrently, Clair Earl is serving as the president of the Reno Nevada \nStake. This is a calling of great magnitude, considering that President \nEarl leads over 4,000 members of the church and does so without any pay \nor reimbursement for time. This great act of service is a tribute to \nthe man that President Earl is and the strength of his convictions to \nbless the lives of others. Clair Earl is to be released from this \ncalling on November 15, 2009, after serving 9 years in this capacity.\n  Brigham Young, prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints and former Governor of Utah, once said, ``We want men to rule \nthe nation who care more for and love better the nation's welfare than \ngold and silver, fame or popularity.'' I feel confident that Clair Earl \nfits Young's definition of men who truly service this great Nation. I \nwish him all the best as he continues his service to the people of \nnorthern Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11284-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11284-S11285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT LARSEN BRAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today I wish before the Senate to honor \nRobert Larsen Bray. Although he is not a resident of my home State of \nNevada, his lifetime of service has been exemplary and is worthy of our \nattention. On October 30, 2009, Bob officially retired from his \nposition as chief information officer for the Texas Department of \nCriminal Justice. This retirement marks the end of a career in public \nservice that has been nothing short of monumental.\n  Bob was blessed to come from a wonderful family. Like me, Bob was \nborn the son of a hard-working man who went to great lengths to provide \nfor his family. Vern Bray, Bob's father, worked as a blast furnace \noperator, a gold miner, and also as a builder on the Hoover Dam, which \nis one of Nevada's prized possessions. Bob's mother, Myrl, instilled in \nher children a desire to learn and gain education. Three of her \nchildren went on to become outstanding educators, two of which did so \nin Nevada. My friend and Bob's oldest brother, Lawrence, was a longtime \nteacher in Las Vegas.\n  Together with his wife and best friend, Maryann, Bob has raised a \ngreat family of his own. Over their 43 years of marriage they have \nraised nine children five girls and four boys. Their seven married \nchildren have provided the Brays with 20 grandchildren. Although it was \ndifficult at times to provide and care for such a large family, the \nBrays fostered in their children an ardent work ethic and firm resolve \nto help their fellow man. I have witnessed firsthand the good they have \nbestowed upon their children, as my legislative correspondence manager, \nVaughn Bray, is their eighth child.\n  Much like his father, Bob has worked hard his whole life. At a young \nage he learned to keep working until the job was finished, an \nunpleasant notion when faced with the task of picking beets or cleaning \nirrigation ditches. As a man, Bob worked full-time at night for the \ndefense contractor Hercules in order to pay for his education at the \nUniversity of Utah. Later, Bob would attain a master's in public \nadministration at Texas Tech University in much the same way.\n  In order to provide for his family, Bob's work took him from Utah to \nTexas to New York to New Mexico and, finally, back to Texas. He has \nworked in some form of government for over 25 years. Most notably, he \nserved as the director of planning at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, \nTX, and more recently as chief information officer for the Texas \nDepartment of Criminal Justice in Huntsville, TX.\n  Throughout his life Bob has been a dedicated member of the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a 19-year-old, he served as a \nmissionary in Canada under the direction of the current president of \nthe LDS Church, Thomas S. Monson. He has gone on to serve in the church \nas a branch president, bishop, Stake president, and mission president \nin Nashville, TN. In these years of retirement that are soon to follow, \nBob and Maryann are eager to continue to serve in any capacity \npossible. Bob has stated that if he has his way, the Brays will serve \n10 more missions.\n  Although Bob had many duties at the home, office, and church, he \nstill found time to serve his community. He and his wife labored as PTA \npresidents while their children were in elementary school. Bob has \nworked as a leader in the Boy Scouts, as a board member of the Lubbock, \nTX, Civic Center, and as a volunteer during Hurricane Rita. \nPolitically, he has been involved on the local level of the Democratic \nParty, and even worked on the campaign of former Texas Congressman Kent \nHance, the only politician ever to defeat former President George W. \nBush in an election.\n  As his career comes to an end, it is safe to say that Robert Bray \nwill not resign himself to a life of golf and afternoon naps. Old \nhabits cannot be broken, and Bob Bray is a worker. I have no doubt that \nhe will continue to labor diligently to improve his community and to \nmake life a little better for\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nthose around him. I wish him all the best in his retirement, and \nsincerely hope that the next generation of Americans contains a few Bob \nBrays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11285-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BICENTENNIAL OF DR. EPHRAIM McDOWELL'S HISTORIC SURGERY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has many \nheroes. Yet only two have been granted significant prominence to have \ntheir likeness stand on permanent display within the halls of the U.S. \nCapitol building.\n  The Great Compromiser, Henry Clay, is one of those who have earned \nsuch distinction. And the second statue recognizes the contributions of \nDr. Ephraim McDowell to modern medicine. While his might not be a \nhousehold name, Dr. McDowell's contribution to surgical procedure is \nnonetheless momentous, making him one of only two Kentuckians in \nhistory to be recognized in the Capitol.\n  It was 200 years ago that Dr. McDowell performed the world's first \nsuccessful ovariotomy. What Mrs. Jane Todd Crawford of Green County, \nKY, mistook for twins, Dr. McDowell correctly diagnosed as a 22-pound \novarian tumor.\n  Mrs. Crawford begged Dr. McDowell to prevent her from dying a slow \nand painful death. The young doctor explained that her only option was \nto have experimental surgery, and he went further in explaining that \nnone who had previously undergone such surgery had survived. \nUndeterred, Mrs. Crawford pressed Dr. McDowell to perform the surgery \nand made the 60-mile horseback ride to Danville, KY, on December 13, \n1809.\n  By the end of the 25-minute procedure, which was performed without \nanesthetic, Mrs. Crawford's tumor had been removed and she was able to \nmake an uncomplicated recovery. She would go on to live another 32 \nyears. In time, Dr. McDowell would go on to perform nearly a dozen more \nsuch procedures, and his meticulous notes of performing a successful \nabdominal surgery would be reviewed and taught on two continents.\n  In those notes, he wrote about his first success:\n\n       Having never seen so large a substance extracted, nor heard \n     of an attempt, or success attending any operation such as \n     this required, I gave to the unhappy woman information of her \n     dangerous situation. The tumor appeared full in view, but was \n     so large we could not take it away entire. We took out \n     fifteen pounds of a dirty, gelatinous-looking substance. \n     After which we cut through the fallopian tube, and extracted \n     the sac, which weighed seven pounds and one-half. In five \n     days I visited her, and much to my astonishment found her \n     making up her bed.\n\n  Madam President, it is not just Mrs. Crawford who owes a debt of \ngratitude to Dr. Ephraim McDowell. Indeed, because of his efforts and \ncourage, the entire field of medicine made great advancements and \nsociety as a whole is the better. With the bicentennial of this \nremarkable accomplishment soon approaching, I thought it fitting for us \nto take a moment and remember this man who Kentucky rightfully honors \nwith a place in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11285-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11285-S11286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                  Economic Development Administration\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \nSenator from New York, in a colloquy.\n  I would first like to take this opportunity to commend Senator \nMikulski and Senator Shelby and their hard working staff for crafting a \nresponsible, commonsense funding measure, the Commerce, Justice, \nScience, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010.\n  I would like to highlight one piece of this bill, and that is the \nfunding allocation for the Economic Development Administration. Madam \nPresident, the country is facing the highest unemployment rate we have \nseen in more than 20 years. There are too many hard-working Americans \nwithout a paycheck.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. That is true in my State, as I know it is in the \nSenator's. Last week, the Labor Department reported 263,000 more jobs \nlost in September, leaving 15.1 million workers unemployed. The number \nof underemployed is even greater.\n  Funds for EDA are critical to our economic recovery, especially funds \nfor Economic Adjustment Assistance, which is more flexible spending \nthat enables EDA to respond quickly and forcefully to regions hit with \nan economic catastrophe.\n  Mr. BROWN. I agree with Senator Gillibrand that the Economic \nAdjustment Assistance account is critical for responding to sudden and \nsevere economic hardship in a region. One proven strategy for economic \ndevelopment in these regions is business incubators.\n  In Ohio, there are more than 30 business incubators that help foster \nregional economic development and spur small business expansion. Recent \nstudies show that business incubators are an effective public-private \napproach that produces new jobs at a low cost to the government.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Yes, I thank the Senator. In fact, a 2008 study \nconducted for the Economic Development Administration found that for \nevery $10,000 in EDA funds invested in business incubators, an \nestimated 47-69 local jobs are generated. In rural areas, business \nincubator projects are the most effective type of EDA project.\n  The National Business Incubation Association, NBIA, estimates that in \n2005 business incubators supported more than 27,000 start-up companies \nproviding full-time employment to more than 100,000 workers--generating \nmore than $17 billion in annual revenue.\n  NBIA also points to research showing that every dollar of Federal \nfunds devoted to a business incubator generates approximately $30 in \nlocal tax revenue.\n  Mr. BROWN. I was proud to introduce with the Senator the Business \nIncubator Promotion Act last month, which defines the types of \nincubator services proven to be most effective, and targets Federal \nfunds to the most economically distressed regions.\n  It is my understanding that the CJS appropriations legislation \nprovides $200 million to EDA, with $90 million of that to Economic \nAdjustment Assistance. I would like to see an additional $20 million in \nthis account to promote the revitalization of economically distressed \ncommunities and encourage the development of business incubators. This \nincrease would mean jobs--for Ohio, New York, and for other States with \nhigh unemployment.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I understand the administration would also like to \nsee these funds increased. In fact, in the Statement of Administration \nPolicy issued for the CJS Appropriations measure, the administration \nurges Congress to provide increased funding to fully implement the \nadministration's proposals to promote regional innovation clusters and \ncreate a business incubator network.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would like to join Senator Gillibrand in working with \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Shelby in boosting these funds. Now more \nthan ever, Congress must give EDA the tools to help entrepreneurs drive \nthe economic revitalization of towns, cities, and regions all across \nOhio, New York, and the country. The CJS Appropriations is an important \nstep, one upon which to build.\n  Again, I commend the work of Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby and \nlook forward to working with them to increase funding for EDA in \nconference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I am disappointed that on November 5, \n2009, the Senate voted to table my amendment to prohibit the use of \nfunds to prosecute individuals involved in the September 11, 2001, \nattacks in article III courts. As I stated at the time of the vote, it \nwould be a grave mistake to prosecute these detainees in civilian court \ninstead of the newly revamped military commissions.\n  Two hundred forty-nine family members of the victims of the September \n11 attacks wrote a letter in support of my amendment. They know better \nthan anyone that the attacks that took their loved ones were war crimes \nand that criminalizing this war would be dangerous and unwise.\n  I would like to submit their letter in support of my amendment for \nthe record, and I would like to give a special thanks to Debra \nBurlingame for her leadership on this issue. While I am disappointed in \nthe vote on this amendment, I hope that in the future we will heed the \ncounsel of those who lost the most in the terrible attacks on our \ncountry--the family members of 9/11 victims.\n\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\n\n                                                 November 5, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On September 11, 2001, the entire world \n     watched as 19 men hijacked four commercial airliners, \n     attacking passengers and killing crew members, and then \n     turned the fully-fueled planes into missiles, flying them \n     into the World Trade Center twin towers, the Pentagon and a \n     field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 3,000 of our fellow human \n     beings died in two hours. The nation's commercial aviation \n     system ground to a halt. Lower Manhattan was turned into a \n     war zone, shutting down the New York Stock Exchange for days \n     and causing tens of thousands of residents and workers to be \n     displaced. In nine months, an estimated 50,000 rescue and \n     recovery workers willingly exposed themselves to toxic \n     conditions to dig out the ravaged remains of their fellow \n     citizens buried in 1.8 million tons of twisted steel and \n     concrete.\n       The American people were rightly outraged by this act of \n     war. Whether the cause was retribution or simple recognition \n     of our common humanity, the words ``Never Forget'' were \n     invoked in tearful or angry rectitude, defiantly written in \n     the dust of Ground Zero or humbly penned on makeshift \n     memorials erected all across the land. The country was united \n     in its determination that these acts should not go unmarked \n     and unpunished.\n       Eight long years have passed since that dark and terrible \n     day. Sadly, some have forgotten the promises we made to those \n     whose lives were taken in such a cruel and vicious manner.\n       We have not forgotten. We are the husbands and wives, \n     mothers and fathers, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers and \n     other family members of the victims of these depraved and \n     barbaric attacks, and we feel a profound obligation to ensure \n     that justice is done on their behalf. It is incomprehensible \n     to us that members of the United States Congress would \n     propose that the same men who today refer to the murder of \n     our loved ones as a ``blessed day'' and who targeted the \n     United States Capitol for the same kind of destruction that \n     was wrought in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, should be \n     the beneficiaries of a social compact of which they are not a \n     part, do not recognize, and which they seek to destroy: the \n     United States Constitution.\n       We adamantly oppose prosecuting the 9/11 conspirators in \n     Article III courts, which would provide them with the very \n     rights that may make it possible for them to escape the \n     justice which they so richly deserve. We believe that \n     military commissions, which have a long and honorable history \n     in this country dating back to the Revolutionary War, are the \n     appropriate legal forum for the individuals who declared war \n     on America. With utter disdain for all norms of decency and \n     humanity, and in defiance of the laws of warfare accepted by \n     all civilized nations, these individuals targeted tens of \n     thousands of civilian non-combatants, brutally killing 3,000 \n     men, women and children, injuring thousands more, and \n     terrorizing millions.\n       We support Senate Amendment 2669 (pursuant to H.R. 2847, \n     the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act of 2010), \n     ``prohibiting the use of funds for the prosecution in Article \n     III courts of the United States of individuals involved in \n     the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.'' We urge its \n     passage by all those members of the United States Senate who \n     stood on the senate floor eight years ago and declared that \n     the perpetrators of these attacks would answer to the \n     American people. The American people will not understand why \n     those same senators now vote to allow our cherished federal \n     courts to be manipulated and used as a stage by the \n     ``mastermind of 9/11'' and his co-conspirators to condemn \n     this nation and rally their fellow terrorists the world over. \n     As one New York City police detective, who lost 60 fellow \n     officers on 9/11, told members of the Department of Justice's \n     Detainee Policy Task Force at a meeting last June, ``You \n     people are out of touch. You need to hear the locker room \n     conversations of the people who patrol your streets and fight \n     your wars.''\n       The President of the United States has stated that military \n     commissions, promulgated by congressional legislation and \n     recently reformed with even greater protections for \n     defendants, are a legal and appropriate forum to try \n     individuals captured pursuant the 2001 Authorization for the \n     Use of Military Force Act, passed by Congress in response to \n     the attack on America. Nevertheless, on May 21, 2009, \n     President Obama announced a new policy that Al-Qaeda \n     terrorists should be tried in Article III courts ``whenever \n     feasible.''\n       We strongly object to the President creating a two-tier \n     system of justice for terrorists in which those responsible \n     for the death of thousands on 9/11 will be treated as common \n     criminals and afforded the kind of platinum due process \n     accorded American citizens, yet members of Al Qaeda who \n     aspire to kill Americans but who do not yet have blood on \n     their hands, will be treated as war criminals. The President \n     offers no explanation or justification for this \n     contradiction, even as he readily acknowledges that the \n     9/11 conspirators, now designated ``unprivileged enemy \n     belligerents,'' are appropriately accused of war crimes. We \n     believe that this two-tier system, in which war criminals \n     receive more due process protections than would-be war \n     criminals, will be mocked and rejected in the court of world \n     opinion as an ill-conceived contrivance aimed, not at \n     justice, but at the appearance moral authority.\n       The public has a right to know that prosecuting the 9/11 \n     conspirators in federal courts will result in a plethora of \n     legal and procedural problems that will severely limit or \n     even jeopardize the successful prosecution of their cases. \n     Ordinary criminal trials do not allow for the exigencies \n     associated with combatants captured in war, in which evidence \n     is not collected with CSI-type chain-of-custody standards. \n     None of the 9/11 conspirators were given the Miranda warnings \n     mandated in Article III courts. Prosecutors contend that the \n     lengthy, self-incriminating tutorials Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \n     and others gave to CIA interrogators about 9/11 and other \n     terrorist operations--called ``pivotal for the war against \n     Al-Qaeda'' in a recently released, declassified 2005 CIA \n     report--may be excluded in federal trials. Further, unlike \n     military commissions, all of the 9/11 cases will be \n     vulnerable in federal court to defense motions that their \n     prosecutions violate the Speedy Trial Act. Indeed, the judge \n     presiding in the case of Ahmed Ghailani, accused of \n     participating in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in \n     Kenya, killing 212 people, has asked for that issue to be \n     briefed by the defense. Ghailani was indicted in 1998, \n     captured in Pakistan in 2004, and held at Guantanamo Bay \n     until 2009.\n       Additionally, federal rules risk that classified evidence \n     protected in military commissions would be exposed in \n     criminal trials, revealing intelligence sources and methods \n     and compromising foreign partners, who will be unwilling to \n     join with the United States in future secret or covert \n     operations if doing so will risk exposure in the dangerous \n     and hostile communities where they operate. This poses a \n     clear and present danger to the public. The safety and \n     security of the American people is the President's and \n     Congress's highest duty.\n       Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey recently wrote in \n     the Wall Street Journal that ``the challenges of terrorism \n     trials are overwhelming.'' Mr. Mukasey, formerly a federal \n     judge in the Southern District of New York, presided over the \n     multi-defendant terrorism prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abel \n     Rahman, the cell that attacked the World Trade Center in 1993 \n     and conspired to attack other New York landmarks. In addition \n     to the evidentiary problems cited above, he expressed concern \n     about courthouse and jail facility security, the need for \n     anonymous jurors to be escorted under armed guard, the \n     enormous costs associated with the use of U.S. marshals \n     necessarily deployed from other jurisdictions, and the danger \n     to the community which, he says, will become a target for \n     homegrown terrorist sympathizers or embedded Al Qaeda cells.\n       Finally, there is the sickening prospect of men like Khalid \n     Sheikh Mohammed being brought to the federal courthouse in \n     Lower Manhattan, or the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, \n     just a few blocks away from the scene of carnage eight years \n     ago, being given a Constitutionally mandated platform upon \n     which he can mock his victims, exult in the suffering of \n     their families, condemn the judge and his own lawyers, and \n     rally his followers to continue jihad against the men and \n     women of the U.S. military, fighting and dying in the sands \n     of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan on behalf of us all.\n       There is no guarantee that Mr. Mohammed and his co-\n     conspirators will plead guilty, as in the case of Zacarias \n     Moussaoui, whose prosecution nevertheless took four years, \n     and who is currently attempting to recant that plea. Their \n     attorneys will be given wide latitude to mount a defense that \n     turns the trial into a shameful circus aimed at vilifying \n     agents of the CIA for alleged acts of ``torture,'' casting \n     the American government and our valiant military as a force \n     of evil instead of a force for good in places of the Muslim \n     world where Al Qaeda and the Taliban are waging a brutal war \n     against them and the local populations. For the families of \n     those who died on September 11, the most obscene aspect of \n     giving Constitutional protections to those who planned the \n     attacks with the intent of inflicting maximum terror on their \n     victims in the last moments of their lives will be the \n     opportunities this affords defense lawyers to cast their \n     clients as victims.\n       Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-conspirators are asking \n     to plead guilty, now, before a duly-constituted military \n     commission. We respectfully ask members of Congress, why \n     don't we let them?\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       (Signed by 249 Family members).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11286-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11286-S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the sixth \nanniversary of what is known today as the Office of the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Six years ago, on November \n6, 2003, President Bush signed Public Law 108-106, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction \nof Iraq and Afghanistan. The reconstruction effort at the time was \nunder the direction of the Coalition Provisional Authority, CPA, and \nCongress, appropriately, provided for an Inspector General of the \nAuthority to oversee the CPA's expenditures.\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\n  As the administration moved toward ending the CPA and transferring \nsovereignty back to the Iraqi people through its interim government, it \nbecame clear that it was important to maintain oversight of the \nmultiagency reconstruction effort underway in Iraq. In Public Law 108-\n375, the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 2005, Congress decided to redesignate the CPA IG as the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, or SIGIR, with \nresponsibility for reviewing programs funded with amounts appropriated \nor otherwise made available for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \nFund.\n  The law provided, uniquely at the time, that the SIGIR report \ndirectly to both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, \nand that its quarterly reports be sent directly to the Congress.\n  As the reconstruction effort for Iraq grew in complexity Congress \nasked SIGIR to review additional funding streams; it is now responsible \nfor reviewing ``all funds appropriated or otherwise made available for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq.''\n  Since SIGIR reviews reconstruction funds expended by all agencies, it \ncan compare the effectiveness of different agencies' practices and \napproaches to related problems. In addition, the frequent \nreorganizations of the reconstruction effort and the widespread pattern \nof having some agencies carry out work on behalf of others has made \ncross-agency reviews critical to providing accountability for \nexpenditures. SIGIR has been able to provide precisely that type of \ncross-agency scrutiny.\n  SIGIR's productivity is notable. It has submitted 23 quarterly \nreports to Congress and published 4 ``lessoned learned'' reports, \nincluding the comprehensive account entitled ``Hard Lessons: The Iraq \nReconstruction Experience.'' It has issued 155 audit reports, 159 \nproject assessments, inspections, and 96 limited onsite assessments.\n  SIGIR's staff in Baghdad and Arlington, VA, produces timely, useful \nreporting to program managers, senior Department leadership, and \nCongress. Its quarterly reports present a comprehensive, closely \ndocumented, snapshot of the reconstruction effort and conditions on the \nground to provide context for understanding progress, or lack of \nprogress, in Iraq's reconstruction. In recent quarters, reports have \nincluded province-by-province descriptions of the status of \nreconstruction and the pace of political change. The audit and \ninspections groups work in ``real time,'' so that managers can improve \nprocesses quickly, often before reports are formally published.\n  SIGIR's reviews have been extremely useful to both the administration \nand Congress in assessing the many challenges of the reconstruction. \nThe performance by the SIGIR office has also been recognized by the \nCouncil of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, formerly the \nPresident's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, PCIE, for \ndemonstrating integrity, determination and courage in providing \nindependent oversight and unbiased review of U.S. reconstruction \nefforts in Iraq, and for exemplifying the highest ideals of government \nservices as envisioned by the tenets of the Inspector General Act.\n  SIGIR's auditors and investigators carry out their work under \ndangerous and difficult circumstances. Its employees in Baghdad, in \naddition to being separated from their families and living under \ndifficult conditions, are subject to considerable physical danger. Five \nhave been wounded by indirect fire. Today I would especially like to \npay tribute to SIGIR auditor Paul Converse, who died of wounds \nsustained in the Easter 2008 rocket attack on Baghdad's International \nZone. Mr. Converse made the ultimate sacrifice in service to his \ncountry.\n  As my colleagues know, the reconstruction effort in Iraq suffered \ninitially from uncoordinated and insufficient planning and has been \ncharacterized too often by poor contract oversight. The security \nsituation in Iraq also increased the complexity of executing \nreconstruction projects. From its audits of specific projects such as \nthe Basrah Children's Hospital and the Mosul Dam, to its broad reviews \nof thematic issues such as human capital management and contract \nadministration, the SIGIR reports have provided a frank look at, and a \nbetter understanding of, the shortcomings, the successes, and the \nchallenges of reconstruction.\n  So today I salute all the hard-working current and former staff of \nSIGIR, SIGIR's long-serving Deputy Inspector General, Ginger Cruz, and, \nof course, Stuart Bowen, who has ably served as the Special Inspector \nGeneral for 6 years. Their work has been extremely influential on the \nevolution of reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and undoubtedly will help \ninform future U.S. relief and reconstruction efforts. Their efforts are \ngreatly appreciated by this Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11287-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION AUTHORIZATION AND FUNDING ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nthat I introduced on Friday with Senator Bingaman--the Land and Water \nConservation Authorization and Funding Act of 2009--which would \nestablish permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nThis bill makes it certain that the funds available in the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund--LWCF--are not subject to the annual whims of \nCongress, but instead that these funds are available at a steady, \nreliable, certain level that will allow us to protect land and water \nwell into our future.\n  For over 30 years, the LWCF has been used to purchase lands from \nwilling sellers for the purposes of conservation. It is authorized at a \nspending level $900 million per year. However, Congress has rarely \napproved the full $900 million, and appropriations have varied widely. \nThe result is a program that sometimes moves forward in fits and starts \nrather than with a consistent level of investment from year to year.\n  Even with this situation, the LWCF is an incredibly successful and \nimportant program for our land conservation needs. In Montana, the LWCF \nhas funded the acquisition of key treasures such as the Sun Ranch in \nMadison County and the Iron Mask Ranch in Broadwater County. We have \nareas all over Montana in the pristine ecosystem of the Rocky Mountain \nFront that are standing in line, just waiting for LWCF funds to be \navailable.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer. We need to take steps today, \nthis Congress, to fix this long-standing problem and establish \npermanent funding for the LWCF to protect Montana's resources well into \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11287-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11287-S11288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WYOMING FARM BUREAU FEDERATION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Since its first meeting, the \nWyoming Farm Bureau Federation has advocated for Wyoming farm and ranch \nfamilies in local, State and Federal policy. The organization has been \na leader in advocating for low taxes, less government, multiple use, \nand most of all private property rights for generations. The Wyoming \nFarm Bureau Federation provides organization, resources, and service to \nour agriculture community.\n  Among the strengths of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation is the \norganization of the Farm Bureau Young Farmers & Ranchers Program. This \nprogram provides resources and leadership for men and women beginning \ntheir careers in agriculture. The program is laying the foundation for \nfuture leaders in Wyoming agriculture and our rural communities.\n  Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation serves as a reliable source of \nagriculture and business information in Wyoming. Many in Wyoming turn \nto Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation as the source for up-to-date \nagricultural news. The organization provides timely information and \nvaluable insight into current issues facing Wyoming and America.\n  Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation members will celebrate 90 years of \nservice at their annual meeting this week in Casper, WY. They will \nremember the pioneer spirit that brought together farmers and ranchers \nfrom Wyoming's counties 90 years ago. The foresight of those early \nmembers has allowed the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation to be the \nleading agriculture organization that it is today.\n  Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation has led the way to preserve individual\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nfreedoms and expand opportunities in agriculture for 90 years.

Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of \na very special resident of my home State of Alaska, former Anchorage \nMayor George Murray Sullivan.\n  Mayor George Murray Sullivan passed away September 23, 2009, after an \nextended battle with lung cancer.\n  Mayor George Sullivan was the embodiment of a true Alaskan. He was \nborn and raised in Valdez, honorably served in our Nation's Army, and \nassisted with the completion of the only road leading out of our State, \nthe Alaska Highway. As a devoted public servant, Mr. Sullivan served in \nthe Alaska Legislature and as mayor of Anchorage. Today, Alaskans are \ngrateful to this remarkable man for his guidance and pioneering spirit.\n  On behalf of his family and his many friends I ask we honor George \nSullivan's memory. I ask his obituary, published September 27, 2009, in \nthe Anchorage Daily News, be printed into the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n            [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 27, 2009]\n\n       Anchorage Mayor George Murray Sullivan, 87, died Sept. 23, \n     2009, surrounded by his family after a long battle with lung \n     cancer. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 11 a.m. Saturday \n     at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church. Burial will be at \n     the Anchorage Memorial Cemetery. George was born March 31, \n     1922, to Harvey and Viola Sullivan in Portland, Ore.\n       He was raised in Valdez with sisters Lillian and Marion, \n     and graduated salutatorian from Valdez High School in 1939. \n     His father Harvey was the U.S. district marshal and mother \n     Viola was the first woman mayor in Alaska. George had a \n     wonderful life as a kid in Valdez, playing many sports, \n     engaging in school activities and helping at the family \n     store. In 1937, at the age of 15, George was hired at the \n     Kennecott Mine, although the hiring age at the time was 16. \n     He was strong and eager, so he was put to work on the tram. \n     He navigated 750-pound ore buckets off the tram and into the \n     grizzly crusher for 10 hours a day, seven days a week. He \n     once estimated that he put in about 17 miles a day on the \n     job. In 1938, George drove trucks for the Alaska Road \n     Commission and hauled equipment and supplies to the workers \n     active in the Richardson Highway construction project.\n       He worked with the military troops to get the Alaska \n     Highway completed and transported military equipment to the \n     Tanacross airport for Bob Reeve to fly to the outlying bases. \n     In July 1944, George was drafted into the U.S. Army for two \n     years and was stationed at Adak in the Aleutian Islands. He \n     married the love of his life, Margaret Eagan Sullivan, on \n     Dec. 30, 1947, and moved to Nenana. George was the U.S. \n     deputy marshal and Margaret was the U.S. commissioner. Aptly, \n     George would catch the criminals and Margaret would try them. \n     In 1952, George worked for Al Ghezzi's Alaska Freight Lines, \n     trucking supplies to the DEW Line on the first ice road to \n     the North Slope. He worked for Garrison Fast Freight.\n       In 1955, he was elected to the Fairbanks City Council. \n     George took a job in management with Consolidated Freightways \n     and in 1959 moved the family to Anchorage, where he lived for \n     the next 50 years. In 1964, he was appointed by Gov. Bill \n     Egan to fill a vacant seat in the Alaska State Legislature. \n     He was in Juneau when the 1964 earthquake occurred; Margaret \n     was at home in Anchorage with seven children. George spent \n     many agonizing hours trying to get on a plane home to his \n     family. George finished his term in the Legislature and, in \n     1965, was elected to the Anchorage City Council. In 1967, he \n     ran a successful race to become Anchorage mayor, a position \n     he would hold for 15 years. Anchorage grew fast during those \n     years, spurred in large part by the oil boom. In 1975, voters \n     approved the unification of Anchorage's city and borough \n     governments and elected George its mayor. The creation of the \n     Municipality of Anchorage was an incredible undertaking. As \n     mayor, George successfully merged the duplicative \n     departments, boards, utilities. etc., into one government. \n     After unification, the state was awash with money from the \n     oil pipeline revenues. George and his administration had a \n     vision of what Anchorage could become and what was needed to \n     enhance the city's quality of life for its residents. He \n     worked hard to develop what was known as Project '80s.\n       George lobbied successfully in Juneau and received hundreds \n     of millions of dollars for construction of the Egan Civic and \n     Convention Center, Loussac Library, the Alaska Center for the \n     Performing Arts and the Sullivan Sports Arena. This moved \n     Anchorage into being a modern and vibrant community, which \n     enhanced economic and community growth in the Southcentral \n     area. George finished as mayor of Anchorage in 1982. He then \n     worked for Western Airlines as senior vice president. In \n     1986, he was a founding member of the Sullivan Group, a \n     consulting firm. He also worked as the legislative director \n     for Gov. Steve Cowper. He received an honorary doctorate from \n     the University of Alaska in public administration. George was \n     never one to stay still for too long and remained active in \n     community and state boards up until his illness in 2008.\n       Over the years he was active on the Enstar board, AWWU, \n     state PERS board, Anchorage Senior Center Endowment, TOTE \n     Advisory Board, Military Advisory Board, Anchorage Wellness \n     Court Alumni Group, Alaska Heart Association, Boys and Girls \n     Clubs and many more. He was always willing to lend a helping \n     hand to make Anchorage a little better for those less \n     fortunate or in need. He had a strong faith in the Roman \n     Catholic Church and often assisted at Mass and in the \n     church's organizations, the Knights of Columbus and Knights \n     and Ladies of the Holy Sepulcher. He was a member of the Elks \n     Club, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Pioneers of \n     Alaska. George had an incredible love for the community and \n     worked on many projects to enhance the quality of life for \n     all who called Anchorage home.\n       He was a true public servant and visionary who strived to \n     make Anchorage a better community for future generations \n     while he was mayor and during his retirement. George's family \n     said: ``Dad was blessed with a kind and generous heart. He \n     and Mom gave so much to their family and community. Dad had a \n     wonderful way with people. He was a great Alaskan with an \n     Irish charm and humor that would put people at ease when they \n     met him. He and Mom traveled extensively and held lifelong \n     friendships that spanned the globe. He loved people and never \n     forgot a name or face.''\n       George is survived by his sons, Timothy, Daniel (Lynnette), \n     Kevin, George Jr., Michael and Casey (Paige); and daughters, \n     Colleen (Ted Leonard) and Shannon (Christopher Adams). He is \n     also survived by grandchildren, Tim (Terrill), Conor (Carey), \n     Catherine and Moira Sullivan and their mother, Susan; \n     grandchildren, Kelly, Patrick (Julie) and Erin Sullivan and \n     their mother, Jean; grandchildren, Jennifer Sullivan; \n     Matthew, Adam, Molly and Bridget Glenn; Jared Leonard; Declan \n     and Shane Adams, and Tierney and Parker Sullivan; and six \n     great-grandchildren with one on the way. His is also survived \n     by sisters-in-law, Pat Franklin and Marge Eagan of Fairbanks; \n     and many nieces and nephews. George was preceded in death by \n     his parents, Harvey and Viola Sullivan; sisters, Marion and \n     Lillian; son, Harvey; and Margaret, his wife of 59 \n     years.\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11289-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING MYRON GORDON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I \nmark the passing of an important judicial figure in Wisconsin and a \ndear family friend, Myron Gordon.\n  Myron was a good friend of my father, Leon Feingold, for many years, \nand I was privileged to know him well myself. He was a man of so much \nintegrity, and I admired him tremendously, as my father did. In his \nobituary in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, people describe him as a \n``giant'' of the legal profession and the ``king of judges,'' and he \ntruly was.\n  His outstanding character served him well in his many years on the \nbench, on Milwaukee County Civil Court, the Milwaukee County Circuit \nCourt, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and, finally, the Eastern District \nof Wisconsin, where he served as a Federal judge until his retirement \nin 2001.\n  Myron had so many wonderful qualities that came through in his work. \nHe was very wise, and he was absolutely fairminded, refusing to play \nfavorites in the courtroom or be swayed by outside opinion. He was an \nexample for us all, and I am so glad that he was able to serve the \nState he loved so well for so many years. I was fortunate to know him, \nand Wisconsin is fortunate to have benefited from his lifetime of \nservice and his commitment to the public good. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11289-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LORRAINE ANDERSON\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute \nto a dedicated public servant, Ms. Lorraine Anderson, who on November \n9, 2009, is stepping down after 24 years on the Arvada City Council.\n  Lorraine has been a dedicated public servant who has served her \ncommunity of Arvada, CO, in innumerable ways and has developed a \nreputation across the Denver metropolitan area as a leader in the best \ntradition of bipartisanship and local government service. Her \nexperience and influence have also been recognized at the national \nlevel.\n  I got to know Lorraine while working on issues related to the cleanup \nand closure of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility near Arvada \nwhen I was a Congressman representing this area of Colorado. While she \nwas a strong advocate for a thorough cleanup of this site and a \ndefender of the interests of Arvada, she also worked in a collaborative \nspirit that was informed by heavy doses of practical common sense. As \nmany of my colleagues will recognize, these cleanups can be complex and \nthe process full of acronyms and scientific jargon. Lorraine would make \nsure that regulators and State and Federal officials spoke to the \npublic in plain English. She prized understanding and workable \nsolutions in the very complicated process of securing local agreement \non the cleanup process.\n  She was a valuable contributor to this process and helped make it a \nsuccess. It is the same approach that she brought to all of her public \nservice work.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight that work and her distinguished and \nimpressive record. She served six terms on the Arvada City Council \nbetween 1985 and 2009 and served as mayor pro tem many times over the \nspan of her time with the city. During this time, she also served on \nthe Arvada Planning Commission, was a founding member of both the \nArvada Clean Air Advisory Committee and the Arvada Economic Development \nAssociation, and served as a board member of the Forward Arvada \nBuilding Corporation.\n  On issues affecting the Denver metropolitan area, she served on the \nboard of the Colorado Municipal League from 1991 through 2005 and was \nthe president of that board in 2000. She also served on the board of \ndirectors of the Denver Regional Council of Governments from 1991 \nthrough 2007 and was chair of that organization in 2004. She served on \nthe Regional Air Quality Council from 1993 to 1997 and was president of \nColorado Women in Municipal Government from 1991 to 1993. And she \nserved on the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments and the Rocky \nFlats Stewardship Task Force Steering Committee.\n  On the national level, Lorraine served on the National League of \nCities board of directors from 2003 to 2005 and was a member of many of \nthe league's committees, including Energy, Environment, and Natural \nResources and the Clean Air Task Force, and was a board member of the \nEnergy Communities Alliance.\n  Lorraine is well-known throughout the Denver metropolitan region and \nis a tireless advocate for local governments in the metro area on \ngrowth policies, transportation, both highway and transit, public \nhealth, and environmental issues. She has not only worked actively and \neffectively with her local and State elected colleagues in the region, \nbut she has also advocated and educated her constituents on the \nimportance of their involvement in regional issues. She has been one of \nonly a handful of women who have served on the Arvada City Council, and \nshe is a role model for the community in this regard.\n  In addition to her public service, Lorraine is the retired co-owner \nof Anderson Tire Service, Inc., and served as president of the Mountain \nStates Tire Dealers Association in 1988, one of two women first elected \nto the board of directors and the first woman to serve as president of \nthat organization.\n  I know that the city of Arvada is sorry to see her step down. But I \nalso know that she will likely stay involved in the important issues \naffecting her city, region, State and Nation. I wish her all the best \nin her future endeavors and thank her for her proud service to her \ncommunity and Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11289-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11289-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11289-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT WAS DECLARED IN \n  EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938 ON NOVEMBER 14, 1994, AS RECEIVED DURING THE \n          ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON NOVEMBER 6, 2009--PM 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n   Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas, on December 23, 2008, a group of military officers \n     calling itself the National Council for Democracy and \n     Development (referred to in this preamble as the ``CNDD'') \n     seized power in a coup in Guinea, installed as interim \n     President Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, and promised to hold \n     elections;\n       Whereas, on September 28, 2009, tens of thousands of \n     unarmed opposition protesters met in and around an outdoor \n     stadium to protest statements made by Captain Camara that he \n     may run for president, after he said that he would not;\n       Whereas government security forces killed at least 157 \n     demonstrators, after opening fire on the crowd, and \n     brutalized and raped dozens of women openly in public;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, these killings \n     and assaults were part of a ``premeditated massacre'' in \n     which the ``level, frequency, and brutality of sexual \n     violence that took place at and after the protests strongly \n     suggests that it was part of a systematic attempt to \n     terrorize and humiliate the opposition, not just random acts \n     by rogue soldiers'';\n       Whereas, according to the humanitarian organization CARE, \n     ``What happened in Guinea is an outrage--and a stark reminder \n     of a larger epidemic of violence against women and girls \n     around the world.'';\n       Whereas members of the United Nations Security Council \n     condemned ``the violence that caused reportedly more than 150 \n     deaths and hundreds of wounded and other blatant violations \n     of human rights including rapes in public streets in broad \n     day light, and violence that led to the arrest of opposition \n     party leaders'';\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights characterized the events as a ``blood bath'' and \n     stated that they ``must not become part of the fabric of \n     impunity that has enveloped Guinea for decades'';\n       Whereas Amnesty International reports that violence against \n     women knows few bounds, and that ``in armed conflicts, \n     countless women and girls are raped and sexually abused by \n     security forces and opposition groups as an act of war, and \n     often face additional violence in refugee camps. Government \n     sponsored violence also exists in peacetime, with women \n     assaulted while in police custody, in prison, and at the \n     hands of any number of state actors.'' and that ``violence \n     against women is a violation of human rights that cannot be \n     justified by any political, religious, or cultural claim''; \n     and\n       Whereas, on October 16, 2009, United Nations Secretary-\n     General Ban Ki-moon announced the creation of an \n     international commission of inquiry to investigate the \n     events: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) deplores the rape and assault of women and the killing \n     of political protestors in Guinea, and calls for an immediate \n     cessation of violence, including gender-based violence and \n     targeted killings by security forces;\n       (2) strongly supports efforts by the United Nations \n     Security Council's commission of inquiry into the violence, \n     and calls for Captain Moussa Dadis Camara and the National \n     Council for Democracy and Development to abide by their \n     pledge to cooperate with the commission;\n       (3) urges the identification and prosecution, by the \n     appropriate authorities, of those responsible for \n     orchestrating or carrying out the violence in Guinea;\n       (4) urges President Barack Obama, in coordination with \n     leaders from the European Union and the African Union, to \n     seriously consider punitive measures that could be taken \n     against senior officials in Guinea found to be complicit in \n     the violence, in particular the atrocities perpetrated \n     against women and other gross human rights violations; and\n       (5) encourages President Obama to remain actively engaged \n     in the political situation in Guinea, to continue to convey \n     that the blatant abuse of women will not be tolerated, and to \n     continue supporting the efforts of the appointed facilitator, \n     President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, to pave a way \n     forward to credible elections.\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11293-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11293-S11294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 346--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT, AT THE \n      21ST REGULAR MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE \nCONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC TUNAS, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE \n   MANAGEMENT OF THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN BLUEFIN TUNA \n   FISHERY ADHERES TO THE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE STANDING \n  COMMITTEE ON RESEARCH AND STATISTICS AND HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF \n   ACHIEVING THE ESTABLISHED REBUILDING TARGET, PURSUE STRENGTHENED \n PROTECTIONS FOR SPAWNING BLUEFIN POPULATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA \n    TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERY OF THE ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA, PURSUE \n   IMPOSITION OF MORE STRINGENT MEASURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BY ALL \n   MEMBERS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF \n    ATLANTIC TUNAS' CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR \nATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA AND OTHER SPECIES, AND ENSURE THAT UNITED STATES' \nQUOTAS OF TUNA AND SWORDFISH ARE NOT REALLOCATED TO OTHER NATIONS, AND \n                           FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nWhitehouse, and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 346\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna and Atlantic swordfish are \n     valuable historical commercial and recreational fisheries of \n     the United States and many other countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic \n     swordfish and other Atlantic highly migratory species in the \n     Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent seas, including the \n     Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas the United States has established for its fisheries \n     a strict regime of conservation, management and compliance \n     for Atlantic highly migratory species and protected living \n     marine resources caught incidentally to such fisheries that \n     is unmatched by other fishing nations;\n       Whereas the reallocation of United States quotas of \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna and Atlantic swordfish to other nations \n     will cause severe economic impacts, including a loss of \n     United States jobs, and undermine the conservation of \n     populations of protected living marine resources such as \n     Atlantic billfish species, endangered sea turtles, sea birds \n     and marine mammals caught incidentally in the fisheries of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin stocks, \n     with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific advice intended to prevent \n     overfishing, rebuild and maintain bluefin tuna populations at \n     levels that will permit the maximum sustainable yield, and \n     ensure the future sustainability of the stocks, the total \n     allowable catch quotas have consistently been set at levels \n     significantly higher than the recommended levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     minimum sizes for Atlantic bluefin tuna with which the United \n     States has fully complied, the Standing Committee on Research \n     and Statistics has repeatedly expressed grave concerns that \n     the flagrant lack of compliance with such size limits by \n     Members fishing in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is \n     seriously undermining the effectiveness of the Commission's \n     bluefin tuna recovery plans;\n       Whereas despite the ongoing establishment by the Commission \n     of fishing quotas for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna fishery that surpass scientific recommendations, \n     compliance with such quotas by parties to the Convention that \n     harvest that stock has been extremely poor, with harvests \n     exceeding the scientific advice by more than 50 percent in \n     recent years as reported by the Standing Committee on \n     Research and Statistics and other independent sources \n     monitoring the fishery;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics resulting from \n     inadequate or non-existent catch monitoring and observer \n     programs has frequently undermined efforts by the Commission \n     to determine the levels of overharvests by specific \n     countries;\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing for \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas it is widely recognized that some fishing vessels, \n     in particular those participating in illegal, unregulated, \n     and unreported fishing, have little incentive to cease these \n     infractions due to a lack of adequate sanctions;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2008 stock assessment that the \n     fishing mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock was more than 3 times the level that \n     would permit the stock to stabilize at the maximum \n     sustainable catch level and that unless fishing mortality \n     rates are substantially reduced in the near future, further \n     reduction in spawning stock biomass is likely to occur \n     leading to a risk of fisheries and stock collapse;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics has recommended that the annual harvest levels for \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna be reduced to \n     levels between 15,000 and 8,500 metric tons to halt the \n     decline of the resource and initiate rebuilding, and \n     indicated that a total allowable catch of 8,500 has a higher \n     probability of rebuilding the stock within the Commission's \n     established time frame;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), which was amended in \n     2008, containing a wide range of management, monitoring, and \n     control measures designed to facilitate the recovery of the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock by the \n     year 2023;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and continuing \n     information and repeated warnings by the Standing Committee \n     on Research and Statistics indicate that current \n     implementation of the plan is unlikely to achieve its goals;\n       Whereas the Principality of Monaco has submitted a petition \n     to list Atlantic bluefin tuna under Appendix I of the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Fauna and Flora, and while the United States did not \n     cosponsor this petition, the Administration has expressed its \n     support for this petition unless the Commission ``adopts \n     significantly strengthened management and compliance \n     measures'' for countries fishing on the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     including a closure to directed fishing in the spawning \n     grounds of the Gulf of Mexico, and these recommendations have \n     been fully implemented by Nations fishing west of 45 degrees \n     west longitude;\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very \n     low, especially for the United States;\n       Whereas scientific evidence now provides indisputable \n     evidence from electronic tagging studies and other scientific \n     research that mixing of the eastern and western Atlantic \n     bluefin tuna stocks occurs throughout the Atlantic ocean on \n     feeding and fishing grounds, and the poor management and \n     noncompliance with the Commission's Recovery Plan for the \n     eastern Atlantic stock is having an adverse impact on the \n     western Atlantic stock and United States fisheries;\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks, which will assist in the \n     conservation, recovery, and management of the species \n     throughout its range;\n       Whereas a 2008 Independent Review of the Commission \n     concluded that the Commission's management of bluefin tuna in \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean has been ``widely \n     regarded as an international disgrace'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States delegation to the 21st Regular Meeting of the \n     International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \n     Tunas, should--\n       (1) seek the adoption of all revisions to the Recovery Plan \n     for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna that will \n     conform the Plan to the scientific advice provided by the \n     Standing Committee on Research and Statistics and has a high \n     probability of achieving the established rebuilding target \n     within the established time frame, including a strict penalty \n     regime and other appropriate mechanisms to verify and ensure \n     compliance;\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\n       (2) seek to expand time and area closures of spawning areas \n     in the Mediterranean in full conformity with the scientific \n     advice provided by the Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics;\n       (3) pursue the continued aggressive review and assessment \n     by the Commission's Committee on Compliance of compliance \n     with conservation and management measures, including data \n     collection and reporting requirements, adopted by the \n     Commission and in effect for the 2009 eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, occurring east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, and other fisheries that are subject \n     to the jurisdiction of the Commission;\n       (4) aggressively seek to address noncompliance with such \n     measures by all parties to the Convention through all \n     appropriate actions;\n       (5) pursue the commitment by the Commission and its parties \n     to fund additional research on both the western Atlantic and \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stocks \n     including but not limited to the extent to which the stocks \n     mix; and\n       (6) strenuously defend the interests of United States with \n     regard to Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic swordfish, and \n     other species managed by the Commission, including the \n     protection of U.S. quota shares.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11294-1",

We will continue to work on a finite list of \namendments remaining to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations bill.\n  In view of the memorial service in Texas, there will be no rollcall \nvotes tomorrow. We have tried to be more definite. I have had a number \nof Senators who have said they would go if there were no votes. I could \nnot earlier today give them any indication that there would be no \nvotes, but I think at this stage, with the memorial service in Texas \ntaking place and a number of Senators wanting to go, we will have no \nvotes tomorrow. There was some consideration that we would do it after \nthey get back, but we have Veterans Day the next day, so we are going \nto have no votes until next Monday, a week from today. We will continue \nto work on the health care legislation and other things that are going \nto make that week prior to Thanksgiving extremely eventful.\n  The regular caucus lunch will be held tomorrow, the Democratic lunch \nat the usual location. President Clinton will be at that lunch to talk \nto us about health care and certainly he is someone who knows a lot \nabout health care. The Democratic Members are encouraged to attend the \ncaucus luncheon tomorrow. As we know, it starts at 12:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11298-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11298-S11299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 530, the \nnomination of David Gompert, to be Principal Deputy Director of \nNational Intelligence; that the nomination be confirmed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; that no further motions be in \norder; that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the \nRecord; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\n            office of the director of national intelligence\n\n       David C. Gompert, of Virginia, to be Principal Deputy \n     Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Mr. David \nC. Gompert to be the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence \nand urge my colleagues to support this nomination. The Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence unanimously approved Mr. Gompert's nomination \nby voice vote on October 29.\n  The Principal Deputy DNI is an extremely important position that has \ntwo main responsibilities: 1: to assist the DNI, and 2: to act on \nbehalf of the DNI in his absence or due to a vacancy in the position.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Blair, has made clear \nto me and to the committee his strong desire to have Mr. Gompert in \nplace to carry out his duties. In fact, Director Blair's predecessor, \nAdmiral Mike McConnell, told the Committee when he was in office that \ncarrying out the DNI function requires a strong and able deputy, and \nthat a lengthy vacancy in the PD-DNI positions was a major problem \nduring his tenure.\n  Mr. Gompert has made clear that he will assist Director Blair by \nserving as the lead intelligence official in many policymaking areas, \nincluding the numerous National Security Council meetings in which \nintelligence assessments play a key role.\n  He will also have an important role to play in assuring that the \nNational Intelligence Program, which was recently disclosed to account \nfor $49.8 billion in fiscal year 2009, is managed well and provides to \nthe American public the intelligence capability required to keep the \nnation safe and its policymakers well informed.\n  Especially given Mr. Gompert's role in the private sector, the \ncommittee will look to him to import and insist on strong management \npractices to reign in troubled acquisitions, improve information \nsharing, and help run our intelligence apparatus as a true community \nand not just a collection of agencies.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Gompert will be the third principal deputy DNI \nsince Congress created the position in 2004. As I mentioned previously, \nthe position has been unfilled for much of the time, so I am pleased \nthat the President has nominated Mr. Gompert and I am also pleased he \nwill be confirmed quickly.\n  Mr. Gompert was nominated by President Obama on August 6, 2009--the \nday before Congress broke for the August Recess. After going through \nthe pre-hearing procedures, the Senate Intelligence Committee held a \nconfirmation hearing on the nomination on October 13, 2009. As part of \nthe confirmation process, Mr. Gompert was asked to complete a committee \nquestionnaire, pre-hearing questions, and post-hearing questions for \nthe record. The answers provided by Mr. Gompert have all been posted to \nour committee website.\n  From my meeting with Mr. Gompert and based on his answers to the \nquestions put to him by members of the Intelligence Committee, I can \nsay that Mr. Gompert has proven that he will be an excellent addition \nto help the Office of the Director of National Intelligence carry out \nall of its important responsibilities and to make continued reforms. \nHis responses to our questions have been thoughtful and thorough.\n  Mr. Gompert has almost 40 years of experience as a national security \nprofessional and information technology company executive. He has also \nserved as a national security analyst in senior White House and State \nDepartment positions.\n  Most recently, Mr. Gompert has worked in the Office of the Director \nof National Intelligence--ODNI--on a short-term assignment to evaluate \nhow the ODNI's mission managers are working in practice. In that \ninformal role, Mr. Gompert worked to identify what additional measures \ncan be taken to facilitate mission management and other forms of cross-\nagency teaming of analysts and intelligence collectors.\n  Before his service at the ODNI, Mr. Gompert was a Senior Fellow at \nthe RAND Corporation. Prior to this he was Distinguished Research \nProfessor at the Center for Technology and National Security Policy at \nthe National Defense University.\n  In 2003 he was a senior advisor for National Security and Defense to \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.\n  He has also been on the faculty of the RAND Pardee Graduate School, \nthe United States Naval Academy, and the National Defense University.\n  Mr. Gompert served as President of RAND Europe from 2000 to 2003, \nduring which period he was on the RAND Europe Executive Board and the \nchairman of RAND Europe-UK. He was vice president of RAND and director \nof the National Defense Research Institute from 1993 to 2000.\n  From 1990 to 1993, Mr. Gompert served as special assistant to \nPresident George H. W. Bush and senior director for Europe and Eurasia \non the National Security Council staff. He has held a number of \npositions at the State Department, including deputy to the Under \nSecretary for Political Affairs, 1982-83; deputy assistant secretary \nfor European Affairs, 1981-82; deputy director of the Bureau of \nPolitical-Military Affairs, 1977-81; and special assistant to Secretary \nof State Henry Kissinger, 1973-75.\n  Mr. Gompert worked as an executive in the private sector from 1983-\n1990, when he held executive positions at Unisys and at AT\n  At Unisys, 1989-90, he was president of the Systems Management Group \nand vice president for Strategic Planning and Corporate Development. At \nAT, 1983-1989, he was vice president, civil sales and programs, and \ndirector of international market planning.\n  Mr. Gompert holds a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from \nthe United States Naval Academy and a Master of Public Affairs degree \nfrom the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University.\n  In sum, Mr. Gompert will be an asset to the Intelligence Community \nbecause he has worked at the intersection of intelligence and policy \nfor much of his career.\n  His background has provided good management experience and a unique \nperspective on how to address the challenges lying ahead for the \nIntelligence Community.\n  I look forward to the Senate approving Mr. Gompert's nomination and I \nyield the Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11299-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the following postal naming \nbills en bloc: Calendar Nos. 198 through 207: H.R. 955, H.R. 1516, H.R. \n1713, H.R. 2004, H.R. 2215, H.R. 2760, H.R. 2972, H.R. 3119, H.R. 3386, \nand H.R. 3547.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the bills en bloc.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will make a brief comment. I had the good \nfortune of serving with Wes Watkins, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives from Oklahoma. It is a very good thing that there is \ngoing to be a building named after him.\n  Finally, Rex Lee was my neighbor when I first came back to Congress. \nHis son and my boy Josh were best friends. They still are. Rex Lee was \none of America's all-time great legal minds. He argued numerous cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. He was stricken as a young man with an \nincurable type of cancer and died at a much too early age. He was first \ndean of the BYU Law School and then president of BYU. His No. 1 \nqualification was his legal mind, which was outstanding, and he had \nsuch a wonderful family. I think that is wonderful that there is going \nto be a building named after Rex Lee in Provo, UT. He deserves that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Rex E. Lee, \na man whose legacy we recognize today by renaming the post office in \nProvo, UT in his honor. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Conner \ncaptured my own feelings about Rex when she said:\n\n       Knowing him [Rex] was one of the greatest privileges of my \n     life. Remembering him will be one of the easiest.\n\n  Graduating first in his class from the University of Chicago Law \nSchool in 1963, Rex went on to serve as a law clerk for Byron White on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Then, just 4 years out of law school, Rex \nargued his first case before the Supreme Court in 1967, and went on in \n1972 to become the Founding Dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School at \nBrigham Young University.\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\n  In addition to serving as an Assistant Attorney General in charge of \nthe Civil Division at the Department of Justice in the middle of the \n1970s, Rex served as the Solicitor General of the United States from \n1981 to 1985. In fact, over the span of his life, Rex argued 59 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and his record as the \nSolicitor General is impressive. Never one to rest, Rex was then named \nas the 10th president of Brigham Young University in 1989, where he \nserved thousands of students, faculty, and administrators faithfully \nfor over 6 years. As a man, Rex is someone I respected; as a dedicated \nhusband, father, and friend, Rex is someone who is deeply missed.\n  Anyone who had the privilege of knowing Rex, as I did, well remembers \nhis stellar service to his community, our State, and to the Nation as a \nwhole. Long after his passing, his influence still lingers and is \nkeenly felt everywhere from the classrooms at BYU to the corridors of \nour government's most revered institutions. Renaming the Provo Post \nOffice in Rex's honor befits a public servant of his stature, and I am \npleased to support this legislation in the Senate to honor Rex's \nlegacy.\n  In short, Rex Lee was a great man and I am proud to see the Provo \nPost Office named after him. There are thousands of Utahns throughout \nthe State who join me in celebrating this man's great life with this \nfitting tribute.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the bills be read the third \ntime and passed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc; and that any statements related to these bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11300-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOHN ``BUD'' HAWK POST OFFICE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 955) to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 10355 Northeast Valley Road in Rollingbay, \nWashington, as the ``John `Bud' Hawk Post Office,'' was ordered to a \nthird reading, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11300-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SERGEANT MARCUS MATHES POST OFFICE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 1516) to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 37926 Church Street in Dade City, Florida, as \nthe ``Sergeant Marcus Mathes Post Office,'' was ordered to a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11300-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRESSMAN WESLEY ``WES'' WATKINS POST OFFICE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 1713) to name the South Central Agricultural Research \nLaboratory of the Department of Agriculture in Lane, Oklahoma, and the \nfacility of the United States Postal Service located at 310 North Perry \nStreet in Bennington, Oklahoma, in honor of former Congressman Wesley \n``Wes'' Watkins was ordered to a third reading, read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11300-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AKRON VETERANS MEMORIAL POST OFFICE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 2004) to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 4282 Beach Street in Akron, Michigan, as the \n``Akron Veterans Memorial Post Office,'' was ordered to a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11300-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JOHN J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 346) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 346\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna and Atlantic swordfish are \n     valuable historical commercial and recreational fisheries of \n     the United States and many other countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic \n     swordfish and other Atlantic highly migratory species in the \n     Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent seas, including the \n     Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas the United States has established for its fisheries \n     a strict regime of conservation, management and compliance \n     for Atlantic highly migratory species and protected living \n     marine resources caught incidentally to such fisheries that \n     is unmatched by other fishing nations;\n       Whereas the reallocation of United States quotas of \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna and Atlantic swordfish to other nations \n     will cause severe economic impacts, including a loss of \n     United States jobs, and undermine the conservation of \n     populations of protected living marine resources such as \n     Atlantic billfish species, endangered sea turtles, sea birds \n     and marine mammals caught incidentally in the fisheries of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin stocks, \n     with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific advice intended to prevent \n     overfishing, rebuild and maintain bluefin tuna populations at \n     levels that will permit the maximum sustainable yield, and \n     ensure the future sustainability of the stocks, the total \n     allowable catch quotas have consistently been set at levels \n     significantly higher than the recommended levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     minimum sizes for Atlantic bluefin tuna with which the United \n     States has fully complied, the Standing Committee on Research \n     and Statistics has repeatedly expressed grave concerns that \n     the flagrant lack of compliance with such size limits by \n     Members fishing in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is \n     seriously undermining the effectiveness of the Commission's \n     bluefin tuna recovery plans;\n       Whereas despite the ongoing establishment by the Commission \n     of fishing quotas for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna fishery that surpass scientific recommendations, \n     compliance with such quotas by parties to the Convention that \n     harvest that stock has been extremely poor, with harvests \n     exceeding the scientific advice by\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n     more than 50 percent in recent years as reported by the \n     Standing Committee on Research and Statistics and other \n     independent sources monitoring the fishery;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics resulting from \n     inadequate or non-existent catch monitoring and observer \n     programs has frequently undermined efforts by the Commission \n     to determine the levels of overharvests by specific \n     countries;\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing for \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas it is widely recognized that some fishing vessels, \n     in particular those participating in illegal, unregulated, \n     and unreported fishing, have little incentive to cease these \n     infractions due to a lack of adequate sanctions;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2008 stock assessment that the \n     fishing mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock was more than 3 times the level that \n     would permit the stock to stabilize at the maximum \n     sustainable catch level and that unless fishing mortality \n     rates are substantially reduced in the near future, further \n     reduction in spawning stock biomass is likely to occur \n     leading to a risk of fisheries and stock collapse;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics has recommended that the annual harvest levels for \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna be reduced to \n     levels between 15,000 and 8,500 metric tons to halt the \n     decline of the resource and initiate rebuilding, and \n     indicated that a total allowable catch of 8,500 has a higher \n     probability of rebuilding the stock within the Commission's \n     established time frame;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), which was amended in \n     2008, containing a wide range of management, monitoring, and \n     control measures designed to facilitate the recovery of the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock by the \n     year 2023;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and continuing \n     information and repeated warnings by the Standing Committee \n     on Research and Statistics indicate that current \n     implementation of the plan is unlikely to achieve its goals;\n       Whereas the Principality of Monaco has submitted a petition \n     to list Atlantic bluefin tuna under Appendix I of the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Fauna and Flora, and while the United States did not \n     cosponsor this petition, the Administration has expressed its \n     support for this petition unless the Commission ``adopts \n     significantly strengthened management and compliance \n     measures'' for countries fishing on the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     including a closure to directed fishing in the spawning \n     grounds of the Gulf of Mexico, and these recommendations have \n     been fully implemented by Nations fishing west of 45 degrees \n     west longitude;\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very \n     low, especially for the United States;\n       Whereas scientific evidence now provides indisputable \n     evidence from electronic tagging studies and other scientific \n     research that mixing of the eastern and western Atlantic \n     bluefin tuna stocks occurs throughout the Atlantic ocean on \n     feeding and fishing grounds, and the poor management and \n     noncompliance with the Commission's Recovery Plan for the \n     eastern Atlantic stock is having an adverse impact on the \n     western Atlantic stock and United States fisheries;\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks, which will assist in the \n     conservation, recovery, and management of the species \n     throughout its range;\n       Whereas a 2008 Independent Review of the Commission \n     concluded that the Commission's management of bluefin tuna in \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean has been ``widely \n     regarded as an international disgrace'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States delegation to the 21st Regular Meeting of the \n     International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \n     Tunas, should--\n       (1) seek the adoption of all revisions to the Recovery Plan \n     for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna that will \n     conform the Plan to the scientific advice provided by the \n     Standing Committee on Research and Statistics and has a high \n     probability of achieving the established rebuilding target \n     within the established time frame, including a strict penalty \n     regime and other appropriate mechanisms to verify and ensure \n     compliance;\n       (2) seek to expand time and area closures of spawning areas \n     in the Mediterranean in full conformity with the scientific \n     advice provided by the Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics;\n       (3) pursue the continued aggressive review and assessment \n     by the Commission's Committee on Compliance of compliance \n     with conservation and management measures, including data \n     collection and reporting requirements, adopted by the \n     Commission and in effect for the 2009 eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, occurring east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, and other fisheries that are subject \n     to the jurisdiction of the Commission;\n       (4) aggressively seek to address noncompliance with such \n     measures by all parties to the Convention through all \n     appropriate actions;\n       (5) pursue the commitment by the Commission and its parties \n     to fund additional research on both the western Atlantic and \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stocks \n     including but not limited to the extent to which the stocks \n     mix; and\n       (6) strenuously defend the interests of United States with \n     regard to Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic swordfish, and \n     other species managed by the Commission, including the \n     protection of U.S. quota shares.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/09/senate-section/article/S11302-1",
