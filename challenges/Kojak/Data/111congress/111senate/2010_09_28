Madam President, as I came into the Chamber, I saw my \nfriend Arlen Specter standing behind me. There will be other times I \nwill say more about Arlen Specter, but I think it is appropriate to say \na few words today about Arlen Specter. After the beginning of the year, \nhe will no longer be with us as a Senator.\n  I have followed very closely his career. I have read his book--he has \nwritten a number, but I read the book about his life--and it was \nfascinating, about his prosecutorial skills in Pennsylvania.\n  We all know of his academic approach to the law in the Senate. When \nhe comes to the floor, he is someone who speaks after having given \nserious, long thought to what he was going to talk about, as I am sure \nhe will today. I have spoken in recent days with him at great length \nabout something he strongly believes in; that is, making the Supreme \nCourt something the American people can identify with by having cameras \nin and watching the arguments before the Supreme Court, not having to \nread a stale transcript but listen to the give-and-take of the lawyers \nand the Court.\n  As I said, I will have a lot more to say about Arlen Specter at some \ntime in the future, but I have appreciated his astute awareness of the \nlaw and his being so good to me. It doesn't matter whether he is a \nDemocrat or a Republican, he is a Senator who I think is exemplary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7565-8", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the American people have been \nspeaking out for a year and a half. They have wanted Democrats in \nWashington to focus on the economy and on jobs. What they got instead \nwas a budget\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nthat explodes the national debt, a $1 trillion stimulus that failed to \nhold unemployment down to the levels we were told it would, a health \nspending bill that is already leading to higher costs, and a raft of \nother bills that expand Washington's role in people's lives.\n  With just 3 days left in the Democrat's 2-year experiment in expanded \ngovernment, they want to make a good last impression with a bill they \nknow has no chance of passing and which they have no interest in \npassing. So this is about as pure a political exercise as you can get. \nIn my view, it is an insult to the millions of Americans who want us to \nfocus on jobs.\n  Democrats made a very clear choice. They chose to ignore the concerns \nof the American people and to press ahead with their own agenda over \nthe past year and a half. In the last 3 days of the session, they have \ndecided they can at least pretend to be concerned. This is nothing \nshort of patronizing. But in some ways it is the perfect way to end a \nsession in which the American people have taken a backseat to the \nDemocrats' big government agenda.\n  As for the specifics of this bill, even if this were a serious \nexercise, it is a bad idea. Even the Democratic chairman of the Finance \nCommittee said this bill could hurt American competitiveness. As a \nnumber of my colleagues pointed out yesterday, the way to get U.S. \nbusinesses to produce more here isn't to tax them even further, it is \nto stop punishing them with our high corporate tax rate. If American \nbusinesses are going to compete with foreign corporations, we should \nhave competitive tax rates. It is that simple.\n  Moreover, the companies this bill targets, by and large, are not \nopening overseas subsidiaries to make products for Americans. They are \nmoving overseas to serve foreign markets in addition to the markets \nthey already have in place, and that creates jobs right here in the \nUnited States. When these additional markets overseas are opened, it \ncreates jobs right here in the United States.\n  This bill is not a serious attempt to address a problem. It is a \npurely political exercise aimed at making a good impression. \nUnfortunately for Democrats, the impression they have made over the \npast year and a half has stuck--and for good reason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7566-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, at 1 o'clock this afternoon our dear \nfriend, Ted Stevens, will be laid to rest, with honors, across the \nriver at Arlington National Cemetery. So the Senate will be thinking of \nTed Stevens today.\n  Ted was a legend in his own lifetime and the American people would \nhave remembered him even if he had not gone on to serve as the longest \nserving Republican in Senate history. A recipient of the Air Medal and \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in the Army Air Corps \nduring World War II, Ted was, during his earliest days, an adventurer, \na fighter, and a patriot. He lived an incredibly full life, most of it \nin service to his Nation and more specifically to his State.\n  His colleagues in the Senate admired and even sometimes feared him, \nbut Alaskans loved him without any qualification. To them he was just \n``Uncle Ted,'' a title I am sure will live on.\n  I have been to Alaska a number of times over the years at Ted's \ninvitation and one of the things that becomes clear to anyone who goes \nup there, as I said at Ted's funeral last month, is that Alaska \nironically is a pretty small place--in the sense that everybody seems \nto know each other, and everybody knew Ted Stevens. From the airport in \nAnchorage to the remotest villages, Ted is omnipresent up there. That \nis saying something in a State that is bigger than California, Texas, \nand Montana combined.\n  The reason is simple: In Ted's view, if it wasn't good for Alaska, it \nwasn't good. He devoted his entire adult life to a simple mission, to \nwork tirelessly and unapologetically to transform Alaska into a modern \nState. He was faithful to that mission to the very end. It is hard to \nimagine that any one man ever meant more to any one State than Ted \nStevens.\n  One of the stories I like about Ted is the one about his former chief \nof staff and his first trip to Alaska with Ted. When he showed up at \nTed's house to pick him up at 6 o'clock in the morning, Ted had already \ngone through the briefing book he had been given the night before, read \nall the daily papers, and had already been on the phone to Washington \nfor a couple hours. By the end of the trip, he said he needed a \nvacation after doing, for 2 weeks, what Ted had been doing for 39 \nyears.\n  But Ted would always say he worked so hard because there was always \nso much work to do. Part of that, of course, was making sure that all \nof us knew about what Alaska and Alaskans needed. So everybody got \ninvited up there--not necessarily because he liked you but because he \nwanted us to appreciate the unique challenges Alaskans faced day in and \nday out, and turning down an invitation from Ted Stevens was not \nrecommended.\n  Ted poured himself into Alaska and he poured himself into the Senate. \nHe mentored countless young men and women who worked for him over the \nyears. He mentored countless new Members from both parties.\n  It was an honor to have known him, and it was a privilege to have \nserved alongside him in the Senate for so long.\n  We have missed him the past 2 years, and we honor him again today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7566-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to join in \npaying tribute to Senator Ted Stevens, who was in this Chamber from \n1967 until early 2009, and his presence is still felt, so pervasive was \nhis impact on this body.\n  My first contact with Senator Stevens was shortly after my election, \nwhen I was in the process of selecting my committee assignments. I had \nsaid during the campaign that I would seek the Agriculture Committee, \nbut when the first round came up and there was a spot left on \nAppropriations, I decided that was the best committee to select for the \ninterests of my State.\n  I did not get the Ag Committee. Appropriations has a subcommittee, Ag \nAppropriations, and it was filled. But Ted Stevens generously opened \nthe spot, taking another subcommittee assignment so I could maintain, \nin part, my statement that I would seek influence on the agricultural \nissues.\n  Ted Stevens had a reputation for being tough and demanding. He had a \nfamous Hulk tie which I proudly have in my closet and wear on occasions \nwhen it is appropriate. But behind that tough exterior, there was a \nheart of gold and a very emotional man. He said that he did not lose \nhis temper, he would ``use'' his temper, that he did not lose his \ntemper, he always knew where it was.\n  I recall one session of the Senate in the middle of the night. During \nHoward Baker's term as majority leader, he would sometimes have all-\nnight sessions. It is amazing how much you can get done and how short \nthe debate is at 3 a.m. An issue had arisen as to residency. I believe \nit was Bill Proxmire who had made some statements about living in \nWashington, DC. That infuriated Ted Stevens, and he rose, and in a \nloud, bombastic, explosive voice, he said he did not live in \nWashington, he lived in Alaska, and because of his affection for \nAlaska, he could not consider living in Washington. This was part-time \nduty to handle a specific job.\n  In 1984 after the elections, Senator Baker retired, and the Senate \nleadership was up. At that time, we had the most hotly contested battle \nfor leadership during my tenure here and perhaps of all time. There \nwere five top-notch candidates: Senator Stevens, Senator Dole, Senator \nMcClure, Senator Domenici, and Senator Lugar. It finally boiled down to \nBob Dole and Ted Stevens, and Bob Dole won, 28 to 25. When the vote was \ntaken, I happened to be sitting with Senator Dole.\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nWe had lived in the same town--Russell, KS--and had been friends for \ndecades. When Ted Stevens came over to congratulate Bob Dole, I was in \nthe picture--a photo I prize until this day.\n  Senate leadership elections are complex, and there was later \nconsideration that perhaps Bob Dole's leaving the leadership of the \nFinance Committee opened the door for Bob Packwood, whose vote was for \nDole, and perhaps Senator Packwood's leaving the leadership of the \nCommerce Committee chairman opened it up for Jack Danforth. That was a \nwatershed election.\n  Senator Stevens and I did not always agree on matters, such as the \noutcome of the Iran Contra matters, but there was also a collegiality \nand cordiality. I was the beneficiary of one of the famous Alaska trips \nwith Ted Stevens. I caught a king salmon, 29 pounds--toughest 15 \nminutes of my life--and it hangs on a shelf. The stuffed salmon hangs \nproudly in my Senate office. Great fish to eat. They have ways of \npreserving the carcass so that you can stuff it. You can have your fish \nand eat it too.\n  Ted Stevens was a mentor. During the Alcee Hastings impeachment \nproceedings, where I was cochairman of the committee assigned to hear \nthe evidence and later making a floor speech, I thought there ought to \nbe a standard for impeachment. Ted Stevens wisely counseled me against \nthat. He said: Don't do that. Don't try to establish some standard. It \nis a matter of each Senator's individual judgment. And when the \nimpeachment proceeding of President Clinton came up, Ted Stevens was \none of the 10 dissenters. He voted no on one of the bills of \nimpeachment.\n  During the course of Ted Stevens' problems with the Department of \nJustice and the investigation, I talked to him about those matters, \nsome of the implications in the criminal law case. I responded to an \ninquiry shortly before the 2008 election, was on Alaska radio \ncautioning the voters not to consider Ted Stevens a convict because the \ncase was in midstream and there were very, very serious questions which \nhad to be adjudicated, and I said I didn't know all of the details, but \nI had reviewed enough of the file to know that it was an open question. \nDuring the confirmation hearings of Attorney General Eric Holder, when \nwe had our private talks--I was then ranking--I called the issue to his \nattention, and he promised to make a thorough review and later did so. \nAnd the rest is history. Ted Stevens was exonerated and the issue was \ndismissed.\n  After that event took place, I was talking to Larry Burton, who \nworked years ago for Ted Stevens, a squash-playing partner of mine. A \nfew of us crafted a resolution honoring Ted Stevens and saying what a \ntremendous force he had been here, but we were asked by the lawyers to \nhold up because some action might be pending in the Department of \nJustice, so that should be delayed.\n  Today, we will lay Ted Stevens to rest, and with him a really great \nAmerican. His family--Catherine, a devoted wife, an outstanding lawyer, \na great public servant in her own right as an assistant U.S. attorney. \nWhen my class was elected in 1980, their daughter Lily was an infant, \nand she grew up in the Senate and now is a fine young woman, is a \npracticing attorney, and is now 30 years old. And Catherine, Joan, Ted, \nand I spent many pleasant evenings over a martini and a dinner and some \nof Ted Stevens' really great red wine.\n  He was extraordinary in his devotion to his State, and no Senator has \never done more for their State than Ted Stevens did for Alaska. So he \nleaves a great record, a great reputation, and he will be sorely \nmissed.\n  In the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber seeking \nrecognition, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7567-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7567-S7569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A GRIDLOCKED CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mainstream Americans must march to the polls this \nNovember to express themselves forcefully to stop extremists financed \nby undisclosed contributors from stifling our democracy. The Congress \nis gridlocked, leaving the Nation's business floundering. Fringe \ncandidates with highly questionable competency are winning primary \nelections. Moderates and some conservatives are falling because they \nfail the test of ideological purity.\n  In the past 10 years, both parties have taken advantage of procedural \nrules-gimmicks to thwart needed congressional action. During the \nadministration of President George W. Bush, Democrats mounted so many \nfilibusters against judicial nominations that the Senate was on the \nverge of changing an important rule requiring 60 votes to cut off \ndebate. During the Obama administration, Republicans have exceeded the \nprior extremism of Democrats on filibusters. In addition, the leaders \nof both parties have abused procedural rules to stop Senators from \noffering important, germane amendments to pending legislation in a \nChamber where the tradition had allowed any Senator to offer virtually \nany amendment on any bill to get a vote to focus public attention on \nimportant national issues.\n  The partisanship has reached such a high level and comity such a low \nlevel that there is not even the pretense of negotiation or compromise \nin almost all situations. Within days of the start of the Obama \nadministration, literally before the ink was dry on his oath of office, \nRepublicans openly bragged about plans to ``break'' him and to engineer \nhis ``Waterloo.'' Announcing that ideological purity was more important \nthan obtaining a majority, the prevailing Republican motto was: We \nwould rather have 30 Marco Rubios in the Senate than 50 Arlen Specters.\n  Moderates and some conservatives, too, have fallen like flies at the \nhands of extremists in both parties. Senator Robert Bennett's 39 \npercent conservative rating was insufficient for renomination in Utah. \nSenator Lisa Murkowski was rejected by Alaska's tea party's dominance \nin their Republican primary. In perhaps the most stunning election, an \nopponent whom conservative Republicans characterized as incompetent \nbeat Congressman Mike Castle. These elections were presaged by the \nsurprising defeat of Senator Joe Lieberman, who was not sufficiently \nliberal to represent Connecticut's Democrats.\n  The Senate is a vastly different place than it was when I was elected \nin 1980. In that era, Howard Baker and Lloyd Bentsen worked together. \nBob Dole and Russell Long could reach an accommodation on tax issues. \nBill Cohen and ``Scoop'' Jackson found compromises in the Armed \nServices Committee. The Nunn-Lugar initiatives were legendary. Dan \nInouye and Ted Stevens perfected bipartisanship on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I think it is fair and accurate to say that the Republican Party has \nchanged the most ideologically from the days when the steering \ncommittee, led by Senator Jesse Helms, represented the conservatives \nand the Wednesday moderate luncheon club was almost as big, with Mark \nHatfield, ``Mac'' Mathias, Lowell Weicker, John Danforth, Charles \nPercy, Bob Stafford, John Heinz, John Chafee, Bob Packwood, Alan \nSimpson, John Warner, Warren Rudman, Slade Gorton, and Arlen Specter, \nin addition to Baker, Dole, Stevens, and Cohen. By the turn of the \ncentury, the group had shrunk to Jim Jeffords, Olympia Snowe, Susan \nCollins, Lincoln Chafee, and me. After the 2008 election, only Snowe, \nCollins, and I remained.\n  By the fall of 2008, the economy was in free fall. More than half a \nmillion jobs were being lost each month, and the unemployment rolls \nwere nearing 4 million. President Bush formulated a $750 billion so-\ncalled bailout called TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. \nResistance to the proposal was high. The House of Representatives \nrejected it on September 29 by a vote of 228 to 205. The stock market \nfell 778 points on the Dow Jones average. Nothing could be done \nimmediately since many in Congress--myself included--were in synagogues \nacross the country celebrating Rosh Hashanah on that evening and the \nnext day. The Senate came back into session on October 1 to vote on \nTARP.\n  Vice President Cheney met with the Republican caucus to urge \nacceptance of the President's plan. Dick Cheney had an earned \nreputation for being a dry, factual, unemotional speaker, low key, \ndirect, here it is, take it or leave it.\n  Before the Senate vote, in the Senate Mansfield Room, immediately off \nthis Chamber, the Vice President was impassioned. He said if you don't \npass\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nthis legislation, George W. Bush will turn into a modern day Herbert \nHoover.\n  Republicans responded with 34 voting aye and 15 opposed. TARP passed \nthe Senate 75 to 24. The House followed suit, and the President signed \nthe bill. It wasn't a pretty legislative process. It started out with a \nfew pages, mushroomed into a gigantic bill, without appropriate \nhearings, analysis, debate or deliberation. Fast action was mandatory \nif we were to stop the market slide and the economy from crashing. The \nimplications were worldwide.\n  The situation continued to deteriorate. President Obama immediately \nwent to work on a stimulus bill. He came to the Republican Caucus on \nJanuary 27, and made a very strong appeal on the urgency of immediate \naction to save the U.S. economy from a 1929-type depression with a \ndomino effect on the world economy. He said it was imperative that the \nbill be passed by February 13, the Friday before Congress began a \nweeklong recess for the Washington/Lincoln birthdays.\n  A large group of Senators held a series of meetings attended by about \n15 rotating Democrats with 6 Republicans initially in attendance: \nOlympia Snowe, Susan Collins, George Voinovich, Lisa Murkowski, Mel \nMartinez, and me. The final meetings were held on February 6 in Harry \nReid's office, attended by Susan Collins, Ben Nelson, Joe Lieberman, \nRahm Emanuel, Reid, and me. Collins and I insisted on having a final \nbill under $800 billion. The Obama figure had started out at $600 \nbillion and ballooned to more than a trillion dollars. She and I \nthought it would be tough for the public to swallow a stimulus act so \nwe insisted on holding the figure under $800 billion. When she and I \ncouldn't agree with the Democrats, we took a break and went to my \nhideaway office to confer. There we formulated our last best proposal, \nwhich was accepted.\n  The stimulus package, like TARP, was put together too fast without \nappropriate hearings, analysis, debate, and deliberation. Had the \nRepublican leadership participated, there would have been critical \nstaff assistance on formulating what the money should have been spent \nfor to stimulate the economy immediately and create jobs, but the \nRepublican leadership refused to participate. The Republican game plan \nwas already in effect to ``break'' Obama and cause his ``Waterloo.''\n  There were many Republicans in the caucus who would have liked to \nhave voted for the stimulus. The U.S. and world economies were closer \nto the precipice of depression than when 34 Senators had voted for \nTARP. But the pressure to vote the party line was tremendous--the \nstrongest I had seen in my 29-year tenure. The risk of retribution was \nenormous.\n  After making my floor speech supporting the President's plan, I \nwalked back into the Republican cloakroom where a senior colleague \nsaid: ``Arlen, I'm proud of you.'' When I then asked him: ``Will you \njoin with me?'' he replied: ``No, I couldn't do that. Might cost me a \nprimary.'' While there has been much justified criticism that the \nstimulus legislation could have been better, most would agree that it \ndid prevent a 1929-style depression.\n  Not interested in governance, after the stimulus vote, Republicans \nturned to obstructionism--a virtual scorched-earth policy to carry out \nthe plan to defeat the President. In 2009 and 2010 to date, 112 cloture \nmotions have been filed and voted on 67 times. That the filibusters \nwere frivolous, dilatory, and obstructionistic is evidenced by the fact \nthat some judges were confirmed by overwhelming majorities, some 99 to \n0, after cloture was invoked. Each time cloture was invoked, the Senate \ncould not take up any other business for 30 hours, leaving little time \nto take up other vital legislation.\n\n  On some occasions, relatively rare, the filibusters were justified \nwhere the majority leader filled the so-called tree, precluding \nminority amendments. That sometimes led to half-hearted negotiations \nover how many and what amendments the minority could offer, resulting \nin reciprocal recriminations of unfairness. Often the recriminations \nwere meritorious with both parties being to blame. Each side maneuvered \nto avoid voting on amendments which posed political risks to their \nside. Notwithstanding the fact that Senators are sent to Washington to \nvote, enormous energy is expended to avoid votes. This issue did not \napply to judicial confirmations where no amendments were in order. In \n2008, I proposed a rule change to establish a timetable for confirming \njudges precluding filibusters. In 2009, I proposed a rule change to \nprohibit filling the so-called tree to prevent other Senators from \noffering amendments.\n  The exodus of Senate Republican moderates has resulted from the shift \nof the party to the right causing many moderates to reregister as \nIndependents or Democrats, significant expenditures by the Club for \nGrowth, the activism of the tea party, and, more recently, the infusion \nof enormous sums of money from secret contributors. Extreme right-wing \ncandidates have benefited from enormous campaign expenditures by \noutside groups. The New York Times recently reported that ``outside \ngroups supporting Republican candidates in House and Senate races . . . \nhave been swamping their Democratic-leaning counterparts on television \n. . .'' Bloomberg News reports that, in September alone, groups \nsupporting Republican candidates spent $17 million while groups \nsupporting Democratic candidates spent only $2.6 million.\n  The Club for Growth's backing of Lincoln Chafee's primary opponent in \nRhode Island in 2006 was especially costly causing his defeat in the \ngeneral by draining his financing and pushing him to the right. It cost \nRepublicans control of the Senate in 2007 and 2008. When the Club for \nGrowth defeated moderates in the primaries, Pete Domenici's seat was \nlost in 2008, as were the House seats of Joe Schwartz in Michigan in \n2006 and Wayne Gilchrist in Maryland in 2008.\n  It is understandable that moderates are responding to caucus \npressure, seeing what is happening to colleagues who are seen as \nideologically impure and insufficiently conservative. Bob Bennett had a \n93 percent conservative rating. Only two objections were raised against \nhim: he sponsored health care reform legislation which was cosponsored \nby many other Republicans, and he voted for TARP. As noted, TARP was \nPresident Bush's legislation, enthusiastically advocated by Vice \nPresident Cheney. It was a significant success, stabilizing the banking \nindustry and enabling GM and Chrysler to stay in business. Most of the \ngovernment funds have been repaid.\n  South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis, who was defeated earlier this \nyear by a conservative primary challenger, said today's political \nclimate would make it ``a tough time for Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp.'' \nFlorida Governor Charlie Crist was driven out of the Republican Party \nto an Independent candidacy because his State accepted stimulus money. \nHe was pictured embracing President Obama and he was thought to be too \nliberal. Considering what has happened to Bennett, Murkowski, Castle, \nand Crist, is no wonder that Republican Senate moderates and some \nconservatives are hewing the party line as they watch right wingers \nplan for their primary defeats years away.\n  Republican Senators who previously actively supported campaign \nfinance reform were unwilling to cast a single vote with 59 Democrats \nto proceed to consider legislation requiring the disclosure of \ncorporate contributions permitted by the Supreme Court decision in \nCitizen's United. Notwithstanding the broad latitude given to campaign \ncontributions under the first amendment, the Supreme Court rulings \nleave Congress the authority to require disclosure. It is hard to \nunderstand how any objective view would oppose disclosure when secret \ncontributions pose such a threat to our democracy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has now used his \nadditional 15 minutes of time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have been waiting now to speak on \nTed Stevens, which was, I thought, the time allotted here. I am happy \nto give the Senator another 2 minutes on top of the extra 15 if that is \nnecessary, but we have several Members wishing to speak on Senator \nStevens. If he would hold it to another 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I asked for the time when no one was here. I do \nask for the additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not, I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Specter, I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, Senator Hutchison be recognized for 5 \nminutes, Senator Collins for 10 minutes, Senator Alexander for 5 \nminutes, and Senator Isakson for 5 minutes, thus locking in the time we \nunderstood we were going to get.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, both requests \nare granted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To continue the chain of thought, like the issue on \ncampaign contributions, the DOD authorization bill was stymied on the \nexcuse of ``procedural'' considerations involving ``don't ask, don't \ntell,' when many Republicans had voted to repeal it on prior occasions.\n  This country is still governed by ``we the people,'' but the only \npeople who count are the ones who vote. If mainstream Republicans had \nbeen as active tea party Republicans in the Utah, Alaska, and Delaware \nprimaries, I believe Bennett, Murkowski, and Castle would have won. \nThat would have given heart to other Republican Senators that their \nrecords would be judged by a sufficiently large base to give them a \nfighting chance to survive.\n  Politics is routinely described as the art of the possible or the art \nof compromise. The viability of the two-party system is predicated on \nadvocacy of differing approaches to governance which ultimately seeks \nmiddle ground or compromise. That is virtually always indispensible to \nreach a supermajority of 60. When one party insists on ideological \npurity, compromise is thwarted and the two-party system fails to \nfunction.\n  People with grievances are the most anxious to shake up the system. \nThe Congress needs to deal with issues such as the deficit, the \nnational debt, and the intrusiveness of government. The tea party \npeople who attended townhall meetings in August of 2009, like mine in \nLebanon, were not Astro Turf, but citizens making important points. But \nthey did not represent all of America or, in my opinion, even a \nmajority of Republicans. Pundits are saying this November our Nation \nwill be at the crossroads. I believe it is more like a clover leaf. If \nactivated and motivated to vote, mainstream voters can steer America to \nsensible centrism.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7569-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7569-S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, today we will go to Arlington for the \nfinal ceremony with respect to our former colleague, Senator Ted \nStevens. He has earned a place in Arlington by virtue of his service in \nthe Second World War, but he has earned a place in the hearts of all of \nus who worked with him, and like my colleagues I want to take the \nopportunity to say a few words about Senator Stevens.\n  Senator Stevens was something of a character. He would wear his Hulk \ntie. He would cultivate his reputation as an irascible fighter, and he \nalways had a twinkle in his eye when he did it. But there was some \ntruth to it.\n  I remember the first time he took over as the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. He gathered us together and he, speaking of \nhis predecessor, Mark Hatfield, said: Mark Hatfield was a saint. He was \nfilled with patience. You could talk to him at length, and he was \nalways willing to defer. He was always willing to put off until you \ncould get to the right solution. Mark Hatfield was a saint. I am not. \nWe are going to get this thing done, and we are going to get it done on \ntime. I am impatient, and I am going to make sure that the things go in \nthe way they should.\n  We all chuckled at that. We did, indeed, enjoy Mark Hatfield. But the \npoint I want to make today is that behind that facade that Senator \nStevens liked to put up was a very serious legislator and a very \nsuperior human being.\n  Ted Stevens was always accessible. No matter what your problem was, \nyou could go to him and he would listen to you. I discovered that when \nwe were working on funding for the Olympics. He was a great supporter \nof the Olympics. As a Senator from Utah, when we were holding the \nOlympics I not only got his support, but I got his advice and his help. \nHe was always accessible. He was always prepared. If you went to Ted \nStevens, you wouldn't catch him by surprise on anything. He was always \nengaged. He didn't have to have the staff bring him up to speed; he had \nto have an understanding of the issues himself.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Ted Stevens was always open to new ideas. I \nwas chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and would talk about the \neconomy to the conference as a whole and would be surprised how many \ntimes Ted Stevens would come up to me after and have some new idea \nabout the economy or some new source he had come across he would \nrecommend to me. Even after he had left the Senate when I would run \ninto him in a social situation, Ted would say, You ought to get your \nstaff looking at--and then he would fill in the blank with information \nof what it was he had found out.\n  Ted Stevens served in the highest tradition of this body. It was an \nhonor and a privilege and a learning experience for me to be able to \nserve with him. On this day, he takes his final resting place in \nArlington. I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to him, not just \nas a Senator but as a superior human being and a great friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to salute my former colleague \nTed Stevens who will be laid to rest in Arlington today. He earned the \nright to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery, having served in \nWorld War II. That is one of the things that hasn't been talked about \nas much regarding Ted Stevens because he was a remarkable Senator and \nhas a remarkable history with his State of Alaska as well as in the \nSenate.\n  Ted Stevens served here for 40 years. From the very beginning, Ted \nwas Alaska's greatest champion. He helped found his State. He pushed \nthrough Alaska statehood and worked tirelessly to serve its unique \nneeds for his entire life and continued to be its greatest advocate.\n  Nine years after he helped establish Alaska's statehood, he was \nelected to serve in the Senate. He spent the next 40 years building his \nState from an undeveloped territory, which Alaska was, to one of our \nNation's most important energy producers, along with the other things \nAlaska gives to our great Nation. It is a testament to Ted Stevens' \nmighty efforts and his love for his native land.\n  Alaska and every other State was helped by Ted Stevens. Everyone \nknows he took care of Alaska because he fought ferociously, but he also \nhelped every other Senator represent their States and the priorities of \ntheir States, and that was one of the great things about this man.\n  In particular, when he went on the Appropriations Committee and later \nwas its chairman as well as the chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, he devoted himself to protecting our troops, to making \nsure they had the right equipment to do the jobs we ask them to do. Of \ncourse, he was a man of the military. He was so proud of his air \nservice. He was a man who had flown in World War II. I visited the \nWorld War II Memorial to Americans in Great Britain with Ted Stevens, \nand he walked around all of the old airplanes and talked about the \nairplanes that were there and the ones he had flown and the ones that \nwere new. There was an excitement about that, in his 80s--all the \nmemories of his World War II time.\n  When someone would say to me, How do you get along with Ted Stevens, \nI would always say Ted Stevens is a man who is all bark and no bite. \nThis was a man who had this Incredible Hulk tie and he would frown and \nhe would look ferocious. He was so tender underneath. He wanted to help \npeople. He wanted to make sure people did the right thing. He had a \npassion, he did, but he was so good underneath.\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n  Back in 1993, when I first entered the Senate, I was one of seven \nwomen Senators. I would say there was not another woman on the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee--my colleague Barbara Mikulski was on the \ncommittee--but I wanted to be on the Defense Subcommittee and I told \nTed Stevens, We have more Army retirees in Texas than any other State. \nWe have great Army bases as well as Air Force bases in Texas. I want to \nbe on the Defense Subcommittee. He helped me get there. It made a \ndifference in my capability to serve my State and my Nation.\n  I traveled once with Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye to Saudi Arabia for \nour work on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I was told later \nthat Ted Stevens was actually discouraged by our Saudi host from \nbringing me with the delegation because I was a woman. Ted Stevens \nnever told me this until later. He said, No way am I going to keep a \nmember of my subcommittee and my committee off this trip she deserves \nto go on, and that was it. I was part of the delegation. I visited our \nair base there with all of the other Members. I participated in every \nmeeting and every event during that trip. Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye \ntogether would have it no other way.\n  Let me mention the relationship between Danny Inouye and Ted Stevens.\n  Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye were the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, but they never referred to each other as \nranking member. They were always chairman and vice chairman. It went \nback and forth. When Democrats were in charge, Danny Inouye would be \nthe chairman of a committee and Ted would be the vice chairman. If \nRepublicans were in the majority, it would be Ted who was the chairman \nand the vice chairman would be Danny Inouye, because they were World \nWar II soulmates. Danny Inouye--who is now the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and another great patriot for our country, \nhailing from Hawaii, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his \ngreat service in World War II--and Ted were inseparable friends and \ncalled each other soul brothers.\n  Another Ted story: One day during the markup in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Ted grew very animated, as he did on issues, \nand when another Senator said, Mr. Chairman, there is no reason for you \nto lose your temper, Ted glared back and said, I never lose my temper. \nI know exactly where it is. Those who knew him best knew his \ncompassionate heart.\n  There is a wonderful article this morning in Politico, one of the \nnewspapers on Capitol Hill, and it talks about his time. Again, another \nTed story, World War II: He was very close to the Chinese, because he \nflew missions into China. One of the things he did was fly supplies to \nGEN Claire Chennault's Flying Tiger air bases in China. He escorted \nAnna Chennault on her first trip back to China in 1981 when Stevens \nhimself had just remarried and was on his honeymoon with Catherine. \n``We went on our honeymoon there with Anna Chennault'', said Catherine \nStevens, laughing. ``Everybody kept sending tips that Ted Stevens is on \nhis honeymoon with Anna Chennault.'' Then Catherine said, ``And that \nwas technically true.''\n  This is another side of this wonderful man that we are going to bury \ntoday with all of the tributes and accolades he deserves at Arlington \nNational Cemetery. We will miss this great man, this great patriot, \nthis great Alaskan, this great American, and this great friend to every \none of us here.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, Senator Collins is next in order, but \nshe has kindly given me a few minutes to make my remarks, and I wish to \nthank her for that.\n  Senator Ted Stevens will be remembered as a patriot who flew the \nfirst cargo plane into Peking, as it was then called, at the end of \nWorld War II, and helped create and then serve the 49th State for a \nhalf a century.\n  I have often thought that some day I should write a book about \nSenators--not about their gossip or their secrets--but about the things \nothers don't know about the people we work with: About Jim Inhofe's \nflight around the world; about Ben Nighthorse Campbell's jewelry; about \nBarack Obama's and Mel Martinez's boyhood; about Jim Bunning's pitches. \nAll of these things have nothing to do with politics. I always wanted \nto start with Ted Stevens. Some day I think I will write this book, \nincluding about how he flew a cargo plane into Peking at the end of \nWorld War II. It says a lot about the kind of life he led afterwards.\n  No one did more to create Alaska as a State. He worked at the \nInterior Department for several years, writing speeches, lobbying, \ndoing all kinds of things to cause it to happen. Then he served that \nState for nearly a half century in the best manner of the greatest \ngeneration.\n  He had a broad view.\n  He and Senator Inouye led a trip, along with several of us, to China \nin 2006, a delegation of Senators. We were better received than if they \nhad been the President and Vice President of the United States, because \nthe Chinese revered Ted Stevens and honored Danny Inouye because of \ntheir service in World War II. We saw the No. 1 man in China, President \nHu. We saw the No. 2 man, Mr. Wu. We saw in all parts of the country \nthe respect they had for Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye.\n  Senator Stevens carried that to the floor of the Senate. For example, \nhe saw there in China what the Chinese are doing to remain competitive \nin the world by building up their universities, keeping their brain \npower advantage. He came back to this body and became a principal \ncosponsor of the America COMPETES Act, which helps our country do the \nsame.\n  Perhaps no two Senators had a closer relationship than Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens. They came from the same generation. They fought in \nthe same war. They were both enormously brave. They treated one another \nas brothers.\n  I was a young aide in the Senate when Ted Stevens was first appointed \nto the Senate in 1968. He was here when I came back 20 years later as \nthe Education Secretary, and when I came back as a Senator 8 years ago, \nhe was still here. He served longer than any other Republican Senator. \nHe will be remembered as a great patriot and as the man who flew the \ncargo plane into Peking in 1944 and spent half a century creating and \nthen serving our 49th State.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Maine for her courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it has actually been a great pleasure \nto sit on the floor--and I see the Presiding Officer nodding in \nagreement--and hear these tributes to our friend, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  It is, of course, with sorrow that I rise to offer these words on the \ntragic passing of Senator Stevens, but it is also with a sense of \ngratitude and fondness that I remember him and that I celebrate his \ndedicated service to our Nation, to his beloved State, and to the \nSenate. My thoughts and prayers remain with the Stevens family and with \nthe families of the others who perished in that heartbreaking accident.\n  In 1999, Senator Stevens was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' It was \na fitting tribute to a man who, though not Alaskan by birth, became one \nwith every ounce of his spirit, energy, and determination.\n  In 1953, with his heroic military service behind him and fresh out of \nlaw school, he drove from Washington, DC, to Fairbanks, AK, in the \nmiddle of the winter to begin his first job in his new profession. He \nsoon was appointed U.S. Attorney and quickly established a reputation \nas a courageous and diligent prosecutor. Returning to Washington 3 \nyears later to accept a position in the Department of the Interior, he \ntook on the cause of Alaskan statehood as the cause of his life.\n  In 1959, his relentless efforts were rewarded with success. He served \nwith distinction in the brand-new Alaska State Legislature and joined \nthe Senate 9 years later. In this city, he was known as ``Mr. Alaska.'' \nBack home, he was simply ``Uncle Ted.'' His devotion to his \nconstituents in matters large and small, and in all corners of that \nvast State, was unsurpassed.\n  Let me return to his military service for a moment, for I believe it \noffers a clear view of his character and his patriotism. In 1942, with \nAmerica plunged\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\ninto war, Ted volunteered to become a Navy aviator, but was rejected \ndue to problems with his vision. Rather than admit defeat, he embarked \non a course of rigorous eye exercises and earned his way into the Army \nAir Corps, scoring near the top of his training class. His assignment--\nto fly cargo over the towering Himalayas to the legendary Flying \nTigers--was extraordinarily dangerous. His valor earned him two \nDistinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals, as well as military \nhonors from the government of Nationalist China. As in all things, Lt. \nTed Stevens let no obstacle bar his way.\n  I was privileged to work alongside this extraordinary Senator on the \nHomeland Security Committee. On every issue, Senator Stevens \ndemonstrated great knowledge and commitment to protecting our Nation \nand our people. As just one example, he was instrumental in passage of \nthe SAFE Ports Act of 2006 to secure the seaports that are so essential \nto our Nation's prosperity and security.\n\n  Alaska and Maine are separated by a great many miles, but our two \nStates have much in common, including spectacular scenery, and rugged, \nself-reliant people. Our States also share a connection to the sea that \nis central to our history and our future. From the Magnuson-Stevens \nFisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976, to his work to \nprotect marine mammals, Senator Stevens demonstrated a deep commitment \nto the hardworking people who sustain countless coastal communities and \nan abiding respect for the natural resources that bless us all.\n  Since his passing, tributes have poured in from across America. Some \nserve as valuable reminders of his commitment to a broad range of \ninterests. Olympic athletes and those who aspire to that level of \nachievement know that his Amateur Sports Act of 1978 brought the dream \nof competing on the world stage within reach of all, regardless of \nfinancial circumstances. Female athletes celebrate his support of title \nIX, which leveled the playing field for women in sports. Cancer \nsurvivors remember him as a champion of research, testing, and \neducation in that dread disease. Alaska Natives and Native Americans \nthroughout the Nation recall him as a true friend.\n  Mr. President, 3 years ago, Ted Stevens became the longest-serving \nRepublican in Senate history. His service has inspired many who seek to \nserve their States in public office. We will remember him always, and \nmay God bless Ted and comfort his family, his friends, and those of us \nwho were privileged to serve with him.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I join Senator Collins and many \ncolleagues in paying tribute to the life and times of Senator Ted \nStevens.\n  While today we will lay his body to rest, his legacy will never be \nlaid to rest. There has never been a more impactful Senator for their \nState in this country than Senator Ted Stevens.\n  While I can tell countless stories, I wish to make two brief \nobservations to show you the heart and soul of the effect and impact of \nTed Stevens. One of my dear friends, the first Republican Senator from \nGeorgia since Reconstruction, Mack Mattingly, from Brunswick, GA, told \nme not too long ago, after the passing of Senator Stevens, that when he \nfirst came to the Senate in 1981, Stevens was the first man to reach \nout to him, to help him, and to show him the way. I said: Mack, that is \ninteresting, because when I was elected 6 years ago and I came to the \nSenate, the first man to offer a hand of leadership and help show me \nthe way was Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Ted was a consummate Senator, a ferocious fighter for the State of \nAlaska, and a proud patriot of the United States of America. He may \nhave been small in stature, but he was a giant in ability.\n  I always loved when we debated ANWR on the Senate floor--whether to \ndrill. He wanted to drill. The people of Alaska wanted to drill. Every \nday that amendment was going to come up, you knew it because he had his \nIncredible Hulk tie on and was ready for the fight--not in an \nadversarial way or in a fistfight way but in a pride way, fighting for \nwhat was right for Alaska.\n  Today, we will lay Senator Stevens to rest in Arlington National \nCemetery, but his legacy will live on as a consummate fighter for his \nState and a lover of this great country. As I have said in my stories \nabout Senator Mattingly and myself, Ted was a mentor to those who came \nto the Senate to serve. May God bless the life, the times, and the \nfamily of Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it was just about two years ago that many of \nus came to the floor to say goodbye to one of our good friends. Ted \nStevens was leaving the Senate and returning home to his beloved \nAlaska. He had earned his retirement many times over.\n  At last there would be time to do the things that he always enjoyed--\nfishing, spending more time with his family, and being with the people \nof Alaska who hold him in such high esteem and affection. He was known \nthroughout the State as Uncle Ted.\n  Now we are gathered again to reflect on Ted Stevens and his life, but \nthis time we are here to say a final farewell as we mourn his loss. On \nreflection, nothing says more about the way he lived his life than to \nspeak of his loss at the age of 86 with the feeling that he was taken \nfrom us all too soon.\n  Ted's life was a great, grand and glorious adventure, and he filled \nevery day of it to the brim as he pursued anything and everything that \ninterested him or moved him to action. The strength of his character \nand his love of his country saw him through his military service. His \ndetermination to succeed and his commitment to getting a good education \nhelped him through college and then through law school as he worked to \nobtain the skills and the knowledge he knew he would need to be \nsuccessful in whatever he chose to do in life.\n  For all who knew him, Ted's ultimate legacy can be summed up in one \nword--statehood. That was his first and most powerful calling, and his \nsuccessful effort to make Alaska a State left its mark on our country \nand our flag--a distinction that will ensure that Ted will always be \nremembered.\n  Although it was a remarkable achievement, the idea of making Alaska a \nState wasn't a new idea when Ted got a hold of it. It had been talked \nabout for some time, but it wasn't going anywhere because the proposal \nneeded something more to get the ball rolling--it needed a champion who \nwould fight for it--someone who could develop a strategy that would \nmake the impossible dream of the people of Alaska come true. That \nindividual was Ted Stevens.\n  Ted practically ran the effort from start to finish as soon as he \narrived in Washington. He had a plan, and he put it into operation. It \nproduced a groundswell of support that became so powerful there was \njust no stopping it. Soon President Eisenhower had signed the necessary \nlegislation and Alaska had become our 49th State.\n  For most people, that would have been enough. But it wasn't enough \nfor Ted. Ted didn't know what life had in store for him, but he knew \nwhere he would be taking the next steps in his life--back home in \nAlaska.\n  After a series of twists and turns, Ted became one of Alaska's \nSenators. He was a tremendously effective Senator, and his reputation \ngrew over the years as a tireless worker who wouldn't take no for an \nanswer when it involved one of his State's priorities.\n  Ted and I were able to forge a good working relationship and a \nfriendship that meant a lot to us both. We understood each other and \nmore often than not, we supported each other's legislative priorities. \nWyoming is a lot like Alaska, so that may explain why Ted and I got \nalong so well.\n  Wyoming is a large State with a relatively small population. So is \nAlaska. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty. So is \nAlaska. The people who call our States their home are strong, \nindependent and proud--proud of their past, confident of their future, \nand well aware of how blessed they are to be Americans. I think that \ncomes from the placement of our States. It took people with a sense of \nadventure and a willingness to put up with a great deal of difficulty \nand an abundance of hardship to travel the miles it took for them to \nget to Wyoming and later to travel North to Alaska.\n  In the years to come, whenever I remember the days I spent with Ted, \nI will think of the words of the old adage that reminds us that the \nmost important inheritance we receive from our\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nfriends, family and those we care about is found in the memories we \nwill always carry with us of the special days we shared with them. For \nme, I will always remember the times I spent away from the Senate doing \nwhat Ted and I most loved to do: enjoying the great outdoors with a \nfishing rod in our hands. If you are from Wyoming or Alaska, I do not \nthink you can find a bad fishing spot anywhere in those two States.\n\n  That is how Ted got a lot of us to his beloved Alaska year after \nyear. He was always talking about his Kenai Tournament and the chance \nit gave everyone to see the sights of Alaska and get a little break \nfrom the rigors of the Senate. It was a great fishing tournament, but \nit was also a chance for us to help Ted raise some needed funds that \nwere used to improve the habitat of the salmon that had the good sense \nto live there.\n  God must have needed a good man. I know we all miss Ted. When he wore \nhis Hulk tie, you knew things were about to happen and happen fast. \nThis memory makes it feel like he is never far away. Diana joins in \nsending our sympathy to Catherine and all his family. The Stevens \nfamily can be very proud of the difference they made together over the \nyears and of the legacy they will proudly carry of service and an \nunwillingness to ever think any task is impossible, no matter how \ndifficult the struggle.\n  I cannot help but think God needed someone with Ted's abilities to \nhave taken him from us. I take some comfort in the knowledge that Ted \nwas doing those things he dearly loved right up to the end. He was \nflying around his beloved Alaska and heading to a lodge to catch up on \na little fishing when his plane went down.\n  In the days to come, whenever I am with my grandson and we both look \nup at the sky with the awe and wonder it inspires, I will remember the \nwords of the Eskimo proverb that speaks to the reason why the beautiful \nlights in the sky shine so brightly at night. As legend goes: Perhaps \nthey are not stars but, rather, openings in heaven, where the love of \nour lost ones pours through and shines down upon us to let us know that \nthey are happy.\n  I do not know if there is fishing in heaven, but if there is, I know \nTed must be up there somewhere waiting patiently for a nibble and the \nchance to reel in another prize winner. I can almost see him there, \nfishing rod in hand and a smile on his face. If that is what heaven has \nbrought to Ted, I have no doubt he will be happy forever because it \ndoes not get any better than that.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to laud the life and work of the \nHonorable Ted Stevens, Senator from Alaska. Ted was a fellow World War \nII veteran and my partner in the Senate who fought hard on behalf of \nAlaska and this great Nation.\n  When it came to policy, we disagreed more often than we agreed, but \nwe were never disagreeable with one another. We were always positive \nand forthright.\n  We shared a bond in that we believed it was our mission to ensure \nthat Hawaii and Alaska were not forgotten by the lower 48 and our \nefforts were constant reminders of the economic and international \nimportance of the Pacific.\n  Our beloved Ted was much more than the Senator of Alaska, much more \nthan a fighter and an advocate and an example of what bipartisan effort \ncan accomplish. Ted was a father, grandfather, and loving husband who \nput his family before everything else. We have lost a great man, and I \njoin my colleagues in mourning his passing.\n  Mr. President, recently in meeting with the Librarian of Congress, \nDr. James H. Billington, our chat focused upon Senator Ted Stevens. I \nlearned that on August 14, 2010, Dr. Billington had written a special \ntribute to Senator Ted Stevens. Yesterday, I received a copy of this \ntribute and I wish to share it with my colleagues.\n  Our beloved Ted was much more than the Senator of Alaska, much more \nthan a fighter and a brilliant parliamentarian. This tribute says \nsomething about him and his impact on Alaska and the world. I thank Dr. \nBillington for his heartfelt tribute to our great friend and colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Dr. Billington's \ntribute printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    A Tribute to Senator Ted Stevens\n\n   (By James H. Billington, The Librarian of Congress, Aug. 14, 2010)\n\n       Just a few years ago, at the end of a particularly \n     exhausting week in the Senate, Ted Stevens took an overnight \n     flight to open a Library of Congress exhibit for the 300th \n     anniversary of St. Petersburg. He insisted that I take his \n     comfortable seat on the way over; and he flew back rapidly--\n     leaving me well-rested for follow-up and the Russians in awed \n     admiration of his age-defying journey to a distant cultural \n     event of symbolic and even political importance.\n       This small memory came back to me just a year ago when I \n     was back again in St. Petersburg. I was waiting to speak \n     after Russian President Medvedev at the dedication ceremony \n     of a great Petersburg palace that had been refashioned into \n     the central building of a new library system for Russia \n     modeled in many ways on the Library of Congress. I think my \n     subconscious was reminding me that neither I nor the Library \n     would probably have been in the picture without the varied \n     ways that Ted Stevens quietly helped the Congress' library \n     undertake new initiatives for our country--during and beyond \n     his many years as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Joint \n     Committee on the Library of Congress.\n       Senator Stevens played a key role in bringing into being \n     within the legislative branch of government three important \n     innovations for sustaining long-term American leadership in \n     the world. Each of them had from the beginning bipartisan, \n     bicameral support, and have been implemented in cooperative \n     collaboration with the executive and judicial branches.\n       1. He championed a special $2 million grant to the Library \n     in 1999 to create a bi-lingual, online library of primary \n     documents comparing the parallel experiences of Russia and \n     America as continent-wide, multi-ethnic nations. This \n     visionary, one-time appropriation (which we had not requested \n     in our budget submission) enabled the Library to attract \n     unprecedented in-kind support from 36 Russian repositories \n     and to put online three-quarters of a million rare Russian \n     items. This experience has helped equip us more recently to \n     launch a multi-lingual World Digital Library with private \n     support and the endorsement of UNESCO.\n       2. Senator Stevens was an early advocate and continuous \n     supporter of The Open World Leadership Program, the first \n     international people-to-people exchange ever created and \n     administered within the legislative branch of our government. \n     For eleven years it has enabled more than 15,000 emerging \n     young leaders from Russia and other states of the former USSR \n     to experience democratic governance in action in local \n     communities across America. Senator Stevens was and remained \n     active and engaged as the Honorary Chairman of its Board of \n     Trustees.\n       3. At a very busy time late in the year 2000, Senator \n     Stevens devoted an entire Saturday to discussing at his home \n     the national need for preserving important information that \n     was increasingly available only in highly perishable digital \n     form. He proceeded to take the lead in creating the still \n     ongoing National Digital Information and Infrastructure \n     Preservation Program that has enabled the Library of Congress \n     to work with 170 partner repositories throughout America to \n     conserve immense amounts of digital material.\n       Ted Stevens rarely mentioned and never stressed his own \n     role in any of these programs. He repeatedly and rightly \n     credited the contributions of other colleagues and of the \n     Congress itself. He was respectful and supportive of those in \n     public service implementing these and many other long-range \n     national programs.\n       At this sad time, all of us at the Library specially and \n     gratefully remember his help in creating unique and \n     challenging new programs within America's oldest federal \n     cultural institution. I mourn the passing of a deeply admired \n     friend. He was an unforgettable man of action and a dedicated \n     public servant--not just for his beloved Alaska, but for all \n     of America and our long-term future in a changing world.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on the morning of Tuesday, August 10, \nin Alaska, in Washington, and around the world, time seemed to stand \nstill. It was then we received word that a floatplane carrying our \nbeloved Senator Ted Stevens had gone down in the remote Bristol Bay \nregion of western Alaska. Senator Stevens traveled to that area, as he \ndid practically each summer for decades, to pursue one of his dearest \npassions--fishing.\n  Along with Senator Stevens on that flight were several of his closest \nfriends. Sean O'Keefe, the former Administrator of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration; Jim Morhard, who came to the \nSenate in 1983 as an aide to Senator Pete Wilson of California and \nretired in 2005 as chief of staff of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee; Bill Phillips, a distinguished Washington lawyer and former \nchief of staff to Senator Stevens was on the flight; as was Dana \nTindall, one of\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nAlaska's best and brightest who made a career of bringing 21st century \ntelecommunications technology to our vast territory. Three of their \nchildren were on the trip as well: Sean's son Kevin, Bill's son Willy, \nand Dana's daughter Corey. The pilot was Theron ``Terry'' Smith, an \naccomplished aviator who retired as chief pilot after 25 years with \nAlaska Airlines in Anchorage.\n  When it became apparent that the floatplane was overdue en route to a \nremote fishing camp, a massive search was quickly mobilized. The \nwreckage was located and, thankfully, there were survivors.\n  Sean and his son Kevin, Jim Morhard and Willy Phillips survived the \ncrash. We pray for their swift and full recovery.\n  At the same time our hearts dropped at the news that the crash \nclaimed the lives of Senator Stevens, Bill Phillips, Dana Tindall, her \ndaughter Corey, and pilot Terry Smith.\n  At a later time I will have more to say about the distinguished \ncareers of Bill Phillips, Dana Tindall, and Terry Smith, as well the \nlost promise of Corey Tindall, a champion debater at South High School \nin Anchorage and an aspiring doctor.\n  I will also have more to say about the heroes that responded to the \ncrash site. That story begins with the Good Samaritan pilots who \nlocated the wreckage, Dr. Dani Bowman, and local first responders who \nwere brought in by helicopter--they cared for the survivors and the \ndead in poor weather through a long night awaiting rescue--the elite \nAlaska National Guard and Coast Guard search and rescue teams that \naccomplished the rescue, the medical teams in Anchorage that tended to \nthe survivors.\n  Today, I would like to devote a few moments in memory of my mentor, a \nman who stands tall among our Senate family as one of the truly great \nSenators of all time, my dear friend, Ted Stevens.\n  It would take days and days to enumerate all of Senator Stevens' \naccomplishments in this body over the course of 40 years. The Senate \nbegan the process of chronicling Senator Stevens' place in history in \nS. Res. 617, which was enacted on August 12. Our colleagues will fill \nin the details in the coming days.\n  Let me digress for a moment and extend my deepest appreciation, and \nthat of the Stevens family, to our colleagues and the staff--all of \nthose who pulled out the stops--to ensure that S. Res. 617 could be \nenacted during a brief lull in the recess. The resolution was presented \nto the Stevens family following the funeral in Anchorage. It was well \nreceived.\n\n  So how to summarize the remarkable career of Ted Stevens in a few \nmoments. Ted Stevens was the longest serving Republican in the Senate's \nhistory. He served as President pro tempore and President pro tempore \nemeritus. He was the assistant Republican leader. At various points \nduring his career he chaired the Appropriations Committee, the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, the Committee on Rules and Administration, and \nthe Senate Select Committee on Ethics. He was involved in numerous \nother leadership roles.\n  He was a dear, dear friend of our men and women in uniform. In the \nearly 1970s he helped to bring an end to the draft and encouraged the \nAll Volunteer military force. He worked diligently to ensure that \nservice members were compensated fairly, that their benefits were not \neroded, and that they received the best health care.\n  A family man always, he was deeply concerned about the length of time \nthat service members were separated from their families. And when \nservice members returned from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from PTSD \nand TBI, he ensured that funds were shifted from lower defense \npriorities to address these immediate concerns. He used his key \nposition on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to make this all \nhappen.\n  During his more than 40 years in the Senate he traveled to visit with \nservice members on the battlefield. He visited Vietnam, Kuwait, Bosnia, \nKosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. On those trips he spent time with those \nin the lowest ranks, asking whether they had the right equipment, how \nthe food was, and how their families back home were coping.\n  Although he will long be remembered as a tireless advocate for the \nresponsible development of Alaska's abundant natural resources, his \nfriends and even his foes readily admit that he leaves a substantial \nconservation legacy. He was key to the compromise that led to the \nenactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, a \nleader in fishery conservation through the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act and the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries \nEnforcement Act.\n  He was a champion of the Olympic movement, a champion of physical \nfitness, a champion of amateur athletics. He played a significant role \nin ensuring that female athletes could compete on a level playing field \nwith their male counterparts. He was one of the best friends public \nbroadcasting could possibly have in Washington. He championed family \nfriendly policies for America's civil servants. These are some of his \nlegacies to the Nation.\n  But to many Alaskans he was known simply as ``Uncle Ted.'' And it was \nnot just for the Federal dollars he brought to the State of Alaska, the \nenergy facilities, hospitals and clinics, roads, docks, airports, water \nand sewer facilities, schools and other community facilities, although \nthese were substantial.\n  The Almanac of American Politics observed, ``No other Senator fills \nso central a place in his state's public and economic life as Ted \nStevens of Alaska; quite possibly no other Senator ever has.''\n  Truth be told, Ted Stevens was known as Uncle Ted because so many \nAlaskans viewed him as a friend of their own Alaskan families. Alaskans \ntreasure the photographs and the letters that Senator Stevens sent \nthem. Some of those photographs and letters were decades old, yet \ntreasured keepsakes.\n\n  He gave Alaska's young people an opportunity to intern in Washington, \ninspiring many careers in public service. I am proud to be one of those \ninterns. He hired many young Alaskans, once they graduated college, as \njunior staff members. He encouraged the best to go to law school and \nthen brought them back as legislative assistants and committee staff. \nMany went on to accomplish great things in their chosen fields.\n  In the aftermath of Senator Stevens' death, hundreds upon hundreds of \nAlaskans lined the streets of Anchorage bearing signs that read, \n``Thank you, Ted'' as his funeral procession drove by. Makeshift \nmemorial services were conducted in Alaska's Native villages.\n  Why did Ted Stevens' loss shake Alaska so hard? The answer is simple. \nFor generations of Alaskans he had been their Senator for life. Ted \nStevens became Alaska's Senator less than 10 years after Alaska was \nadmitted to statehood. I was 11 years old when he first came to the \nSenate.\n  In so many respects, his elevation to the Senate in 1968 was the \nculmination of a career of service to Alaska that began in the 1950s. \nIt was, if you will, his second career of service to the people of \nAlaska.\n  Ted's first career began when he was named the U.S. attorney in \nFairbanks. In a 2002 speech to the Alaska Federation of Natives, Ted \nrecalled that this position gave him the opportunity to carry out \nPresident Eisenhower's commitment to equal rights for everyone. He \ntraveled throughout the area requesting business owners to take down \nsigns that read, ``No Natives Allowed.''\n  Ted then moved to Washington to serve as legislative counsel in the \nInterior Department. He played a key role in the enactment of the \nlegislation that admitted Alaska as America's 49th State.\n  He helped draft that section of the Alaska Statehood Act which \ncommitted the Federal Government to the settlement of the Alaska Native \nland claims. After leaving the Interior Department he opened a law \npractice in Anchorage. Among his clients was the Native Village of \nMinto. The State of Alaska was about to select Minto's traditional \nlands in advance of a land claims settlement. Senator Stevens took on \nMinto's case pro bono. He invited Alaska Native leaders to his home to \nexplore strategies for a more comprehensive settlement of Alaska Native \nland claims.\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n  Ted Stevens could not have guessed at that point that he would join \nthe U.S. Senate and have the opportunity to make the dreams of Alaska's \nNative peoples a reality.\n  That was the first order of business when Ted came to the Senate. He \nbegan work on the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1969 and on \nDecember 18, 1971, the dream that Alaska's Native people would hold \ntitle to their ancestral lands became a reality.\n  This December marks the 39th anniversary of the passage of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act--ANCSA. That landmark legislation returned \nsome 44 million acres of land to Alaska's Native people and created the \nregional and village Alaska Native Corporations.\n  ANCSA led to a resurgence in Native pride and self-confidence. It \ngave our Native people unparalleled opportunities to lead. It has \nproven a valuable legacy for the continuation of Alaska Native culture \nthrough the generations.\n  Senator Stevens played a significant role in bringing Alaska's Native \npeople together to create today's great institutions of Indian self-\ndetermination. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the \nSouthcentral Foundation, which together operate the Alaska Native \nMedical Center in Anchorage, are just two examples.\n  The Alaska Native Medical Center, Alaska's only certified level II \ntrauma center, has earned national recognition for the quality of its \nnursing care. It is connected through innovative telemedicine \ntechnology to regional Native medical centers in rural Alaska and \nclinics at the village level. None of this would be possible without \nSenator Stevens' leadership.\n  Senator Stevens deplored the Third World conditions that stubbornly \npersisted in rural Alaska, threatening the health of Native children. \nHe helped build showers and laundromats in rural Alaska--we call them \nwasheterias--and he helped construct water and sewer facilities so that \nour Native people did not have to haul their waste to an open dump \nsite. I am sad to say that this work is far from done. There is that \nlast 25 percent or so that remains to be done.\n  It is often said that a society is judged by the way it treats its \nmost vulnerable members. It is appropriate that we judge the character \nof our elected officials in the same manner. In Alaska, our Native \npeople are the most vulnerable. For decades, Alaska's most vulnerable \npeople have had no better friend than Ted Stevens.\n  As I noted in my response to Ted's farewell speech on November 20, \n2008, ``When I think of all of the good things, the positive things \nthat have come to Alaska in the past five decades I see the face and I \nsee the hands of Ted Stevens in so many of them.''\n  Not just in rural Alaska but throughout Alaska I think of Senator \nStevens whenever an F-22 takes flight from Elmendorf Air Force Base. I \nthink of him when I drive through the front gate of Eielson Air Force \nBase, which was spared from the 2005 BRAC round largely through his \nleadership. His face is in the new VA Regional Clinic in Anchorage and \nin the Community Based Outpatient Clinic in the Mat-Su Valley. I think \nof Ted when I am fishing on the Kenai River and all of his efforts to \nhelp with conservation and restoration of this world class river. These \nare just a few of Senator Stevens' contributions to Alaska. There is so \nmuch more.\n  At the close of his farewell remarks to the Senate, our friend Ted, \ntold us that he had two homes: ``One in this Chamber, the other his \nbeloved State of Alaska.'' He closed his remarks with the phrase, ``I \nmust leave one to return to the other.''\n  How prophetic. For on the afternoon of August 9, a cold and gloomy \nday, yet the kind of day when fishing is great, the Lord called our \nfriend Ted Stevens from Alaska to yet a third home.\n  Ted's departure leaves a tremendous hole in the hearts of the people \nof Alaska, a hole in the collective hearts of his Senate family, and a \nhole in my heart that will take a long time to heal.\n  On behalf of a grateful Senate and a grateful American people, I \nextend condolences to Ted's wife Catherine; to his children Susan, \nBeth, Ted, Walter, Ben and Lily, and to all of the grandchildren.\n  As our friend, the late Senator Robert Byrd, knew and often recounted \non the Senate floor--of all of the things that brought Ted Stevens joy, \nhis family brought Ted the greatest of joys. In Ted's words, his family \ngave him the kind of love, support, and sacrifice which made his 40-\nyear career in the Senate possible and gave it meaning. We thank Ted's \nfamily for sharing this remarkable man with Alaska, the Senate, and the \nNation.\n  Thank you, Ted. We will never forget you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for 34 years in the Senate it was my \nprivilege and honor to serve alongside Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. \nToday, I would like to pay tribute to Ted, a dedicated public servant, \na respected lawmaker, and a man I was proud to call my friend.\n  Ted Stevens loved this country, and he dedicated nearly his entire \nlife to public service. He served as a pilot in World War II, as a U.S. \ndistrict attorney, as a senior member of the U.S. Interior Department, \nand as a U.S. Senator. Ted loved his State. In fact, he assisted in its \nbirth as a State. During his more than four decades in the Senate, he \nwas an unrelenting and unabashed advocate for Alaska and its people. I \nknow no other Senator who has filled so central a role in their State's \npublic and economic life as did Ted Stevens. He was a man many Alaskans \nknew simply as ``Uncle Ted.''\n  The fight for Alaskan statehood was Ted's principal work at the \nDepartment of the Interior, and, over time, he developed another \nappropriate nickname: ``Mr. Alaska.'' After leaving Interior, Ted \nreturned to Alaska and was elected to the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives in 1964. In 1968 he was appointed to the U.S. Senate, \nand today he remains the longest serving Republican Senator in history.\n  In the Senate, he was a tough negotiator and a savvy legislator, but \nhe was always fair. He was an old-school Senator, and he kept his word. \nDuring the challenging years after statehood, Ted helped transform \nAlaska, playing key roles shaping the State's economic and social \ndevelopment. A staunch defender of the Alaskan way of life, he \nchampioned legislation to protect the fishing industry, to build the \nAlaska oil pipeline, to protect millions of acres of wilderness area, \nand to address longstanding issues surrounding aboriginal land claims. \nWhile he and I have not agreed on some issues, I have never questioned \nhis commitment to do what he believed was right for his State and its \npeople.\n  I know it can sound repetitive when people hear Senators make remarks \nsuch as these about our colleagues. But I think it is important for the \npublic to know that despite all the squabbling that goes on in \nWashington, there is the deep respect, affection, and caring that goes \non among the Senate's Members, who work side by side and day by day on \nthe Nation's business and on the concerns of their constituents.\n  I was last with Ted at Bob Byrd's funeral. I had asked him if he \nwould sit with me because we had not seen each other for a while and it \ngave us a chance to get caught up. I told him again how much his \nfriendship meant to me and how much I missed him in the Senate. We \ntalked about the number of pieces of legislation we had worked on \ntogether and both spoke of Ted being part of the old school of \nSenators--those who always stuck with agreements they had made and our \nconcern that was not the way some were today. It was a sad day being at \na memorial service, but it was a special day being with Ted.\n  Ted was a statesman, a public servant, and one of my closest friends \nin the Senate. I consider myself fortunate to have known him and served \nwith him.\n  Marcelle and I wish Catherine and all his family our best wishes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Senator \nTed Stevens, who will be laid to rest today at Arlington National \nCemetery. Unfortunately, Senator Stevens was taken from us on August 9 \nof this year, but his legacy will live on through the countless lives \nhe touched during his distinguished career in public service.\n  Senator Stevens will be missed by so many because of the tenacity he \ndisplayed fighting for his beliefs. This began when he volunteered for \nthe Army Air Corps during World War II, where he supplied Chinese \nforces as\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nthey defended their country from Japanese invasion. For his heroism, \nTed Stevens received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.\n  Senator Stevens took this same tenacity to the Senate where he served \nthe people of Alaska for over 40 years. It is largely because of \nSenator Stevens that many Alaskans gained access to clean drinking \nwater and their children received a quality education. Finally, Senator \nStevens fought to create an oil pipeline that put thousands of Alaskans \nto work and provided affordable energy for this Nation. These \naccomplishments are just a sample of the many issues that Senator \nStevens championed during his long career.\n  By the time I came to the Senate in 1998, I knew Ted Stevens was an \noutstanding legislator, but over the next 10 years, I learned so much \nmore that defined his character. I found that Ted Stevens was one of \nthe most sincere members of this Chamber. No matter what the issue, I \ncould always count on Senator Stevens to speak with frankness and \nhonesty, two traits that are sorely lacking in the modern Senate.\n  I also learned that despite his dedication to the Senate, he always \nput family first. Senator Stevens was the father to six children, and \nalthough there is over 4,000 miles that separates Alaska from our \nNation's Capital, he always made time for his wife and children. I \nrealize my words are little consolation to his wife Catherine or the \nrest of his family, but I hope they know Mary and I are grieving with \nthem as they cope with the loss of this model family man.\n  The Senate was blessed to have Ted Stevens as one of its Members. His \ncountless accomplishments guarantee him a prominent place in the \npantheon of American history. I was fortunate to have him as my \ncolleague for over 10 years, but even luckier to have him as a friend.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to not only a \ngiant of the Senate, a hero to Alaska, and a war hero, but also someone \nI counted among my valued friends, and a true mentor--Ted Stevens.\n  When I first heard the news about Ted's death, I was shocked and \nsaddened. Today, the loss of my dear friend is no easier to bear, and I \nknow many of my colleagues here feel the same.\n  Later today, we will lay to rest this giant of the Senate, but I \nfirst want to say a few words about my friend Ted.\n  Much has been said about Senator Stevens' sometimes grouchy and \nintimidating demeanor. But if you took the time to look past the Hulk \nties, the scowling countenance, the vigorous defense of any and all \nattacks on Alaskan priorities, and the cowed staff who feared they had \nfallen on the wrong side of the esteemed senior Senator, you saw \nanother more compassionate--some would even say softer side.\n  I was a lucky beneficiary of that softer side, which changed the \ncourse of my time here in Washington.\n  When I first arrived in Washington, DC, in 1987, my son was entering \nfirst grade at the same time as Ted's beloved daughter. Sam and Lily \nbecame fast friends, and, lucky for me, so did their parents.\n  Over the years, Ted and Catherine were very close friends of ours and \nlike godparents to Sam.\n  Anyone who knew Ted well knew how important his family was and the \nhigh value he placed on his children and their friends. He was truly a \nmost kind, gentle, and readily approachable father, uncle, and \ngodfather.\n  His concern about others' children and family members was equally \nheartfelt. As he exercised his many leadership roles, Senator Stevens' \nwas always willing to take our family obligations into account. He \nrealized how important it is to schedule time for our families in the \nchaotic, hectic life we lead in the Senate.\n  In addition to the close personal friendship I enjoyed with the \nStevens family, I had the opportunity to work closely with Chairman \nStevens as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. As \nchairman, Ted was solicitous of the concerns of even his most junior \nmembers. He was also a devoted friend of his partner--sometimes ranking \nmember and sometimes chairman--Senator Dan Inouye.\n  Ted was a very passionate defender of the Appropriations Committee, \nits prerogatives, and its responsibilities. Woe unto the person who \nattacked the appropriations process or the work that he had done. We \ncould use more of that wisdom around here today.\n  As former President pro tempore and the longest serving Republican \nMember of the U.S. Senate in our country's 230-year history, Ted was a \nfaithful and dedicated leader of the Senate.\n  But Senator Stevens' influence extended far beyond the Senate to \nAlaska, the Nation and the world.\n  Many of the accomplishments of the Senate over the last 4 decades \nbear the mark of Ted Stevens.\n  As a war hero himself, Ted was tireless in his leadership to secure a \nstrong military--and funded a strong personnel system, the most needed, \nup-to-date equipment and the most promising research. The current \nstrength and superiority of the U.S. Armed Forces is due in no small \npart to Senator Stevens.\n  He was a leader in the natural resources, transportation issues, and \nclimate change issues important to all of America but that particularly \naffect his home State.\n  Ted was passionate about Alaska--its natural beauty, its people, its \nneeds, and its fishing. Many of us have enjoyed traveling to Alaska \nwith Senator Stevens and discovering firsthand the treasures it has to \noffer.\n  The many roads, parks, and buildings named for him are but a hint of \nall he has done for the State. His contributions are extensive and \nlasting, from improving the infrastructure to safeguarding the wildlife \nand natural resources Alaska has in abundance.\n  Alaskans rightly dubbed the Senator the ``Alaskan of the Twentieth \nCentury.''\n  It was a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \ncolleague, our friend, and a great statesman, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber as we continue to mourn his \nloss.\n  Senator Stevens' service to our Nation began during his military \nservice during World War II as a ``Flying Tiger,'' and spanned six \ndecades.\n  During his 41 years in the Senate, Senator Stevens has been chairman \nof four full committees and two select committees, assistant Republican \nwhip, and the President pro tempore Emeritus.\n  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Stevens was an ardent \nsupporter of our national defense, serving as either Chairman or \nRanking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee from 1980 to \n2005. A champion of our Armed Forces, he ensured that our \nservicemembers have the equipment, training, and pay necessary to be \nprepared to take on those who threaten our national security.\n  Senator Stevens was not only my distinguished colleague but someone I \nconsidered a friend. He was a man of purpose whose life touched all \nthose with whom he came in contact. His commitment to the people of \nAlaska was remarkable, making him a legendary advocate for the State. \nNo one has done more for Alaska than he did. His many contributions to \nboth Alaska and our Nation will not soon be forgotten.\n  He will be remembered as a dedicated American, World War II warrior, \na public servant, and the quintessential American statesman who gave so \nmuch of his life in service to the Nation.\n  I offer my thoughts and prayers his family and friends during this \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \ncommitment of Senator Ted Stevens to the State of Alaska and to our \nNation.\n  As we all know, Ted joined the military at a young age and served his \ncountry with honor in World War II.\n  He earned his Army Air Corps wings in 1944 and served in World War II \nas a member of the Flying Tigers, for which he received the \nDistinguished Flying Cross.\n  Two friends of mine from Georgia who served with the Flying Tigers \nknew Ted during those days. When they shared with me stories of those \ntimes, they always spoke fondly of Ted.\n  Several years ago, I attended a funeral of a family member of one of \nour Senate colleagues on the west coast. A few other Senators were in \nattendance, but not many. One of those nights we stayed up late and \nstarted talking\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nabout life, and Ted told us he always attended the funerals of \ncolleagues and their loved ones because when his first wife was \ntragically killed in a plane crash, those colleagues who took the \neffort to make the trip up to Alaska to attend her funeral meant so \nmuch to him.\n  That is the type of person Ted was--he was loyal to the State of \nAlaska, his Nation, and to his colleagues.\n  Ted and I also worked closely on defense issues and he was a good \nally to have in those battles.\n  He was a good friend and an esteemed colleague who served with \ndistinction in the Senate.\n  Ted will be remembered for his passion and his many, many years of \nservice to his constituents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today one of the most enduring figures in \nthis Nation's political history and the history of this Chamber will be \nlaid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. For more than half a \ncentury, it was almost impossible to discuss the State of Alaska \nwithout discussing Theodore Fulton ``Ted'' Stevens.\n  Like many, Ted Stevens came to Alaska from elsewhere, searching for \nopportunity to serve. Few succeed as well as he did. He was named a \nFederal prosecutor just months after he arrived in Alaska in 1953--\nmeaning his public service to Alaska predated its statehood. He was a \nkey figure in the drive for statehood. He served in the State \nlegislature before coming to this Chamber in 1968.\n  Over the next four decades, he became one of the most influential \nSenators of the 20th century. Alaska was a young State with a small \npopulation, but that did not stop Ted Stevens from advocating \nforcefully and effectively on his State's behalf. He became the longest \nserving Republican in the history of the Senate, and the State he \nfought for became a huge beneficiary of his service.\n  He was a World War II veteran and a devoted family man. History will \nremember him as one of those present at the founding of Alaskan \nstatehood and a longtime servant of the State. Barbara and I know that \nthe memory of Ted Stevens' long and full life will relieve the sadness \nof his family, his constituents, and his multitude of friends at his \npassing.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have just returned from the interment \nservices for our colleague and our friend, the Senator from Alaska, Ted \nStevens.\n  I must say it should be pointed out that our Chaplain, Chaplain \nBlack, gave a marvelous eulogy during the graveside services that was \npoignant, elegant, and I know in regard to helping the family with \nsolace and poignancy, he had no equal. He simply was absolutely \nmarvelous. He described Ted Stevens as a ``force of nature''--which I \nthink was a rather appropriate description, depending on your \ndescription of a force of nature--and as a person who always made him \nlaugh. Well, it is difficult to try to figure out how to eulogize a \nperson of Ted's stature, someone who has done so many different things. \nSo you have to sort of segment, it seems to me, your own personal \nrelationship with Ted and do the best you can to grasp this unusual man \nand describe him.\n  I was a Member of the House when I first met Ted Stevens. It was at a \nRepublican retreat years ago. In expressing his opinion, he was \nobstreperous, if not outrageous, regardless of any other person's point \nof view. To say he was both unique and memorable is an understatement--\na force of nature, indeed, perhaps a wandering tornado, if you will, \nwith a poststorm rainbow of ideas.\n  I came to the Senate back in 1996. It didn't take long for Ted \nStevens to burst into my--up to that point--relatively routine \nsenatorial life. He jabbed his finger on my chest and said, ``I know \nwho you are.'' I responded, ``Well, I sure as hell know who you are.'' \nHe said, ``You allegedly know something about agriculture.'' I said, \n``Well, thank you,'' and he interrupted and said, ``You serve on Armed \nServices and Intelligence?'' I said, ``That's right.'' He said, ``How \nwould you like to go to the Russian Far East with me and Danny and some \nothers?''\n  I thought to myself, Why on Earth would I want to go to the Russian \nFar East?\n  He said, ``We are going to Khabarovsk, and then we are going to \nVladivostok.'' But that's out there where the Cossacks went over the \nsteppes of Russia. ``Then we are going to meet with the admiral of the \nRussian navy, and Vladivostok is closer to Alaska than to Moscow. I \nknow him,'' said Ted. ``Then we are going to go to South Korea to \nindicate our strong support. But then we are going to be the first \ndelegation allowed into North Korea, Pyongyang.''\n  Well, that got my attention. He said, ``That is why I need to have \nyou come along, because if we can arrange a third-party grain sale, \nthere are things that we can do in North Korea to at least establish a \nrelationship.''\n  I thought, what a unique idea, using agriculture as a tool for peace, \nif you will--or at least a fulcrum to change the relationship with \nNorth Korea. I said, ``Well, sure, I will sign up.''\n  That began a personal and meaningful relationship with Ted and \nCatherine and their family with Franki and our family that lasted \nduring the duration of my career in the Senate until his untimely death \nweeks ago.\n  He said, ``I understand that you are a newspaper guy.'' I said, \n``Yes, and?'' He said, ``You could be the scribe in regard to our \nCODEL.'' I might add that any CODEL you went on with Ted Stevens, you \nalways had a T-shirt afterward saying: ``I survived CODEL Stevens.'' \nYou could--and I did--end up at the South Pole. So I was known as the \nStevens CODEL scribe.\n  In any case, we went to Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. We talked to that \nadmiral, who felt closer to Ted Stevens than he did his own Russian \nGovernment, and we went to Sakhalin Island. Ted was trying to work out \nsome kind of arrangement where American oil companies could explore and \ndevelop the tremendous oil reserves there and have a contract that \nmeant something with Russia. It was there that Flying Tiger Ted learned \nabout saber-toothed tigers that were allegedly actually still alive in \nthat part of the world. It is a wonder he didn't schedule a hunting \ntrip.\n  Then we went to South Korea and eventually into North Korea, and it \nwas the first delegation allowed into that theocratic time warp. We \nleft everything on the plane. We stayed at an alleged VIP \nheadquarters--no heat, very cold, just North Korean TV with 24/7 \nmilitary parades and martial music.\n  That night the discussion had gone on and on and on. We had hoped to \nmeet with Kim Jong Il. That was not possible, so he sent two of his \npropaganda puppets to meet with us. We had permission from the Treasury \nto waive certain requirements so that we could arrange for a third-\nparty grain sale to assist North Korea, which goes through a famine \nevery harvesting year. It would have been at least a start.\n  So you had Ted and Danny Inouye, two World War II veterans, who told \nthe North Korean delegation it was time to make Panmunjon a tourist \nattraction. Ted finally had it and said, ``Knock off the BS. I know you \nunderstand English. Let's get to the bottom line.'' The bottom line was \nthat they could not do anything in terms of policy. They were there to \nmake an intelligence estimate, and it was a lost opportunity at that \nparticular time. The leadership effort by Ted Stevens didn't pan out, \nbut not for the lack of trying.\n  On another CODEL we landed at 11 and got to the hotel at about \nmidnight. Ted was a great connoisseur of military history and movies. \nHe was a great devotee of the series ``Band of Brothers.'' So we were \nplaying Band of Brothers to staff and to all present. This is at 12:30 \nat night, going on to 1, 1:30. We had fought and died with episode \nfive; we were going to episode six. I looked around, and all the loyal \nstaff were asleep; all Members were still there and were asleep. I was \nhaving a hard time keeping my eyes open. I looked over at the great \nman, and his eyes were closed. I thought he was asleep, so I got up and \nstarted to turn off the television. As I reached for the power button, \nhe said, ``This next part is the best part.'' He was not watching it; \nhe was listening to it because he had seen it at least three times. \nWell, needless to say, we saw episode six in its entirety. Thank the \nLord, we didn't go to episode seven. We would have been there all \nnight.\n  Some years ago, I was present for the ceremonies in Alaska when Ted \nwas named the ``Alaskan of the Century.'' How on Earth could a sitting \nSenator,\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nor anybody, get overwhelming citizen support and approval and accolades \nfrom his State and be named ``Alaskan of the Century''? Ted did. I was \nthere to allegedly roast him. There was a great crowd. Facts and \nrecords are stubborn things. He was and is still today the ``Alaskan of \nthe Century.'' What he did and what he accomplished in the making of \nour 49th State was simply remarkable. By the way, the Federal \nGovernment still has not made good on many promises they made to Ted \nwhen he worked so hard and diligently to make Alaska a State.\n  At any rate, he flew in, during that ceremony, on a World War II \nplane. He had his combat jacket. He came in with Catherine and they \ntook their places on very posh chairs. I will quote what he said time \nand time again to the people of Alaska: ``The hell with politics; let's \ndo what's good for Alaska.''\n  I will add this: The country and our national defense and every man \nand woman in uniform owe this man a great debt.\n  When you come to this body and you come to public service, you know \nyou risk your ideas, your thoughts, your hopes, and your dreams before \nthe crowd. Sometimes the crowd says yes, and you have friends who will \nstand behind you when you are taking the bows. Then perhaps something \nhappens in your life and you suddenly become a lightning rod for \naccusations; you wonder where your friends are, who will stand beside \nyou when you are taking the boos, not the bows. The lightning rod was \nfast, furious, and egregious, especially considering the man, his \naccomplishments, and integrity.\n  In Washington, when there is crisis and chaos and big-time problems, \nmany are called but few are chosen. When the chips were on the table, \nwe chose Ted. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he \nheaded up the posse that decided the Nation's spending priorities. What \na tough job. It was a tough job then, and it is even tougher today. But \nhe did a heck of a job. For, you see, Members of Congress are a lot \nlike someone suffering from the flu, an insatiable appetite on one end \nand no sense of responsibility on the other.\n  They said: Ted, Ted, I know we have to meet our budget caps, but this \nprogram is really important to me. My program is an investment, not a \ncost.\n  Somehow, someway, the chairman has to wade through all of the demands \nof his colleagues, try to meet the ever changing and growing needs of \nour Nation at an unprecedented time of economic challenge, and through \nall of it, then he must fulfill our obligations to guarantee our \nnational security and to the many entitlement programs we are very \nreluctant to reform in this body and the other body and to which we \nAmericans seem to think we are entitled. It is like herding cats, big \ncats with saber teeth, just like those up on Sakhalin Island. In the \ndoing of this, Ted Stevens was surrounded by many colleagues good at \nproposing more spending on existing programs and new programs to boot \nand those who look at any spending increase with a gleam in their eye \nand the tools of a stonecutter.\n  There are few, however, who can measure value, and that is what Ted \ndid. Just at the time he thought he could make both ends meet in behalf \nof Alaska and our Nation, someone moved the chains. To his critics--and \nthere were many--the old saying ``a penny for your thoughts'' may be a \nfair evaluation of their contribution. The wheels of progress are \nseldom turned by cranks, critics, or, in Ted's case, a howling pack of \nwolves.\n  Today, both political parties are having trouble looking beyond their \nideological fences. Ted Stevens was a bipartisan fence-mender while \nriding herd on all of the strays. How on Earth did he do this? How did \nhe persevere throughout an ordeal that would have best the best of men?\n  Abraham Lincoln defined duty in this way:\n\n       I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I \n     mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out \n     all right, what is said against me will not amount to \n     anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing \n     I was right would make no difference.\n\n  During Ted's memorial service in his beloved Alaska, Vice President \nBiden's tribute was truly eloquent, personal, and pertinent. Others \nspoke with equal meaning. But it was Senator Danny Inouye, his best \nfriend, who brought thousands to their feet at this service, clapping \nfor minutes when he said: ``We all knew he was innocent.'' So did 10 \nangels and those who knew him best, and I think Ted heard them both.\n  Thank you, Catherine and Ted's family, for sharing him with us, and, \nas Vice President Biden said so well, we will not see the likes of him \nagain.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nrecognize our late colleague, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Ted Stevens was a fighter. He fought for his State and his country \nevery day here in the U.S. Senate. As a former military pilot and \nrecipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross, Senator Stevens was a \nchampion for the military here in the Senate. And he fought for the \nprerogatives of this institution, sometimes taking on politically \nunpopular causes to make the Senate stronger.\n  All of my colleagues will remember when Ted Stevens managed \nlegislation. He would put on his ``Incredible Hulk'' tie, his best \nscowl to deter Members from offering amendments, and dare anyone to get \nin the way of passing his bills.\n  Ted knew Alaska inside and out, and he did everything he could to \nmake his State a better place for future generations of Alaskans. He \nrecognized that in isolated, rural States the Federal Government was \nsometimes the only entity capable of truly transforming the lives of \nindividuals and the prosperity of communities.\n  And he recognized that other states sometimes faced similar \ncircumstances.\n  I will never forget the role Ted Stevens played during the Grand \nForks flooding of 1997. The Red River overtopped the levee that year \nand covered most of the city, including all of downtown. And the \nflooding caused a major fire in the historic downtown, further \ndevastating the community. At the time, the evacuation of Grand Forks \nwas the largest evacuation of a city since the Civil War.\n  In the aftermath, the city could have accepted a diminished future. \nIt could have watched people leave and reemerged as a shadow of its \nformer self. But it did not. The city's leaders pledged to rebuild. And \nthe North Dakota delegation went to work here in the Congress to secure \nFederal assistance to help make that vision a reality. We quickly \nconcluded that community development block grant funding would be the \nbest source of assistance because CDBG money is very flexible and could \nbe used to meet the city's highest priority needs. Unfortunately, the \nAppropriations Subcommittee chairman at the time was adamantly opposed. \nHe simply refused to support the level of CDBG funding we badly needed.\n  Normally, that might have been the end of the story. But in this \ncase, Ted Stevens, the full Appropriations Committee chairman, \nintervened. He saw that Federal funding was absolutely critical for the \ncommunity to rebuild. I think maybe he saw a city in North Dakota that \nneeded funding just as badly as many of his Alaska communities needed \nFederal funding to build a brighter tomorrow. And he overruled his \nsubcommittee chairman and made sure that Grand Forks got the CDBG \nfunding it needed.\n  The results have been spectacular. Grand Forks did rebuild bigger and \nbetter than ever. When some say that Federal spending is wasteful, \nGrand Forks is a tremendous example of how the Federal Government can \nmake things better.\n  So it was with profound sorrow that I learned last month that Ted \nStevens had died in a plane crash on a fishing trip in his beloved \nState. His country owes him thanks for his long service to his Nation, \nboth in the military and here in the Congress. The State of North \nDakota and the city of Grand Forks owe him thanks for his role in \nbringing needed funding to projects all across our State.\n  Lucy and I send our deepest condolences to his wife Catherine, his \nfamily, and his friends. Ted was one of a kind. We will miss him.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today at Arlington National Cemetery the \nfinal resting place for so many national heroes, the burial service of \nour friend and former distinguished colleague, Ted Stevens of Alaska, \nwas attended by\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\na large number of friends. It was my honor and privilege to serve as a \nMember of the Senate with Ted Stevens. From him I learned the \nimportance of hard work and seriousness of purpose that characterized \nhis exemplary service in this body.\n  He was energetic and tenacious, and he used those assets to \naccomplish so much for the people of his State. His quick wit and \ncapacity for hard work were formidable assets that enabled him to get \nthings done for his country and his fellow citizens of Alaska.\n  It was a special pleasure to visit Alaska with him and especially to \nparticipate in his annual Kenai River fishing tournament which raised \nmoney for the preservation of that river and the unique beauty of its \nriver basin.\n  Alaska and our Nation have lost a great leader and a true patriot, \nand I have lost a highly valued friend.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it wasn't an hour ago that we saw the \nlofty formation of four jets flying in formation over the burial site \nof Ted Stevens. Then, just as it passes over the site, one of the jets \nheads up, breaks formation, and heads into the sky above the others. It \nis such a memorable moment. I have seen this now twice, this formation. \nIt is so memorable for me on this particular occasion because it is \nabout a man who is so memorable.\n  Senator Ted Stevens served in this body for many years and is ``Mr. \nAlaska'' to this Nation's Capital and to many of the people in his home \nState. He is one of those soaring, towering figures who served in this \nbody. He died at age 86 in a tragic accident, but he leaves a memory \nand a legacy that won't be forgotten.\n  One of the things I find so endearing about the memory of Ted Stevens \nis his tenacity in his work and his belief in the body. This guy would \nfight tirelessly for his State, for his beliefs, and for this body. He \ndid it for a lengthy period of time through a number of different \nadministrations and was an institution in and of his own right in what \nhe did. I know the Presiding Officer, who works in this body and has \nserved in this body, is someone who remembers Ted Stevens similarly.\n  I didn't realize some of the other aspects the Chaplain of the Senate \ntalked about. There were about 6 years when Ted was President pro \ntempore of the Senate, so he would open the Senate every day. He would \nopen the Senate, pledge allegiance to the flag, and then came the \nprayer. Senator Stevens at that time would go to the Chaplain and say: \nLet's bring up the prayer pressure, Chaplain--really urging him and us \nforward and to do things better and better for this country. It is a \nmarvelous legacy to think about and to know about.\n  One of the beauties of serving in this body--and this is my last year \nin this body--is the people you get to meet and get to know. One thing \nthat is always so striking to me is that while we deal with policy \nissues all the time, it is the people whom you touch who are so \nimportant and so critical. I think too often we look at it as a policy \ndebate when I think we really should be looking at people's \nrelationships. I say that from the standpoint that we need to be better \nin working together.\n  Ted Stevens had a beautiful relationship with Chairman Inouye across \nthe aisle in the Appropriations Committee. It is often those \nrelationships that get things done. People lament in leaving this body \nthat it has gotten less civil, it is this or it is that. My analysis is \nthat it has gotten less relational, and that is the real problem, is \nthat people don't have relationships across the aisle with people whom \nthey talk with and with whom they are friends. They disagree. They \ndisagree on a lot of different things. They disagree probably on most \nthings that are voted on. Yet when it comes to the end of the day and \nwe have to get something moving and done, it is that relationship of \ntrust and that here is a person who is a friend that you can work with \nis what counts. I think that is what we really need to look at much \nmore, the relational needs. It is not something you can artificially \ndo. It is something that has to take place over a period of time. It is \nsomething that has to take place over probably a period of a series of \nprojects where, after a period of time, you say, you know, this is a \nperson whom I can work with, whom I relate well with, and whom I trust. \nI think it is that trust that gets things done at the end of the day. \nIt is that sort of thing you could often see in Ted Stevens.\n  Whenever Ted Stevens gave his word, you knew it was going to happen. \nIf he had any way of doing it, it would be according to what he said. I \nhad a friend of mine who once said that when a man breaks his word, it \nbreaks the man. You could look at Ted Stevens and the guy was \nconsistent; if he said he was going to do something, it was something \nhe would stand with, and that is a good trait.\n  I bring these memories of Ted to the floor at a time when we have \njust witnessed the jet fly up toward the sky in memory of Ted Stevens \nand of his spirit and of his relational nature that he had within this \nbody, with people he knew and who knew him, who trusted him and whom he \ntrusted. I really commemorate that way of service, that time of \nservice. I also commend to Members continuing in this body that we be a \nlot more relational and intentional about relating to one another so \nthat we really look for those chances to do that.\n  God bless you, Ted Stevens.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to the survivors, \ncertainly, of that terrible plane crash that took Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this afternoon at Arlington National \nCemetery, this Nation laid to rest a great American, a great patriot, \nan extraordinary Senator, Ted Stevens.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Senator Stevens for 13 years. In \nthat time, he impressed not only myself but everyone with his deep \ncommitment to his State of Alaska, to the Nation and, in particular, to \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Ted Stevens began his commitment to service above self at the age of \n19, when he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. He became a pilot and at \nage 20 received his wings. Then he was deployed to the China-Burma-\nIndia theater, where he undertook some of the most dangerous missions \nany pilot had to face in World War II. He flew over the Hump. He flew \nsupplies to Chinese nationalist forces, and he would frequently fly \nbehind enemy lines to deliver his precious cargo and to keep that fight \ngoing. They would fly at night, and they would have to muffle the \nflights--their engines--to avoid detection by the Japanese. They would \nland and camouflage the planes, because they were in enemy territory, \nand then they would take another dangerous flight out in the evening--\nto return again and again. That kind of sacrifice and service and \ncourage is remarkable.\n  Also, typical of Ted Stevens, it was not something he boasted and \nbragged about a lot. He just did it. That was one of the great \nstrengths of Ted Stevens. He just did things he thought were right.\n  When he returned to the United States, he attended college. He went \noff to Harvard Law School and became a lawyer. Although he had \nmidwestern roots, he saw his future in the great State of Alaska. He \npacked up and went to Alaska, and Alaska changed him, but I suspect he \nchanged Alaska more. One of the things I believe he felt very strongly \nabout, having seen the great effort of World War II, having seen \ncitizens come together from across this land from different \ncommunities, different ethnicities and races, to forge a unified effort \nto do a great thing, he was convinced that government could make a \npositive and important contribution to the life of his community in \nAlaska. He worked very hard. He worked hard to build roads, to build \nbridges, to literally bring together the people of Alaska. He supported \nconsistently and enthusiastically the military forces--not just there \nbut across the globe. He too served, and he knew what these men and \nwomen were doing and how important it was.\n  Something also struck me, too, while I was at the services today. A \ngentlemen from New England came up to me and said, ``Hi, Senator.'' I \nwondered why he would be there. He was involved in the fishing industry \nin New England, and he appreciated what Senator Ted Stevens did for the \nfishing industry in Alaska, because he extended some of the same help \nto us in the Northeast. That was another thing about him. If he thought \nit was important enough for his constituents, he equally felt it\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nwas important for all people. He helped all of our constituents, and he \nwould do it in a positive way.\n  I always found Ted Stevens to be somebody who was clear on where he \nstood. If he was with you, you didn't have to worry. If he was against \nyou, you should worry. But he was consistent and honest. He represented \nthe values we all appreciate--candor, honesty, and decency.\n  Today, America has laid to rest a great patriot. To his family, our \ndeepest condolences. But what he has done--and not just for the people \nof Alaska but for all of us--has left an example of patriotism, of \ndiligence, of hard work, and of commitment to this Senate, which will \nsustain and inspire us in the difficult days ahead. For that, I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator Ted \nStevens, a great American.\n  Senator Stevens cared deeply for the people of Alaska, and all the \npeople of the United States of America.\n  He dedicated his career to the security and well being of this \ncountry, from his early days as an Army Air Corps pilot in World War II \nwhere he served multiple deployments across several continents, through \nhis long career here in the U.S. Senate, as the longest serving \nRepublican in the history of this institution.\n  Ted Stevens was a brother and a dear friend. We were ohana, family. \nWe worked together on so many issues to serve the needs of our \nnoncontiguous States.\n  Senator Stevens knew well the unique challenges both Alaska and \nHawaii face, as the newest States, farthest from the U.S. mainland.\n  Ted Stevens' love of Alaska is well known. But many people do not \nknow Ted was actually a great surfer, and he was a frequent visitor to \nHawaii. He loved to surf Kaimana Hila, Diamond Head, and Waikiki.\n  When his surfing days were over, he brought his favorite surfboard \nhere to Washington and displayed it in his Senate office, alongside the \nmany treasures from Alaska. Ted loved Hawaiian music and song, and I \nenjoyed singing with him.\n  Ted Stevens was a friend of America's first people. He constantly \nreminded the United States of its responsibility to its indigenous \npeople in Alaska, Hawaii, and across the country.\n  While the people of Alaska will always remember him, visitors to our \nNation's Capitol will also be reminded of Ted Stevens' work. Together \nwe were successful in moving the 1965 model of the Statue of Freedom \nout of storage and into its prominent place today in the Capitol \nVisitor Center Emancipation Hall.\n  Ted Stevens brought strength and passion to the Senate for many \ndecades. He was a constant presence in this institution.\n  My wife Millie and I send our warm aloha and deepest condolences to \nCatherine and all of Ted's family. I also want to extend my condolences \nto Senator Stevens' staff who worked tirelessly for him and for all of \nAlaska for so many years.\n  Aloha, farewell to Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening, as so many colleagues \nhave done, to pay tribute to and remember one of the Senate's most \nenduring Members, the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who was \nburied today. For 40 years, Senator Stevens represented the people of \nAlaska in this body with zeal, with dignity, with intellect, and with \nstrength.\n  Ted Stevens came in a small package, but he was indeed a giant--a \ngiant for Alaska and for the Senate. He helped to chart a course for \nAmerica's 49th State and our entire Nation through his vigorous \ndedication and passion. As one of the earliest proponents of statehood \nfor Alaska, Ted Stevens' legacy remains intertwined with Alaska's \ndevelopment. His pride in Alaska was unmatched.\n  Fighting on behalf of Alaska, Senator Stevens was instrumental in \ndeveloping America's energy policy and highlighting the incredible \nnatural resources available in our own country. He saw the danger posed \nby a lack of energy security for this country, and drawing on Alaska's \nvast resources, he tirelessly advocated American energy independence. \nHis work, including the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act of \n1973, created good jobs for Alaskans and helped supply the power \nAmerica desperately requires to fuel our economic growth.\n  A true American patriot who was concerned about U.S. security, \nSenator Stevens was determined that we maintain the ability to stand \nalone, if necessary, against the international forces of evil that plot \nour destruction. When it came to national defense, Ted Stevens \ndemonstrated his commitment at an early age, long before his days in \nthe Senate. I once heard Ted refer to the men and women of today's \nArmed Forces as ``the next greatest generation.'' He truly knew whereof \nhe spoke. At 19 years of age, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps, during \none of the darkest periods in American history. Having seen combat, Ted \nStevens knew what service, valor, and bravery meant, and he saw that in \nthe courageous men and women admirably serving now.\n  Retired Air Force COL Walter J. Boyne wrote a tribute to Senator \nStevens that appeared in the Washington Post on August 11. I will quote \nexcerpts from Colonel Boyne's memorable piece:\n\n       At age 20, Lt. Stevens flew twin-engine transports ``over \n     the Hump,'' carrying vital supplies from bases in India to \n     the Chinese armies resisting Japan. On these often-\n     unaccompanied missions, he had crossed the Himalayas; in \n     Asia, the mountains were higher than in Alaska, the weather \n     worse, and there was always the threat of a Japanese fighter \n     plane showing up to dispute the passage.\n\n  Boyne continues:\n\n       Young Lt. Stevens was probably disappointed to find himself \n     in the cockpit of a transport plane. He had completed flying \n     school at Douglas, Ariz., earning his wings by May 1944, and \n     probably expected to be assigned to Lockheed P-38 fighters. \n     The urgent requirement for transports dictated otherwise, \n     however, and he was assigned to the 322nd Troop Carrier \n     Squadron, part of the 14th Air Force commanded by Gen. Claire \n     Chennault.\n\n  Boyne writes:\n\n       While the route over the Himalayas demanded piloting skill \n     and endurance, Stevens also flew many missions within the \n     interior of China, some going behind Japanese lines, bringing \n     supplies in direct support of Chinese troops.\n\n  For his service, Stevens received two Distinguished Flying Crosses, \nwhich Boyne points out ``can be awarded to any member of the U.S. armed \nforces who distinguishes him or herself by `heroism or extraordinary \nachievement while participating in aerial flight.' ''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Aug. 11, 2010]\n\n                Ted Stevens: A Flier Who Faced the Risks\n\n                          (By Walter J. Boyne)\n\n       The crash of a famed ``bush'' aircraft, the de Havilland \n     DHC-3T Otter, near Aleknagik, Alaska, that killed former U.S. \n     senator Ted Stevens, 86, on Monday brought to a close a life \n     filled with the dangers of flying. Before Stevens began the \n     career in elected politics that culminated in 40 years in the \n     Senate, he left college to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps \n     in World War II. And in 1978, Stevens survived the crash of a \n     Learjet at the Anchorage airport in which his wife, Ann, was \n     killed.\n       Stevens had long accepted the hazards of flight in Alaska \n     as being part of the political scene. Doubtless he was one of \n     the few people who could fly over the state's rugged terrain \n     with serene confidence. He had often flown over far more \n     hostile territory during World War II.\n       At age 20, Lt. Stevens flew twin-engine transports ``over \n     the Hump,'' carrying vital supplies from bases in India to \n     the Chinese armies resisting Japan. On these often-\n     unaccompanied missions he had crossed the Himalayas; in Asia, \n     the mountains were higher than in Alaska, the weather worse, \n     and there was always the threat of a Japanese fighter plane \n     showing up to dispute the passage. For his dedication and \n     heroism flying the Hump and other flights behind Japanese \n     lines, Stevens was awarded the fourth-highest federal medal, \n     the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).\n       The ``Hump'' route had a more sinister nickname: the \n     ``Aluminum Trail,'' for all the aircraft wreckage that \n     glinted brightly when the sun made its rare appearances. \n     American pilots began flying the 530-mile route in 1942, \n     taking off from bases in India and Burma. In October that \n     year, all of the transport units operating in the theater \n     were brought into the 10th Air Force, by direct order of Gen. \n     Henry H. Arnold, chief of staff of the U.S. Army Air Forces.\n       The Douglas C-47 aircraft that were initially used strained \n     to reach and maintain the altitudes necessary to clear the \n     Himalayas. When the larger, more powerful (but more difficult \n     to fly) Curtiss C-46 was introduced to the 322nd in September \n     1944, it\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n     allowed slightly more margin for error. Yet the route took \n     its toll: At least 600 aircraft and more than 1,000 lives \n     were lost in the three years it was used. In 1945, airlift \n     needs ended when the Burma Road, from Lashio, India, to \n     Kunming, China, was reopened.\n       Young Lt. Stevens was probably disappointed to find himself \n     in the cockpit of a transport plane. He had completed flying \n     school at Douglas, Ariz., earning his wings by May 1944, and \n     probably expected to be assigned to Lockheed P-38 fighters. \n     The urgent requirement for transports dictated otherwise, \n     however, and he was assigned to the 322nd Troop Carrier \n     Squadron, now part of the 14th Air Force commanded by Gen. \n     Claire Chennault.\n       The unit was based primarily at Kunming, the original home \n     of Chennault's famous American Volunteer Group, the Flying \n     Tigers. The 322nd was equipped with the C-47 ``Skytrain,'' \n     which came to be known as the ``Gooney Bird.'' The C-47 had \n     been derived from the revolutionary Douglas DC-3 transport \n     and was used by the armed services until the 1970s.\n       In September 1944, Stevens later recalled, he transitioned \n     into the C-46, which after initial (and too often fatal) \n     troubles with its Curtiss Electric propellers, turned into an \n     aerial workhorse that substantially increased the capacity of \n     the 322nd to move supplies.\n       While the route over the Himalayas demanded piloting skill \n     and endurance, Stevens also flew many missions within the \n     interior of China, some going behind Japanese lines, bringing \n     supplies in direct support of Chinese troops. Stevens often \n     had to land at tiny camouflaged airports, some with primitive \n     crushed-stone runways that were narrower than the wingspan of \n     his plane. He flew throughout Indochina, over what is now \n     Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, and even made flights into \n     Mongolia. The 322nd was also tasked with bringing vital \n     supplies to the small American fighter bases that had sprung \n     up far from road or rail traffic.\n       On one 1945 trip to Beijing (then Peking), Stevens \n     encountered bad weather, and there was no local ground \n     control to assist him. He improvised a non-precision approach \n     using the local radio station and his plane's radio direction \n     equipment. After the war, he returned and found that the \n     approach he had devised was still being used.\n       The Distinguished Flying Cross, first awarded in 1927 to \n     Charles Lindbergh, can be awarded to any member of the U.S. \n     armed forces who distinguishes him or herself by ``heroism or \n     extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial \n     flight.'' While Stevens was also awarded the Air Medal and \n     the Yuan Hai medal by the Chinese Nationalist government, he \n     surely must have been most proud of his DFC.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Only 3 years before Senator Stevens earned his wings, \nPilot Officer John Gillespie Magee, Jr., of the Royal Canadian Air \nForce composed a poem after being struck by the sheer wonder of flying \na test flight at 30,000 feet. This poem was sent home to John Magee's \nparents just a few days before his death. It is entitled ``High \nFlight.''\n  I will close with those words in remembrance of an American hero, \nSenator Ted Stevens:\n\n     ``Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth\n     ``And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\n     ``Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth\n     ``Of sun-split clouds--and done a hundred things\n     ``You have not dreamed of--wheeled and soared and swung\n     ``High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there\n     ``I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung\n     ``My eager craft through footless halls of air.\n     ``Up, up the long delirious, burning blue,\n     ``I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace\n     ``Where never lark, or even eagle flew--\n     ``And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod\n     ``The high untresspassed sanctity of space,\n     ``Put out my hand and touched the face of God.''\n\n  On August 9, 2010, Ted Stevens slipped the bonds of Earth one final \ntime. He died, literally and figuratively, with his boots on, among \nfriends, enjoying the rugged and dangerous beauty of nature and of the \nState of loved. We will miss his leadership and his friendship and the \nNation will long be indebted to him for his lifetime of service.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Ted Stevens was as dedicated to his State as \nanyone to ever serve in this body. From his fight for Alaska's \nstatehood to the four decades he represented that State in the U.S. \nSenate, he never forgot where he came from or who elected him.\n  Although he set the record as the longest-serving Republican Senator \nin American history, his legacy is not measured by his longevity but by \nthe indelible impact he had on Alaska.\n  He made much of that impact during from his time on the \nAppropriations Committee, and I learned a lot from working with him \nthere. He once gave me a necktie with a picture of ``The Incredible \nHulk'' on it as a token of his appreciation for my work on an \nappropriations bill. It was his unique way of saying ``thank you,'' and \nit meant a lot to me. I still have that tie.\n  Public service was more than a career for Senator Stevens; it was his \nlife's calling. He served his country from halfway around the globe, \nfighting with the Flying Tigers in World War II, and served his State \nfrom clear across the continent when he came to the U.S. Senate. But no \nmatter how far away from home, he always kept it close to his heart.\n  Senator Stevens loved flying, loved the outdoors, and loved his \nState. He died doing what he loved, and his footprint will forever be \nvisible across the Last Frontier.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7580-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3816, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider Calendar No. 578, S. 3816, a \n     bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create \n     American jobs and to prevent the offshoring of such jobs \n     overseas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, between the two leaders or their \ndesignees prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will be \nvoting on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to a \nbill that has been mislabeled the ``Creating American Jobs and Ending \nOffshoring Act.''\n  The part of the bill that is attracting the most attention is the \nrepeal of deferral for the income of foreign subsidiaries for importing \ninto the United States. Deferral is the policy that allows U.S. \ncorporations to defer paying U.S. tax on the earnings of its foreign \nsubsidiaries until those earnings are sent back to the United States \nwhen, at that point, they are going to be taxed just like every other \ncorporate income.\n  In general, deferral is not allowed if the income is earned offshore \nand the reason for it being offshore is solely to avoid tax. What is \nbad about the bill is it would deny deferral for income that a foreign \nsubsidiary legitimately earns from the sale of goods into the U.S. \nmarket.\n  The problem is that there has been no finding that such income is \nearned outside the United States by a motivation to simply avoid U.S. \ntaxes. So this bill is completely contrary to a whole half century of \nbipartisan thinking as to when it is appropriate to deny deferral and \nwhen it is not. That bipartisanship goes back to President John F. \nKennedy's administration, when there was a bipartisan agreement within \nthe Congress and between the President and the Congress that this is \nthe tax policy we should have to make American manufacturing \ncompetitive with foreign competition.\n  To the contrary, there are obviously many reasons for a foreign \nsubsidiary of a U.S. corporation selling goods into the United States. \nThere could be a need to be near to a certain overseas market or the \ngood in question may not be found in appreciable quantities within the \nUnited States. Yesterday, I referred to chromium not being available in \nthe United States, as one example.\n  There could be many reasons having nothing to do with tax policy. But \nthe sponsors of this bill don't seem to understand that fact, that \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\nmanufacturing ought to be competitive with overseas competition or, \nobviously, we are going to lose business and lose jobs in the process \nor perhaps the bill's sponsors would admit that curbing tax avoidance \nis not the point. Perhaps they would instead claim it is all about an \neffort to create American jobs.\n  That would be a very good goal, but it is unlikely to create jobs. I \nfear it would have the opposite effect. The bill may lead to fewer \nheadquarters jobs in the United States, if a corporation, for \nuncompetitive reasons, decided to move totally offshore and take those \nheadquarters jobs with them. The bill could lead to a loss of American \njobs assembling finished products from parts assembled outside the \nUnited States.\n  In the words of the late Senator Moynihan, who was, for a long time, \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in speaking in opposition to \nthis very same proposal 14 years ago:\n\n       Investment abroad that is not tax driven is good for the \n     United States.\n\n  In other words, what he is saying there is, if there is investment \nabroad but it is not solely to avoid U.S. taxation but has economic \nsubstance behind it, that is good for the United States.\n  He did not say this. Contrariwise, if there is money offshore simply \nto avoid U.S. taxation, then obviously that is wrong. As an example, \nSenator Baucus and I have been involved in the Stanley Corporation \ndoing that 6, 7 years ago, and we plugged those loopholes.\n  I agree with Senator Baucus when he was recently quoted as to this \nbill saying:\n\n       I think it puts the United States at a competitive \n     disadvantage. That's why I'm concerned.\n\n  If there is any doubt about whether I agree with that statement of \nSenator Baucus, the Democratic leader of our committee, I agree with \nSenator Baucus.\n  In addition, there are procedural defects concerning this bill. I \nwish to start this part of my remarks by relying on a statement Senator \nReid said to me privately--he might deny he made this statement, but \nsoon after the 2006 election, when the Senate became a Democratic \nmajority rather than a Republican majority, he said something like this \nto me: You and Senator Baucus work so well together. I want you to know \nI am going to let the committees continue to function as they always \nhave, particularly in your case because you have such a close working \nrelationship.\n  With that as background, things have changed very recently so that \nevery bill seems to be written in Senator Reid's office, not in \ncommittee.\n  This bill before us has not been vetted by the Finance Committee. \nDoes anyone believe that if my friend the chairman were to put this \nbill before the Finance Committee, it would be approved in the form it \nis right now? If the idea in this bill had the kinds of merits claimed \nby their proponents, then they should welcome the Finance Committee \nreviewing it. Let members ask questions as they review the language. \nTest the strength of ideas through the committee process.\n  The Democratic leadership has short-circuited the opportunity to \nmethodically test the bill as good tax policy. Unfortunately, this \nprocess defect has been more the rule than the exception. Since the \nstimulus bill in January of 2009, the Finance Committee has only marked \nup one tax policy bill, and that was the health care reform bill.\n  My sense is the Democratic leadership simply does not want this bill \nto undergo scrutiny of a regular-order process--in other words, the way \nthe Senate normally does business. This bill is presented as a ``take \nit or leave it'' proposition. Republicans are not supporting cloture \nbecause they are not being offered the opportunity to amend this bill \nwith amendments that go to the supposed purposes of the bill. No \namendments are allowed on any tax incentives for job creation. No \namendments are allowed on measures to prevent offshoring of jobs. In \nother words, the Senate being a deliberative body of a bicameral \nCongress--and, obviously, the House is not a deliberative body--the \npurpose of this body is being neutered by the procedure this bill is \ngoing through. For instance, I have amendments dealing directly with \nthe offshoring of jobs. They are bipartisan amendments. But if I vote \nfor cloture, I have no assurance from the Democratic leadership that \nthese amendments will be in order. I will describe these amendments.\n  The first amendment mirrors a bill the junior Senator from Vermont \nand I have coauthored. It is the Employ America Act. It would prevent \nany companies engaged in the mass layoff of American labor from \nimporting cheaper labor from abroad through temporary guest worker \nprograms if they lay somebody off.\n  The second amendment I filed today mirrors a bill the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, a Democrat, and I have worked on for several years. It \nis the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2009. It would improve two key \nvisa provisions while rooting out abuse while making sure Americans \nhave the first chance of obtaining high-skilled jobs in this country.\n  Many Americans are unemployed. Yet we still allow companies to import \nthousands of foreign workers. These businesses should be asked to look \nfirst at Americans to fill those jobs, and they should be held \naccountable for displacing Americans to hire cheaper foreign labor.\n  These two amendments go directly to the concerns about job creation \nand the prevention of offshoring of U.S. jobs. Both amendments are \nbipartisan. Yet if cloture is invoked, these amendments would fall on \nthe Senate cutting room floor.\n  Furthermore, I have no confidence, even if the Democratic leadership \nwere to follow regular order for floor purposes, that we could expect \nanything like a conference committee to work out the issues between the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  In sum, the bill's substance would more likely lead to an increase in \noffshoring of American jobs and would make American companies less \nglobally competitive. The bill's procedure is very irregular and not in \nthe thoughtful traditions that so dignify the Senate.\n  For purposes of the contents of the amendments, as well as this \nprocedure, I ask that we vote against this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today asking that we vote to \nproceed to this measure so that we can have a full discussion and \ndebate and work on the issues that are so important to middle-class \nfamilies related to incentives for jobs being shipped overseas versus \nincentives to have jobs in America.\n  I agree with my distinguished colleague from Iowa--we have worked \ntogether on many issues--that there is a larger set of issues. It is \nvery important that in the next Congress we focus on comprehensive tax \nreform. Permanently extending the research and development tax credit, \nas the President has proposed, which I strongly support, is very \nimportant to us for long-term innovation and the ability to invest in \nAmerica. I believe it is important to have fair trade agreements, \nagreements that are enforced. When we look at a country such as South \nKorea, where our manufacturers have been blocked from selling into \nSouth Korea, where automakers have been at a disadvantage, we need to \nmake sure those issues are fixed before that trade agreement or any \ntrade agreement moves forward. There are many issues on which we need \nto focus under the whole commitment that we want to export products, \nnot jobs.\n  I will talk about specifically what is in this bill, this piece of \nit, because this goes to the question of whether, in Michigan or in any \nState, if there is a decision made to close operations and take it to \nanother country, lay off people in Michigan and move those jobs \noverseas, whether the workers, their families, Americans should \nsubsidize that through a tax system that provides that you can take a \ndeduction, a loss, or a credit for amounts paid in connection with \nreducing or ending an operation in America if you are starting the same \nkind of operation overseas--in other words, shipping your jobs \noverseas. Right now, you shut down, you get business tax deductions for \nwhat it costs you to shut down the operation and start it up somewhere \nelse. To add insult to injury, we have\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nworkers training folks to take their place. We heard over and over what \na challenging, humiliating, angering situation that is for too many of \nour workers.\n  The question is, on this policy, knowing there is much more that \nneeds to be done, which I support--and I do support looking at the \nentire tax system and how we are competing in a global economy and \nmaking sure our businesses in America have every advantage, every \nopportunity to compete successfully. But the question is, the single \nquestion on this vote that is coming up very shortly is whether we are \ngoing to allow companies that shut down operations and start similar \noperations abroad to write off their American taxes, whether the same \npeople who are losing their jobs are going to have to help pay for the \njobs going overseas. That is No. 1. We say no. We say that as a basic \npremise, that is wrong.\n  No. 2, the question is whether we should end Federal tax subsidies \nthat reward firms that move their production overseas under something \ncalled deferral. This bill says no.\n  No. 3, the question is whether we are going to provide incentives--\namong many incentives we have and need to have--whether we will say: If \nin the next 3 years you as a company choose to bring back jobs from \noverseas and hire Americans, we want to provide an incentive by giving \na 24-month, a 2-year payroll tax holiday for those workers--if you are \nbringing jobs back from overseas.\n  That is simply what this is. It is not everything, but it is a very \nimportant piece of the puzzle. That is what this is all about.\n  For me, this is a fight about whether we are going to make products \nin America. If we make a commitment, as we have begun to do through the \nRecovery Act, through the advanced manufacturing tax credit, through \nthe focus on manufacturing that has begun to get business moving again, \nwe are going to have the ability to make it in America. And when we \nmake it in America, we are going to make a lot of it in Michigan. The \nreason I am very committed to strengthening our manufacturing base is \nbecause I know that is going to strengthen Michigan because we have the \nengineers, we have the skilled workforce, we have the know-how, we have \nthe innovation and the ingenuity. If we make it in America, we are \ngoing to be making a lot of that in Michigan.\n  We are committed more broadly to doing that. We cannot have a middle \nclass if we do not make products. If we do not make products and grow \nproducts and add value to it as a country, we will not have a middle \nclass. The reason we are losing our middle class is because there has \nbeen in the last decade much more interest in how cheaply we can buy \nsomething rather than where it is made. Every other country has \nunderstood that it matters where it is made. China thinks it matters \nwhere it is made. India thinks it matters where it is made. Germany, \nBrazil, Japan--go around the globe. They look at us. They look at what \ncreated the middle class of this country. They want that, so they are \nfocusing on manufacturing. They are putting in place their own \nbarriers--and China, of course, wins the prize on this--to keep our \ncompanies out, to say, you have to make it in China, to say it has to \nbe a Chinese patent, you have to turn over your technology, and so on.\n  This bill is part of our effort to say that we are committed to fight \nfor America, American businesses, American workers. This is not about \npunishing folks; this is about fighting for America. It is about \nfighting for a way of life. It is about fighting for the middle class \nof this country. We want to make it in America, and this bill sends a \nvery simple message: Stop shipping our jobs overseas. Stop having \nloopholes in the law, incentives in the law that ship our jobs \noverseas.\n  We have lost over 4.7 million manufacturing jobs in the last decade. \nWe can debate the 8 years of the former Presidency and the incentives \nthat caused job loss and too many of those in my State of Michigan. We \nknow that if we focus on making products in America, we will bring \nthose jobs back; that if we close loopholes, if we create incentives, \nwe will bring jobs back.\n  One example, and then I will close--I see my colleague from Ohio is \nhere--when we focus on the right incentives, we do bring jobs back. In \nthe last Energy bill, section 136--which I was pleased to author on \ntooling older plants to help businesses get retooling loans--caused \nFord Motor Company to bring jobs back from Mexico to Wayne, MI. The \njobs came back because of the right incentives. This bill is about the \nright kinds of incentives and closing the wrong kinds of incentives.\n  I ask our colleagues to give us the opportunity to get to this bill, \nto work together to stop the bleeding, stop the shipping of jobs \noverseas, and give us the opportunity to make it in America again.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan \nyield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor her work on this legislation--she was here late in the evening \nyesterday--and the effort she has put forward.\n  It was 10 years ago this month that the Senate passed permanent \nnormal trade relations with China. Initially, that was called most-\nfavored-nation status, as Senator Stabenow remembers. They dressed it \nup, cleaned it up, put lipstick on the pig, and decided they should \ncall it something else. We know what it has done to our country. We had \na trade deficit with China in the fairly low double digits back 10 \nyears ago. Today, our bilateral trade deficit with China is $260 \nbillion. I believe last year it was $240 billion.\n  The first President Bush said that $1 billion in trade deficit \ntranslates into 13,000 jobs. So if we have a trade surplus of $1 \nbillion, it means we are selling a lot more than buying and have gained \n13,000 jobs. If we have a trade deficit of $1 billion, we have a 13,000 \njob loss. Well, we have a trade deficit with China alone of $260 \nbillion, so we know what that means.\n  Look at what this PNTR with China has done. Look at what our tax laws \nand trade laws have done, and this legislation will begin to fix the \ntax laws. Look at what tax laws and trade laws have done to the middle \nclass, to our manufacturing base in Toledo, OH, and Monroe, MI, and \npoints north and south of there. It has all been based on this sort of \ncynical business plan. Not since colonial times have we seen the world \nwhere a company--an industry--will close their manufacturing in our \ncountry, they will move their production line and build factories in \nanother country and then sell back their products to the United States. \nNever before have large numbers of businesses and industries done that, \nto my knowledge. Now we are seeing what damage it has caused to the \nmiddle class. We see the manufacturing job loss. We went from 1 million \nmanufacturing jobs 10 years ago to, during the Bush years, that number \nshrinking to 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country.\n\n  We are seeing progress. This legislation is progress. Clearly, I am \nhopeful our Republican colleagues won't object, as they typically have. \nThey know people who have lost jobs, I assume, and they understand \nthat. But we have also seen the President begin to enforce trade laws.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Creating American \nJobs and Ending Offshoring Act. These clearly justified reforms will \nclose wasteful tax loopholes for firms that move jobs overseas and \nprovide real incentives for firms to bring jobs back to the United \nStates. I am proud to join Senators Dick Durbin, Harry Reid, Byron \nDorgan, Barbara Boxer, Chuck Schumer, Sherrod Brown, and Sheldon \nWhitehouse in cosponsoring this bill.\n  For the past two decades our country has witnessed a disturbing trend \ntowards outsourcing American jobs abroad. What began as a way for \ndomestic manufacturers to cut labor costs has blown into a full-fledged \nsprint by some U.S. manufacturing and service companies to move as much \nproduction offshore as possible.\n  The devastating effects of global offshoring have hit large, \nmanufacturing States like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and California with \nparticular hurt, but smaller States like Vermont are not immune to the \nglobal realities of corporate outsourcing and consolidation. \nUnfortunately, there is quite a list of companies in recent years that \nhave either left our State or gone out of business entirely because \nthey moved jobs overseas or were squeezed\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\nout of the market by competitors using cheap, foreign labor.\n  That is why the Senate must move forward with considering the \nCreating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act.\n  First, the bill will eliminate the perverse tax subsidies that U.S. \ntaxpayers provide to firms that move facilities offshore. Specifically, \nit prohibits a firm from taking any deduction, loss, or credit for \namounts paid in connection with reducing or ending the operation of a \ntrade or business in the United States and starting or expanding a \nsimilar trade or business overseas.\n  Second, the bill will close the tax loophole that rewards U.S. firms \nthat move their production overseas and then turn around and import \nthose now foreign-made products back to the United States for sale. Not \nonly will this help keep good manufacturing jobs here at home, it will \nsave American taxpayers more than $15 billion in revenue over the next \ndecade.\n  Finally, to encourage businesses to create jobs in the United States, \nthe bill will provide businesses with payroll tax relief for each new \njob that they bring back onshore.\n  During these trying economic times, too many Vermonters are \nstruggling to find goods jobs and pay their bills. The economic \ncollapse came swiftly, and we have all seen that there are no quick \nfixes to turn around our economic troubles. We staved off greater \neconomic disaster with an essential economic rescue plan, and we have \ntried to jump-start the economy with a bold economic recovery plan. But \nemployment opportunities here at home are hampered when employers push \nmore and more jobs overseas.\n  Last year, Congress helped lay the groundwork for a renewed and \nvibrant economy by enacting tax relief for working families and \nbusinesses and making needed investments in broadband deployment, job \ntraining, electrical smart grids, water and transportation \ninfrastructure, better schools, housing, first responders, and new \nenergy sources. We need to ensure that these important investments by \nU.S. taxpayers benefit businesses and workers here at home.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American people understand a simple \ntruth: Our Tax Code should not encourage U.S. companies to send their \njobs overseas. That is why we have proposed the Creating American Jobs \nand Ending Offshoring Act. This legislation would take important steps \nto prevent American workers from losing their jobs because American \ncompanies get tax breaks when they move jobs overseas.\n  I thank Senators Reid, Durbin, Schumer, and Dorgan for introducing \nthis legislation. It would eliminate tax deductions that corporations \nclaim for expenses related to sending U.S. jobs overseas. It would end \nthe tax breaks companies receive on income earned by foreign \nsubsidiaries established to do work they once did with American \nworkers. And in a bid to turn around the twisted incentives in our Tax \nCode, incentives that now encourage companies to send jobs overseas, it \nwould provide incentives for companies to bring those jobs back home.\n  I understand some of my colleagues oppose this legislation because \nthey fear it might violate our treaty obligations. It is difficult to \nhave sympathy for this position, given the thousands of U.S. jobs lost \nbecause our trading partners fail to live up to their treaty \nobligations. I am in favor of trade, but I strongly oppose unilateral \ndisarmament when it comes to trade. It is our obligation to defend the \ninterests of U.S. workers. Ending the tax incentives that cost \nthousands of those workers their jobs is one way we can fulfill that \nobligation.\n  U.S. companies that do the right thing by their U.S. workers should \nnot be at a disadvantage over those companies that ship jobs overseas. \nU.S. tax law should not encourage companies to fire hard-working \nAmericans. We should pass this legislation and end the distorted \nincentives that are costing Americans their jobs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, very soon, the Senate will be asked to \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the majority leader's motion to \nproceed to a bill that is mislabeled the ``Creating American Jobs and \nEnding Offshoring Act.''\n  The process for this bill illustrates how the Democratic leadership \nhas dumbed down any efforts to seriously legislate any tax policy \nissues. To show how far, as a body, we have run off the rails in \nlegislating, let's compare the legislative track record of this bill \nwith the last major piece of tax legislation designed to deal with \ndomestic job creation.\n  I am referring to the bill that responded to a World Trade \nOrganization ruling against a domestic manufacturing benefit known, at \nthat time, as the foreign sales corporation or FSC program. Dangerous \ntariffs were pending with respect to many American products. How was \nthat legislation handled?\n  First of all, the Finance Committee members and staff engaged in a \nlot of due diligence in crafting the replacement regime, the domestic \nmanufacturing deduction. On a bipartisan basis, Finance Committee \nstaff, principally the tax and trade staffs, met with the interested \nparties, including officials from the litigating group, the European \nUnion.\n  Finance Committee staff, Republican and Democrat, negotiated a bill \nthat took the revenue generated from repealing the FSC benefit, added \nrevenue from shutting down tax shelters like the so-called SILO/LILO \nschemes, and channeled that revenue back into a new broader based \ndomestic manufacturing incentive. That incentive is a 9 percent \ndeduction for domestic manufacturing activity. It is a substantial tax \nincentive. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it is worth $10 \nbillion annually in terms of reduced taxes to domestic manufacturers, \nlarge and small. The chairman's mark was a joint mark between my \nfriend, then-ranking Democratic member, Max Baucus, and me.\n  Ranking Member Baucus and I came up with a bill title. It was the \nJump Start Our Business Strength or JOBS bill. The bill went through \nthe usual transparent Finance Committee markup process. Over several \ndays, Finance Committee members reviewed the language, asked questions, \nand prepared and filed amendments. When I gaveled the committee to \norder, several amendments were debated. Some were defeated. Some were \nmodified and accepted. Others were discussed and withdrawn. Every \nFinance Committee member played a role in shaping the bill the \ncommittee approved. And it should be noted the only dissents were two \nmembers on the then majority side.\n  When the bipartisan JOBS bill was scheduled for floor debate, then \nmajority leader Bill Frist brought up the Finance Committee bill. Both \nmy friend, Senator Baucus, and I were consulted on the floor bill's \ncontents. At that time the Democratic leadership filibustered efforts \nto effectively process the bill. Keep in mind there was no dissent in \nthe Finance Committee on the substance of the bill on the Democratic \nside. As I said before, two members of my leadership, on very \nprincipled grounds, voted against this popular bill. Despite opposing \nthe bill in committee, those two members supported the majority \nleader's efforts to bring the time-sensitive legislation to the floor \nand process it in a timely fashion.\n  It took three cloture votes to process the JOBS bill. That is right. \nThree cloture votes. The basis for the multiple filibusters of the JOBS \nbill was not opposition to material in the bill. The Democratic \nleadership filibustered over items not in the bill that they wanted to \noffer as amendments. The Republican leadership did something we seldom, \nif ever, see from the Democratic leadership. Majority Leader Frist \nyielded by allowing votes on those issues, which were not in the bill, \nbut controversial with many in the Republican Conference. Many votes \nwere held on the JOBS bill. Some were designed by those close to the \nDemocratic campaign operation solely to score political points. The \nRepublican Conference, as the majority party at the time, recognized \nmultiple votes were the price to pay to push part of the majority's \nagenda.\n  Even if that agenda consisted of doing the people's business by \nprocessing a bill with more support on the other side.\n  The conference committee that considered the JOBS bill was fully \nopen. There was a chairman's mark and several days of amendments \nbetween the House and Senate. In the end, a conference report was \nproduced that\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\ngarnered a majority of Senate conferee signatures from each side. The \nconference report passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Compare that JOBS bill process with the one for this bill which, as I \nsaid at the start of my remarks, is a jobs bill in name only. In the \nSenate, I have found over the years, that legislative substance and \nlegislative process are symbiotic.\n  That is, the quality of the process often affects the quality of the \nsubstance and vice versa.\n  Here we are debating a bill whose proponents claim will make a \nmaterial difference with job creation incentives. We are also told that \nthis bill will materially curtail the offshoring of U.S. jobs. If it \nwere only that simple, I am sure the bill would pass with the \noverwhelming bipartisan margin the JOBS bill did some 6 years ago.\n  I have previously discussed the defects in the bill before the \nSenate. I will not do it again here. But I will say this: Does anybody \non the other side really believe if my friend, the chairman, were to \nput this bill before the Finance Committee that it would be approved in \nthe form that is before the body today? I can tell you this Senator has \nseveral amendments that he thinks would improve this bill dramatically.\n  I would expect those amendments might pass with bipartisan support. \nThis bill, like so many others, was crafted in the majority leader's \noffice and is largely the singular work of two senior members of his \nleadership. That is not to say anything negative about those members or \ntheir interest or work in the area of tax legislation. My point is \nthat, if the ideas in this bill had the kind of merit claimed by their \nproponents, why avoid the Finance Committee? Why not let the public see \nit in committee. Let members ask questions as they review the language. \nTest the strength of the ideas through the amendment process. If the \nproponents answer by blaming Republican Leader McConnell, I would point \nout that Senator McConnell isn't on the Finance Committee. If the \nproponents answer by blaming partisanship, I would ask them to take a \nlook at the Finance Committee ratio.\n  It has been the most favorable to the majority since the early part \nof the 1990s. By intentionally skipping the committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Democratic leadership has deliberately short-circuited the \nopportunity to methodically test the bill as tax policy. Unfortunately, \nthis process defect has been more the rule than the exception. Since \nthe stimulus bill in January of 2009, the Finance Committee has only \nmarked up one tax policy bill, the health care reform bill. As a former \nchairman, I know the current chairman would not want to proceed this \nway. Nope. My sense is the Democratic leadership simply doesn't want \nthis bill to undergo the extra scrutiny of a regular order process.\n  Unlike the 2004 JOBS bill, this bill is being presented as a take-it-\nor-leave-it proposition. Republicans are not supporting cloture because \nthey are not being offered the opportunity to amend this bill with \namendments that go to the supposed purposes of the bill. No amendments \nallowed on other tax incentives for job creation. No amendments allowed \non measures to prevent offshoring of jobs. I have amendments dealing \ndirectly with the offshoring of jobs question. They are bipartisan \namendments. If I vote for cloture, I have no assurances from the \nDemocratic leadership that these amendments will be in order. Any look \nback on the way in which tax bills have been processed this year tells \nme I have good reasons for doubting that a full debate would occur. I \nwould like to briefly describe the two amendments I filed earlier.\n  The first amendment mirrors a bill that the junior Senator from \nVermont and I have coauthored. Known as the Employ America Act, this \namendment would prevent any company engaged in a mass layoff of \nAmerican workers from importing cheaper labor from abroad through \ntemporary guest worker programs. Companies that are truly facing labor \nshortages would not be impacted by this legislation and could continue \nto obtain employer-sponsored visas. Only companies that are laying off \na large number of Americans would be barred from importing foreign \nworkers through guest worker programs.\n  Since the recession started in December of 2007, nearly 8 million \nAmericans have lost their jobs and the unemployment rate has nearly \ndoubled. In total, 15 million Americans are officially unemployed, \nanother 8.8 million Americans are working part-time only because they \ncannot find a full-time job, and more than 1 million workers have given \nup looking for work altogether.\n  At the same time, some of the very companies that have hired tens of \nthousands of guest workers from overseas have announced large scale \nlayoffs of American workers. The high-tech industry, a major employer \nof H-1B guest workers, has announced over 330,000 job cuts since 2008. \nThe construction industry, a major employer of H-2B guest workers, has \nlaid off 1.9 million workers since December of 2007.\n  The second amendment I filed yesterday mirrors a bill that the senior \nSenator from Illinois and I have worked on for several years. Known as \nthe H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2009, this amendment would improve \ntwo key visa programs by rooting out fraud and abuse while making sure \nAmericans have the first chance of obtaining high-skilled jobs in this \ncountry.\n  The amendment does several things, including: one, requiring \nemployers to try and recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1B visa \nholders; two, requiring employers to pay a better wage to visa holders \nwho take these jobs; three, expanding the powers of the federal \ngovernment to go after abusers; four, creating new rules regarding the \noutsourcing and outplacement of H-1B and L-1 workers by their employers \nto secondary employers in the United States; and five, establishing a \nnew database that employers can use to advertise positions for which \nthey intend to hire an H-1B worker.\n  Too many American workers are unemployed today. Yet we still allow \ncompanies to import hundreds, even thousands, of foreign workers with \nvery little strings attached. These businesses should be first asked to \nlook at Americans to fill vacant positions, and they should be held \naccountable for displacing Americans to hire cheaper foreign labor.\n  These two amendments go directly to the concerns about job creation \nand prevention of offshoring of U.S. jobs. Both amendments are \nbipartisan. Yet if cloture is invoked, these amendments would fall on \nthe Senate cutting room floor.\n  Unlike the 2004 JOBS bill, I have no confidence that, even if the \nDemocratic leadership were to follow regular order for floor purposes, \nthat we could expect anything like a conference committee to work out \nthe issues between the House and the Senate.\n  We find ourselves in a very disappointing situation today. Two \nserious issues are supposed to be addressed in the legislation before \nthe Senate: The first is tax incentives for job creation; the second is \nmeasures to prevent offshoring of jobs. No doubt the people who send us \nhere expect us to take these weighty matters seriously. With all the \neconomic pain Americans are enduring, we shouldn't be playing political \ngames. But here we are. We have a bill whose proponents claim is a \nserious effort.\n  The Democratic leadership skipped the Finance Committee, and we are \npresented with a take-it-or-leave-it bill that is really nothing more \nthan a political label. We can do better.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Montford Point Marines\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I take the floor today to pay tribute to a \ngroup of Americans that blazed a trail, people who helped to shape the \nhistory we share, and whose contributions deserve recognition at the \nhighest levels.\n  There has been no war fought by or within the United States in which \nAfrican Americans did not participate.\n  The war for our independence featured all-Black units in Rhode Island \nand Massachusetts. During the War of 1812, about one-quarter of the \nNavy involved in the Battle of Lake Erie was Black. Nearly 190,000 \nAfrican Americans fought for their own freedom in the Civil War. In \nWorld War I, over 350,000 Black men served on the Western Front.\n  But prior to 1941, Black servicemen were denied the honor and glory \nthat comes with uniformed service, and their contributions went largely \nunnoticed. The units were segregated. Black infantry divisions hardly \nsaw the battlefield. They served our Nation with honor, but our Nation \ndid not honor their service.\n  But on June 25, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt changed all that. \nExecutive Order 8802 prohibited racial discrimination in the Nation's \nmilitary. It was the first Federal action to promote equal opportunity \nin the United States.\n  Immediately, people of color answered the call and joined all \nbranches of the service. Soon, the very first Black U.S. marines began \ntraining at Camp Montford Point in North Carolina. These men would \nbecome the first Black drill instructors, the first Black combat \ntroops, and the first Black officers the Marine Corps had ever seen.\n  More than 19,000 Black marines served in the Second World War. Some, \nlike SGM Edgar Huff and SGM Louis Roundtree, served in Korea and \nVietnam as well. They earned decorations such as the Bronze Star, the \nSilver Star, and the Purple Heart.\n  All of the Montford Point marines sacrificed for their country, and \nfor that they deserve our deepest gratitude. But they also did far more \nthan sacrifice on the battlefield. They broke down barriers. Their \nnames may not be as familiar as Washington, Jefferson or Lincoln. But \ntheir contribution to the American story deserves more than our \nrespect. Through their actions, they changed the face of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nThey deserve our praise and recognition.\n  Last fall, I introduced S. 1695, a bill to award the Congressional \nGold Medal to the Montford Point marines. I urge my colleagues to move \nforward and honor these fine men and women. Every American has \nbenefited from their sacrifice, their bravery, and their leadership. \nAnd every American should learn from their fine example.\n  Unfortunately, time is not on our side. Every day, approximately 900 \nbrave American souls who served in World War II pass away. We should \nhonor our greatest generation while we have the chance to look them in \nthe eye and thank them.\n  Since the day a few brave men began their training at Camp Montford \nPoint more than half a century ago, the U.S. Marine Corps has been \ntransformed into a stronger, more diverse fighting force. The legacy of \nthe Montford Point marines represents what is best about this Nation's \nhistory. Theirs is a proud chapter in the continuing American story.\n  As I address this Chamber today, I am surrounded by the towering \nmonuments to our Founding Fathers, and the memorials to those who have \nfought and died so that we might live free. It is time to make the \nMontford Point marines a part of that immortal history--to award them \nthe prestigious Congressional Gold Medal.\n  I ask that my colleagues join with me in celebrating these American \nheroes.\n  We need to do it before it is too late, and we will not have any of \nthem to look into the eye and tell them: Thanks for your service. \nThanks for standing up against some of the toughest situations on the \nbattlefield but even tougher situations as Blacks on the homefront.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my friend, the Senator from \nIllinois, for his comments, and I associate myself with his effort. \nThis is recognition that is long overdue. I am pleased to support his \nefforts in this area. It is a part of American history that has not \nreceived appropriate recognition, these individuals' service to and in \ndefense of our country. I believe strongly that we need to take action \non this, as the clock for many of these individuals, as they get \nadvanced in age, is ticking.\n  The Senator from Illinois will be leaving this Chamber at the end of \nthis year. He and I came in together, as did the Senator from New \nMexico. It has been a great honor of mine to serve with him. I consider \nSenator Burris a dear friend. I know there will be time for a more \nformal process, but I simply wish to say on this matter and countless \nothers over the 2 years we have served together, it has been a real \npleasure. I look forward to--perhaps not in this Chamber--other \nopportunities for us to serve and work together for many years to come.\n  (Mr. BURRIS assumed the chair.)\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 3853 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend the work of my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, on a very important set of challenges we \nhave.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Afghanistan and Pakistan\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the conflict in Afghanistan enters its \nninth year next month. Over the past few months, the United States has \nexperienced the most casualties since the war began in 2001. In June, \n60 U.S. troops were killed; in July, 66; in the month of August, 55 \nservice members gave their lives.\n  We always recall the words of Lincoln when we recall those who are \nkilled in action, those who gave, as he said, the last full measure of \ndevotion to their country. These are difficult days, and that is an \nunderstatement--very difficult days for the American people and \nespecially for the families and the troops. I also believe these are \ndays that have tried the patience of Americans and tested the resolve \nof our commitment to this conflict.\n  At a minimum, we--when I say ``we,'' I mean those Members of the U.S. \nCongress--we owe the families of these service members every assurance \nthat their elected officials, their elected representatives in \nWashington are vigilantly exercising oversight of the war. We also owe \nit to them that we ask and demand answers to very tough questions and, \nfinally, that we are doing everything we can to make sure we get this \npolicy and this strategy that goes with it right.\n  Since I last spoke on the floor on the issue of Afghanistan, there \nhave been many important developments with respect to the war. First, \nwe have been confronted with new revelations of corruption by the \nAfghan Government--more about that in a moment--second, reports of \nballot box stuffing and voter intimidation in the parliamentary \nelections earlier this month have raised long-held doubts by the Afghan \npeople as to the durability of the country's democratic experiment. The \nnumber of IED attacks has increased, and while deaths due to the IEDs \nare, in fact, down, the number of injuries is, unfortunately, up. ISAF \nhas also begun operations in Kandahar. We saw a story about this \nyesterday. This is notable because this is reportedly the first \noperation to be primarily made up of Afghan troops.\n  I wish to spend a couple moments today to draw attention to the \ninternational response to the floods in Pakistan. The United States has \nplayed an important leading role. We were the first, and with the most \nassistance, of any country. While this may be the case, we also have a \nresponsibility to encourage generosity from the public and private \nsectors in the international community.\n\n  I mentioned before the issue of corruption in Afghanistan. This issue \nhas nationwide implications and could serve to undermine the totality \nof our efforts in Afghanistan. Our troops are fighting and dying to \nhelp extend the reach of the Afghan Government outside of the capital \nof Kabul to show the Afghan people that their government has a monopoly \non the use of force and is capable of providing goods and services to \nits people. But we need to put this very simply. We cannot be \ncomplicit. Our forces, our government, cannot be complicit in helping \nto extend the reach of a corrupt government. Afghanistan is a sovereign \ncountry, and if the fight against corruption is going to be effective, \nAfghans--Afghans--can and must own the process.\n  The United States should support the work of the Major Crimes Task \nForce and the Special Investigations Unit, but, frankly, the track \nrecord to date has been very disappointing, and unless serious progress \nis made, support for U.S. engagement in Afghanistan will be seriously \neroded.\n  As a former auditor general of Pennsylvania who oversaw the auditing \nof government programs at the State level, I perhaps have a heightened \nsensitivity to the vital role transparency and accountability have in \ngovernment--in any government. The importance of these basic elements \nof a representative democracy is especially compelling when the lives \nof courageous Americans, ISAF, and Afghan forces are, indeed, on the \nline.\n  Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that there is a U.S. \ncriminal investigation into President Karzai's older brother Mahmood, \nand prosecutors are trying to determine whether they can bring charges \nof tax evasion, racketeering, or extortion against him. Reportedly, he \nwill travel to the United States this week to amend his tax returns. \nBut these are serious allegations that we read about time after time. I \nhave spoken and many in this Chamber have spoken about the allegations \nof corruption against Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been implicated in \nlocal corruption schemes involving the opium trade. These are \nallegations, they are charges, but they are charges that are very \nserious and potentially damaging to the overall U.S. effort in the \ncountry, as it strikes to the heart of trust in the Afghan Government. \nWithout this trust from Afghans and from the international community, I \nam concerned that support for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan will erode.\n  On September 18, Afghans went to the polls to vote for a new \nparliament. This has also become a serious cause\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\nfor concern. On Sunday, the Afghan election officials ordered recounts \nin seven provinces. A government antifraud elections watchdog has \nreceived more than 3,500 complaints--3,500 complaints--about this \nelection. They are concerned that up to 57 percent of these complaints \ncould change the outcome of the vote. The Free and Fair Election \nFoundation of Afghanistan, the main independent Afghan observer group, \nobserved ballot box stuffing in 280 voting sites in 28 provinces. We \ndon't expect elections in a developing country to be perfect, \nespecially a country that is in a war zone, but these reports are \nalarming, to say the least, because they indicate that not enough \nprogress has been made over the past 9 years to create an Afghanistan \nin which the people resolve their own differences through politics and \nnot violence.\n  Next let me move to the question of security, which is so fundamental \nto our strategy. I have sought to highlight the threat posed by \nammonium nitrate, the fertilizer that is a key ingredient in the \nimprovised explosive devices in Afghanistan. According to a recent \nreport from the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, \nknown by the acronym JIEDDO, there have been 1,062 effective IED \nattacks against coalition forces in 2010 that killed 292 soldiers and \nwounded another 2,178 others. In the first 8 months of 2009, there were \n820 such attacks that killed 322 and wounded 1,813. So while the number \nof deaths in the comparable period of 2009 versus 2010 may be down--\ninstead of it being 322 deaths in those 8 months, it is 292--even \nthough the number of deaths is down, the number of wounded, the number \nof injuries has risen dramatically in 2010.\n  It is essential that we highlight this threat and support U.S. and \ninternational efforts to crack down on the proliferation of dangerous \nchemicals such as ammonium nitrate that can be used in IEDs. I \nsponsored a resolution which was passed by unanimous consent--which we \nknow is hard to do in this body these days--calling for increased focus \nby the Governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asian nations \nto effectively monitor and regulate the use of ammonium nitrate \nfertilizer in order to prevent terrorist organizations from \ntransporting ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan. As we know, a lot of \nthe inflow, a lot of the movement of this precursor chemical that is \nused in IEDs comes from Pakistan into Afghanistan. As a show of \nbipartisan strength on this resolution, Senators Kyl, Snowe, Reid, and \nLevin--two Democrats, two Republicans--were original cosponsors of this \nresolution. I also had language inserted into the foreign operations \nfunding bill which requires the State Department to report on its \nefforts to encourage Pakistani assistance on this issue. We must remain \nvigilant and persistent to address this ongoing problem. This is about \nprotecting our troops from the horror of an IED attack. We must do all \nwe can to minimize the threat to our brave men and women fighting for \nus in the field.\n  At a different level, at a strategic level, ISAF has launched \nOperation Dragon Strike, a joint operation with Afghan forces which \nwill look to eradicate Taliban elements in Kandahar. This operation \ncould mark a crucial and critical turning point in the war, and we will \nbe watching closely in the coming weeks to gauge the progress as it \nmoves forward. This operation is notable as there are more Afghan \ntroops than ISAF troops on the ground, and this is indeed an \nencouraging sign that the training of the Afghan National Army is \nbeginning to reap benefits. That is a bit of good news--more good \nnews--as it relates to the training of the Afghan Army; not such good \nnews--in fact, some bad news--as it relates to the training of the \nAfghan National Police.\n  Let me move finally to the floods in Pakistan. I wish to draw \nattention to the devastating humanitarian crisis that continues to \nplague Pakistan after the flood. This has affected millions of people \nin Pakistan across the country--maybe not always directly but in some \nway or another through displacement, death, injury--in so many ways \nthis has adversely affected the people of Pakistan. This is the worst \nnatural disaster in the history of the country.\n  To assist the people of Pakistan during this difficult time, the \nUnited States has provided more than $340 million to support immediate \nrelief and recovery efforts. The United States has provided food, \ninfrastructure support, and air support to transport goods and rescue \nthousands stranded by the floods.\n  These floods will require a substantial international commitment of \nassistance. The United Nations has issued appeals, but the response \nfrom the international community has been, in a word, weak, and that \nmight be an understatement. Private contributions have slowed to a \ntrickle.\n  Last week, we heard from Cameron Munter, the President's nominee to \nbe Ambassador to Pakistan, who described at our hearing in the Foreign \nRelations Committee the administration's plans to bolster support for \nthe Pakistan relief fund. The American response to the flood has been \nsubstantial, but we can and must do more to rally the international \ncommunity and the private sector to be generous in Pakistan's time of \nneed. The Pakistani-American community has led an important effort to \ndraw attention to the devastation wrought by the flood. We should \nbolster their work and use our platforms as public officials to broaden \ntheir appeals for help.\n  So we have many challenges in this area to get our strategy right in \nAfghanistan as it relates to governance. Increasingly, that word really \nmeans anticorruption, mostly--obviously on security in terms of what \nour strategy is but also in terms of training the Afghan National Army \nand police so that we can eventually draw down our troops and have them \ntake over the fight and govern their own country.\n  Finally, on development, which I didn't speak much about today, there \nis the ability for the Afghans to develop the infrastructure and \nsupport they need to govern themselves, whether that is services, water \nand sewer--any indication, any element any country would need to have \nin place so that people can live in peace and security. Finally, there \nare the efforts we are making to help the people of Pakistan at a time \nof great need. We have all kinds of important humanitarian reasons to \nbe helpful and to show solidarity with suffering people, and we also \nhave several security imperatives that come into play when it comes to \nthe flood and the aftermath.\n  So for all of these reasons, it is critically important to continue \nto debate and discuss and even argue about what our policy in \nAfghanistan should be. That is the least the Senate can do when our \ntroops are fighting and sometimes dying in the field to carry out this \nmission.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you opened the newspaper over the last \nseveral weeks, you have probably noticed a large full-page \nadvertisement that has appeared almost every day. It shows, usually, a \nyoung person, and it has a caption that reads: ``A hundred thousand \nworking Americans don't count? Put the brakes on the Department of \nEducation's gainful employment rule.''\n  There are a lot of photos of young people with that basic statement \npopping up in newspapers not only in Washington but across the United \nStates. Others show photos of young people saying: ``I don't count? \nSome in Washington think I don't.''\n  These ads have been hard to miss. They have been running in more than \n10 newspapers on a daily basis for several weeks, at a cost of millions \nof dollars. Most Americans, when they look at it, are puzzled and say: \nWhat is this debate and this battle all about?\n  Well, many of these ads are being paid for by Corinthian Colleges, \nIncorporated. This is a for-profit higher education company that \nprovides training and education after high school for young people \nacross America--and for those who are not so young anymore. Corinthian \nand other for-profit colleges\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nare upset about a regulation that the Obama administration has \nproposed. Corinthian is spending millions of dollars on a barrage of \nads across the United States, rather than basically taking the same \nmoney and offering it in scholarships to help their students. They want \nto stop the Obama administration from its proposed change in the rules. \nThe proposed regulation could end Federal subsidies to some of the \npoorest performing for-profit colleges in America. That might hurt the \nprofits of some very wealthy corporations, especially Corinthian.\n  This is simple dollars and cents. They are spending millions of \ndollars now to persuade Congress, and perhaps some voters and opinion \nmakers, not to enforce a rule that holds them to a standard of \nperformance because they may lose business. If they lose business, they \nmay lose profits. In losing profits, they think it is worth putting \nmoney into this advertising effort. They are worried, because if you \ntake a look around, you cannot miss them in Washington. I have said, \nhalf jokingly, that having served in Congress for more than 20 years, \nthe best way I can find to meet former Members of Congress whom I have \nserved with over those 20 years is to take on this issue because they \nhave all signed up as lobbyists for these for-profit colleges. They are \ncalling me and saying: Durbin, guess who I am working for. It turns out \nmy efforts to hold for-profit colleges accountable for the students \ngoing to school there and ending up deeply in debt is a full employment \nbill for former Members of Congress to be lobbyists. That was not my \nintention. It is not my goal.\n  They are also spending millions of dollars on these ad campaigns, \nabout which I have spoken to newspaper people who say: The newspaper \nbusiness isn't profitable anymore, but thank goodness these schools are \nbuying full-page ads. So I have this sort of one-man campaign to put \nAmericans back to work and make American newspapers more profitable. It \nis almost the basis for a comedy routine, except what I am talking \nabout is not funny at all.\n  I am talking about some of these for-profit schools that are sinking \nyoung people deeply into debt in student loans that they can never pay \noff, promising them courses, training, and degrees that will lead to a \ngood job and, in fact, it leads to a dead end, where they end up with a \nworthless piece of paper. They don't end up with the skills they need \nto get a job, but they do end up in debt, with student loans to the \nheavens.\n  I think the Department of Education is on the right track. If we are \ngoing to send literally millions, if not billions, of dollars to \ncolleges and schools that are training those who finish high school, we \nshould have some standards there. We should not just give them to \nanyone who happens to call themselves a school or calls their effort an \neducation and training. It is right to ask these questions.\n  The proposed gainful employment regulation is complicated, and some \nchanges may be made before it is all over. It is basic: For-profit \ncolleges should not routinely leave students with student loan debt \nthat they cannot afford to pay back. Luring a 19-, 20- or 21-year-old \ndeeply into debt, when they are being promised a job they will never \nhave, is cruel and unfair. In a moment, I will tell you what happens \nwhen the students default on their debts. In the meantime, the \ntaxpayers are subsidizing this. It is our Federal tax dollars passing \nthrough Washington and out to these schools, loaned to students, paid \nto the colleges that are representing they have something good to \noffer, leaving students deeply in debt and many without a job.\n  This rule the Obama administration is looking at would look at debt-\nto-income ratios and student loan repayment rates to determine those \neducation and training programs that are leaving students with more \ndebt than they can realistically ever pay back. Those programs might \nhave to print a warning label on their promotional materials about the \nhigh debt levels of their students or there might be restrictions on \nenrollment in departments of schools that regularly produce students \nwho are deeply in debt without a job. Some programs would actually lose \ntheir eligibility for Federal student aid if they don't meet certain \nstandards. I think that is an honest approach for the students and for \nour need in this country to educate and train people in our workforce.\n  Recently, I had a hearing in Chicago, and it was on this issue. I \ncould not get over the crowd. I expected a few people to be interested, \nbut 450 people showed up. We had to have an overflow room in the \nFederal courthouse. As I walked into that Federal courthouse building, \nI thought there was something else important going on there beyond my \nhearing. It turned out the demonstrators on the sidewalk outside were \nthere for me. So I went up to talk to them; they were students. These \ntwo students I spoke to were dressed in a white tunic, which chefs \nwear, with buttons on the side. They were carrying a sign against the \ngainful employment rule. I talked to them. I said: Where do you go to \nschool? They said they went to the Institute of Art of Chicago, located \nin the suburb of Schaumburg, IL.\n  For those of us who know Chicago, the reason that name is written the \nway it is written is because there is a real art institute in Chicago. \nThis school is not affiliated with it, but it is creating the \nimpression that it may have some connection. It doesn't. I asked the \nstudent: What are you studying? The student says: Culinary arts. I want \nto be a chef. I said: How long does the course last? He said: 2 years. \nI said: How much do you pay in tuition for this course? He said: \n$54,000. It costs $54,000 to work in a restaurant. I said: How much \nwill you get paid after you finish the course, when you go to work? He \nsaid: We usually start at about $10 an hour, and if I work 6 days a \nweek or maybe more and do overtime, I might make $30,000 a year gross. \nI said: Do you have any idea how long it will take to pay off this \ndebt? What is this leading to? He said: Someday I want to own a \nrestaurant. I said: That is a great ambition, but if you start this \njourney $54,000 in debt, what is the likelihood you will reach your \ngoal? He said: Well, I am going to pursue it. I think it is the thing \nto do.\n  The same culinary course is offered at the community colleges in \nChicago--a 2-year course, with the same preparation, and the tuition \nfor 2 years is $12,000 versus $54,000. This young man is going to be \ndeeply in debt, a debt which people our age think, my goodness, that is \nmore than my first home cost. They are going to have that facing them \nas they start a job that pays about $10 an hour.\n  That, to me, is unfair and creates an unrealistic expectation. I wish \nthere would be a suspension, for about 6 months, of the super chef, \nmaster chef shows, so all the young people who are bored and watching \ncable TV will not turn to these shows and have these dreams about being \nthe master chef of tomorrow. For many of them, it will be a dream that \nis never realized, although the debt they incur will be realized in a \nhurry. We think these schools would either have to improve the salary \noutcomes of their students or cut tuition costs. Either way, that is \ngood for students.\n  But the for-profit colleges want us to believe that the idea of \ncontrolling student debt somehow hurts these students. Look at \nCorinthian College spending millions of dollars on these ads to stop \nthis accountability. This company is buying full-page print advertising \nall across America. It owns Everest College, Everest Institute, and \nEverest University. How many students are enrolled at the colleges \nowned by Corinthian? It is 112,000, including 20 percent through online \ncourses.\n  If I did a quiz and asked the American people which institution of \nhigher learning they believe receives the most Federal funds of any \ninstitution in America, most people would get it wrong. It is an \ninstitution that is owned by a company called the Apollo Group, and it \nis known as the University of Phoenix. The University of Phoenix has \nover 450,000 undergraduates enrolled. That is more than the combined \nundergraduate enrollment of all of the Big Ten schools--450,000-plus. \nThey receive more Federal aid for education than any other institution \nin America. Next is DeVry out of Chicago--for 75 years--and I might add \nduring the course of testimony before our panel, our investigation did \ncome up with some very positive things to say. I hope what I am about \nto say is not taken to condemn every for-profit\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nschool. I think some are doing a good job in some areas and they are \nvaluable and should continue. The other is Kaplan University. Kaplan is \nowned by the Washington Post and is the biggest moneymaker in their \ncorporation.\n  They have quite a few students. They are No. 3 in terms of receiving \nFederal aid to education. The fourth school, incidentally, is Penn \nState University, finally one you would guess would be there. It is a \nlarge university with online courses. That gives us an idea of where \nthe Federal money is flowing from student loans and Pell grants. It is \ngoing to for-profit schools. They represent about 9 percent of all the \nstudents taking postsecondary education. They represent 25 percent of \nall the Federal aid to education and 43 percent of all the student loan \ndefaults: 7 to 9 percent of the students, 43 percent of the defaults. \nIt is an indication that we have a problem. We are shoveling money in \nthe name of educating students at institutions which are heaping them \nup with debt and not providing them with training or preparation for a \ngood-paying job.\n  In 2009, Corinthian--the one buying the millions of dollars in pages \nof advertising--had $1.3 billion in revenue, up 22 percent over the \nprevious year, and 89 percent of the revenue for Corinthian Colleges \nacross the United States came from the Federal Treasury, from \ntaxpayers, in the form of Federal Pell grants and student loans. That \ndoes not include the GI bill, Department of Labor funding or Department \nof Defense funding.\n  The company's net income--that is their profit--was $71 million. The \nCEO of Corinthian Colleges, buying all these ads, was paid $4.5 million \nin executive pay and other compensation last year. Corinthian spent, \nout of the money they brought in--89 percent of it from the Federal \nGovernment--$295 million in advertising and recruiting in 2009. That is \n22.5 percent of the total revenue went to advertising and recruiting.\n  They are, by and large, a marketing operation: bring the students in, \nsign them up, bring in the Federal dollars; bring in more students, \nsign them up, bring in more Federal dollars.\n  Given the ad campaigns in the newspapers, the amount spent on \nadvertising by Corinthian is likely to go up even higher.\n  On average, for-profit schools, which receive the lion's share of the \nrevenue from taxpayers, spend 25 percent of their revenue on \nadvertising and recruiting.\n  What do community colleges across America spend in recruiting \nstudents to come to their campuses and classrooms? Not 25 percent of \nthe revenue, 2 percent. They are being outclassed in the marketing \nbattle by these for-profit schools.\n  How are the students doing at Everest College, for example? Recently, \nan undercover Government Accountability Office investigator went and \ntook a look. That investigator posed as a potential student and found \nthat the admissions representative at Everest College misrepresented \nthe cost and length of the program and refused to disclose the \ngraduation rate to this so-called potential student--not surprisingly. \nDo you know why? Only 15 percent of the student loans are being paid by \nthe students who go to Everest; 85 percent of them are not paying on \ntheir loans. It shows they are getting into debt they cannot pay off.\n  Data from the Department of Education indicates that Corinthian, \noverall--in all their different colleges--has a 24-percent repayment \nrate. Three out of four students who go to their schools cannot pay the \nprincipal on their debt after they finish--three out of four. It is the \nlowest repayment rate of any publicly traded corporation in this \nbusiness.\n  On a recent investor call, Corinthian acknowledged some campuses are \nat risk of losing their accreditation and that a majority of campuses \nwill have 3-year default rates over 30 percent.\n  We cannot expect a young student fresh out of high school or someone \nwithout worldly experience to launch an investigation about whether a \nschool is accredited. One assumes, if the Federal Government is going \nto send its money to that school for the students, somebody in \nWashington is keeping an eye on the school to make sure it is the real \nthing. The honest answer is we are not. That is why the Obama \nadministration thinks we should change the rules, create more oversight \non these schools, make sure Federal dollars are well invested and \nstudents do not end up overwhelmed by debt.\n  An independent analysis predicted that the Corinthian companywide 3-\nyear default rate may be 39 percent. Do you know what that means? Two \nout of every five students who attend a college owned by Corinthian \nwill default on their student loan within 3 years--40 percent of them.\n  That is happening despite the company's strong efforts to lower the \nnumber of defaults within the government's 3-year window. They are \nencouraging students to just pay interest on their debt if they cannot \npay the principal so they can at least say you are paying something.\n  Corinthian spent $10 million over the last year to strengthen what it \ncalls default management because they see the writing on the wall. It \nis indefensible that we are sending this money to the Corinthian \ncorporation. They are heaping debt on the students and not producing an \neducation that leads to a job.\n  Everett College in Illinois is doing slightly better with a default \nrate of 25 percent.\n  Corinthian also offers private loans to students who are in trouble. \nListen to this. Corinthian Colleges' chief financial officer, Ken Ord, \nstated in a Federal 2010 investor call that they anticipate a 56- to \n58-percent default rate on the private loans the school makes directly \nto students.\n  That is a 56- to 58-percent default rate on an estimated $150 million \nin internal student lending. Why is Corinthian willing to lend money to \nthe students--their own money--when they know these students are \nalready defaulting on their government loans?\n  The company is willing to take this loss of $75 million in private \nstudent loan defaults because these loans help ensure the Federal loans \nand Pell grants will keep coming in to these students, despite the fact \nthey are in over their head in debt and have nowhere to turn.\n  Corinthian Colleges was sued by the State of California in 2007. The \nState argued it misled students about career opportunities. They \nreached a $6.5 million settlement in the State of California to refund \ntuition to former students, pay student debt cancellation, and pay \ncivil penalties.\n  That was not the first time they had been in court. There have been a \nnumber of lawsuits from former students who had spent tens of thousands \nof dollars for useless degrees and useless certificates from Corinthian \nand Everest.\n  Recently, Corinthian and several of its executives are being sued by \ntheir own shareholders for allegedly making false and misleading \nstatements about the company's business prospects.\n  I have questions about whether Corinthian is the education \nopportunity students are looking for. There are certainly students who \nhave a good experience at one or more of the Corinthian schools, but I \nwish to share a story that they are not featuring in their full-page \nads, arguing that they should not be subject to oversight by the \nDepartment of Education.\n  Last year, Washington Monthly magazine told the story of a student \nnamed Martine. At the age of 43, Martine decided to go back to school \nand pursue a career in nursing. She came across a Web site for Everest \nCollege, part of the Corinthian Colleges chain.\n  Martine was promised hands-on training in state-of-the-art labs and \nrotations at the Los Angeles Medical Center. She was worried about the \n$29,000 tuition but was told it would not be a problem. She was going \nto make $35 an hour as a nurse.\n  When Martine filled out her paperwork, she was rushed through the \nprocess and was not told the terms of her loans, including private \nloans that carried double-digit interest rates.\n  The education did not prove to be what she had been promised. The \ninstructors were inexperienced. The lab equipment was old and broken. \nInstead of the promised rotations at UCLA Medical Center, her clinical \ntraining consisted of passing out pills in a local nursing home.\n  Martine was unable to find a job after she graduated. Instead, she is \nworking as a home health care aide, and she cannot pay back her student\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nloans. She said: ``I made one mistake, and I will be paying for it for \nthe rest of my life.''\n  Many of these for-profit colleges argue that we need them desperately \nbecause the community college system in America is filled. Not true. \nOver the last week, I went to Olive-Harvey College, part of the \ncommunity college system in Chicago. They have new leadership that is \ninspiring. I said: What is your capacity?\n  They said: We are at about 50 percent of our capacity. We can absorb \nmany more students in our community colleges.\n  The cost is a fraction of what these for-profit colleges charge. It \nis important we give to students the information about the variation in \ncosts for education and training and what they can expect to receive. \nAccording to the Department of Education, Everest College in Skokie, \nIL, costs, on average, $14,000 in tuition and fees for education.\n  Less than 3 miles away from the Everest campus in Skokie is a school \nyou and I both know, Mr. President--Oakton Community College.\n  At Oakton, students can earn degrees in the same fields, same \ncertificates for dramatically less. A certificate in medical billing, a \nprogram offered at Everest College--the private, for-profit school--for \nover $10,000 will cost you $1,000 at Oakton Community College, one-\ntenth the cost of this private school.\n  The Corinthian ad campaign suggests we do not think the students who \nare enrolled in their schools count. I disagree with them. I think they \ncount for a lot. They count for our future. I would like to tell the \nstudents attending for-profit colleges, it is because they count that \nwe are asking these hard questions.\n  I see another colleague on the floor, the Senator from Minnesota, so \nI will wrap up quickly and tell one thing I want students across \nAmerica to know. First, the standards I wish to impose on for-profit \ncolleges I also wish to impose on community colleges, public \nuniversities, and private universities. They should be accredited so \ntheir hours are worth taking. They should not promise a job leading \nfrom a certificate that is earned there if it is not true. They should \nhave full disclosure to students about what it means to enter into a \nstudent loan, and they ought to have some revenue coming in other than \nthe Federal Government.\n  For many of these, 75 to 90 percent of their revenue comes straight \nfrom the Federal Government. When the GAO did the undercover survey of \nwhat some of these for-profit schools are saying to students, some of \nthese recruiters were saying to them: I am a recruiter, but I just \nfinished college, and I have a big debt I will never pay back. I am \ngoing to have a good job and make a lot of money, so it is OK.\n  Do you know what happens when you default on a student loan in \nAmerica? It is time we tell students what they get into if they get in \nover their heads with a worthless education.\n  Your loan will be turned over to a collection agency and they may \ncharge 25 percent more to collect what you owe.\n  Your wages can be garnisheed; that is, they can take it right out of \nyour paycheck.\n  Your tax refunds can be intercepted by the Federal Government if you \nstill owe on a student loan.\n  Your Social Security benefits ultimately will be withheld if you end \nup in debt at that point in life from a student loan.\n  Your defaulted student loan will be reported to a credit bureau and \nwill remain on your credit history for 7 years, even after it is paid. \nThat means you may not be able to buy a car, a house or take out a \ncredit card. It might be you cannot get a job because of your credit \nhistory. You cannot take out more student loans or receive Pell grants \nto go back to school.\n  You are no longer eligible for HUD or VA loans.\n  You could be barred from the Armed Forces and might be denied some \njobs in the Federal Government.\n  I might also add, most student loans are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. When the bottom falls out and you go to bankruptcy court, \nthat is the one that will still be hanging over you when you walk out \nof that court process.\n  We have to be honest with students across America and let them know \nwhat they are getting into when they get into student loans. I borrowed \nmoney. I went to a good school. I think it paid off for me. It was an \nimportant decision. I was not misled about my education. I knew what it \nwould get, and I was willing to risk the debt to reach that goal, and \nit worked. That is a good thing.\n  For those who are misleading students and burying them deeply in \ndebt, I can tell them the time of accountability has arrived. The \nFederal Government is going to keep its obligations to the students \nacross America to help them with education, but these schools have an \nobligation to their students to be honest with them, to be accredited, \nand to produce training and education that leads to a good-paying job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Recovery Act\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss something I regret. I \nregret that Democrats have allowed the word ``stimulus'' to become a \ndirty word, one that we avoid using.\n  The President spoke a few weeks ago about his new plan to invest $50 \nbillion in new infrastructure--projects that will improve safety and \ntransportation. But he never once mentioned the words ``stimulus'' or \n``recovery.'' That was probably a smart move on his part because, \nfrankly, the stimulus has gotten a bad rap. But this is a reputation it \nabsolutely does not deserve.\n  There are Members of this body who opposed the Recovery Act because \nthey thought it would not work or did not jibe with their theory of \neconomics or of how the government should address recessions, and that \nis fine. They were entitled to vote the way they thought best. But now \na year and a half later, we have been able to see the economic effects \nof the Recovery Act. To deny it has been a success is simply to ignore \nthe facts.\n  A recent poll showed that a majority of Americans believe that either \nthe stimulus bill did nothing to help the economy or even made it \nworse. The economic data, however, indicates otherwise. How do we \nexplain this disparity between what people believe and what the data \nsupports?\n  Members of the American public do not form opinions out of thin air. \nThey engage themselves. They watch the news. They listen to speeches by \nelected officials. One would expect that watching the news and \nlistening to your elected officials would be a decent way to form an \nopinion about something. Unfortunately, the talking heads on many of \nthe news shows, along with many elected officials, have been feeding \nthe American public half-truths, at best, about the Recovery Act, and \nthat, frankly, is cheating the American people out of the facts.\n  Today, I wish to go through some of these claims made by these \ntalking heads and elected officials and then follow it up with some \ndata, and that way the American people can use the facts to decide for \nthemselves.\n  Let's take claim No. 1 about the Recovery Act, made by one of my \ncolleagues in February: ``It didn't create one new job.''\n  The Congressional Budget Office--the arbiter and referee of economic \nquestions that we in the Senate all have agreed to abide by--reports \nthat the Recovery Act has increased employment by 1.4 million to 3.3 \nmillion people. A separate report issued by two respected economists \ncorroborates CBO's estimates, putting the figure at about 2.7 million \njobs. That report was issued by Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi. That is \nMark Zandi, who, incidentally, was a key economic adviser to the John \nMcCain Presidential campaign in 2008.\n  I understand that economic analysis has a lot of errors; that \nestimating jobs figures is very complex and it is difficult to \ndetermine whether a job was created or saved. But when CBO and \nrespected economists agree that employment has increased by millions of \njobs, is it at all plausible that the Recovery Act didn't create a \nsingle new job? Well, of course it is not. But that doesn't seem to \nstop some misinformed souls from claiming that.\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  Let's tackle the second claim. My friends on the other side of the \naisle often imply that tax cuts would have been more effective than the \nRecovery Act. But perhaps they have forgotten that over one-third of \nthe stimulus package in the Recovery Act was comprised of tax cuts--\n$288 billion of it.\n  Unfortunately, the tax cuts were designed in a way so that many \nAmericans didn't notice they were getting them. An extra 20 bucks on \nyour paycheck adds up for you and the economy over time but people \ndon't notice it as they do when they get a big lump sum rebate or \nrefund. But here is the thing about lump sum refunds. People like to \nsave them or pay off debts with them. When you get an extra 20 bucks in \nthe paycheck, you are more likely to spend it, giving the economy a \nboost.\n  This explains one unfortunate paradox of the Recovery Act. Because \nthe tax cut was well designed, it helped boost consumer spending, but \nnobody noticed it. But that is not a failure of Recovery Act policy, \nthat is a failure of getting the message to the American taxpayers. The \ntax cuts in the Recovery Act did their part. According to CBO, tax cuts \nfor those in lower income brackets increased GDP by $1.70 for every \ndollar in tax cut.\n  For those who would argue the Recovery Act should have been only tax \ncuts, consider this: While tax cuts for lower brackets yielded a $1.70 \nGDP boost, tax cuts for higher income earners and companies only raised \nGDP by 50 cents per dollar spent, and neither of these figures compares \nto the return on the Recovery Act's public works investment--an \nimpressive $2.50 increase in GDP for every dollar spent.\n  After tax cuts, another substantial portion of the stimulus was \nfiscal aid to States. The Recovery Act provided about $224 billion to \nStates so they wouldn't have to slash essential State programs. State \nbudgets across the country are in dire straits. The Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities estimates 46 States will have budget shortfalls \nthis year. Over the past 2 years, the Recovery Act has helped fill in a \nlarge percentage of State fiscal gaps.\n  Imagine where State budgets would be had they not received assistance \nfrom the Recovery Act. Imagine the layoffs of teachers and firefighters \nand law enforcement, and of people who deliver key social services, for \nwhich there is far more demand during an economic downturn.\n  Let's look at another misleading claim--that the Recovery Act failed \nbecause it didn't keep the employment rate under 8 percent, as \nPresident Obama promised. Well, it is true that President Obama's \nadvisers did not accurately forecast the gravity of the unemployment \ncrisis. But, frankly, nobody did. And because of the lag in \nunemployment data, we now know that unemployment had already surpassed \n8 percent by the time the Recovery Act was signed into law.\n  Let me walk you through this, because it is interesting, I promise. \nThe claim about Obama's promise of keeping unemployment down actually \ncame from a report issued by Obama's advisers on January 9, 2009--\nbefore he took office. In early January, we only had access to job \nnumbers through November. Back in November 2008, unemployment was about \n6.9 percent. By December, it had risen to 7.4 percent. But the Recovery \nAct wasn't signed until February 17, and by February the unemployment \nrate had risen to 8.2 percent.\n  So the unemployment rate was already over 8 percent when the Recovery \nAct was signed, let alone had any chance to go into effect. By that \ntime, Obama's advisers, along with most other economists, had realized \nthe tide of unemployment was going to be much more severe. So it is \nfair to say that President Obama's advisers underestimated the coming \nemployment crisis, but it is not fair to say that unemployment \nexceeding 8 percent was a failure of the Recovery Act. It is \npreposterous to say that because the report issued by Obama's advisers \ncontained an economic forecast that later proved to be inaccurate, \ntherefore, Obama lied or that he broke his promise or that he is an \nexpert in snake oil, as I heard a talking head on a Sunday show say. A \nforecasting error is not a lie.\n  Let's look at another claim. As an elected official has stated:\n\n       According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the \n     stimulus was passed we have lost 3 million real jobs, 2.4 \n     million net jobs in this economy and all the calculations and \n     reports from the White House are not going to change the fact \n     that their economic stimulus bill has failed.\n\n  Okay, this is a fun one because, technically, the first part of the \nclaim is correct--since the Recovery Act, we have had a net job loss.\n  Here is a chart illustrating the job losses mentioned. These are job \nlosses, here. See. You may notice a trend. I am going to show another \nchart that might put this more in context. You may notice a trend here. \nThis is President Bush. If we had a slide whistle, it would whistle up \non the scale. And if you had a slide whistle for here--here is the \nRecovery Act--it would whistle up on the scale. There is a trend. You \ncan tell by my slide whistle that the Recovery Act was clearly a \nturning point. We went from a downward slide to a relatively upward \nclimb. It is not as fast as we would like, and things have been \nslightly stalled of late, but clearly--clearly--we are doing much \nbetter.\n  This is Bush's last day in office.\n  In fact, one could make the argument that the stimulus was key in \nreversing our slide into a depression. In fact, that is pretty much \nexactly what Blinder and Zandi have said about the Recovery Act. \nRemember, this is Mark Zandi, who was John McCain's economic adviser. \nThe Blinder-Zandi report sums it up this way: The government response \nto the crisis ``probably averted what could have been called Great \nDepression 2.0.'' Again, from the adviser to the 2008 Republican \nPresidential candidate.\n  I think avoiding a depression is, on balance, a good thing, and I \nthink most Americans would agree. And if they knew the facts, they \nwould thank President Obama and the Members of Congress who kept us \nfrom sliding into another Great Depression.\n  Let's look at a fifth claim. A prominent elected official said \nrecently that he thinks the Recovery Act created only bureaucratic \ngovernment jobs--only bureaucratic government jobs. In response to \nthat, I wish to show a few recovery projects in progress in my State of \nMinnesota. You can judge for yourself whether they are bureaucratic \ngovernment jobs.\n  I am not sure how the cameras work here in the Senate for those \nwatching on TV, but maybe they can push in here on Jamie, a Local 361 \ncarpenter from Cloquet, MN. Here he is performing scaffolding work on \nthe north tower of the Duluth aerial lift bridge. He is doing this in \nJanuary 2010. The Duluth aerial lift bridge, I think, is the largest in \nNorth America. The south tower will be completed this winter as part of \nthe two-phase $5 million project funded by the Recovery Act.\n  Jamie, his wife and two children--aged 19 and 14--went without health \ninsurance for 13 months when he was on unemployment. He was hired for \nthis job last winter and worked enough hours on this job to get back on \nhealth insurance. The Recovery Act has enabled Jamie and his family to \nget back on their feet. I ask you: Does Jamie look like a government \nbureaucrat?\n  How about Cecil? Here is a picture of Cecil. I want to ask you: Does \nCecil look like a bean counter for OMB? Cecil is pictured here working \non the Highway 610 extension project in Brooklyn Park, MN. He is \nbuilding 6 miles of sound walls. I attended the groundbreaking ceremony \nfor this project. So did a Republican Congressman from this district, \nwho voted against the stimulus package. Cecil had been unemployed since \n2008 before being hired onto this Recovery Act-funded project. He has \ntold us he is very thankful for the opportunity to earn a living wage \nto support his family.\n  Next, we have Spencer, a Local 49'er crane operator for a contractor \nnamed LUNDA, working on the 694/35W widening of bridge and on and off \nramps--a $2.5 million project. There are 11 onsite contractors--private \ncontractors--working on the project. Spencer, who is 23, is from Isle, \nMN, and was unemployed until this job came along. Spencer told me:\n\n       I wasn't working until this job came along . . . investing \n     in our country's infrastructure is an investment in my \n     financial fate and family's future.\n\n  As I said, his Local 49'ers run heavy machinery. I don't know about \nyou, but I don't know many Washington bureaucrats who can safely \noperate heavy machinery.\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n  Who is next? Matthew and Randy, both Laborers Local 563. They had \nbeen employed by contractor CS McCrossan for 7 and 13 years, \nrespectively, before they were both laid off last fall. But this \nspring, they were hired back to work on several different Recovery Act-\nfunded projects. They are pictured here working on a pedestrian \nreplacement bridge on 49th Avenue Northeast over Central Avenue in \nColumbia Heights, MN. You can see them. They are, you know, a couple of \nCBO paper pushers, I guess.\n  Next we have Sheila. Here she is working on the night shift on the I-\n94 rehabilitation project. I-94 is a huge interstate highway in \nMinnesota--a very important artery. Sheila is new to the construction \nindustry but her work ethic has led her colleagues to comment that she \nhas a bright future in the industry. These are just a few of the 70,000 \nRecovery Act projects happening across our country.\n\n  Here is another project in Two Harbors. These guys are building a \nwater tower. In addition to five crews of workers on the project, the \ntower tank is made of 723,000 pounds of American steel. Let's get a \npicture of it; looks like a little more in progress--723,000 pounds of \nAmerican steel, and the rebar is another 33,000 pounds of American \nsteel. So additional American workers made this steel. More American \nworkers mined the iron, Minnesotans on the Iron Range--Minnesotans. \nMore jobs. I visited Two Harbors on September 6, just a few weeks ago, \nand personally saw this project in progress.\n  As you can see, these folks are not in suits and ties shuffling \npapers; they are building bridges, they are building roads, they are \nbuilding water treatment plants and water towers. These projects are \ngoing to improve transportation and the health and safety of people in \nMinnesota. Because of these jobs, made possible by the Recovery Act, \nthey will keep a roof over the heads of their families, put food on the \nkitchen table, send their kids to college, and, yes, buy stuff.\n  Another vital component of the Recovery Act that is often overlooked \nis its expanded funding for unemployment insurance that helped keep 3.3 \nmillion unemployed people, including 1 million children, out of poverty \nin 2010.\n  Another overlooked but critical program in the Recovery Act is the \nfunding for Head Start. The $2 billion allocation preserved Head Start \nand Early Head Start programming for 64,000 children across the \ncountry--over 900 in Minnesota alone. These programs are helping the \nmost vulnerable kids, kids in our communities.\n  It is simple. Economic analysis suggests that the Recovery Act \nboosted demand, created millions of jobs, kept families in their homes, \nand helped the economy start growing again.\n  Let me tell you what I love about being a Senator as opposed to being \na candidate for the Senate. I think most of my colleagues can relate to \nthis. The Presiding Officer has been a statewide candidate many times. \nWhen you are a candidate, you are speaking mainly to your own people. \nIf you are Republican, you are speaking to Republicans to get the \nnomination and then to get out the vote. If you are a Democrat, you are \ndoing the same. But as a Senator, you talk to everyone.\n  As Senator, I have been privileged to go all around the State of \nMinnesota and talk to folks at economic development meetings. I have \ntalked to county commissioners and mayors and city councilmen and small \nbusinesses and community bankers. You know what. I don't know what \nparty they are in, and I don't care. We are trying to get people going. \nWe are trying to get the economy moving. Everywhere in Minnesota, do \nyou know what these folks say to me? Thank you for the Recovery Act. \nThank you. Thank you for the teachers we are able to keep on here in \nBrainerd, the firefighters, and for the Workforce Investment Act funds \nso we are able to train people for jobs that were available but didn't \nhave trained people for. Thanks for the highway underpass so school \nbuses do not have to cross the train tracks or an ambulance doesn't \nhave to cross the train tracks. Thanks for funds for the wastewater \nplant or for rural broadband or for the weatherization of public \nbuildings--speaking of which, Michael Grunwald, writing for Time \nMagazine, wrote this:\n\n       The Recovery Act is the most ambitious energy legislation \n     in history, converting the Energy Department into the world's \n     largest venture-capital fund. It's pouring $90 billion into \n     clean energy, including unprecedented investments in a smart \n     grid; energy efficiency; electric cars; renewable power from \n     the Sun, wind and Earth; cleaner coal; advanced biofuels; and \n     factories to manufacture green stuff in the U.S. The act will \n     also triple the number of smart electrical meters in our \n     homes, quadruple the number of hybrids in the Federal auto \n     fleet and finance far-out energy research through a new \n     government incubator modeled after the Pentagon agency that \n     fathered the Internet.\n\n  A few weeks ago, I heard a prominent conservative talking head on one \nof the Sunday news shows describe the Recovery Act this way. He said:\n\n       If I pay my neighbor $1,000 to dig a hole in my backyard \n     and fill it up again, and he pays me $1,000 to dig a hole in \n     his backyard and fill it up again, according to the national \n     income statistics, that is a $2,000 increment to GDP and two \n     jobs have been created. The American people understand, \n     however, there is no real wealth created in this kind of \n     transfer payment.\n\n  How offensive. How out of touch. Yet this is why so many Americans \nbelieve the Recovery Act has not created any jobs or just created jobs \nfor bureaucrats.\n  I worry that my speech today is too little, too late. I worry that \nmost Americans have already formed their opinion about the Recovery Act \nbased on the inaccuracies they hear from beltway pundits or from \nelected officials. But I challenge these talking heads and these \nelected officials to find the Spencers and Sheilas and Cecils and \nRandys in their State, go out and watch them work or talk to a teacher \nin a classroom or a cop on the beat. They are not digging and filling \nholes in their neighbor's backyard. They are doing skilled work, \nnecessary work, hard work rebuilding our roads, teaching our children, \nand getting paid for it. With their paychecks, they buy food for their \nfamilies and make their car payments and maybe buy a new one, which \ngenerates more demand. That is an economic recovery in the making.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n\n\n               U.s. Senate Staff: Great Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, last week I stood at this desk and \nrecognized my 100th and final great Federal employee. Since May, I have \ncome to the floor each week to share the stories of dedicated men and \nwomen who have chosen to work in public service.\n  Honoring these individuals has been truly one of the highlights of my \ntime in office. As my term nears its end, I look over at this mosaic of \ndedicated government employees, and I hope that these speeches each \nweek in their honor have drawn attention to the excellent work they \nhave done and continue to do for our Nation.\n  At a time when politicians express their frustration with lack of \nprogress by attacking nameless, faceless Washington ``bureaucrats,'' I \nthought it important to shed light each week on the face, story, and \naccomplishments of individual Federal employees. In that way, in my own \nsmall way, I hope I have helped remind people that those who pursue \ngovernment work are constantly trying their best, often at great \npersonal sacrifice, to make this a better country and a better world.\n  These 100 are a microcosm of our government workforce; as I have said \nbefore, they are not exceptional but exemplary. They come from over 40 \ndepartments, agencies, and military service branches. They represent a \nFederal workforce of 1.9 million.\n  Just as we 100 Senators are a snapshot of the American people, these \n100 great Federal employees are a snapshot of the hard-working men and \nwomen who serve the American people every day.\n  But, just as it takes more than a 100 great Federal employees to \ncarry out the work of the American people, it takes more than us 100 \nSenators to perform the work of the U.S. Senate. This week, in closing \nmy series of speeches\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nhonoring public service, I want to recognize the untiring efforts of \nU.S. Senate staff.\n  I am not only speaking of those who work for Members as personal \nstaff. I mean everyone here who has a role in making the Senate work, \nincluding those who work in the cloakrooms, the Parliamentarian's staff \nand that of the clerks, those who provide support services through the \nSergeant at Arms and the Secretary of the Senate, the men and women who \nserve as Capitol Police, and so many more. Over 7,200 people work as \nSenate staff in personal offices, for committees, and for the various \nservices that keep the modern Senate functioning.\n  All of them know well the importance of the Senate in our system of \ngovernment and the role it plays binding our large and diverse Nation \ntogether. Indeed, on the west pediment of the Dirksen Building it is \ninscribed: ``The Senate is the living symbol of our union of states.''\n  It is a living symbol in that we rely upon a deliberative group of \nwise men and women to smooth out our differences and keep fastened \nsecurely our union's many parts.\n  We cannot do this without the help of our staff. They brief us on \nissues and provide up-to-the minute research. They are our link with \nexecutive agencies and the military. They maintain our busy schedules \nand keep us on time, or mostly so. They form a network that links our \noffices together with one another and make bipartisan deals possible. \nMost important, they keep us connected to our constituents while we are \nhere working for them in Washington.\n  Who are these staffers, and what brought them to these Halls?\n  Many of them are young, in their twenties and thirties. They have an \nenergy and passion for the issues on which they work. Those who stay \nmore than a few years often spend their whole careers here, becoming \nsome of our Nation's leading experts in their issue areas. Just like \nMembers, staff preserve the institutional memory of this body and pass \non its traditions and history.\n  We have staffers from both civilian and military backgrounds. Every \nprofession and field of education is represented here. Senate staffers \nhave trained as doctors, lawyers, writers, farmers, nurses, engineers, \nteachers, manufacturers, the list is endless. They come from every \nState and territory in the Union.\n  They are creative and intellectual, pragmatic and imbued with good-\nold common sense. Senate staffers are diverse in both their origins and \ntheir ideas.\n  The paths that led them to the Senate are diverse as well. Staffers \nhave come here because they are driven by a shared love of country and \nthey long to play a constructive role in our Nation's history. One of \nthe common traits of Senate staffers is that, when asked, they will say \nthat there is something truly special about working in the Capitol and \nthese impressive office buildings. Their eyes light up talking about \nthe history and gravity of this place. They share the great feeling of \nexcitement from living inside the news.\n  Staff work under the long shadows cast by this body's Members. \nInfrequently seen in the public spotlight, nevertheless their hands \nmold and shape everything we debate and pass. Here no 2 days are the \nsame; there is no routine.\n  I like to think that my staffers are the best, but I know that every \nMember or Senate officer thinks his or her staffers to be the greatest. \nI would never dare dispute any of them.\n  Senate staffers share in common a deep sense of pride in their public \nservice. They share the experience of walking through these august \nHalls and feeling goose-bumps from the power and weight of history and \ntheir palpable role in it. On both sides of the aisle they all want \nAmerica to be strong, prosperous, and safe.\n  Senate staffers are so great because they take their jobs so \npersonally.\n  This is why they work so hard. It is why they are here on weekends, \ndrafting legislation, hammering out deals across the aisle, and \nadvising their Members on the next day's votes. It is why front desk \nstaff assistants are so compelled to engage with the constituents who \ncall in with questions about bills.\n  It is why security guards, maintenance personnel, and those who work \nin the Printing, Graphics, and Direct Mail division trudged through the \nsnowstorm to get here when all other government offices were closed. It \nis why all kinds of staff are here past midnight regularly.\n  I was a Senate staffer for 22 years. My service as chief of staff to \nJoe Biden gave me the chance each day to work with wonderful people on \nboth sides of the aisle who came to the Senate motivated by love of \ncountry. Many of those with whom I worked during those days went on to \nother jobs in government and continue in public service today. A number \nof former Senate staffers now serve in the House of Representatives and \nin this Chamber.\n  As I come to the end of this series, I cannot help but think about \nall those great Federal employees I have not had a chance to honor from \nthis desk. There are so, so many. They are the unsung heroes that keep \nour Nation moving ever forward.\n  I hope my colleagues and all Americans will join me in thanking those \nwho serve and have served as staff here in the U.S. Senate. They are \nall truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey and Mr. Durbin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3849 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3671\n\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue of \nincredible importance to my home State of West Virginia, to the \nPresiding Officer's home State of Virginia, and, indeed, to our entire \ncountry; that is, the safety of our coal miners.\n  Unfortunately, during the past 4 years, West Virginia has dealt with \nthree significant mining disasters. On an early morning in January \n2006, an explosion rocked through a central West Virginia coal mine \nkilling 12 people. Less than a month later, tragedy struck again at a \nmine fire in Logan County, where two more miners were lost, and just \nthis past spring, West Virginians mourned, yet again, when 29 of their \nneighbors were lost in the worst coal mining disaster in nearly a half \ncentury.\n  Through these tragedies, our Nation was sadly reminded of the dangers \nand risks miners face every day to provide a living for their families \nand affordable energy for our country. We collectively were reminded \nhow important it is for miners, companies, and regulators to work \ntogether to keep our mines safe. Finally, we witnessed how my fellow \nWest Virginians have come together in the midst of crisis and in a time \nof tragedy.\n  Yet the story of West Virginia lies not simply in such tragedy but, \nrather, in the story of thousands of West Virginians who go to work \nevery day to produce nearly half the electricity consumed in this \ncountry. It is a story of good-paying jobs with benefits that help form \nthe foundation of strong families and strong communities across my home \nState. It is a story my predecessor, Robert C. Byrd, knew very well.\n  In remarks he gave as a young Congressman in his maiden speech on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives nearly 60 years ago, Senator Byrd \nemphasized the importance of coal in a\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nspeech lamenting our Nation's increasing dependence on foreign oil, \nremarking in that 1953 speech:\n\n       We . . . must pursue not a policy that is detrimental to \n     the economy of this nation and which impairs its strength \n     while enriching other nations, but a policy that will \n     strengthen our beloved country.\n\n  Those are words that certainly resonate and ring true today, which is \nwhy we should continue our efforts to develop technologies that allow \nour country to harness this abundant energy source in a cleaner way, \nsuch as the bipartisan carbon sequestration bill put forward by \nSenators Rockefeller and Voinovich.\n  Coal can and must be a part of the solution to the energy challenges \nof the 21st century. West Virginians know this and understand that our \nfuture depends on our ability as a nation to extract and burn coal more \ncleanly. West Virginians simply want to be part of that conversation \nand part of the solution.\n  As we move forward to ensure coal's vital role in the future of our \neconomy, we must simultaneously also keep our focus on assuring that \nmines remain safe. It is not simply about preventing or investigating a \nlarge-scale disaster when that may capture the attention of the Nation \nand the world for a brief period of time. Rather, when tragedy strikes \nin a coal mine, it is usually far away from satellite trucks, \ninternational media, and the glare of television cameras. All too \noften, when a coal miner is seriously injured or perishes or succumbs \nafter a battle with black lung disease, it is simply a community and a \nfamily who mourns quietly.\n  I would note that in addition to the 29 miners lost at Upper Big \nBranch, another 15 coal miners have been killed on the job so far this \nyear, and it is only September.\n  Sadly, these deaths often go unnoticed by the country at large. The \nloss is just as great and just as tragic to the families, which is why \neveryone must remain committed to coal mine safety each and every day \nand each and every shift.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate understand this and have taken \nthis responsibility seriously. The changes brought about in 2006 after \nSago and Aracoma were significant and positive. I was privileged to \nhave played a small role in drafting legislation in West Virginia to \nhelp form part of the basis for the Federal MINER Act--the first \ncomprehensive mine safety legislation passed by Congress in nearly 30 \nyears.\n  Our work, however, is not complete. In his final months of service to \nWest Virginia and our Nation, Senator Byrd was working with Senator \nRockefeller to craft and push additional mine safety legislation. \nDuring my brief tenure in this body, that has been a fight I have been \nhonored to carry on. Although these efforts may not be completed during \nmy tenure, I have every confidence that the Senate will continue its \nhard work on passing additional coal mine safety legislation.\n  There are serious issues that additional legislation needs to \naddress. We need comprehensive and targeted inspections and increased \ntransparency in mine safety recordkeeping. We need a sophisticated and \neffective way to separate good operators from the bad. For those who \nare irresponsible, we need enhanced oversight and enhanced penalties. \nWe need to strengthen protection for miners who speak out about unsafe \nconditions and make certain their livelihoods are not jeopardized when \nthey choose to do so.\n  Although my time in the Senate is not long, it has been and will \nalways remain my enduring privilege to have served in this body \nalongside so many dedicated public servants, including and especially \nmy friend, colleague, and senior Senator from West Virginia, Jay \nRockefeller. My remarks here today are on behalf of the State we \nrepresent and her people whom we both revere.\n  No coal miner should have to go to work fearing for his safety, and \nno coal miner should fear for his job for raising concerns about that \nsafety. Coal mine safety is workplace safety, and it is the right thing \nfor our country to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia wishes \nto continue as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the Senate, the core job, \nobviously, of any Senator is to do all we can every day to help our \nconstituents. It has been such an honor for this Senator to stand with \nour newest Senator from West Virginia, Carte Goodwin, and work with him \nto do exactly that.\n  Before joining this body, Senator Goodwin made serving West Virginia \nhis focus in everything he did--as an attorney; general counsel to our \nGovernor; chairman of the School Building Authority, which is a very \ncomplex matter--and all the while exuding enormous character, great \ncharacter, dignity, and always keeping West Virginia families first and \nforemost in his mind.\n  It has been interesting to watch him on this floor in this relatively \nshort period of time in which he has been a Senator and still is--the \nway people come up to him, see him as a breath of fresh air, respond to \nhis intelligence, his integrity, his modesty, and his very smart brain.\n  Senator Goodwin comes from a family deeply committed to public \nservice that has taught him to work very hard, to give back, and be \nproud of where he came from. I respect him a very great deal.\n  More importantly, he has a deeply ingrained sense of what matters to \nWest Virginia. He does not come from one of our big urban counties. He \ncomes from a very small rural county, Jackson County. He knows what \nworking families need. He knows what people who represent them in \nWashington need to bear in mind. As I say, his character is strong, his \nwork ethic is unmatched, and his heart is always in the right place.\n  So it is a sad day for me, in a sense, because I respect him so much \nand like him so much and I will not be hearing him enough, except if he \nis dissatisfied with my work, in which case he can call me and tell me \nthat and I will be taking copious notes.\n  I join Senator Goodwin to talk about an issue that impacts the lives \nof every American in this country; that is, workplace safety.\n  This past April, as West Virginia's other Senator has mentioned, we \nsuffered the worst mining disaster in 40 years in this country. It was \nstatistically shocking, it was personally horrifying, and deeply \npoignant. Twenty-nine miners were killed in an explosion at the Upper \nBig Branch Mine in Montcoal.\n  I was there with the families as we hoped and we prayed for any sign \nthat their loved ones would emerge. For the most part, they did \nnot. The sorrow and hurt and anguish I saw on their faces is \nunimaginable and indescribable. It is something that no family should \nhave to go through, but it happens in West Virginia and, as it turns \nout, in other States.\n\n  But mining tragedies are not just happening in West Virginia. Nearly \none-third of our States have experienced mining disasters this year, \nincluding Alabama, Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, \nKentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, \nand Utah. Yet the mining industry is not the only industry where \nsignificant improvements to workplace safety are necessary. We have \nseen major disasters take the lives of hard-working Americans employed \nin a variety of other industries: 7 dying in a refinery blast in \nWashington, 6 in an explosion at a clean energy plant in Connecticut; \n11 died with the BP Oil rig disaster off the coast of Louisiana which \nwe all know about.\n  In fact, there were more than 4,300 workplace deaths in the United \nStates in the year 2009, this year not having been completed, but it is \na decent benchmark. That is 11 deaths each and every day of the year--\n11 men and women who went to work but did not return home to their \nloved ones.\n  This is America. We are the greatest country on Earth. All of us \ntogether must do more to protect the lives of these workforces. That is \nwhy Senator Goodwin and I introduced the Robert C. Byrd Mine and \nWorkplace Safety and Health Act of 2010.\n  Senator Byrd worked diligently with the two of us on this bill, as \nhave Chairman Harkin, Senator Murray, and obviously Senator Goodwin. \nThey are committed advocates to the working men and women of our \ncountry and\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nin our State, and I wish to thank them for their tireless dedication to \ndoing what is right.\n  This legislation contains commonsense proposals that will give \nAmericans the peace of mind that comes from safe working conditions. It \nfixes the broken ``pattern of violations'' process which was meant to \ngive MSHA authority to crack down on mines that repeatedly violate our \nlaws, but has never been effectively implemented, this process. It \ntakes a hard look at MSHA itself to make sure it is doing its job by \ncreating an independent panel to investigate the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration's--MSHA's--role in serious accidents. In these matters \nwhere regulation is done on discrete and for the most part invisible \nindustries, the people who do the regulating and the checking need to \nbe looked at carefully, just as do those who operate coal mines. It \ngives teeth to existing whistleblower protections so miners can come \nforward to report safety concerns. It gives MSHA additional tools to \nkeep miners safe, including the ability to subpoena documents and \ntestimony outside of the public hearing context. This is something \nwhich OSHA has, and it is amazing to me that MSHA has not had it and \ndoes not have it. If this bill were to pass, it would happen.\n  Finally, sort of, it provides protections that will apply to workers \nacross, as I indicated earlier, all industries; greater rights for \nvictims and their families to participate in investigations and \nenforcement actions; updating civil and criminal penalties; and the \nrequirement that hazardous conditions be addressed immediately so that \nlitigation doesn't shoot right into the middle of it and delay the \nwhole process.\n  Over the past few months, I have been working with my colleagues on \nthe HELP Committee on bipartisan legislation--and I deeply appreciate \nthe efforts of Senators Enzi, Isakson, and Hatch on the Republican \nside. I have worked closely with Senator Enzi and Isakson in the past \non other matters, first with Senator Enzi on, of all things, the \nPresident's Commission on Coal back in the 1970s when he was mayor of \nGillette, WY, and later with both him and Senator Isakson to pass the \nMINER Act which came right after the Sago disaster.\n  I stood with both Senators Enzi and Isakson at the Sago disaster as \nwe tried to comfort families, as we sat in circles and Senator Isakson \nand Senator Enzi seemed to--well, Senator Enzi comes from a coal-\nproducing State, Senator Isakson does not--but both of them profoundly \nrelated to the families. It was very clear in their voices and what we \nsaw in their eyes, and the families felt it. I know they care deeply \nabout coal miners.\n  But it is also no secret that I am deeply frustrated we have yet to \nproduce a bipartisan bill. The families of the Upper Big Branch are \nwondering, What is the holdup, and, quite frankly, so am I.\n  The provisions that should be included in a strong workplace safety \nbill are not that hard to figure out. In fact, they are the very \nprovisions Senator Goodwin and I have included in the Robert C. Byrd \nMine and Workplace Safety and Health Act, which is why I come before \nthe Senate today to at the proper time ask for unanimous consent that \nour legislation be passed.\n  Before I ask for unanimous consent, which I will do, I wish to \naddress three of the main objections I have heard from my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. First, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have expressed concerns that including workplace safety \nstandards for all industry amounts to overreaching. I am sure the loved \nones of the workers who died at the refinery, at the clean energy \nplant, and the BP Oil rig would see things a little bit differently. I \nam sure they would tell us that this bill cannot simply be about mine \nsafety alone--although that is huge and the bulk of the bill--we must \ninclude important Occupational Safety and Health Administration \nprovisions that cover all industries. OSHA, for example, does have \nsubpoena power, and it does cover all industries, but it too needs to \nbe strengthened.\n  Second, my colleagues have questioned whether MSHA, the Mine Safety \nand Health Administration, needs adequate subpoena authority. The idea \nthat a law enforcement agency such as MSHA does not have subpoena power \nto proactively make mines safer is, to me, unimaginable. We are seeing \nproblems with the existing system right now. The State of West \nVirginia's subpoenas in the Upper Big Branch investigation are being \nchallenged in court--totally predictable. The intent, of course, is to \nchallenge them in court before they can be effective and to prevent the \nquestioning of company officials and others with vital information. \nThat is the story of mine enforcement in the coal fields.\n  Third, it has been suggested that we do not have enough data to \nsupport additional whistleblower protections for coal miners. Let me \nanswer that by saying that back in April, the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee heard testimony from Jeffrey Harris, a miner \nfrom Beckley, WV. Jeffrey told us--I was there--what it was like to \nwork for Massey Energy. This is quoting Jeffrey Harris:\n\n       Either you worked or you quit. If you complained, you'd be \n     singled out and get fired. Employees were scared but, like \n     me, they have to feed their families. Jobs are scarce, and \n     good-paying coal mining jobs are hard to come by.\n\n  The Presiding Officer knows exactly what I mean. We are looking at \n$60,000-plus salaries, mostly in the very rural areas of our States, \nthe southwestern part of the Presiding Officer's State, and it is quite \ntrue. What is somebody to do? They have a $60,000 salary or they have \nnothing, because jobs in those areas are not plentiful or, in some \ncases, simply don't exist.\n  To continue, in May, the House Education and Labor Committee held a \nhearing in Beckley, WV. We heard testimony from miners who have worked \nat Upper Big Branch and one of those miners, Stanley, nicknamed \n``Goose,'' Stewart told us that:\n\n       No one felt they could go to management and express their \n     fears. We knew that we would be marked men. And the \n     management would look for ways to fire us. Maybe not that \n     day, maybe not that week, but somewhere down the line, we \n     would disappear. We'd seen it happen.\n\n  So enough is enough. No employee should be fired for reporting safety \nconcerns. A lot of manufacturing companies--I am thinking of Toyota in \nWest Virginia--have the assembly line and they have a rope that goes \nall the way down. If any worker sees any problem of any aspect, whether \nit is real or he imagined it or whatever, he pulls that rope, the \nproduction line shuts down, and the manager comes over and they fix the \nproblem if it exists. But the comfort that brings to the worker is a \nvery small price to pay for very well-made cars.\n  Finally, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed \nconcerns about reforming the pattern of violations process. The pattern \nof violations process, which does not sound very interesting but which \nis usually important in bringing things to a head, to justice--was \nintended by Congress to allow MSHA to take action against operatives \nthat refused to follow our laws. But to date, no mine has ever \nofficially been placed on pattern status. Why would that be? Well, one \ncan only speculate.\n  I think everyone agrees that the process must be fixed, but what I \ndon't want to do is to tie MSHA's hands or to dictate a formula that \nwill virtually guarantee that no mine is ever placed in pattern of \nviolations status. I want a proactive system, one that will identify \ntroubled mines before accidents happen and one that focuses on \nrehabilitating mines that are having problems.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3671, the \nRobert C. Byrd Mine Workplace Safety and Health Act of 2010, and that \nthe Senate then proceed to its consideration; that the bill be read \nthree times, passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the Senator from West Virginia notes, the \nonly change in mine safety law that was\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\nmade was with his and my leadership and several others. That was the \nfirst change in 30 years. I know he is aware that in the area of OSHA, \nthe only legislative changes that have been made in the 28 years the \nlaw has existed were under my chairmanship, with me as a major sponsor. \nSo I am interested in safety.\n  The Republicans weren't invited to work on a bipartisan bill until 2 \nweeks before the August recess. We had our staffs work through the \nentire recess. There were numerous meetings. We were making great \nprocess. I think we had agreed on 14 different parts or so. We still \nhad six or so provisions that were in the process of negotiation, but \nvery close, and seven or so that the Senators themselves would have to \nwork out. So I am disappointed that was called off. It was not called \noff by my staff. I think we could have had a bipartisan bill that would \nwind up unanimous on this side like the last one, with only a few \nobjections on the House side.\n  So I am disappointed my colleague is attempting to bring up a bill \nwith no bipartisan support at this late stage of the Senate schedule. \nThey went back to the original one, not the one we have been \nnegotiating. If the majority truly wanted to pass a bill on this issue, \nwe would have continued those bipartisan negotiations, or they could \nhave taken this bill through the Senate procedure and allowed a hearing \nand a markup on the bill.\n  As I stated last week on the floor, if this were to be brought up \nthis way, I would have to object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, having objected, I would like to take a \nmoment to clear up some confusion about what caused the breakdown of \nbipartisan negotiations on mine safety legislation last week.\n  The terrible tragedy that occurred in West Virginia this past April \nhas focused us again on the strength of our Federal mine safety laws \nand regulations. As a Senator from a State that leads the Nation in \ncoal production, I have always considered workplace safety as one of \nthe most important missions of the HELP Committee and I have been \npleased to work across the aisle to improve safety. That is exactly \nwhat I have tried to do this year as well with my colleagues from West \nVirginia and members of the committee.\n  As my colleagues well know, negotiations had been making significant \nprogress until we ran into a stumbling block known as the election \ncycle. The staffs of seven Senators had been meeting several times a \nweek for over 2 months and all throughout the recess period. Agreements \nhad been formed on over a dozen important proposals, and several more \nimportant ones were right on the brink of compromise when the talks \nwere abruptly called off until after the election. Despite what has \nbeen said in the press and on this floor, the simple fact is that we \nmight well have had an agreement by now if the majority hadn't decided \nthey would rather have an election issue. Certainly, it is not for me \nto consult on the political calculations of my colleagues. But it seems \nto me that political theatre and failing to work together to get \nimportant things like this done are exactly what the American people \nare so frustrated by this year.\n  We are serving this Nation best when we work together to accomplish \nthe people's business. The formula is not that complicated and, really, \nanyone can do it:\n  Bring both sides together for discussions,\n  Establish agreed upon goals and work toward agreement on those goals,\n  Consult with stakeholders that will be affected by the changes being \ndiscussed,\n  Once substantial agreement has been reached, determine which issues \nthe sides will never be able to agree upon, and set those aside for \nanother day's debate. This is what I call the 80-20 rule.\n  This formula has worked in the past for the very issue we are \ndiscussing today--mine safety. In 2006, when I was chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, we were faced with a string of tragic mine accidents in West \nVirginia. In response to the first one, Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nKennedy organized a trip to Sago, WV, to meet with miners, victims' \nfamilies and investigators. The three of us, along with Senators \nIsakson, Murray, and Byrd, then began negotiations and were able to \ncome up with an agreement in less than 2 months--the MINER Act, which \nwas the first major revision of the Mine Safety and Health Act since \n1977. This bill made important improvements to the emergency \npreparedness of underground mines and has fostered tremendous \nimprovements in communications technology adaptability to the \nunderground environment.\n  One of the reasons I am so proud of the MINER Act is that we wrote it \nin the way I believe all legislation should be drafted. We brought in \nall of the stakeholders--the union, the industry, the safety experts, \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administration--MSHA--and we sat them all \naround the table and worked through the biggest safety concerns and the \nbest way to approach them. Because of the bipartisan nature of the \nbill, it sailed through a committee markup, was passed by the Senate \nunanimously a week later, and passed the House 2 weeks later with just \n37 House Members opposing. One more week later it was signed into law. \nThat is how it was done.\n  During my tenure as the chairman of the HELP Committee, we were able \nto move 27 bills to enactment this way. In total, we reported 35 bills \nout of committee and, of those, 25 passed the Senate. This is the kind \nof cooperation and accomplishment Americans are demanding, especially \non an issue as important and timely as workplace safety.\n  Every day, thousands of Americans go to work in the energy production \nindustry. The work they do benefits every single one of us and \nunderpins our entire economy. This year, major accidents in the energy-\nproducing sector have taken the lives of 29 men in West Virginia, 6 in \nConnecticut, 7 in Washington State, 3 in Texas and 11 men off the coast \nof Louisiana.\n  If there was ever a time to work together to actually enact \nlegislation, as opposed to playing at political theatre, this should be \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first, I wish to reemphasize how much \nI respect Senator Enzi, the senior Senator from Wyoming, and the fact \nthat he is quite right about the MINER Act and what took place after \nSago, which was another rural spot in West Virginia where a number of \npeople were killed--a lot of anguish--and it was the first time in 30 \nyears that there had been any revision of the Federal mine safety laws.\n  I have to say, though, that the bill we passed, the MINER Act, was \nnot fully--because it had to pass through the committee at that time \nthat was controlled by the present minority, it did not come out as \nstrongly as I would have preferred. However, it was a good bill and has \nhad a good effect in mining.\n  One of the aspects of mining, which is hard for people to understand, \nis that there is no margin for error. There is no margin for it. It is \na discreet industry, which, for the most part, is carried on out of \nsight--in this case, underground. The great majority--I would say well \nover 95 percent--of West Virginians and people from the Presiding \nOfficer's State have never been underground--or I guess sometimes \nSenators and Congressmen and Cabinet officers.\n  Obviously, I am disappointed that my colleague objected to this bill. \nHowever, I very much believe Senator Enzi when he said that he wants to \nstart working on a bill that will keep people safe. I point out to him \nthat at no point did we call off the negotiations. We were simply at \nthe end of the work period, at the end of August, and there had to be a \nperiod of negotiation going on with the staff, and we would come back \nand take the fruits of that negotiation and go ahead and work on the \nbill. That is what I would have wished to have seen happen, and what \nstill can happen. As I listened to the Senator from Wyoming, I believe \nhe wants that to happen. As it turns out, so do I, and I am sure \nSenator Goodwin does too.\n  People are counting on us to get this done. They deserve nothing \nless. I look forward to working on this. Obviously, it cannot be passed \nnow. We have our work to do, but then again we have our work to do in \nany event.\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\n  Senator Goodwin and I and Senators Patty Murray and Tom Harkin wanted \nto lay this down as a benchmark of what a mine safety bill should be. \nIt probably won't end up being in a bill, but that doesn't mean it \nshould not be this bill. You can't do everything at once, and I \nunderstand that. I have faith that the process will produce--as the \nSenator indicated, a number of things were agreed on by Senators, and \nsometimes I wish it were the Senators negotiating with each other; I \nthink we would get a better bill.\n  In any event, I have faith in the future, and we all have the eyes of \n29 miners and so many others looking down on us waiting for us to take \naction.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes to eulogize our former colleague and friend, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Ted \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          National Criminal Justice Association Commission Act\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, first, I would like to say that Senator \nSchumer and I are sharing 30 minutes today--we are going to have to do \nit in divided time--to speak about concerns with respect to the \nrelationship of the United States with China and where we need to move \nforward.\n  Before I do that, I wish to express my hope that my colleagues on the \nother side will allow a vote on the National Criminal Justice \nAssociation Commission Act which I introduced a year and a half ago \nafter 2 years of hearings. We have bipartisan support on this bill. The \nidentical version of this bill has passed the House of Representatives \nalready. We have met with more than 100 different organizations, from \nour office. We have a buy-in on the necessity of this bill from people \nacross the political spectrum and the ideological spectrum. The three \nmajor criminal justice associations strongly back this bill, as do the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, and the NAACP. \nThere is no controversy on this bill. It passed the House by a voice \nvote.\n  I certainly hope that before the end of this year, we will see this \nnational commission come into place. It is 18 months of getting the \nfinest minds in America to come together and examine all aspects of our \ncriminal justice system so we can do two things: one, reduce mass \nincarceration in this country but also reduce the fear in our \ncommunities with the present rate of crime.\n  There are two charts for people to look at to see why we need to move \nforward on this legislation. The first is to look at what has happened \nto the incarceration rate in this country. From 1980 up to today, it \nhas gone off the charts. We have more people in prison than any other \ncountry in the world. We have 5 percent of the world's population and \n25 percent of the world's known prison population. At the same time, \nany survey you look at, you will see that three-quarters of the people \nof this country feel less safe than they did a year ago. These two \nrealities do converge in the need to examine our entire criminal \njustice system.\n  I say again to the one or two people on the Republican side who are \nnot allowing this to come to a vote, this is not a controversial \nmeasure. The top three corrections associations in this country want to \nsee it happen, as do people on the other side.\n  I hope we can get a vote before the end of the year on this \nlegislation and start fixing our criminal justice system.\n\n\n                 United States Relationship With China\n\n  The main purpose of my speaking today is to join with Senator Schumer \nin stating to our colleagues and to the people of this country that we \nneed to have the courage and the wisdom to reconfigure our relationship \nwith China in a way that reflects more clearly its emerging status \neconomically and in terms of our own national security and the security \nof the East Asia region. This has been an incremental process. I have \nbeen talking about the need to balance a relationship with China for 20 \nyears.\n  Actually, I will begin these remarks by reading from an article I \nwrote for the Wall Street Journal 9\\1/2\\ years ago. I wrote:\n\n       China engaged in a massive modernization program . . . It \n     shifted its aviation doctrine from defensive to offensive \n     operations, including the ability for long-range strikes \n     throughout Southeast Asia. It has continually rattled its \n     sabers over the issue of Taiwan. It has laid physical claim \n     to the disputed Paracel and Spratly Island groups, thus \n     potentially straddling one of the most vital sea lanes in the \n     world. In the last year--\n\n  And this meant 2000 and 2001--\n\n     it has made repeated naval excursions into Japanese \n     territorial waters, a cause for long-term concern as China \n     still claims Japan's Senkaku Islands, just to the east of \n     Taiwan, and has never accepted the legitimacy of Okinawa's \n     1972 reversion to Japan.\n\n  This is rather relevant, even though this was written 9\\1/2\\ years \nago, as we examine Chinese activities in areas in the South China Sea \nand the need for us as a nation to stand alongside the other countries \nin this region on issues of sovereignty.\n  Just in the past 3 weeks, we saw an altercation in the Senkaku \nIslands.\n  By the way, I mentioned the Senkaku Islands in a debate in my \ncampaign 4 years ago, asking my opponent what he thought we should be \ndoing there. There were some who thought I was being a little bit \narcane by mentioning a place of which few people had ever heard.\n  It is a major flashpoint between China and Japan. Both claim these \nislands just off Taiwan. We saw a very serious diplomatic confrontation \nwith the potential to have a military confrontation just in the past \ncouple of weeks in the Senkaku Islands. The Chinese still claim the \nParacel Islands, which Vietnam also claims. They have made naval \nincursions there. They claim the Spratly Islands, which are also \nclaimed by other countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and \nBorneo. This is a very serious matter in terms of how we approach the \nstability of East Asia.\n  There was a column written in the Washington Post on Sunday, the \ntitle of which was ``The South China Sea, China's Caribbean.'' I \nemphasize to my colleagues that this is not the Caribbean in terms of \nthe stakes and the threat of the wrong sort of action in this region. \nFrom the Strait of Malacca, where a huge percentage of the world's oil \nand cargo passes, up through the South China Sea into Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan, we see a tremendous amount of world trade move through \nthere.\n  In Southeast Asia, in the ASEAN countries, we have 650 million \npeople. We have almost 1 billion people living not in China but in this \nregion who would be affected by Chinese sovereignty claims if we do not \nresponsibly assist this region in getting a balance.\n  This is happening at a time when I think we have deluded ourselves as \na nation for economic reasons as to the nature of the governmental \nsystem in China. We tend to look at these as comparable governmental \nsystems because we have such a high reliance on trade. And Senator \nSchumer is going to talk about the trade aspects of this issue.\n  Just as one little data point, every year the Freedom House publishes \na record of the freedom of the press. It ranks countries in the world \nin terms of global press freedom. In their last ranking for 2009, China \nranked 181 out of 195 countries in terms of freedom of the press inside \nthe country. Of the 40 countries in Asia, the only countries that \nscored lower than China in terms of freedom of the press were Laos, \nBurma, and North Korea.\n  The second-tier countries in East and Southeast Asia watch very \nclosely how the United States articulates its relationship with China. \nHistory warns them that they must hedge their bets against eventual \nchange. And any failure by the United States to take firm action when \nthe Chinese manifest aggressive behavior is viewed in this region as a \nsign of a permeating weakness in the United States.\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\n  The reality of a smaller size of our naval forces, the turbulence, at \ntimes, with relationships we have had with countries that are friends, \nthe mistreatment and sometimes neglect of our major ally, Japan, causes \nsome to wonder if China will become so powerful that we will abandon \nour friends.\n  On the one hand, this is an administration that has done a good job \nin terms of reconnecting with eastern Southeast Asia. Secretary Clinton \nmade a strong statement in July at the ASEAN conference about the \nimportance of these sovereignty issues.\n  On the other hand, we have a situation that is now evolving. It is \ncontinuing between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands, where we \nmust be very clear in our signals to China that we will not tolerate \ninstability that can be created with false claims of sovereignty in \nthese regions. There are ways to resolve these sovereignty issues, and \nthe expansionist pressure from military actions and other actions is \nnot the way to do that.\n  My major point today is that we must reinvigorate our vitally \nimportant relations with the ASEAN countries and our allies--Japan, \nKorea, the other treaty allies we have--in order to maintain the \nstability in this region, to maintain our own national interest in this \nregion economically, with regard to security, diplomatically, and \nculturally, and ultimately in the long term for a proper balance \nbetween our country and China. This will only be done if we stay with \nour friends and articulate very clearly to China that the wrong type of \nbehavior is not going to be rewarded with a weak form of behavior by \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Secret Holds\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there are currently 48 vacancies on \ncourts that the Federal judiciary considers to be judicial emergencies. \nLet me restate that. Filling these vacancies is now such a priority \nthat they are considered judicial emergencies. One of those vacancies \nconsidered to be a judicial emergency is one of the positions for the \nU.S. District Court for Oregon. My view is this problem is only going \nto get worse with another 20 judges having announced plans to retire. \nIf these positions remain vacant, we all understand it could delay \ntrials and certainly justice delayed is justice denied.\n  The stalling of judicial nominations also discourages qualified \ncandidates from serving on the bench. Those the country most needs on \nthe bench cannot put their lives on hold for months or years while \ntheir nominations sit on the Senate calendar, blocked for no apparent \nreason.\n  One of the things that is most striking about how the country has \ngotten into this predicament is that experts who have analyzed the \nsituation with respect to the delay in getting judges confirmed come \nback to Senate procedures as a significant factor in the holdup. \nRepeatedly, these independent experts say the Senate's secret hold, the \nprocess by which one Senator, just one, can anonymously block a \njudicial nomination from being considered on the floor of the Senate, \nis a central factor in the delay in getting these judges confirmed.\n  I have come to the Senate floor today to say, when we have so many \ndesignated judicial emergencies, when there are so many individuals who \nhave won bipartisan support, and a big factor in not getting judges \nconfirmed is the Senate is unwilling to do public business in public, \nit suggests to me it is time to eliminate the secret hold which is \nkeeping sunshine from coming to the Senate when it comes to the \nconsideration of judicial nominations and other important business.\n  Fortunately, colleagues on both sides of the aisle--a big group on \nour side of the aisle and a big group on the other side of the aisle--\nhave repeatedly said they want to come together, end secret holds, and \ndo public business in public.\n  At this time I would particularly like to commend my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, who has spent well over a decade working on \nthis effort with me, and also single out Senator McCaskill from \nMissouri, who has done outstanding work as well mobilizing colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle, and who also wants to have this procedure \nchanged and have new accountability and sunshine in the Senate.\n  All we need to be able to do is get this out in front of the Senate--\nfrankly, out in front of the American people--so they can find out who \nis in favor of transparency, who is in favor of accountability, and who \nstill thinks we ought to do business behind closed doors.\n  Some in the Senate continue to claim a secret hold does not prevent \nthe Senate from consideration of a nomination or piece of legislation. \nThey say, for example, the majority leader can always file what we know \nas cloture on that nomination or bill to overcome a hold. That may be \ntrue in theory, but for all practical purposes it cannot be done. The \nprocess of filing cloture on a nomination certainly can gobble up \nalmost a week on the Senate schedule. So the Senate could easily spend \nthe remainder of the time remaining this year with votes on just a few \nnominations now on the Executive Calendar and still not come close to \nclearing the backlog of nominations. The fact is, a secret hold can \neffectively kill a nomination or piece of legislation.\n  As we have said, our big bipartisan group in the Senate repeatedly \nhas said all of this secrecy, all of this work to keep the public from \nfinding out what is going on--all of it can be done without anybody, \nany colleagues in the Senate or the American people, knowing who was \nthe secret obstructor and why they were, in fact, obstructing.\n  There is one other point I would like to make, particularly with so \nmuch of the country looking at how Washington, DC, works and how broken \nso much of our system is; that is, how much power a secret hold \nprovides to a lobbyist. I am sure virtually every Member of the Senate \nhas at some point gotten a request from somebody who is a lobbyist \nasking if the Senator would put a secret hold on a bill or nomination \nin order to kill it--to kill it without getting any public debate and \nwithout the lobbyist's fingerprints on it anywhere.\n  Certainly, if a lobbyist finds it possible to get a Senator to put an \nanonymous hold on a bill, it is pretty much like hitting the lobbyist \njackpot. Not only is the Senator protected by the cloak of anonymity, \nbut so is the lobbyist, and in effect, through secrecy, a secret hold \ncan let the lobbyist play both sides of the street. It can give a \nlobbyist a victory with clients without alienating a potential or \nfuture client.\n  Given the number of instances where I heard a lobbyist asking for \nsecret holds, I think it is fair to say a secret hold is in effect a \nstealth extension of the lobbying world.\n  So when you think about the powers that lobbyists already have, why \nin the world would you want to give them another tool, the secret hold, \nwhich could, as I have characterized it, literally be a stealth \nextension of the lobbying world. I think it makes no sense at all, and \nI come down on the side of openness and transparency.\n  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Grassley from Iowa, who stood \nwith me, and Senator McCaskill--a big group of colleagues from both \nsides. On the other side of the aisle, Senator Collins, Senator Inhofe, \nand others have spent a great deal of time. Here it has been Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Udall, and the presiding officer, Senator \nGillibrand--a whole host of colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, who \nthink it is time, when the American people are obviously so angry at \nthe way Washington, DC, does business, to make it clear that we are all \ngoing to come together and change the process of letting an individual \nSenator obstruct the people's business in secret.\n  It seems to me the bottom line is that a secret hold is literally an \nindefensible denial of the public's right to know, particularly at a \ntime when there is so much frustration and anger at the way business is \ndone in Washington, DC. The public's right to know\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nought to be sacrosanct. Certainly, we are talking about the kind of \nmatters Democrats and Republicans talk about all the time in public. \nNobody is talking about national security or classified matters being \nbrought out here for the kind of sunshine that I and Senator Grassley \nand Senator McCaskill want to bring to the Senate. This is about the \npeople's business--legislation and nominations, those judicial \nemergencies and the scores of appointments that are being held up, \npieces of legislation that involve millions of people and billions of \ndollars. It seems to me there ought to be public disclosure. There \nought to be consequences if a Senator fails to disclose a secret hold.\n  In the interest of dealing with the crisis in our courts and the \nimportance of bringing public business to the floor of the Senate, I \nhope my colleagues will come together and quickly pass the bipartisan \nproposal which will once and for all eliminate secret holds.\n  There have been past attempts. Senator Grassley and I were able, as \npart of the ethics legislation, to get a provision through that we \nhoped would make a big difference. What happened then is, the friends \nof secrecy went back and found other ways to get around it. It is time \nonce and for all to strangle secret holds. That is what a bipartisan \ngroup in the Senate wants to do, and it is important that measure be \nenacted and enacted quickly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Kaufman, be recognized for 10 minutes as though in \nmorning business--during that period, I will preside--and then that I \nbe recognized for up to 10 minutes as though in morning business while \nthe Presiding Officer resumes the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (Mr. LEVIN assumed the chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                        Equity Markets Integrity\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor one final time to \ntalk about the integrity of our equity markets, a subject I have made a \ncentral focus of my Senate tenure. It is an issue that has gained \nincreasing attention, especially since the May 6 flash crash, yet still \nlacks fundamental transparency, regulation or oversight.\n  A year ago, I wrote to Mary Schapiro, Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, to outline my concerns. Seven times since then I \nhave come to the Senate floor to talk about the dramatic changes taking \nplace in our equity markets, discussing obscure practices such as \ncolocation, naked access, flash orders, and the proliferation of dark \npools. But the most striking change has been the rise in high frequency \ntrading which has come to dominate equity markets and now accounts for \nwell over half of all daily trading volume.\n  My message about high frequency trading has been straightforward. The \ntechnological advances and the mathematical algorithms that have \nallowed computers to trade stocks in millionths of a second in and of \nthemselves are neither good nor bad. Indeed, as an engineer, I have a \ndeep appreciation for the importance of technological progress. But \ntechnology cannot operate in a vacuum, nor should it dictate how our \nmarkets function. Simply put, technological developments must operate \nwithin a framework that ensures integrity and fairness. That is why our \nregulatory agencies are so critically important. Because while \ntechnology often produces benefits, it might also introduce conflicts \nthat pit long-term retail and institutional investors against \nprofessional traders who are in and out of the market many times a day.\n  As Chairman Schapiro has consistently asserted, including in a letter \nto me over a year ago:\n\n       If . . . the interests of long-term investors and \n     professional traders conflict . . . the Commission's focus \n     must be on the protection of long-term investors.\n\n  Many people have asked me why I focused so intently on the arcane \ndetails of how stocks are traded during my time as a Member of the \nSenate. There are several reasons. First, it is Congress' job not just \nto look backward and analyze the factors that brought about the last \nfinancial crisis, it is also our job to be proactive and identify \nbrewing problems before they put us into a new financial crisis.\n  Second, we simply must protect the credibility of our markets. I have \nsaid time and again that the two great pillars on which America rests \nare democracy and our capital markets. But there is more at stake than \na structural risk that could bring our market once again to its knees \nas occurred on May 6. There is a real perceptual risk that retail \ninvestors will no longer believe the markets are operating fairly, that \nthere is simply not a level playing field.\n  If investors don't believe the markets are fair, they won't invest in \nthem. And if that happens, we can all agree our economy will be in \nserious trouble.\n  Third, we should have learned the lesson from derivatives trading \nthat when we have opaque markets that are nontransparent, disaster is \noften not far behind.\n  It is hardly surprising that high frequency trading should deserve a \nwatchful, and possibly critical, government eye.\n  It is simply a truism that whenever there is a lot of money surging \ninto a risky area, where change in the market is dramatic, where there \nis no transparency and therefore no effective regulation, we have a \nprescription for disaster.\n  We had a disaster in the fall of 2008, when the credit markets \nsuddenly dried up and our market collapsed and almost brought down not \nonly our financial system but the financial systems of the world.\n  We had a near disaster on May 6, 2010.\n  Soon, the SEC will issue a second report on the causes of that May 6 \nflash crash.\n  I hope the SEC has moved much closer to truly understanding the \ndramatic changes in market structure that have taken place in the past \nfew years, the potential ramifications of high frequency trading, and \nits impact on retail and institutional investors.\n  But this is about more than investor confidence. The primary function \nof our capital markets is to permit companies to raise capital, \ninnovate, and grow in order to create jobs.\n  Publicly traded companies employ millions of Americans and are at the \nheart of our economy.\n  Their stock symbols should not be used simply as the raw material for \nhigh frequency traders and exchanges and other market centers more \nconcerned with churning out serving long-term trade volume than \ninvestors and supporting fundamental company value.\n  Perhaps it is not surprising that our IPO markets--initial public \noffering markets--have deteriorated dramatically and only seem to work \nfor the largest public offerings worth several hundred million dollars.\n  Indeed, the IPO situation today is so dire that had it been the case \ntwo decades ago, many of our most famous U.S. corporations, including \nDell, Yahoo, Computer Associates, and Oracle, among others, might never \nhave been nurtured--or perhaps even born.\n  Many people, including the consulting firm Grant Thornton, link this \nphenomenon directly to the rise of high frequency trading under a one-\nsize-fits-all set of market rules that favors efficiency of trading \nabove all else.\n  As for the Securities and Exchange Commission, I believe the SEC is \nstill in the early stages of what I hope will be an extraordinary \nturnaround.\n  After years of deregulatory fervor which sapped morale and led to an \negregious case of regulatory capture, we now have an emboldened agency, \nwith a beefed up enforcement division, a serious chairman, and an \ninvigorated staff.\n  That was evident in last week's hearing that I chaired in the \nJudiciary Committee on the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act.\n  The commission must still reform the way it gathers the facts it \nneeds to study market issues and particularly high frequency trading.\n  Evidence-based rulemaking should not be a one-way street in which all\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nthe ``evidence'' is provided by those whom the SEC is charged with \nregulating.\n  We need the SEC to require tagging and disclosure of high frequency \ntrades and to quickly implement a consolidated audit trail so that \nobjective and independent analysts--in academia, private analytic \nfirms, the media, and elsewhere--are given the opportunity to study and \ndiscern what effects high frequency trading strategies have on long-\nterm investors.\n  They can also help determine which strategies should be considered \nmanipulative.\n  The recent ``layering'' case brought by FINRA against a high \nfrequency trading firm was a good start, but much more needs to be done \nto end the ``wild west'' trading environment that today is eroding \nmarket integrity.\n  We cannot afford regulatory capture nor can we afford consensus \nregulation, not in any government agency, but especially not at the \nSEC, which oversees such a systemic and fundamental aspect of our \nentire economy.\n  Colocation, flash orders, and naked access are just a few practices \nthat were fairly widespread before ever being subjected to any \nregulatory scrutiny.\n  For our markets to remain credible--and it is absolutely essential \nthat they do so--it is vital that regulators be proactive, rather than \nreactive, when future developments arise.\n  After a year of intense study by me and my staff, I sent a letter to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission on August 5, 2010, with my best \nsummary of the market structure problems and potential solutions the \ncommission faces.\n  I will now wait for the SEC report and findings before I add or \nsubtract from my views, as expressed in that letter.\n  Though this work must be completed in my absence, I will continue to \nspeak out on market structure issues long after I leave the Senate.\n  Because if we fail, if we do not act boldly, if the status quo \nprevails, I genuinely fear we will be passing on to my grandchildren a \nsubstantially diminished America: one where saving and investing for \nretirement is no longer widely practiced by a generation of Americans \nand where companies no longer spring forth from the well of capital \nflows that our markets used to provide.\n  Wall Street is a business like any other business in America. But it \nis also different in one important way: It is Wall Street that gathers \nup the hard-earned cash of millions of Americans and allows them to \ninvest in capital markets that up until now have been the envy of the \nworld.\n  These markets, like all markets, will ebb and flow.\n  But they should never be brought down by inherent structural \nproblems, by trading inequities, or by opaque operations that shun \ntransparency.\n  Wall Street holds a piece of American capital, our collective \ncapital, and it has a real and profound responsibility to handle it \nfairly.\n  But that entails another obligation as well: to come to the table and \nplay a constructive role with Congress and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in resolving its current issues--especially the possibility \nof high frequency trading manipulation and systemic risk.\n  For too long, many on Wall Street have urged Washington to look the \nother way, to accept the view that all is fine. If Wall Street does not \nengage honestly and constructively, then these issues must be resolved \nwithout their input, and resolve them we will.\n  The credibility of our capital markets is too precious a resource to \nsquander; as I say every time I have the chance, it is a fundamental \npillar of our Nation. And if it is now threatened, Congress and the \nregulatory agencies will surely act.\n  We can fashion a better solution with industry input, not a biased \nsolution, but a better solution, one that should benefit Wall Street in \nthe long term, one that must benefit all Americans now. The American \npeople deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     Commending Senator Ted Kaufman\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today simply to thank \nmy friend, the Senator from Delaware, for his extraordinary work in the \nSenate and to make a comment on some of the things he has been working \non.\n  Since coming to this body, Senator Kaufman has proven to be a \ntireless advocate for his State of Delaware and the country, and his \nremarks he just provided are further evidence of that.\n  Senator Kaufman joined us here and joined me on the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, where he and his staff dug deeply into \nthe weeds of financial statements and e-mails in efforts that helped \nferret out some of the astonishing findings of our hearings into the \ncauses of the financial crisis. Senator Kaufman's dedication and \nthoughtful questioning during those hearings helped expose some of the \nroot causes and crass conflicts of interest that led to the crisis that \nbrought our economy to its knees.\n  I also want to make particular note of Senator Kaufman's work on high \nfrequency trading, flash trading, and other trading market issues, \nwhere those with powerful computers are able to exploit weaknesses in \nour regulatory systems to their own financial advantage, while hurting \nlong-term investors and hurting the real economy.\n  Senator Kaufman cares deeply about these issues, and he has voiced \nhis concerns about them in this Chamber for over a year. Last year, he \ncalled for a ban on flash trading, a practice in which some firms pay \nfor a ``sneak peak,'' only a few thousandths of a second long, at \ntrades. With their computers, those firms can take advantage of that \nsplit-second head start on market-moving trades. The Securities and \nExchange Commission is working on rules to ban the practice, and I join \nSenator Kaufman in urging that this practice be stopped.\n  Senator Kaufman has studied the trading markets in great detail, \ncommunicating with regulators and industry participants. He has learned \nthat our regulatory system for monitoring trading is outdated and that \nthe technology and capabilities of those who seek to exploit loopholes \nin the rules or avoid them altogether have too often outpaced those \ntasked with their oversight.\n  Senator Kaufman has come to this floor many times over the past \nseveral months to warn us of the risks of our current trading market \nstructure, and of his concerns with the inadequate regulatory process \nwe have to police them.\n  On August 5, he sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission \nChairman Schapiro outlining proposals to address some of those \nconcerns. His thoughtful proposals make a significant contribution to \nthe debate over how to make our financial system safer.\n  On May 6 of this year, we all watched helplessly as the stock market \nplunged nearly 1,000 points in a few minutes. While the regulators have \ncommitted to studying it and are expected to release their report soon \non the root causes of that ``flash crash,'' I cannot help but think \nthat we in Congress owe it to families and businesses around this \ncountry to better understand what happened and to make sure we do what \nwe can to stop it from happening again.\n  Although Senator Kaufman will soon be departing this body, we must \ncontinue his work so that those who seek to exploit our markets to the \ndetriment of long-term investors and the real economy will not be able \nto do so without a battle from the Senate. Senator Jack Reed is \ncommitted to doing just that. He held a hearing in May shortly after \nthe flash crash in which he looked into the causes of the crash. I will \njoin him and others and do all we can to respond to these high-tech \nthreats to market fairness and transparency.\n  The world of trading stocks, bonds, commodities, and other financial \ninstruments today occurs on two levels. There are those who invest for \nthe long haul, investing in companies and products they expect to do \nwell for some time. They drive our economy. But then there are those \nwho seek to ``invest'' for thousandths of a second or just long enough \nto profit on split-second price swings. These traders argue that they \nprovide ``liquidity'' to the markets, but in many cases they are \nactually hurting the markets by promoting volatility and undermining \nthe integrity of those markets.\n  As Senator Kaufman said, we owe it to the millions of families who \nhave\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\ntheir savings in the markets and to the businesses that rely on the \nmarkets for the capital they need to survive and grow to make sure our \nmarkets function properly. I applaud Senator Kaufman for his \nextraordinary work on these issues and other issues in the Senate. I \nthank him for his service. One way for us to recognize that service is \nto continue his quest for more fair and transparent markets.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      The Sherers: Adoption Angels\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, Scott and Nicole Sherer, of Lincoln, \nNE, are extraordinary Nebraskans who opened their hearts and homes to \nfour beautiful children in need of parents. This is a tale of love, \ndevotion and caring.\n  In 2007, Nebraska officials found a young boy named Darren, \ndevelopmentally disabled--a victim of neglect.\n  The State removed Darren from the household and began to search for a \nfoster family.\n  They didn't have to search far because Nicole and Scott Sherer were \nhappy to take him into their home.\n  The following year, a little girl named Mariah was found to be a \nshaken baby and was taken to Children's Hospital.\n  Mariah's brother Christian was also removed from the home and the \nState again looked for a healthy home.\n  Once again, the Sherers did not blink. Two more children needed \nparents; they needed a home. Two more children found their family.\n  And this exceptional family still had more room in their hearts and \ntheir home.\n  Two year later, Darren's sister Desiree was born and was delivered to \nthe Sherers from the hospital.\n  They formally adopted Christian and Mariah in April 2009 and then \nadopted Darren and Desiree in July 2010.\n  During this time, they were able to provide a safe, healthy home for \na fifth little boy until a permanent home could be found. The family \nwas able to keep the biological siblings together and provide a loving \nhome for four children.\n  And the new family began their lives together.\n  Nicole and Scott recently celebrated their seventh wedding \nanniversary. They have taken in four children in need and consider \nthemselves to be blessed.\n  I have great admiration for foster and adoptive parents, and I was \nthrilled to nominate Nicole and Scott Sherer as Adoption Angels.\n  Their commitment to care for these four children, to give love \nfreely, is an inspiration for all. It is my hope that their example \nwill inspire other couples to open their hearts and homes to children \nawaiting adoption.\n  May God bless Nicole, Scott, Darren, Desiree, Christian, and Mariah, \nas well as all adoptive parents who give children the gift of a loving \nfamily.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Chinese Currency Manipulation\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Webb, in discussing serious concerns with Chinese economic and \nforeign policies and their impact on the United States, U.S. companies, \nU.S. workers, and U.S. citizens.\n  Earlier, we were supposed to speak together, but the vicissitudes of \nthe floor broke us up. Earlier today, my esteemed and erudite \ncolleague, Senator Webb, gave an excellent address, which I hope my \ncolleagues will read, about how China is simply taking advantage in the \nforeign policy area. They are pursuing policies that just move forward \nwithout any concern for the world community, for peace, for comity. It \nseems China is first, second, and third.\n  Unfortunately, they are doing the same thing in the economics sphere. \nI have been working with colleagues such as Senators Stabenow, Brown, \nand Graham to try and reverse this situation.\n  I rise to speak about what many of us consider the biggest sticking \npoint in U.S.-Chinese relations: Chinese overt and continuous \nmanipulation of its currency to gain a trade advantage over its trading \npartners.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 2.4 million American \njobs were lost or displaced in manufacturing and other trade-related \nindustries between 2001 and 2008 as a result of increased trade with \nChina and the Chinese Government's manipulation of currency. New York \nhas suffered some of the biggest losses with over 140,000 jobs lost or \nworkers displaced over the past 10 years.\n  Accession to the WTO was supposed to bring China's policies in line \nwith global trade rules meant to ensure free but fair trade. Instead, \nChina has flouted those rules to spur its own economy and export-\noriented growth at the expense of its trading partners, including the \nUnited States. Clearly, our relationship in the economics sphere, as \nwell as the foreign policy sphere and diplomatic sphere, with China \nneeds fundamental change.\n  I say that loudly and clearly to the Chinese because they seem to \nthink we are patsies. Past policies might give some corroboration to \nthat view. Let me explain.\n  Six years ago, Senator Graham and I came up with the idea of doing \nsomething about manipulation of currency. At first everyone said: Oh, \nno, this is not a problem. There were editorials in both the Wall \nStreet Journal and New York Times that said it is OK for China to peg \nits currency. We were attacked from the far right and the far left and \nmany others.\n  Now, at least we have made some progress. Everyone admits it is a \nproblem. Now that we have consensus--quite broad consensus--that this \nis a problem, this is wrong, this is unfair, the fundamental question \nhangs out there: Who is going to fix this problem and how?\n  The administration continues--this administration, and I say that as \nsomeone who is a supporter, who continues to pin its hopes on yet more \ntalking. This despite the fact that years of meetings and discussions \nwith this administration and the previous administration have \nrepeatedly failed to produce any lasting, meaningful results.\n  It has been 3 months since China announced it would allow its \ncurrency to appreciate for the first time since the middle of 2008. The \nRMB has risen less than 2 percent against the dollar, most of that \nappreciation taking place in the last 2 weeks.\n  President Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen last week to urge \nquicker\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nevaluation of his country's currency. He got nothing, nothing--a big \ngoose egg--for his efforts. It is not his fault; it is the fault of the \nChinese. But when are we going to change things?\n  According to news reports, Premier Wen gave a standard response about \ngradual reform. The upcoming G20 summit in Seoul looks similarly devoid \nof possible progress on this issue. News reports suggest that none of \nthe other countries are willing to push China on this issue.\n  Each time I have pushed the administration to take a tougher stance \nagainst China's manipulation of currency; each time they have vowed to \ndo so. It is plain and simple: It is not working. China is merely \npretending to take significant steps on its currency. This sucker's \ngame is never going to stop unless we finally call their bluff.\n  China's mercantilist policies continue to undermine the health of \nmany U.S. industries that inject billions of dollars into the U.S. \neconomy and employ hundreds of thousands, millions of American workers. \nWe have to do something about it--something real.\n  Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee voted out a bill that \nclarifies countervailing duties can be imposed to offset the effect of \nundervalued currency. I applaud Chairman Levin for taking a concrete \nstep toward addressing the persistent imbalance created by China's \nundervalued currency. Effective enforcement of our trade laws is one \ntool the administration can and should use to counter China's \nmercantilist currency policies.\n  But the administration could use more than one ace up its sleeve. And \nthat is what my bill, introduced with Senators Stabenow, Graham, Brown, \nBrownback, Webb, Snowe, and others--bipartisan, across the political \nspectrum--would provide.\n  The bill gives the administration additional tools to use if \ncountries fail to adopt appropriate policies to eliminate currency \nmisalignment and includes tools, including the use of the \ncountervailing duty law, to address the impact of currency misalignment \non U.S. industries.\n  I call on the administration to support our legislation to address \nChina's mercantilistic exchange rate policies. We must stand up for \nAmerican manufacturers, American workers, and American jobs. We have to \nprevent the flow of billions of dollars out of our country--wealth we \nwill never recover--every quarter as long as the Chinese continue this \npolicy.\n  Critics of our bill say it would start a trade war with China, but \nthat is not right because American companies are already fighting a war \nfor survival in China--battling market access limitations, intellectual \nproperty theft, indigenous innovation policies, and unfair competition \nfrom heavily subsidized domestic State-owned enterprises. When are we \ngoing to learn?\n\n  Critics of our bill say it will not solve the trade deficit with \nChina. We have never claimed it will totally solve the deficit, that is \nfor sure. The bill is about fair trade. The bill is about a ceramics \nmanufacturer in upstate New York that has developed a great new product \nthat can clean the air as it goes through our new generator turbines. \nBut China is stealing the product and is now going to sell it back to \nthe United States at a 30-percent advantage. You can't even measure the \nloss we face because of China's unfair policies on currency.\n  Yes, critics of our bill have said it will not solve the trade \ndeficit, but as I said, this has never been the claim. It will reduce \nthe trade deficit, without doubt. It will keep wealth in the United \nStates, it will keep American jobs, and it will restore some \nequilibrium to the American economy and the world economy.\n  Other critics have said China could retaliate by selling some of the \ntrillions of dollars of Treasurys they currently hold, but we know this \nwill not happen. China is not going to cut off its nose to spite its \nface. Its major wealth asset they are going to devalue? Hello, as my \nkids might have said when they were younger.\n  We must take a decisive step against China's currency manipulation \nand other economically injurious behavior. We have no choice but to \ndefend and protect U.S. jobs and the U.S. economy unless and until \nChina starts behaving like the international, law-abiding, global, \nemerging power it seems to be recognized as. Once and for all I say to \nthose in the ivory towers who love to look down upon us but who don't \nlook at the facts, the issue is not U.S. protectionism; the issue is \nChina's flouting the rules of free trade in almost every sphere and \nnever budging unless they are pushed to.\n  This is one reason why when the Senate reconvenes later this year, my \ncolleagues and I intend to move forward with the legislation to provide \nspecific consequences for countries that fail to adopt appropriate \npolicies to eliminate currency misalignment and give the administration \nthe additional tools it needs to address the impact of currency \nmisalignment on U.S. industries.\n  I say to those at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well as in \nBeijing, this issue cannot wait for another year. It cannot wait for \nanother new Congress. I am confident this bill will pass the Senate \nwith overwhelming support.\n  Let me conclude by noting that over the past 6 years, my colleagues \nand I have been sending a message to the Chinese Government about their \nexchange rate policies and other WTO-inconsistent behavior, but \napparently they refuse to listen. Ultimately, if you refuse to play by \nthe same rules as everyone else, we will hold you accountable. Chinese \ncurrency manipulation would be unacceptable even in good economic \ntimes, but at almost 10 percent unemployment, we can't stand for it. \nThere is no bigger step we can take than to confront China's currency \nmanipulation.\n  Praise God, this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. We have \nbroad bipartisan cosponsorship of our legislation. No one is seeking to \ngain political advantage. We are simply seeking to restore economic \nfairness. Every single one of us has manufacturers that are struggling \nto compete at home and abroad with Chinese exports with a built-in 20- \nto 40-percent price advantage. This is not about bashing China; it is \nabout defending the United States before it is too late--before the \nloss of jobs and wealth that flows out of this country is almost \nirreparable. I call on my colleagues to join in the defense.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Environmental Overregulation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I released today a minority staff report \nof the Senate committee on Environment and Public Works. When \nRepublicans were in the majority I chaired the committee and now I am \nthe ranking member, minority member. We have been concerned for quite \nsome time now that the heavyhanded overregulation we are getting from \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee is taking its toll on \nAmerican jobs. So we released this and documented a report that \nexamines the impact on jobs and the economy from all these EPA rules \nand EPA regulations.\n  We are covering four areas. The focus is on the boiler MACT \nregulations, the revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards for \nozone--we are all concerned about that--I notice the new cement MACT \nregulations, and the endangerment findings. These are just four rules \nthat are costing us a lot of jobs.\n  There are many others we could be talking about, in fact we are going \nto be talking about in the near future: standards for cooling water \nintake structures at powerplants, National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards for dust and particulate matter--actually, they are talking \nabout doing one now for farm dust. I am from Oklahoma. A lot of people \nback here don't understand when you grow something you have to grow it \nin dirt. When the wind blows that is dust, but you can't regulate it. \nBut they think they can--the new source performance standards for coal-\nfired powerplants and refineries, and the rules governing disposal of \ncoal combustion waste.\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\n  What does it all mean? The American Forest and Paper Association \nestimates, and I am quoting them:\n\n       . . . about two dozen new regulations being considered by \n     the Administration under the Clean Air Act, if all are \n     promulgated, potentially could impose on the order of $17 \n     billion in new capital costs on papermakers and wood products \n     manufacturers in the next five to eight years alone.\n\n  That is just for one industry. You have all the other industries that \nwill be affected.\n  Before I begin, let me say the Clean Air Act was a success. I have \nalways been a supporter of the results of the Clean Air Act. We now \nhave cleaner air from cars, from factories, and powerplants. It has \nbeen very successful. In fact, when we were a majority and I chaired \nthat committee, we had the 3P regulations, we had the Clear Skies \nregulations we tried to promulgate--we have been attempting to do this \nfor a long period of time. However, if we are going to be competing \nwith other countries, this overregulation is going to do nothing but \nsend our jobs to places such as China and India and Mexico.\n  Of the four areas I mentioned, the first is the boiler MACT. The MACT \nmeans maximum achievable control technologies. Forget about that, just \ncall that regulation.\n  The first one, the regulations, would be the boiler MACT. It would \nimpose stringent emission limits on monitoring requirements for 11 \nsubcategories of boilers and process heaters.\n  The proposed rule covers industrial boilers used in manufacturing, \nprocessing, mining, refining, as well as commercial boilers used in \nmalls, laundries, apartments, restaurants and hotels.\n  The Industrial Energy Consumers of America, which represents \ncompanies with 750,000 employees, said they are ``enormously concerned \nthat the high cost'' of the boiler regulations will leave companies no \nrecourse but to shut down the entire facility, not just the boilers.\n  This is what the econometrics firm IHS-Global Insight found in its \nanalysis of the EPA's proposal, just the one proposal. They concluded \nthat the proposal could put up to 798,000 jobs at risk. Moreover, they \nsaid every $1 billion spent on upgrade and compliance costs will put \nsome 16,000 jobs at risk and reduce the U.S. GDP by as much as $1.2 \nbillion.\n  The EPA's pending boiler regulations also threaten my home State of \nOklahoma. We have one group, a company called Covanta Energy, which in \n2008 reopened the Walter B. Hall Resource Recovery Facility, a waste-\nto-energy plant.\n  This happened, actually, when I was mayor of Tulsa many years ago. We \nhad two great needs: one to dispose of waste and the other to create \nenergy. So we did one of the first waste-to-energy plants in America. \nIt was done back in the early 1980s when I was mayor of Tulsa. This is \nsomething that has been working out and working successfully. But they \nare saying it could threaten the viability of this operation, and it is \nnot just in my State of Oklahoma but all over the country.\n  These concerns are shared by 40 of my colleagues, including 18 \nDemocrats, who wrote Lisa Jackson--she is the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency--a letter. Keep in mind, half of these \nare Democrats.\n\n       As our Nation struggles to recover from the current \n     recession, we are deeply concerned that the pending Clean Air \n     Act boiler MACT regulations could impose onerous burdens on \n     U.S. manufacturers, leading to the loss of potentially \n     thousands of high-paying jobs this sector provides. As the \n     national unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent, and \n     federal, state and municipal finances continue to be in dire \n     straits, our country should not be jeopardizing thousands of \n     manufacturing jobs.\n\n  That is a quote from a letter, half Democrats, half Senators, 40 of \nus, to Lisa Jackson of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Just in the area of boiler regulation, one of the four I am going to \ntalk about, potentially 1 million jobs could be lost. This is the \nproblem we are having with the overregulation in this country. We have \ntwo major problems: overregulation and the fact we are not developing \nany power anymore, we made it so difficult. We have not had a new coal-\nfired powerplant in this country for quite some time. Yet China is \ncranking out two of them every week. This is our competition over \nthere.\n  The second area is ozone. On January 6 of this year, for the second \ntime in less than 2 years, the EPA proposed tightening the NAAQ \nstandards for ground level ozone. Specifically, the EPA is proposing to \nstrengthen the 8-hour ``primary'' ozone standard. The EPA estimates \nthat setting the primary standard within its proposed range will cost \nbetween $19 and $90 billion. That is the EPA's estimate. This proposal \ncomes at the heels of the 2008 ozone standard, which created a serious \nproblem. The CAA, Clean Air Act, only requires revision at least 5 \nyears. That was just 2 years ago. Now they are talking about doing it \nagain. So the EPA is not required to revise the status quo.\n  Meanwhile, States are in the midst of trying to meet the 2008 \nrequirements while some communities are not in compliance with the 1997 \nstandards, the time they did it before.\n  EPA announced it is delaying the new standards until late October. \nGuess what. We are there. My guess is they will be delaying it until \nafter the election because they don't want to know what hardship they \nare imposing upon the American people before the election. It is not \nhard to see why. Whatever level EPA ultimately picks, it will \ndramatically increase the number of so-called nonattainment areas \nnationwide.\n  Based on the 2008 air quality data, we could see as many as 608 new \nnonattainment areas, with many of them highly concentrated in \nmanufacturing regions, in States relying on coal for electricity.\n  What does the nonattainment mean? For local communities, such as my \ncommunities in Oklahoma, it can mean loss of industry and economic \ndevelopment, including plant closures; loss of Federal highway and \ntransit funding; increased EPA regulation and control over permitting \ndecisions; increased costs for industrial facilities to implement more \nstringent controls; and increased fuel and energy costs.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, at least 15 counties would face new \nrestrictions right now, under the 2008, and there are two counties that \nwould be out of attainment. All these things would happen. You can't go \nout and recruit industry, they close down a lot of industries there \nnow. I have listed in these remarks that will be part of the Record 15 \ncounties in my State of Oklahoma that could be facing these new \nrestrictions.\n  We all support cleaner air, but here is where the Obama EPA and I \ndisagree. It should not come at the expense of people's jobs or the \neconomy. Apparently, I am not the only one thinking this way.\n  On August 6, 2010, a bipartisan letter--this is the third one I am \nmentioning now--was sent to the EPA Administrator on the Agency's ozone \nreconsideration. It was signed by Senators Voinovich, Bayh, Lugar, \nLandrieu, Vitter, McCaskill, and Bond. That is an equal number of \nDemocrats and Republicans. They said:\n\n       While we believe we can and should continue to improve our \n     environment, we have become increasingly concerned that the \n     Agency's environmental policies are being advanced to the \n     detriment of the people they are intended to protect. That \n     is, these policies are impacting our standard of living by \n     drastically increasing energy costs and decreasing the \n     ability of our states to create jobs, foster \n     entrepreneurship, and give manufacturers the ability to \n     compete in the global marketplace.\n\n  Again, that was just one of these four areas.\n  The third one would be the Portland cement regulations. This third \nrule is another regulation having to do with cement. According to the \nEPA, ``a projected 181 Portland cement kilns will be operating at \napproximately 100 facilities in the United States by the year 2013.'' \nEPA's new emission standards under section 112 of the Clean Air Act \nwill apply to 158 of that 181. About 7 kilns will be subject to the \nEPA's new source performance standards under section 111 of the Clean \nAir Act.\n  The cement industry is essential to America's economy. According to a \nstudy by the Maguire Energy Institute at SMU, the cement manufacturing \nindustry in 2008 produced $27.5 billion in GDP, $931 million in \nindirect tax revenues for State and local governments, and sustained \n15,000 high-paying jobs.\n  In addition to those 15,000 direct jobs, the industry has an \n``induced employment'' effect, which helps create and\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nsustain an additional 153,000 jobs. ``Importantly,'' the Maguire Energy \nInstitute noted ``these are primarily high-wage jobs generating about \n$7.5 billion annually in wages and benefits.''\n  According to the Portland Cement Association, EPA's regulation puts \nup to 18 cement plants at risk of shutting down, threatening nearly \n1,800 direct jobs and 9,000 indirect jobs, accordingly. I might add, \none of these would be in my State of Oklahoma. These jobs in cement \nproduction would go to China. That is what a professor from King's \nCollege in London said about the EPA's rule--coming from London:\n\n       So rather than importing 20 million tons of cement per \n     year, the proposed [rule] will lead to cement imports of more \n     than 48 million tons per year. In other words, by tightening \n     the regulations on U.S. cement kilns, there will be a risk \n     transfer of some 28 million tons of cement offshore, mostly \n     to China.\n\n  Senators Voinovich and Lincoln wrote a bipartisan letter to \nAdministrator Jackson, sharing these concerns back in February, saying:\n\n       In a very real sense, if a reasonable standard is not \n     adopted in this matter, we anticipate that substantial cement \n     capacity may move overseas to the detriment of industrial \n     employment. . . .\n\n  And the detriment of hundreds of thousands of people in the United \nStates.\n  The fourth is my favorite. To give just a little bit of background, \nway back when we had the Kyoto treaty in the 1990s, there was an effort \nat that time to say we have catastrophic things happening, global \nwarming and all that, as a result of primarily man-made gases. They \ntried through the years to pass legislation. We had the 2003 and 2005 \nMcCain-Lieberman bills. Then we had the Markey bills and the others. I \nthink one was a Boxer-Sanders bill. All of them were essentially doing \nthe same thing; it was called cap and trade. It was something I \ncharacterized as the largest tax increase in the history of this \ncountry.\n  As a matter of fact, during the consideration of all of these bills, \nthey estimated--and this was several--MIT, CRA, and several other \ninstitutions said that the cost to America would be somewhere between \n$300 and $400 billion a year.\n  The rule discussed is the endangerment finding. As I have documented \non the Senate floor before, the EPA promulgated its endangerment \nfinding on greenhouse gases in December of 2009, which I said could \nlead to the greatest bureaucratic intrusion into the lives of the \nAmerican people. It would trigger costly, time-consuming permitting \nrequirements for new and modified stationary sources for greenhouse \ngases such as powerplants, factories, and refineries.\n  So the problem with this is that when the Obama administration saw \nthat Congress was not going to pass these very punitive tax increases \ncalled cap and trade, they decided they were going to try to do it \nthrough regulation. That is what this is all about. This is just one-\nfourth of the minority report we have out there that we introduced \ntoday.\n  The rule, in order to do this--and I will never forget because right \nbefore I went over to Copenhagen in December, we had a hearing in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and we had Lisa Jackson--I have \na great deal of respect for her--before the hearing.\n  I said: Madam Administrator, I suspect that when I leave for \nCopenhagen tomorrow, you are going to have an endangerment finding.\n  An endangerment finding is a finding that will allow them to \npromulgate rules to do what they failed to be able to do in \nlegislation.\n  I said: And to do that, it is going to have to be based on some \nscience. What science would that be based on?\n  She said: Primarily, the science that came from the United Nations.\n  And the IPCC--since that time, there has been Climategate--told the \ntruth about how they have been trying to cook the science over that \nperiod of time. So this is one that is really very serious.\n  But the U.S. Chamber found that if they are able to go ahead and use \nthe emissions, it would affect 260,000 office buildings, 150,000 \nwarehouses, 92,000 health care facilities, 71,000 hotels and motels, \n51,000 food service facilities, 37,000 churches and other places of \nworship, and 17,000 farms. That is because they would be falling under \nthe category--the 250 tons of emissions of CO2 per year.\n  The greenhouse gas regulations will mean higher energy costs for \nconsumers, especially for minorities and the poor.\n  I had the Catholic Charities in my office today. We had, actually, \nthe man, who I learned just died this last week, with the Ohio Catholic \nCharities down for hearings when we were talking about all the things \nthey were trying to do through the various bills on cap and trade. His \ntestimony was--and these individuals were in my office today--that it \ndisproportionately hurts poor people. For example, if someone is in \npoverty, there are just some things that person has to have--heating \nthe home in the winter, transportation costs, costs that are necessary. \nIf you are a wealthy person, that might constitute maybe 5 percent of \nyour expendable income, but it could be 100 percent of the income of \nsomeone who is poor. So it disproportionately hurts the poor people.\n  This is why, on February 19, recognizing that he was going to lose a \nlot of jobs, Senator Rockefeller, joined by seven of his Democratic \ncolleagues, wrote--again, this is the fourth letter--to Administrator \nJackson on their concern with the endangerment finding.\n\n       We write with serious economic and energy security concerns \n     relating to the potential regulation of greenhouse gases from \n     stationary sources under the Clean Air Act. We remain \n     concerned about the possible impacts on American workers and \n     businesses and a number of industrial sectors, along with the \n     farmers, miners and small business owners who could be \n     affected as your energy agency moves toward the regulations \n     for vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  You know, as bad as things are right now, we are supposed to be able \nto knock down and the President said we are going to bring unemployment \ndown to somewhere around 6 or 7 percent, and it is still right up there \nat 10 percent. These regulations haven't even gone into effect yet. So \nthat is going to cause the unemployment figures to be much higher.\n  So I think it is important to recognize right now, before it is too \nlate, that something can be done about this overregulation right now, \nand I really believe this is the opportunity that we have.\n  This report we just released today is on my Web site, \ninhofe.senate.gov, and we have now been able to get this around the \ncountry so that people know that as bad as the unemployment and \noverregulation is that is costing American jobs, it could be a lot \nworse if these four regulations get into full effect. I think it is our \njob here in the Chamber to recognize that we have a very serious \nunemployment problem in this country, a very serious overregulation \nproblem in this country, and we can now do something about it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the status of the Senate? What are \nwe doing? Morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under cloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                Wildlife Conservation and Animal Welfare\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one piece of unfinished business we have \nhere in the Senate is to move a series of good, commonsense bills that \nwould benefit wildlife and domestic animals.\n  These wildlife conservation and animal welfare bills have already \npassed the House of Representatives, and for a good reason. They also \nhave bipartisan support. Most importantly, all of these measures are \nsupported by the American people. These aren't Democratic or Republican \nissues; they are issues of good moral conscience.\n  I have worked over the years on many bills connected to animals and \nwildlife. Not long ago, Senator Cantwell and I worked with a number of \nour Republican colleagues to pass a felony level penalty bill for dog \nfighting and cock fighting. This was a bipartisan rejection of animal \ncruelty.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\nToday, we have the opportunity to help a great number of species. One \nbill ready for action, the Shark Conservation Act, will improve Federal \nenforcement of an existing prohibition on the killing of sharks just \nfor their fins. Because of a loophole in the existing law, animals are \nstill caught, their fins are severed, and the dismembered shark is sent \nback into the ocean to die. But they don't just die, they suffer a \nhorrible and protracted death--all of that cruelty for a bowl of soup.\n  Another important bill is the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act, \nwhich will strengthen programs that provide emergency aid to seals, \nwhales, and other marine creatures that get struck by boats or tangled \nin fishing lines. This happens all the time.\n  Other bills, such as the Crane Conservation Act, the Great Cats and \nRare Canids Act, and the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Act, will protect \nsome of the most rare and remarkable creatures anyplace on Earth. \nWithout our help, many of these creatures could disappear within a \ngeneration.\n  I also wish to draw attention to the efforts of Senators Merkley and \nKyl today to clear an important bill that will end the appalling \npractice of animal crush videos. It is hard for me to comprehend what \nsome people do. They torture animals and take pictures of them and \nsometimes sell those pictures. There are people sick enough to want to \nwatch a little animal or a big animal be crushed and killed. They call \nthem animal crush videos. The law we passed in 1999 outlawing these \nvideos was struck down by the Supreme Court in April of this year. \nSenators Kyl and Merkley have worked to write a more narrowly tailored \nbill that respects the first amendment while still punishing those who \nseek to profit from the torture of puppies, kittens, and other helpless \nanimals.\n  As I understand it, the Supreme Court said you can't stop people from \nbuying these videos to watch. But we can stop people from doing these \nterrible things that people want to watch.\n  I hope we can work these out and pass these by unanimous consent. Why \ndo we need debate on these issues? These are good bipartisan bills that \ndeserve to be passed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a number of unanimous consent \nrequests that I am going to ask. But I have been told the Republicans \nwant to look a few of these over, and I have no problem with that. I \ncan do it later tonight or tomorrow sometime. These are important \nissues. I have given a brief synopsis of some of the awful things going \non around the country as they relate to animals. We should do something \nto take care of this. I hope we can get these cleared. These are not \ngreat legal issues, but they are moral issues. If we can't treat \nanimals in a fair way, we can't treat ourselves in a fair way.\n  When we come in, in the morning, I will ask for these consents. I \nappreciate my friend from Mississippi for his usual manner of being so \ncourteous in allowing me to go forward with my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nanniversary and great impact of the Nevada Opera Theatre in Las Vegas, \nNV. A pillar in the arts, education and entertainment in southern \nNevada, we are proud of the Nevada Theatre Opera and its many \nachievements since inception. It is my great pleasure to honor this \nfine institution along with its participants, patrons and volunteers \nhere before the U.S. Senate today.\n  Known as a global center of entertainment and the arts, Las Vegas, \nNV, enjoys an incredible atmosphere of music and theatre. Eileen Hayes \ndesired to add the immense impact of opera to this reputation and \nrealized her goal with the foundation of the Nevada Opera Theatre in \nOctober of 1985. She brought opera music and performance to southern \nNevada. Her work has been instrumental, and since the first performance \nin August of 1986, audiences have been captivated by productions \nincluding: La Boheme, La Traviata, Tosca and Die Fledermaus, to name a \nfew.\n  The theatre continues on today as the major nonprofit opera company \nin southern Nevada. Comprised of Nevada Opera Theatre artists, chorus, \nand children's chorus and orchestra, membership surpasses 120. Many of \nthe included artists are nationally and internationally recognized, \nwhile others are talented regional and local performers. All artists \nexude an excellent caliber or professionalism in the development of \ntheir craft.\n  As I have previously mentioned, these citizen performers not only \nentertain. Opera Outreach has performed for over 115,000 Clark County \nSchool District and private students, touching a great many lives in \nthe ongoing education of our youth. Everyone is invited to participate \nby either joining the theatre or becoming a patron, making the \neducation all the more tangible. Outreach encompasses not only programs \nin the schools but additional programming in local malls, hospices, \nhospitals, and for civic and community organizations.\n  I join with my fellow Nevadans in honoring the Nevada Opera Theatre \nfor its 25 years of service. Now well into its third decade, this \ninstitution has worked to bring a knowledge and appreciation of music \nto the people of southern Nevada, and I have no doubt that it will \ncontinue to do so for years to come. I am grateful and honored to \nrecognize the 25th anniversary of the Nevada Opera Theatre.\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7606-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOHN MENDOZA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate today to call \nattention to one of Nevada's finest advocacy programs. This year marks \nthe 30th Anniversary of the Court Appointed Special Advocate Program, \nCASA. In Clark County, NV, the CASA program became a reality as a \ndirect result of the efforts of Judge John F. Mendoza. Today I ask my \ncolleagues to join with me in applauding the noble deeds performed by \nJudge Mendoza and the CASA Program.\n  Born and raised in Las Vegas, NV, John received his juris doctor \ndegree from the University of Notre Dame in 1952. After returning to \nNevada, he eventually served as Clark County district attorney, North \nLas Vegas city attorney, and Justice of the Peace of Las Vegas \nTownship. His Honor was elected to district court judge of the State of \nNevada, a position he held for 24 years. Judge Mendoza served as the \npresident of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.\n  During his career, Judge Mendoza recognized the desperate need for \nskilled and timely decisionmaking in the lives of abused, neglected and \nabandoned children, not only in Nevada but across the country. He used \nhis knowledge, passion, and energy to educate and extract a level of \nexcellence when dealing with caseworkers, parents and court proceedings \nin regard to appropriate needs evaluation and placement. He demanded a \nclear vision of roles and procedures. He held caseworkers responsible \nto the children they represented and answerable to the court for \ndecisions they made.\n  Judge Mendoza recognized the lack of quality in the court process and \ndid not tolerate the unfortunate delays in court hearing dates which \noften resulted in children literally growing up without permanent \nhomes. As a result, Judge Mendoza championed national guidelines for \nimproving court practices in child protective cases. He helped to \nestablish methods for monitoring court schedules to prevent unnecessary \ndelays and to control continuances. He urged competent representation \nthru the CASA and guardian ad litem programs. Through his tireless \nefforts, family courts began to take into account not only the \nchildren's safety but also the emotional impact of separation.\n  A lifetime of dedication to the rights of the children of Nevada and \nbeyond has resulted in a national program that engages volunteers to be \na voice for neglected and abused children. Each CASA volunteer in turn \nhas an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of Judge John Mendoza in \nmaking a meaningful and constructive difference. Those footsteps lead \nto protecting and preserving the rights and interests of children who \nare unsafe in their own homes; to insuring that all aspects of the \nfamily court system perform in a child's best interest and secures a \nsafe and permanent home for that child.\n  I am deeply grateful for the work performed by CASA and its many \nvolunteers. The chance to advocate on behalf of someone in need is the \ngreatest opportunity afforded to those who serve in our legal system. I \nstand before the Senate today and thank the CASA program and Judge \nMendoza for these 30 years of remarkable service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7606-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7606-S7607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CHIEF JUSTICE JEFF AMESTOY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this summer, Marcelle and I were honored to \nbe at the Vermont Supreme Court with former Supreme Court Justice Jeff \nAmestoy, his wife Susan, and their daughters. Like all Vermonters, I \nhave respected his tenure, both as attorney general and as chief \njustice, as both were exemplary. While the portrait captures the image \nof the Jeff Amestoy his friends honor and care for, his words are what \nshould be read by everyone who cares about our judiciary. Jeff's \ncommitment to the law, our justice system, and our sense of what makes \nVermont the State we love is in his words. They were so impressive I \nasked him for a copy, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks of Chief Justice Jeff Amestoy (Retired) at Portrait Ceremony\n\n\n                         Vermont Supreme Court\n\n                    (Montpelier, VT, Aug. 13, 2010)\n\n       Governor Douglas, Senator Leahy, Chief Justice Reiber, \n     family and friends:\n       Thank you for the honor you do me by attending this \n     ceremony. Thank you Justice Burgess for your generous \n     introductory remarks. Brian Burgess served as Deputy Attorney \n     General when I was Attorney General. I doubt that either of \n     us could have foreseen this day but here we are together \n     again. History may not repeat itself, but it sometimes \n     rhymes.\n       Thank you Kenneth McIntosh Daly--artist, rancher, and \n     friend who has once again made the trip from California to \n     Vermont.\n       And thank you to my daughters Katherine, Christina, and \n     Nancy for the unveiling.\n       This September I begin my seventh year as a Fellow at the \n     Harvard Kennedy School nearly as long as I served on the \n     Supreme Court of Vermont.\n       For those of you wondering how a Harvard Fellow spends his \n     time, I can say I have spent the better part of the last two \n     years living in the nineteenth century--more precisely in the \n     Boston of the decade before the Civil War.\n       It was a time when a young man working as a waiter in a \n     coffee house, or a clerk in a clothing store, could be seized \n     by agents of the United States Government, brought before a \n     Judge, and under the provisions of the new Fugitive Slave Law \n     (where no process was due), be sent back into slavery.\n       Contrary to what I thought I knew about American history, \n     Boston in the period leading up to the Civil War, was in the \n     words of Charles Francis Adams, Jr., ``almost avowedly a \n     proslavery community.'' ``It was a time'' wrote Emerson, \n     ``when judges, bank presidents, railroad men, men of fashion, \n     and lawyers universally all took the side of slavery.''\n       Well, almost all. I am interested in understanding how a \n     society, and particularly the legal establishment of 1850s \n     Boston, was transformed from the beginning of the decade when \n     Daniel Webster said ``no lawyer who makes more than $40 a \n     year is against the Fugitive Slave Law,'' to the end of the \n     decade when lawyers literally went to war against it.\n       My window on that time, curiously enough, opened when I saw \n     a portrait of a lawyer of that period.\n       So this day, for many reasons, has prompted me to look to a \n     future as far removed from us today as the Boston of 1850. A \n     century from now when each of us will be someone's memory, \n     there will be, I trust, remembrances of things past.\n       In some building if not this one, there will be a wall \n     where portraits of forgotten Chief Justices still hang--or \n     where an enterprising curator has retrieved old paintings and \n     artifacts for an exhibit of our times.\n       And on some class field trip (for those will always be with \n     us), among a group of very bored students, there may be (if \n     the world is lucky to still have teachers as inspiring as \n     Mrs. Amestoy), a bright, curious student who will pause in \n     front of this painting.\n       She will not, of course, recognize its subject, but as she \n     looks through the window in the portrait, she will see Mt. \n     Mansfield. And the window of the painting will begin to open \n     for her a window on our time.\n       Our young historian will immerse herself in the flood of \n     newspapers, opinions, and books of those long ago days at the \n     beginning of the twenty-first century. On the basis of the \n     documentation and her own insight, she will attempt to bring \n     to life the color and passion when the social changes were so \n     profound that even on our own time scholars characterized the \n     upheaval as ``The Great Disruption.''\n       If our young scholar has had a history teacher as good as \n     Mr. Remington, she will know she cannot rely on a single \n     perspective. (In any event, my autobiography, The \n     Indispensable Man, will long be out of print). But our future \n     historian will be struck, as many historians have been, by \n     the disproportionate impact Vermont has had on American \n     history. She will not lack in material looking back at our \n     time.\n       One Vermont Senator whose unparalleled leadership of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, and pivotal endorsement of \n     America's first African-American President, will echo down \n     the halls of history; another whose rejection of the narrow \n     partisanship of his party realigned the political balance of \n     the United States Senate. A Governor whose candidacy for the \n     Presidency altered the nature of presidential campaigns; \n     another whose exemplary service at the beginning of the \n     twenty-first century reflected the virtues Vermont's \n     eighteenth century constitution calls ``absolutely necessary \n     . . . the firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, \n     industry, and frugality.''\n       Our historian will read of an opinion of the Vermont \n     Supreme Court that framed a debate for a nation. And of the \n     people of Vermont who demonstrated what the result is when \n     that debate is conducted with respect and resolved in \n     humanity.\n       If the Vermont of the twenty-second century is as blessed \n     as ours, there will still be a justice system that ``speaks \n     for principle and listens for change.'' Just as the \n     Commission on the Future of Vermont's Justice System \n     envisioned when on the eve of the twenty-first century a new \n     Chief Justice wrote: ``if the future is realized in the way \n     every member of the Commission devoutly wishes it to be, a \n     century hence our successors will\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\n     hear these fundamental principles resonate as clearly as we \n     hear them resonate today.''\n       I am optimistic about that future. How could I not be with \n     these daughters?\n       This portrait (assuming, of course, it is actually hung) \n     may gather dust well into the next century.

BYRD MINE AND WORKPLACE SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety Act. This bill establishes \nvital new workplace safety measures and it deserves consideration here \non the Senate floor.\n  In 2009, there were 4,340 workplace fatalities. In my home State of \nIowa, 78 people were killed on the job. This year, we have already \nwitnessed the horrific mine catastrophe that killed 29 people in West \nVirginia, the fire at the Tesoro oil refinery in Washington State that \nkilled 7 workers, and the BP Deepwater Horizon platform explosion that \nkilled 11 people and was an environmental catastrophe for the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  As the son of a coal miner, I feel these losses very deeply, on a \nvery personal level. My heart goes out to the family and coworkers of \nevery worker who is killed or injured on the job. Too many of these \ntragedies are preventable, and we should not rest until the day that no \nhardworking American has to sacrifice his or her life for a paycheck.\n  History teaches us that stronger laws protecting worker safety make a \nbig difference, but our current laws are not doing the job. That is why \nI strongly support the Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety Act, \nwhich would make long overdue improvements to our workplace safety laws \nand save the lives of many thousands of hardworking Americans.\n  For months, we have been negotiating with Republicans trying to agree \nto a bipartisan bill that improves workplace safety. I think it is fair \nto say there have been setbacks in our discussions recently, but we \nwant and intend to keep working with our Republican colleagues to craft \na bipartisan bill--in this Congress or early in the next--that we can \nget to the President's desk.\n  This has been a long and difficult process as we try to reconcile \npolicy differences between Democrats and Republicans on these important \nissues. Nevertheless, we will keep working to bridge those differences \nbecause it is critical that we find a way to agree on legislation that \nis consistent with certain core principles:\n  Every American deserves to go to work without fearing for his or her \nlife;\n  Responsible businesses that put safety first shouldn't have to \ncompete with businesses that prioritize a quick buck over the safety of \ntheir employees;\n  Employers who put workers' lives at risk should face serious \nconsequences that will force them to change their ways;\n  Companies shouldn't be able to hide behind high priced lawyers and \nconvoluted corporate forms to avoid being held accountable for their \nactions;\n  Critical agencies charged with protecting workers' lives should have \nall the tools they need to get the job done; and\n  Whistleblowers are the first line of defense in safe workplaces, and \ndeserve strong protection from discrimination and retaliation.\n  While there may be many ways to achieve these goals, the Robert C. \nByrd Mine and Workplace Safety Act clearly reflects these core \nprinciples, and its passage would be a major step forward for workplace \nsafety. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and that \nis why I would ask my Republican colleagues to give us an opportunity \nto debate this legislation on the floor.\n  This legislation makes common sense reforms to the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act, which has not been significantly updated since \nit was passed 40 years ago. For example, whistleblower protection under \nthe act is toothless and unfairly tilted against workers who risk their \ncareer to protect the public welfare. This bill makes essential changes \nto ensure that workers are protected, including lengthening OSHA's 30-\nday statute of limitation for whistleblowers, providing for \nreinstatement while the legal process unfolds for cases with an initial \nfinding of merit, and giving the worker the right to file their own \nclaim in court if the government does not investigate the claim in a \ntimely manner.\n  The bill also strengthens criminal and civil penalties that, at \npresent, are too weak to protect workers. Under current law, an \nemployer may be charged--at most--with a misdemeanor when a willful \nviolation of OSHA leads to a worker's death. Under the Robert C. Byrd \nMine and Workplace Safety Act, felony charges are available for an \nemployer's repeated and willful violations of OSHA that result in a \nworker's death or serious injury. The bill also updates OSHA civil \npenalties, which have been unchanged since 1990, and sets a minimum \npenalty of $50,000 for a worker's death caused by a willful violation.\n  In addition to toughening sanctions for employers who needlessly \nexpose their employees to risk, the bill makes sure that the government \nis responsive to the worker when investigating the charges. It \nguarantees victims the right to meet with the person investigating the \nclaim, to be notified of and receive copies of reports or citations \nissued in the investigation, and to be notified of and have the right \nto appear at proceedings related to their case. Victims of retaliation \nshould not suffer the double indignity of being ignored by government \nofficials charged with protecting them.\n  The bill also makes critical changes in our mine safety laws. We \nstill don't know exactly what caused the tragic death of 29 miners at \nUpper Big Branch, but we do know that the mine had an appalling safety \nrecord, and that the tragedy might have been prevented had the Mine \nSafety Health Administration, MSHA, had effective tools to target such \na chronically unsafe mine.\n  We have provisions in our laws that are supposed to target repeat \noffenders--called the ``pattern of violations'' process--but this \nsystem is broken and badly needs to be revamped.\n  As bad as Upper Big Branch's record was, the law has been interpreted \nto allow it to continue operating without ``pattern of violation'' \ntreatment as long as its operators can reduce their violations by more \nthan one third in response to a written warning. With a record as \nspotty as Upper Big Branch's, a partial reduction in its numerous \ncitations is hardly a sign of a safe mine, and it should not be a ``get \nout of jail free'' card to escape the intent of the law.\n  Operators are also finding creative ways to ensure that the system \ncannot work as Congress intended. Some chronic violators have avoided \nbeing placed on ``pattern of violation'' status and avoided paying \nlegitimate penalties by contesting nearly every citation that is \nassessed against them. Because MSHA uses only final orders to establish \na pattern of violations and there is a substantial backlog of cases the \nFederal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, repeat offenders are \nable to evade pattern of violations status by contesting large numbers \nof violations. At the Upper Big Branch coal mine, for example, Massey \ncontested 97 percent of its ``significant and substantial'' violations \nin 2007. These appeals can take up to three years to resolve, virtually \nguaranteeing that mines are never placed on pattern status.\n  MSHA needs to be able to respond to safety concerns in real time, not \n3 years later. This legislation changes the pattern of violation system \nso that MSHA will be able to address unsafe conditions as they occur, \nand gives MSHA the enforcement tools it needs to put dangerous mines \nback on track.\n  Let me respond to recent suggestions that Democrats have been playing \npolitical theatre with important safety and health legislation. We want \nto pass bipartisan legislation based on a shared commitment to \nworkplace safety. I am thoroughly committed to that process, and I hope \nit continues. But we will not support weak or ineffective reforms in \nthe name of bipartisanship.\n  Workplace accidents--whether in a mine, an oil refinery, or \nwherever--are preventable. All we are asking for is an opportunity to \ndebate, amend, and vote\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\non a bill that will make real progress in improving the safety of our \nmost dangerous workplaces. If we are not allowed that opportunity \ntoday, I plan to keep pressing forward on this issue until we get that \nchance. It is far too important, and too many lives are at stake, to \ngive up now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7608-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HAWAII BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join \nme today in honoring the work of Terry Allen Perl, who has served the \nChimes Family of Services for 40 years.\n  The Chimes Family of Services is an international agency delivering a \nwide variety of support to more than 17,000 people. Chimes offers an \nextensive range of services from educational services to residential \nsupport and psychiatric services. It serves people of all ages and \nvarying levels of ability, providing assistance to people with \ndevelopmental disabilities, mental illness, and other specialized \nneeds. It offers an important support network to people with \ndisabilities and their families as they work to achieve their goals, \naspirations, and dreams.\n  Terry Allen Perl started his career with Chimes, Inc. in January of \n1971. He was the first director of a community-based residential \nfacility in the State of Maryland for people with intellectual \ndisabilities. His vision and leadership over the intervening years have \nled to the extraordinary success of the organization as he has helped \nto expand its educational, habilitation, employment, vocational, \nresidential, and support services.\n  Under Mr. Perl's leadership, Chimes has moved from being a provider \nof services to one of the largest contractors employing people with \ndisabilities. Chimes provides janitorial and facility services for the \nU.S. Government and for the State of Maryland.\n  Under Mr. Perl's guidance, Chimes has expanded from serving 200 \npeople in the Baltimore area to more than 17,000 people from North \nCarolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the State of Israel.\n  Mr. Pearl has received numerous awards and honors in recognition of \nhis innovative and pioneering programs. He has been a leader and member \nof numerous professional organizations including: ANCOR, American \nNetwork of Community Options and Resources, CARF, Commission on \nAccreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, AAMR, American Association \non Mental Retardation, Maryland Works, Baltimore City Mayor's \nCommission on Disabilities, Developmental Disabilities Council, \nBaltimore County Workforce Investment Council, and the Baltimore County \nCommission on Disabilities. He is a frequent lecturer, consultant, and \nadvisor to numerous provider agencies, advocacy groups, associations, \nand government entities. During his tenure as president and chief \nexecutive officer, Chimes has become nationally and internationally \nrecognized as a provider of services and jobs for those with \ndisabilities.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Terry Allen Perl for \nhis 40 years of dedicated service to the Chimes Family of Services \norganization and for his outstanding contributions to improving the \nlives of people with disabilities and their families and communities in \nMaryland, throughout our Nation, and in Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7608-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7608-S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BALTIMORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES TASK FORCE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join \nme in paying special tribute to the Job Opportunities Task Force, JOTF, \nan independent advocacy and monitoring organization in Baltimore, MD, \nthat is celebrating 10 years of service.\n  JOTF was begun in 1996 by a handful of people who were concerned \nabout job opportunities for low-skilled job seekers in the Baltimore \narea. They called themselves the Job Opportunities Task Force, and they \nhoped they could help unemployed and underemployed men and women. They \nhad a short-term goal, which was to come up with ideas and \nrecommendations that would break down barriers to better employment and \nto bring private and public partners together to implement these \nchanges.\n  In 1997, the Abell Foundation gave JOTF a grant to prepare a report \non the job gap that would present detailed information about what types \nof jobs were available in the Baltimore region, where they were \nlocated, what they paid, what levels of education and skills were \nrequired, and where the potential workers were. The report, entitled \n``Baltimore Area Jobs and Low Skill Job Seekers,'' was published in \nl999 and revealed many gaps between the workforce and the jobs that \nwere available--far too many impediments to be solved with a few \nmeetings.\n  Since its incorporation in 2000, JOTF has become a leading voice on \nworkforce issues in Maryland, supporting a range of State policy \ninitiatives and budget decisions, including increased investment in \nadult education and job training in communities and in prisons. JOTF \nhas lobbied to expand the earned income tax credit, reduce barriers to \n(re)employment for ex-offenders, and reform unemployment insurance.\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n  JOTF designs programs that create viable career paths for low-wage \nworkers, helping them reach higher wage jobs in industries that need \nmore skilled workers. A good example of JOTF's success is JumpStart, a \npre-apprenticeship program created and managed by JOTF that trains 100 \nlow-wage Baltimore residents each year to become licensed electricians, \nplumbers, or carpenters. JOTF also convenes public meetings on local \nand national topics related to employment and the workforce. These \nmeetings attract employers, policymakers, interested citizens, and \ndirect service providers. JOTF's research informs policymakers and the \npublic and encourages the development of programs based on best \npractices. It explores the impact of specific policies and provides \nrecommendations on how policies can better serve workers, families, \nemployers, and the State's economy.\n  JOTF is making a significant difference in Maryland. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me today in congratulating JOTF's founding chair, \nJoanne Nathans, whose gentle nature and steely convictions have \nimproved the lives of countless Baltimoreans and their families. Please \njoin me in sending best wishes to JOTF on the occasion of its 10th \nanniversary and in thanking JOTF for improving the lives of Maryland \njob seekers, workers, and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7609-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DAKOTA WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \n125th anniversary of the founding of Dakota Wesleyan University, DWU, \nin Mitchell, SD. DWU has provided a well-rounded education that \nemphasizes learning, leadership, faith, and service to its students \nsince its founding 125 years ago. Graduates of the university have gone \non to become great community and professional leaders. Today, under the \nleadership of President Robert Duffett, DWU strives to connect its \nproud heritage with its promising future.\n  In 1883, a group of Methodist settlers received a charter to found \nthe Dakota Wesleyan University. DWU serves as the university for the \nDakotas Conference of the United Methodist Church. Soon after the \nuniversity opened, Dakota Wesleyan students demonstrated their success \nthrough their excellent oratorical skills. They participated in the \nIntercollegiate Oratorical Contest and won 5 of its first 11 \ncompetitions. This is just one of many examples of DWU students' \nability to excel.\n  With a student body just larger than 750 people, the university \noffers a very personalized experience. The university is composed of \nthree colleges: the College of Arts and Humanities, the College of \nHealthcare, Fitness and Sciences, and the College of Leadership and \nPublic Service. These colleges allow for students to pursue an \neducation in both liberal arts and professional programs.\n  In addition to academic programs, students also participate in \nservice work to aid people in South Dakota and around the world. Recent \nmission trip locations have included Tanzania and Mexico, where \nstudents served those living in extreme poverty. Through the Leadership \nand Public Service Program, students have the opportunity to study \ncontemporary issues and perform public service through internship \nplacements. Such broad educational opportunities provided by DWU help \nstudents explore citizenry locally and internationally.\n  On Saturday, October 2, 2010, DWU will celebrate its Blue and White \nBash at the Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD. Dakota Wesleyan University has \nprovided our State quality education and a positive social environment. \nDWU students are well equipped to succeed in a competitive world, \ndelivering countless benefits to organizations and communities close to \nhome and around the globe. With alumni as accomplished as former U.S. \nSenator George McGovern and his wife Eleanor McGovern, DWU continues to \nlive up to its mission of being ``a leading university that educates \nstudents to identify and develop their individual talents for \nsuccessful lives in service to God and the common good.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7609-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7609-S7612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING TED WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, baseball celebrates ``walk off'' \nhome runs, the four baggers that bring a game to an end. But 50 years \nago today, the greatest hitter who ever lived, No. 9, Ted Williams, hit \nthe ultimate ``walk off'' homer. After 21 seasons with our Red Sox, \n``The Kid'' homered deep into right field in his very last at bat. At \n42, despite the toll of nagging injuries, some of which dated back to \nhis combat tours, Ted lofted the ball into the right field bleachers, \nnot all that far from the spot where he hit the longest homerun in the \nhistory of Fenway Park at 502 feet. To this day the record stands and \nthe seat in those bleachers is memorialized in red. This home run might \nnot have been the longest but it was a fitting farewell to the game he \nloved so much--and excelled at like no other. He was bigger than life.\n  We revered Ted Williams for many reasons--for what he did on the \nfield, and off of it as well. It was not just his lifelong commitment \nto the Jimmy Fund, but the selfless way he twice walked away from \nbaseball and served his country in uniform in World War II and in Korea \nwhere he was wingman to another icon, John Glenn. He was a two time \nAmerican League Most Valuable Player, boasted a career batting average \nof .344, an on base percentage of .551, lead the league in batting six \ntimes, and hammered 521 home runs. Ted Williams was guts and grit \npersonified--and all of Red Sox Nation was grateful for the special way \nhe welcomed us into his hearts in his final years, at last tipping his \ncap to the fans of Boston, and letting us say goodbye to him one last \ntime at the 1999 All Star Game in Boston when--on the Fenway mound--he \nwas surrounded by the great players of the 20th century who were in awe \nof our own `Splendid Splinter.' It was one final moment of magic in a \ncareer--and life--seemingly ripped from a story-book.\n  But it was that last home run that John Updike remembers in the \nextraordinary ``Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,'' an essay that captures the \ngreatness of Ted Williams far better than any of us could--and still \ntoday, 50 years later, speaks to the Red Sox faithful, and baseball \nfans across the country. I ask to have this essay printed in the \nRecord, and I thank the Senate for taking time today to remember an \nAmerican icon--Boston's own Ted Williams.\n\n                         Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\n\n                            (By John Updike)\n\n       Fenway Park, in Boston, is a lyric little bandbox of a \n     ballpark. Everything is painted green and seems in curiously \n     sharp focus, like the inside of an old-fashioned peeping-type \n     Easter egg. It was built in 1912 and rebuilt in 1934, and \n     offers, as do most Boston artifacts, a compromise between \n     Man's Euclidean determinations and Nature's beguiling \n     irregularities. Its right field is one of the deepest in the \n     American League, while its left field is the shortest; the \n     high left-field wall, three hundred and fifteen feet from \n     home plate along the foul line, virtually thrusts its surface \n     at right-handed hitters. On the afternoon of Wednesday, \n     September 28th, as I took a seat behind third base, a \n     uniformed groundkeeper was treading the top of this wall, \n     picking batting-practice home runs out of the screen, like a \n     mushroom gatherer seen in Wordsworthian perspective on the \n     verge of a cliff. The day was overcast, chill, and \n     uninspirational. The Boston team was the worst in twenty-\n     seven seasons. A jangling medley of incompetent youth and \n     aging competence, the Red Sox were finishing in seventh place \n     only because the Kansas City Athletics had locked them out of \n     the cellar. They were scheduled to play the Baltimore \n     Orioles, a much nimbler blend of May and December, who had \n     been dumped from pennant contention a week before by the \n     insatiable Yankees. I, and 10,453 others, had shown up \n     primarily because this was the Red Sox's last home game of \n     the season, and therefore the last time in all eternity that \n     their regular left fielder, known to the headlines as TED, \n     KID, SPLINTER, THUMPER, TW, and, most cloyingly, MISTER \n     WONDERFUL, would play in Boston. ``WHAT WILL WE DO WITHOUT \n     TED? HUB FANS ASK'' ran the headline on a newspaper being \n     read by a bulb-nosed cigar smoker a few rows away. Williams' \n     retirement had been announced, doubted (he had been \n     threatening retirement for years), confirmed by Tom Yawkey, \n     the Red Sox owner, and at last widely accepted as the sad but \n     probable truth. He was forty-two and had redeemed his abysmal \n     season of 1959 with a--considering his advanced age--fine \n     one. He had been giving away his gloves and bats and had \n     grudgingly consented to a sentimental ceremony today. This \n     was not necessarily his last game; the Red Sox were scheduled \n     to travel to New York and wind up the season with three games \n     there.\n       I arrived early. The Orioles were hitting fungos on the \n     field. The day before, they had spitefully smothered the Red \n     Sox, 17-4, and neither their faces nor their drab gray \n     visiting-team uniforms seemed very gracious. I\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\n     wondered who had invited them to the party. Between our heads \n     and the lowering clouds a frenzied organ was thundering \n     through, with an appositeness perhaps accidental, ``You \n     maaaade me love you, I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do \n     it . . .''\n       The affair between Boston and Ted Williams has been no mere \n     summer romance; it has been a marriage, composed of spats, \n     mutual disappointments, and, toward the end, a mellowing \n     hoard of shared memories. It falls into three stages, which \n     may be termed Youth, Maturity, and Age; or Thesis, \n     Antithesis, and Synthesis; or Jason, Achilles, and Nestor.\n       First, there was the by now legendary epoch when the young \n     bridegroom came out of the West, announced ``All I want out \n     of life is that when I walk down the street folks will say \n     `There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived.' '' The \n     dowagers of local journalism attempted to give elementary \n     deportment lessons to this child who spake as a god, and to \n     their horror were themselves rebuked. Thus began the long \n     exchange of backbiting, hat-flipping, booing, and spitting \n     that has distinguished Williams' public relations. The \n     spitting incidents of 1957 and 1958 and the similar dockside \n     courtesies that Williams has now and then extended to the \n     grandstand should be judged against this background: the \n     left-field stands at Fenway for twenty years have held a \n     large number of customers who have bought their way in \n     primarily for the privilege of showering abuse on Williams. \n     Greatness necessarily attracts debunkers, but in Williams' \n     case the hostility has been systematic and unappeasable. His \n     basic offense against the fans has been to wish that they \n     weren't there. Seeking a perfectionist's vacuum, he has \n     quixotically desired to sever the game from the ground of \n     paid spectatorship and publicity that supports it. Hence his \n     refusal to tip his cap to the crowd or turn the other cheek \n     to newsmen. It has been a costly theory--it has probably cost \n     him, among other evidences of good will, two Most Valuable \n     Player awards, which are voted by reporters--but he has held \n     to it from his rookie year on. While his critics, oral and \n     literary, remained beyond the reach of his discipline, the \n     opposing pitchers were accessible, and he spanked them to the \n     tune of .406 in 1941. He slumped to .356 in 1942 and went off \n     to war.\n       In 1946, Williams returned from three years as a Marine \n     pilot to the second of his baseball avatars, that of \n     Achilles, the hero of incomparable prowess and beauty who \n     nevertheless was to be found sulking in his tent while the \n     Trojans (mostly Yankees) fought through to the ships. Yawkey, \n     a timber and mining maharajah, had surrounded his central \n     jewel with many gems of slightly lesser water, such as Bobby \n     Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, Rudy York, Birdie Tebbetts, and Johnny \n     Pesky. Throughout the late forties, the Red Sox were the best \n     paper team in baseball, yet they had little three-dimensional \n     to show for it, and if this was a tragedy, Williams was \n     Hamlet. A succinct review of the indictment--and a fair \n     sample of appreciative sports-page prose--appeared the very \n     day of Williams' valedictory, in a column by Huck Finnegan in \n     the Boston American (no sentimentalist, Huck):\n       Williams' career, in contrast [to Babe Ruth's] has been a \n     series of failures except for his averages. He flopped in the \n     only World Series he ever played in (1946) when he batted \n     only .200. He flopped in the playoff game with Cleveland in \n     1948. He flopped in the final game of the 1949 season with \n     the pennant hinging on the outcome (Yanks 5, Sox 3). He \n     flopped in 1950 when he returned to the lineup after a two-\n     month absence and ruined the morale of a club that seemed \n     pennant-bound under Steve O'Neill. It has always been \n     Williams' records first, the team second, and the Sox non-\n     winning record is proof enough of that.\n       There are answers to all this, of course. The fatal \n     weakness of the great Sox slugging teams was not-quite-good-\n     enough pitching rather than Williams' failure to hit a home \n     run every time he came to bat. Again, Williams' depressing \n     effect on his teammates has never been proved. Despite ample \n     coaching to the contrary, most insisted that they liked him. \n     He has been generous with advice to any player who asked for \n     it. In an increasingly combative baseball atmosphere, he \n     continued to duck beanballs docilely. With umpires he was \n     gracious to a fault. This courtesy itself annoyed his \n     critics, whom there was no pleasing. And against the ten \n     crucial games (the seven World Series games with the St. \n     Louis Cardinals, the 1948 playoff with the Cleveland Indians, \n     and the two-game series with the Yankees at the end of the \n     1949 season, winning either one of which would have given the \n     Red Sox the pennant) that make up the Achilles' heel of \n     Williams' record, a mass of statistics can be set showing \n     that day in and day out he was no slouch in the clutch. The \n     correspondence columns of the Boston papers now and then \n     suffer a sharp flurry of arithmetic on this score; indeed, \n     for Williams to have distributed all his hits so they did \n     nobody else any good would constitute a feat of placement \n     unparalleled in the annals of selfishness.\n       Whatever residue of truth remains of the Finnegan charge \n     those of us who love Williams must transmute as best we can, \n     in our own personal crucibles. My personal memories of \n     Williams begin when I was a boy in Pennsylvania, with two \n     last-place teams in Philadelphia to keep me company. For me, \n     ``W'ms, lf'' was a figment of the box scores who always \n     seemed to be going 3-for-5. He radiated, from afar, the hard \n     blue glow of high purpose. I remember listening over the \n     radio to the All-Star Game of 1946, in which Williams hit two \n     singles and two home runs, the second one off a Rip Sewell \n     ``blooper'' pitch; it was like hitting a balloon out of the \n     park. I remember watching one of his home runs from the \n     bleachers of Shibe Park; it went over the first baseman's \n     head and rose meticulously along a straight line and was \n     still rising when it cleared the fence. The trajectory seemed \n     qualitatively different from anything anyone else might hit. \n     For me, Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a \n     hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing \n     at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done \n     well and a thing done ill. Baseball is a game of the long \n     season, of relentless and gradual averaging-out. \n     Irrelevance--since the reference point of most individual \n     games is remote and statistical--always threatens its \n     interest, which can be maintained not by the occasional \n     heroics that sportswriters feed upon but by players who \n     always care; who care, that is to say, about themselves and \n     their art. Insofar as the clutch hitter is not a \n     sportswriter's myth, he is a vulgarity, like a writer who \n     writes only for money. It may be that, compared to managers' \n     dreams such as Joe DiMaggio and the always helpful Stan \n     Musial, Williams is an icy star. But of all team sports, \n     baseball, with its graceful intermittences of action, its \n     immense and tranquil field sparsely settled with poised men \n     in white, its dispassionate mathematics, seems to me best \n     suited to accommodate, and be ornamented by, a loner. It is \n     an essentially lonely game. No other player visible to my \n     generation has concentrated within himself so much of the \n     sport's poignance, has so assiduously refined his natural \n     skills, has so constantly brought to the plate that intensity \n     of competence that crowds the throat with joy.\n       By the time I went to college, near Boston, the lesser \n     stars Yawkey had assembled around Williams had faded, and his \n     craftsmanship, his rigorous pride, had become itself a kind \n     of heroism. This brittle and temperamental player developed \n     an unexpected quality of persistence. He was always coming \n     back--back from Korea, back from a broken collarbone, a \n     shattered elbow, a bruised heel, back from drastic bouts of \n     flu and ptomaine poisoning. Hardly a season went by without \n     some enfeebling mishap, yet he always came back, and always \n     looked like himself. The delicate mechanism of timing and \n     power seemed locked, shockproof, in some case outside his \n     body. In addition to injuries, there were a heavily \n     publicized divorce, and the usual storms with the press, and \n     the Williams Shift--the maneuver, custom-built by Lou \n     Boudreau, of the Cleveland Indians, whereby three infielders \n     were concentrated on the right side of the infield, where a \n     left-handed pull hitter like Williams generally hits the \n     ball. Williams could easily have learned to punch singles \n     through the vacancy on his left and fattened his average \n     hugely. This was what Ty Cobb, the Einstein of average, told \n     him to do. But the game had changed since Cobb; Williams \n     believed that his value to the club and to the game was as a \n     slugger, so he went on pulling the ball, trying to blast it \n     through three men, and paid the price of perhaps fifteen \n     points of lifetime average. Like Ruth before him, he bought \n     the occasional home run at the cost of many directed \n     singles--a calculated sacrifice certainly not, in the case of \n     a hitter as average-minded as Williams, entirely selfish.\n       After a prime so harassed and hobbled, Williams was granted \n     by the relenting fates a golden twilight. He became at the \n     end of his career perhaps the best old hitter of the century. \n     The dividing line came between the 1956 and the 1957 seasons. \n     In September of the first year, he and Mickey Mantle were \n     contending for the batting championship. Both were hitting \n     around .350, and there was no one else near them. The season \n     ended with a three-game series between the Yankees and the \n     Sox, and, living in New York then, I went up to the Stadium. \n     Williams was slightly shy of the four hundred at-bats needed \n     to qualify; the fear was expressed that the Yankee pitchers \n     would walk him to protect Mantle. Instead, they pitched to \n     him--a wise decision. He looked terrible at the plate, tired \n     and discouraged and unconvincing. He never looked very good \n     to me in the Stadium. (Last week, in Life, Williams, a \n     sportswriter himself now, wrote gloomily of the Stadium, \n     ``There's the bigness of it. There are those high stands and \n     all those people smoking--and, of course, the shadows. . . . \n     It takes at least one series to get accustomed to the Stadium \n     and even then you're not sure.'') The final outcome in \n     1956 was Mantle .353, Williams .345.\n       The next year, I moved from New York to New England, and it \n     made all the difference. For in September of 1957, in the \n     same situation, the story was reversed. Mantle finally hit \n     .365; it was the best season of his career. But Williams, \n     though sick and old, had run away from him. A bout of flu had \n     laid him low in September. He emerged from his cave in the \n     Hotel Somerset haggard but irresistible; he hit four \n     successive pinch-hit home runs. ``I feel terrible,'' he \n     confessed, ``but every time I take a swing at the ball it \n     goes out of the park.'' He ended the season with thirty-eight \n     home runs and an average of .388, the highest in either \n     league since his own .406, and, coming from a decrepit man of \n     thirty-nine, an even more supernal figure. With eight or so \n     of the ``leg hits'' that a younger man would have beaten out, \n     it would have been .400. And the next year, Williams, who in \n     1949 and 1953 had lost batting\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\n     championships by decimal whiskers to George Kell and Mickey \n     Vernon, sneaked in behind his teammate Pete Runnels and \n     filched his sixth title, a bargain at .328.\n       In 1959, it seemed all over. The dinosaur thrashed around \n     in the .200 swamp for the first half of the season, and was \n     even benched (``rested,'' Manager Mike Higgins tactfully \n     said). Old foes like the late Bill Cunningham began to offer \n     batting tips. Cunningham thought Williams was jiggling his \n     elbows; in truth, Williams' neck was so stiff he could hardly \n     turn his head to look at the pitcher. When he swung, it \n     looked like a Calder mobile with one thread cut; it reminded \n     you that since 1953 Williams' shoulders had been wired \n     together. A solicitous pall settled over the sports pages. In \n     the two decades since Williams had come to Boston, his status \n     had imperceptibly shifted from that of a naughty prodigy to \n     that of a municipal monument. As his shadow in the record \n     books lengthened, the Red Sox teams around him declined, and \n     the entire American League seemed to be losing life and color \n     to the National. The inconsistency of the new superstars--\n     Mantle, Colavito, and Kaline--served to make Williams appear \n     all the more singular. And off the field, his private \n     philanthropy--in particular, his zealous chairmanship of the \n     Jimmy Fund, a charity for children with cancer--gave him a \n     civic presence somewhat like that of Richard Cardinal \n     Cushing. In religion, Williams appears to be a humanist, and \n     a selective one at that, but he and the Cardinal, when their \n     good works intersect and they appear in the public eye \n     together, make a handsome and heartening pair.\n       Humiliated by his '59 season, Williams determined, once \n     more, to come back. I, as a specimen Williams partisan, was \n     both glad and fearful. All baseball fans believe in miracles; \n     the question is, how many do you believe in? He looked like a \n     ghost in spring training. Manager Jurges warned us ahead of \n     time that if Williams didn't come through he would be \n     benched, just like anybody else. As it turned out, it was \n     Jurges who was benched. Williams entered the 1960 season \n     needing eight home runs to have a lifetime total of 500; \n     after one time at bat in Washington, he needed seven. For a \n     stretch, he was hitting a home run every second game that he \n     played. He passed Lou Gehrig's lifetime total, then the \n     number 500, then Mel Ott's total, and finished with 521, \n     thirteen behind Jimmy Foxx, who alone stands between Williams \n     and Babe Ruth's unapproachable 714. The summer was a \n     statistician's picnic. His two-thousandth walk came and went, \n     his eighteen-hundredth run batted in, his sixteenth All-Star \n     Game. At one point, he hit a home run off a pitcher, Don Lee, \n     off whose father, Thornton Lee, he had hit a home run a \n     generation before. The only comparable season for a forty-\n     two-year-old man was Ty Cobb's in 1928. Cobb batted .323 and \n     hit one homer. Williams batted .316 but hit twenty-nine \n     homers.\n       In sum, though generally conceded to be the greatest hitter \n     of his era, he did not establish himself as ``the greatest \n     hitter who ever lived.'' Cobb, for average, and Ruth, for \n     power, remain supreme. Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Joe Jackson, and \n     Lefty O'Doul, among players since 1900, have higher lifetime \n     averages than Williams' .344. Unlike Foxx, Gehrig, Hack \n     Wilson, Hank Greenberg, and Ralph Kiner, Williams never came \n     close to matching Babe Ruth's season home-run total of sixty. \n     In the list of major-league batting records, not one is held \n     by Williams. He is second in walks drawn, third in home runs, \n     fifth in lifetime averages, sixth in runs batted in, eighth \n     in runs scored and in total bases, fourteenth in doubles, and \n     thirtieth in hits. But if we allow him merely average seasons \n     for the four-plus seasons he lost to two wars, and add \n     another season for the months he lost to injuries, we get a \n     man who in all the power totals would be second, and not a \n     very distant second, to Ruth. And if we further allow that \n     these years would have been not merely average but prime \n     years, if we allow for all the months when Williams was \n     playing in sub-par condition, if we permit his early and \n     later years in baseball to be some sort of index of what the \n     middle years could have been, if we give him a right-field \n     fence that is not, like Fenway's, one of the most distant in \n     the league, and if--the least excusable ``if''--we imagine \n     him condescending to outsmart the Williams Shift, we can \n     defensibly assemble, like a colossus induced from the sizable \n     fragments that do remain, a statistical figure not \n     incommensurate with his grandiose ambition. From the \n     statistics that are on the books, a good case can be made \n     that in the combination of power and average Williams is \n     first; nobody else ranks so high in both categories. Finally, \n     there is the witness of the eyes; men whose memories go back \n     to Shoeless Joe Jackson--another unlucky natural--rank him \n     and Williams together as the best-looking hitters they have \n     seen. It was for our last look that ten thousand of us had \n     come.\n       Two girls, one of them with pert buckteeth and eyes as \n     black as vest buttons, the other with white skin and flesh-\n     colored hair, like an underdeveloped photograph of a redhead, \n     came and sat on my right. On my other side was one of those \n     frowning, chestless young-old men who can frequently be seen, \n     often wearing sailor hats, attending ball games alone. He did \n     not once open his program but instead tapped it, rolled up, \n     on his knee as he gave the game his disconsolate attention. A \n     young lady, with freckles and a depressed, dainty nose that \n     by an optical illusion seemed to thrust her lips forward for \n     a kiss, sauntered down into the box seats and with striking \n     aplomb took a seat right behind the roof of the Oriole \n     dugout. She wore a blue coat with a Northeastern University \n     emblem sewed to it. The girls beside me took it into their \n     heads that this was Williams' daughter. She looked too old to \n     me, and why would she be sitting behind the visitors' dugout? \n     On the other hand, from the way she sat there, staring at the \n     sky and French-inhaling, she clearly was somebody. Other fans \n     came and eclipsed her from view. The crowd looked less like a \n     weekday ballpark crowd than like the folks you might find in \n     Yellowstone National Park, or emerging from automobiles at \n     the top of scenic Mount Mansfield. There were a lot of \n     competitively well-dressed couples of tourist age, and not a \n     few babes in arms. A row of five seats in front of me was \n     abruptly filled with a woman and four children, the youngest \n     of them two years old, if that. Someday, presumably, he could \n     tell his grandchildren that he saw Williams play. Along with \n     these tots and second-honeymooners, there were Harvard \n     freshmen, giving off that peculiar nervous glow created when \n     a quantity of insouciance is saturated with insecurity; \n     thick-necked Army officers with brass on their shoulders and \n     lead in their voices; pepperings of priests; perfumed \n     bouquets of Roxbury Fabian fans; shiny salesmen from \n     Albany and Fall River; and those gray, hoarse men--\n     taxidrivers, slaughterers, and bartenders who will \n     continue to click through the turnstiles long after \n     everyone else has deserted to television and tramporamas. \n     Behind me, two young male voices blossomed, cracking a \n     joke about God's five proofs that Thomas Aquinas exists--\n     typical Boston College levity.\n       The batting cage was trundled away. The Orioles fluttered \n     to the sidelines. Diagonally across the field, by the Red Sox \n     dugout, a cluster of men in overcoats were festering like \n     maggots. I could see a splinter of white uniform, and \n     Williams' head, held at a self-deprecating and evasive tilt. \n     Williams' conversational stance is that of a six-foot-three-\n     inch man under a six-foot ceiling. He moved away to the \n     patter of flash bulbs, and began playing catch with a young \n     Negro outfielder named Willie Tasby. His arm, never very \n     powerful, had grown lax with the years, and his throwing \n     motion was a kind of muscular drawl. To catch the ball, he \n     flicked his glove hand onto his left shoulder (he batted left \n     but threw right, as every schoolboy ought to know) and let \n     the ball plop into it comically. This catch session with \n     Tasby was the only time all afternoon I saw him grin.\n       A tight little flock of human sparrows who, from the \n     lambent and pampered pink of their faces, could only have \n     been Boston politicians moved toward the plate. The \n     loudspeakers mammothly coughed as someone huffed on the \n     microphone. The ceremonies began. Curt Gowdy, the Red Sox \n     radio and television announcer, who sounds like everybody's \n     brother-in-law, delivered a brief sermon, taking the two \n     words ``pride'' and ``champion'' as his text. It began, \n     ``Twenty-one years ago, a skinny kid from San Diego, \n     California . . .'' and ended, ``I don't think we'll ever see \n     another like him.'' Robert Tibolt, chairman of the board of \n     the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, presented Williams \n     with a big Paul Revere silver bowl. Harry Carlson, a member \n     of the sports committee of the Boston Chamber, gave him a \n     plaque, whose inscription he did not read in its entirety, \n     out of deference to Williams' distaste for this sort of fuss. \n     Mayor Collins presented the Jimmy Fund with a thousand-dollar \n     check.\n       Then the occasion himself stooped to the microphone, and \n     his voice sounded, after the others, very Californian; it \n     seemed to be coming, excellently amplified, from a great \n     distance, adolescently young and as smooth as a butternut. \n     His thanks for the gifts had not died from our ears before he \n     glided, as if helplessly, into ``In spite of all the terrible \n     things that have been said about me by the maestros of the \n     keyboard up there . . .'' He glanced up at the press rows \n     suspended above home plate. (All the Boston reporters, \n     incidentally, reported the phrase as ``knights of the \n     keyboard,'' but I heard it as ``maestros'' and prefer it that \n     way.) The crowd tittered, appalled. A frightful vision \n     flashed upon me, of the press gallery pelting Williams with \n     erasers, of Williams clambering up the foul screen to slug \n     journalists, of a riot, of Mayor Collins being crushed. ``. . \n     . And they were terrible things,'' Williams insisted, with \n     level melancholy, into the mike. ``I'd like to forget them, \n     but I can't.'' He paused, swallowed his memories, and went \n     on, ``I want to say that my years in Boston have been the \n     greatest thing in my life.'' The crowd, like an immense sail \n     going limp in a change of wind, sighed with relief. Taking \n     all the parts himself, Williams then acted out a vivacious \n     little morality drama in which an imaginary tempter came to \n     him at the beginning of his career and said, ``Ted, you can \n     play anywhere you like.'' Leaping nimbly into the role of his \n     younger self (who in biographical actuality had yearned to be \n     a Yankee), Williams gallantly chose Boston over all the other \n     cities, and told us that Tom Yawkey was the greatest owner in \n     baseball and we were the greatest fans. We applauded \n     ourselves heartily. The umpire came out and dusted the plate. \n     The voice of doom announced over the loudspeakers that after \n     Williams' retirement his uniform number, 9, would be \n     permanently retired--the first time the Red Sox had so \n     honored a player. We cheered. The national anthem was played. \n     We cheered. The game began.\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n       Williams was third in the batting order, so he came up in \n     the bottom of the first inning, and Steve Barber, a young \n     pitcher who was not yet born when Williams began playing for \n     the Red Sox, offered him four pitches, at all of which he \n     disdained to swing, since none of them were within the strike \n     zone. This demonstrated simultaneously that Williams' eyes \n     were razor-sharp and that Barber's control wasn't. Shortly, \n     the bases were full, with Williams on second. ``Oh, I hope he \n     gets held up at third! That would be wonderful,'' the girl \n     beside me moaned, and, sure enough, the man at bat walked and \n     Williams was delivered into our foreground. He struck the \n     pose of Donatello's David, the third-base bag being Goliath's \n     head. Fiddling with his cap, swapping small talk with the \n     Oriole third baseman (who seemed delighted to have him drop \n     in), swinging his arms with a sort of prancing nervousness, \n     he looked fine--flexible, hard, and not unbecomingly \n     substantial through the middle. The long neck, the small \n     head, the knickers whose cuffs were worn down near his \n     ankles--all these points, often observed by caricaturists, \n     were visible in the flesh.\n       One of the collegiate voices behind me said, ``He looks \n     old, doesn't he, old; big deep wrinkles in his face . . .''\n       ``Yeah,'' the other voice said, ``but he looks like an old \n     hawk, doesn't he?''\n       With each pitch, Williams danced down the baseline, waving \n     his arms and stirring dust, ponderous but menacing, like an \n     attacking goose. It occurred to about a dozen humorists at \n     once to shout ``Steal home! Go, go!'' Williams' speed afoot \n     was never legendary. Lou Clinton, a young Sox outfielder, hit \n     a fairly deep fly to center field. Williams tagged up and ran \n     home. As he slid across the plate, the ball, thrown with \n     unusual heft by Jackie Brandt, the Oriole center fielder, hit \n     him on the back.\n       ``Boy, he was really loafing, wasn't he?'' one of the boys \n     behind me said.\n       ``It's cold,'' the other explained. ``He doesn't play well \n     when it's cold. He likes heat. He's a hedonist.''\n       The run that Williams scored was the second and last of the \n     inning. Gus Triandos, of the Orioles, quickly evened the \n     score by plunking a home run over the handy left-field wall. \n     Williams, who had had this wall at his back for twenty years, \n     played the ball flawlessly. He didn't budge. He just stood \n     there, in the center of the little patch of grass that his \n     patient footsteps had worn brown, and, limp with lack of \n     interest, watched the ball pass overhead. It was not a very \n     interesting game. Mike Higgins, the Red Sox manager, with \n     nothing to lose, had restricted his major-league players to \n     the left-field line--along with Williams, Frank Malzone, a \n     first-rate third baseman, played the game--and had peopled \n     the rest of the terrain with unpredictable youngsters fresh, \n     or not so fresh, off the farms. Other than Williams' \n     recurrent appearances at the plate, the maladresse of the Sox \n     infield was the sole focus of suspense; the second baseman \n     turned every grounder into a juggling act, while the \n     shortstop did a breathtaking impersonation of an open \n     window. With this sort of assistance, the Orioles wheedled \n     their way into a 4-2 lead. They had early replaced Barber \n     with another young pitcher, Jack Fisher. Fortunately (as \n     it turned out), Fisher is no cutie; he is willing to burn \n     the ball through the strike zone, and inning after inning \n     this tactic punctured Higgins' string of test balloons.\n       Whenever Williams appeared at the plate--pounding the dirt \n     from his cleats, gouging a pit in the batter's box with his \n     left foot, wringing resin out of the bat handle with his \n     vehement grip, switching the stick at the pitcher with an \n     electric ferocity--it was like having a familiar Leonardo \n     appear in a shuffle of Saturday Evening Post covers. This \n     man, you realized--and here, perhaps, was the difference, \n     greater than the difference in gifts--really intended to hit \n     the ball. In the third inning, he hoisted a high fly to deep \n     center. In the fifth, we thought he had it; he smacked the \n     ball hard and high into the heart of his power zone, but the \n     deep right field in Fenway and the heavy air and a casual \n     east wind defeated him. The ball died. Al Pilarcik leaned his \n     back against the big ``380'' painted on the right-field wall \n     and caught it. On another day, in another park, it would have \n     been gone. (After the game, Williams said, ``I didn't think I \n     could hit one any harder than that. The conditions weren't \n     good.'')\n       The afternoon grew so glowering that in the sixth inning \n     the arc lights were turned on--always a wan sight in the \n     daytime, like the burning headlights of a funeral procession. \n     Aided by the gloom, Fisher was slicing through the Sox \n     rookies, and Williams did not come to bat in the seventh. He \n     was second up in the eighth. This was almost certainly his \n     last time to come to the plate in Fenway Park, and instead of \n     merely cheering, as we had at his three previous appearances, \n     we stood, all of us--stood and applauded. Have you ever heard \n     applause in a ballpark? Just applause--no calling, no \n     whistling, just an ocean of handclaps, minute after minute, \n     burst after burst, crowding and running together in \n     continuous succession like the pushes of surf at the edge of \n     the sand. It was a sombre and considered tumult. There was \n     not a boo in it. It seemed to renew itself out of a shifting \n     set of memories as the kid, the Marine, the veteran of feuds \n     and failures and injuries, the friend of children, and the \n     enduring old pro evolved down the bright tunnel of twenty-one \n     summers toward this moment. At last, the umpire signalled for \n     Fisher to pitch; with the other players, he had been frozen \n     in position. Only Williams had moved during the ovation, \n     switching his hat impatiently, ignoring everything except his \n     cherished task. Fisher wound up, and the applause sank into a \n     hush.\n       Understand that we were a crowd of rational people. We knew \n     that a home run cannot be produced at will; the right pitch \n     must be perfectly met and luck must ride with the ball. Three \n     innings before, we had seen a brave effort fail. The air was \n     soggy; the season was exhausted. Nevertheless, there will \n     always lurk, around a corner in a pocket of our knowledge of \n     the odds, an indefensible hope, and this was one of the \n     times, which you now and then find in sports, when a density \n     of expectation hangs in the air and plucks an event out of \n     the future.\n       Fisher, after his unsettling wait, was wide with the first \n     pitch. He put the second one over, and Williams swung \n     mightily and missed. The crowd grunted, seeing that classic \n     swing, so long and smooth and quick, exposed, naked in its \n     failure. Fisher threw the third time, Williams swung again, \n     and there it was. The ball climbed on a diagonal line into \n     the vast volume of air over center field. From my angle, \n     behind third base, the ball seemed less an object in flight \n     than the tip of a towering, motionless construct, like the \n     Eiffel Tower or the Tappan Zee Bridge. It was in the books \n     while it was still in the sky. Brandt ran back to the deepest \n     corner of the outfield grass; the ball descended beyond his \n     reach and struck in the crotch where the bullpen met the \n     wall, bounced chunkily, and, as far as I could see, vanished.\n       Like a feather caught in a vortex, Williams ran around the \n     square of bases at the center of our beseeching screaming. He \n     ran as he always ran out home runs--hurriedly, unsmiling, \n     head down, as if our praise were a storm of rain to get out \n     of. He didn't tip his cap. Though we thumped, wept, and \n     chanted ``We want Ted'' for minutes after he hid in the \n     dugout, he did not come back. Our noise for some seconds \n     passed beyond excitement into a kind of immense open anguish, \n     a wailing, a cry to be saved. But immortality is \n     nontransferable. The papers said that the other players, and \n     even the umpires on the field, begged him to come out and \n     acknowledge us in some way, but he never had and did not now. \n     Gods do not answer letters.\n       Every true story has an anticlimax. The men on the field \n     refused to disappear, as would have seemed decent, in the \n     smoke of Williams' miracle. Fisher continued to pitch, and \n     escaped further harm. At the end of the inning, Higgins sent \n     Williams out to his leftfield position, then instantly \n     replaced him with Carrol Hardy, so we had a long last look at \n     Williams as he ran out there and then back, his uniform \n     jogging, his eyes steadfast on the ground. It was nice, and \n     we were grateful, but it left a funny taste.\n       One of the scholasticists behind me said, ``Let's go. We've \n     seen everything. I don't want to spoil it.'' This seemed a \n     sound aesthetic decision. Williams' last word had been so \n     exquisitely chosen, such a perfect fusion of expectation, \n     intention, and execution, that already it felt a little \n     unreal in my head, and I wanted to get out before the castle \n     collapsed. But the game, though played by clumsy midgets \n     under the feeble glow of the arc lights, began to tug at my \n     attention, and I loitered in the runway until it was over. \n     Williams' homer had, quite incidentally, made the score 4-3. \n     In the bottom of the ninth inning, with one out, Marlin \n     Coughtry, the second-base juggler, singled. Vic Wertz, \n     pinchhitting, doubled off the left-field wall, Coughtry \n     advancing to third. Pumpsie Green walked, to load the bases. \n     Willie Tasby hit a double-play ball to the third baseman, but \n     in making the pivot throw Billy Klaus, an ex-Red Sox \n     infielder, reverted to form and threw the ball past the first \n     baseman and into the Red Sox dugout. The Sox won, 5-4. On the \n     car radio as I drove home I heard that Williams had decided \n     not to accompany the team to New York. So he knew how to do \n     even that, the hardest thing. Quit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7612-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7612-S7613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FLIGHT NETWORK\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to honor \nan exceptional program in Alabama.\n  For many young men and women, their experiences during World War II \nwere a profound time in their lives. This Nation owes a debt of \ngratitude for the sacrifices of those Americans who left their families \nand lives behind to go ``fight the good fight''.\n  The Honor Flight Network was established to honor the remaining WWII \nveterans and provide them a trip to the WWII Memorial in Washington, DC \nwhich was built in their honor.\n  The Honor Flight Tennessee Valley program, which also serves northern \nAlabama, began in the summer of 2006 and flew 14 WWII veterans on their \nfirst flight on April 4, 2007. Their final mission was on September \n11th, 2010. In this time, Honor Flight Tennessee Valley has flown over \n1,300 WWII veterans to Washington, DC. This could not have been \naccomplished without the leadership and outstanding efforts of the \npresident and founder of Honor Flight Tennessee Valley, Joe Fitzgerald. \nHis organizational skills and\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nability to put a plan together were essential to the overall success of \nthe program. Joe put a special emphasis on honoring the veterans who \ndied before they were able to make the trip to DC.\n  I am thankful that these revered veterans were able to come to our \nNation's Capital to be recognized and remembered for their individual \nsacrifices. Among the most important of the historic sites they visited \nwas the new World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million veterans \nwho served in the Armed Forces of the United States, the more than \n400,000 of our finest Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our \nNation, and all who supported the war effort from home.\n  I have met many Honor Flight groups from all over Alabama at the WWII \nMemorial. Without exception, they are men and women of character and \npositive spirit who love their country and thoroughly enjoy the visit. \nThey also have not asked for recognition but are humbled and thankful \nfor this honor. Visiting these veterans is one of the most enjoyable \nthings I get to do as a Senator.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues and the State of Alabama, I thank \nthese veterans for their service to the United States of America and am \nproud of the work Honor Flight Tennessee Valley and the Honor Flight \nNetwork have done for our WWII Veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7613-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT WINCHESTER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to mark the retirement \nof Robert Winchester after 35 years in government service. Throughout \nthis time, Bob has been both the consummate professional and a friendly \npresence in the Halls here on Capitol Hill.\n  Mr. Winchester had a varied and distinguished career, having worked \nin different positions and capacities for the Department of Justice, \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Army. For most of that time, \nBob worked in the intelligence field where efforts and successes are \nnot always rewarded publicly. I am glad we can do so here today.\n  Mr. Winchester graduated in 1967 from the University of Paris, La \nSorbonne, and from Kings College in 1968. From 1969 until 1971, he \nserved in the U.S. Army as an intelligence analyst and was stationed in \nVietnam. After being honorably discharged as a staff sergeant, he \ncontinued his education at Illinois State University earning a master's \ndegree. He then returned to Europe to receive a master's of advanced \nEuropean studies with honors in 1974 from the College of Europe in \nBruges, Belgium.\n  Continuing his already impressive academic achievements, Mr. \nWinchester received his juris doctorate from Temple University School \nof Law. He served as a judge advocate general captain in the U.S. Army \nReserves for 13 years. He is a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. Winchester worked for 7 years at the Central Intelligence Agency \nin operational law and legislative liaison positions, and also served \nas an assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice in \nPennsylvania.\n  During the last 25 years, Bob has served as legislative counsel to \nthe Secretary of the Army and the Army leadership, the Army G-2, the \ncommanding generals of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence \nat Fort Huachuca, and the Intelligence and Security Command.\n  Since 1984, Mr. Winchester served as the special assistant for \nlegislative affairs for the U.S. Army's Office of the Chief, \nlegislative liaison and served as the Army's principal liaison to the \nCongress for all Army intelligence programs and policies. It was in \nthis role that Mr. Winchester became a fixture in matters involving \nArmy intelligence on Capitol Hill. For over two decades, the Members \nand staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence knew that they \ncould turn to Mr. Winchester with a request and he would respond not \njust in a timely and professional manner, but also with insight and \nenthusiasm. He was able not only to represent the views and policies of \nthe U.S. Army, but also to ensure that Congress had the information it \nrequested to conduct effective congressional oversight. He made this \ndifficult job look easy.\n  Mr. Winchester has earned his retirement many times over, but we \nstill hope that he reconsiders and returns to serve his country once \nagain.\n  Mr. Winchester, thank you for your service and good luck in all your \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7613-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RUSTY TOUPAL\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to restore the application of the 340B drug discount \nprogram to orphan drugs with respect to children's hospitals; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \nto speak about a bill that I am introducing today along with several of \nmy Senate colleagues. My bill protects the lives of the most vulnerable \namong us our Nation's children by ensuring children's hospitals across \nthe country are able to purchase orphan drugs at a discount.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues: Senators Snow, Bennett, \nCorker, Collins, Voinovich, Alexander, and Chambliss today, to stand \ntogether to provide for and protect the ability of children's hospitals \nto access medicines for their patients at a reduced price.\n  As my colleagues are aware, access to orphan drugs are critically \nimportant to children, many of whom, if they are ill, suffer from rare \ndisease or conditions. Orphan drugs, by definition, are designed and \ndeveloped to help and treat diseases or conditions that affect fewer \nthan 200,000 people, many of whom are children. On a daily basis, the \nChildren's Hospital of Boston uses most of the 347 medicines that are \ndesignated orphan drugs.\n  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today restores and \nprotects the ability for children's hospitals to access those \noutpatient medicines through the 340B drug discount program authorized \nin the Public Health Services Act. Access to this program and the \ncorresponding discount saves the Children's Hospital of Boston nearly \n$3 million annually, but more importantly, Children's Hospital of \nBoston is able to save lives as a result. Hospitals and doctors at \nchildren's hospitals are able to access life-saving medicines, children \nlive better lives, and families are given a piece of mind.\n  Passing this bill quickly is the right thing to do and I encourage \nthe Senate to act swiftly to enact my legislation to ensure that \nchildren's hospitals can once again receive discounted pricing on these \nlife-saving medicines.\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  There is no cause for delay. The House has passed this restorative \nlanguage twice already. The Senate needs to do the same.\n  I believe quick passage is possible quick passage should be possible \nbecause of the support and efforts that I have seen demonstrated by my \nfellow Senators.\n  Senator Sherrod Brown has been a thoughtful leader on this issue and \nI respect and admire him for his work. Because of his leadership and \nperseverance, he was able to secure the support of sixteen Democratic \nSenators in favor of this legislation, all of whom signed a letter to \nthe Majority Leader, expressing their support to restore access to this \nvery important program.\n  I am hopeful that Senator Sherrod Brown and I can continue to work \nacross party lines and with all of our colleagues to reach agreement \nand find resolution on this.\n  My door is always open to my colleagues who are willing to work \ntogether to solve common problems. In this instance, our Nation's \nchildren deserve that we come together and protect their access to \nmedicines that will save their lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 11\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONTINUED INCLUSION OF ORPHAN DRUGS IN DEFINITION \n                   OF COVERED OUTPATIENT DRUGS WITH RESPECT TO \n                   CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS UNDER THE 340B DRUG \n                   DISCOUNT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Amendment.--Subsection (e) of section 340B of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 256b) is amended by \n     striking ``covered entities described in subparagraph (M)'' \n     and inserting ``covered entities described in subparagraph \n     (M) (other than a children's hospital described in \n     subparagraph (M))''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of section \n     2302 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of \n     2010 (Public Law 111-152).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: We are writing to ask that a \n     technical correction to Section 2302 of the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) be provided at the \n     earliest opportunity. The Section exempted orphan drugs from \n     required discounts for newly eligible entities added to the \n     340B statute under the Act. PPS-exempt children's hospitals \n     were included among these entities, when in fact they were \n     already eligible for and participating in the 340B program.\n       Since the HCERA provision was effective upon enactment, it \n     is imperative that a retroactive correction be made as soon \n     as possible. Both the House and Senate have included this \n     correction in various pieces of legislation, but none of \n     these bills have been signed into law. We thank you for your \n     efforts to date to fix this problem and respectfully ask for \n     your continued help in ensuring another legislative vehicle \n     for the prompt passage of a technical correction restoring \n     the children's hospitals' ability to fully participate in the \n     340B drug discount program.\n       Children's hospitals use on a daily basis most of the 347 \n     drugs that have received orphan drug status. The hospitals \n     participating in the 340B drug discount program have achieved \n     significant savings. They estimate that those savings would \n     be reduced dramatically with the orphan drug exemption. If \n     the exemption is not corrected, the children's hospitals will \n     have to pay wholesale prices for these drugs or leave the \n     340B program.\n       We would appreciate your continued support to ensure that \n     children's hospitals do not lose the critical benefit \n     provided by the 340B program.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sherrod Brown; John F. Kerry; Joseph I. Lieberman; ------\n           ; Al Franken; Amy Klobuchar; Mary L. Landrieu; Debbie \n           Stabenow; Maria Cantwell; Kirsten E. Gillibrand; \n           Christopher J. Dodd; Robert P. Casey, Jr.; Carl Levin; \n           Dianne Feinstein; Herb Kohl; Arlen Specter; Barbara \n           Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Children's Hospital Boston,\n\n                                      Boston, MA, August 24, 2010.\n     Senator Scott Brown,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: We write with urgency to request your \n     leadership on a pressing issue facing Children's Hospital \n     Boston. An unintentional error in the Health Care Education \n     and Reconciliation Act (HCERA) is threatening children's \n     hospitals access to discounts on orphan drugs through the \n     drug discount program authorized under section 340B of the \n     Public Health Service Act.\n       The 340B program allows a number of safety net providers to \n     purchase outpatient pharmaceuticals at discounted rates, \n     thereby expanding access to care to low income and vulnerable \n     populations. The program saves Children's Hospital Boston \n     between $1.5 and $3 million annually and is of no cost to the \n     government. Participation in this program has made it \n     possible for the hospital to control costs in a challenging \n     environment and ensure patient access to outpatient drugs, \n     such as Botox (used to reduce spasticity in patients with \n     cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders) and \n     Rituximab (used to treat non-Hodgkins lymphoma and to \n     alleviate the effects of severe juvenile arthritis).\n       Children's hospitals were included in the 340B program \n     through an amendment to Medicaid in the Deficit Reduction Act \n     of 2005. Federal guidance enabling them to enroll in the \n     program was finally published in September 2009, and 25 \n     children hospitals, including Children's Hospital Boston, are \n     now participating. The Patient Protection & Affordable Care \n     Act (PPACA) added some new types of hospitals as eligible \n     entities to the 340B statute and also included the children's \n     hospitals so that they would be subject to same regulatory \n     requirements as other eligible providers. When HCERA amended \n     the PPACA with a last minute provision exempting orphan drugs \n     from discounts received by all of the newly eligible \n     providers, children's hospitals were unfortunately included, \n     even though they were already eligible for and participating \n     in the 34013 program.\n       Without a technical correction restoring 340B discounts for \n     orphan drugs, Children's Hospital Boston is facing the loss \n     of most of its savings from the 340B program and the choice \n     of either leaving the program or paying wholesale prices for \n     orphan drugs. Orphan drugs, i.e. drugs developed to treat a \n     disease that afflicts relatively few, are widely used in \n     children's hospitals, given their role in caring for the \n     sickest children with the most complex health care needs. In \n     addition, orphan drugs may also be used more widely in \n     treating other diseases or conditions. Indeed, Children's \n     Hospital Boston currently uses most of the 347 drugs with \n     orphan drug status on a daily basis.\n       The Massachusetts Biotechnology Council (MassBio), which \n     represents more than 600 biotechnology companies, \n     universities and academic institutions dedicated to advancing \n     cutting edge research, urges a correction to this problem. As \n     you likely know, the focus of MassBio is to foster an \n     environment in the state where biotechnology companies can \n     succeed. For MassBio, as well as the member companies, true \n     success means that research and development leads to \n     treatments that reach the most vulnerable patients in our \n     state. As such, it is critical that institutions like \n     Children's Hospital Boston have ready access to the \n     pharmaceuticals they need to treat seriously ill children.\n       As the months pass and denials of discounts for orphan \n     drugs begin, we are gravely concerned about the cost impact \n     of this mistake on Children's Hospital Boston. The hospital \n     employs more than 8,000 people, treats thousands of very sick \n     children annually and is the safety-net provider for \n     Massachusetts children. Children's has worked diligently in \n     coordination with insurers and others in the industry to \n     reduce health care costs and improve efficiency.\n       Without immediate legislative action, Children's Hospital \n     Boston will be forced to withdraw from this cost saving, \n     health care enhancing program. As leaders in the \n     Massachusetts health care industry and partners in improving \n     community health, we ask you to take a leadership role in the \n     correction of the issue. Corrective language was included in \n     the two tax extenders bills that passed in the House. \n     However, the language, while uncontroversial, has not been \n     included in any legislation that has passed the Senate.\n       We hope that you will agree to serve as an original \n     cosponsor of the legislation drafted by Senator Sherrod Brown \n     (attached) and contact the Majority and Minority leadership \n     in the Senate to insist that this issue not be tied up in \n     politics.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Mandell, MD,\n       CEO, Children's Hospital Boston.\n     Robert K. Coughlin,\n       President & CEO, MassBio.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Burris, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 3849. A bill to extend the Emergency Contingency Fund for State \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support \nextending a critically needed program that provides hope to 250,000 of \nour poorest families.\n  I am joined by Senators Durbin, Casey, Sherrod Brown, Bingaman, \nBurris, Harkin, Leahy, Boxer, Menendez, Reed and Dodd in offering the \nJob\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nPreservation for Parents in Poverty Act, which simply provides a 3-\nmonth extension of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, \nEmergency Contingency Fund. The $500 million in funding needed to pay \nfor this extension is offset with corresponding reductions to the \nregular TANF Contingency Fund in fiscal year 2012.\n  We have suffered through the worst recession since the great \ndepression. Just this month, the Census Bureau reported that nearly 44 \nmillion Americans--1 in 7--lived in poverty last year. This represents \nthe largest number of Americans living in poverty since the Census \nBureau began keeping these statistics 51 years ago.\n  The TANF Emergency Fund was created as part of the Recovery Act \nenacted last year to provide temporary, targeted, emergency spending \nthat combats the recession by helping to create jobs for our poorest \nfamilies. It gave States funds to subsidize jobs for low-income parents \nand older youth and to provide basic cash assistance and short-term \nbenefits to the increasing numbers of poor families with children. It \naddresses the emergency needs of low-income families that are \nstruggling in the recession.\n  At least 36 States have used TANF Emergency Contingency Funds to \ncreate or expand subsidized employment programs. States have used this \nfund to create subsidized jobs in the private and public sectors during \nthe depth of the recession. By the time it expires at the end of \nSeptember, the fund will have created approximately 250,000 jobs for \nlow-income Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. Nearly all of \nthese jobs will be eliminated if the program is not extended with \nadditional funds.\n  If this worthy program is allowed to end on Thursday, these States \nwill no longer be able to use the TANF Emergency Fund to subsidize \nemployment and provide basic cash assistance to struggling families to \nhelp with housing and heating bills, domestic violence services, and \ntransportation costs. This will hurt our economy because families on \nTANF have to spend nearly all of the money they receive to meet their \nbasic needs. This will reduce demand for the goods and services, \nparticularly in low-income communities.\n  Massachusetts relies on the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund to \nmaintain the key existing safety net programs for cash assistance, \nemergency housing, rental vouchers, employment and training services, \nchild care, and other initiatives to support low-income families \ngetting back to work.\n  In Massachusetts, the Emergency Fund is used to provide TANF cash \nassistance to more than 50,000 low-income families in the Bay State \neach month. To qualify for this assistance, a family of three must have \nincome less than $1,069 a month. Let me repeat that. To qualify for \nthis assistance a family of three must have income of less than $1,069 \na month. The maximum cash grant they can receive from the state is just \n$578 a month. Massachusetts also uses the fund to provide emergency \nshelter and related services to 3,000 homeless families.\n  An extension of the TANF Emergency Fund would provide Massachusetts \nwith federal assistance to accommodate the 10 percent TANF caseload \nincrease we have experienced since the start of the recession. It would \nenable the State to preserve and maintain critical services for our \npoorest citizens during these difficult economic times.\n  If Congress does not immediately act, tens of thousands of jobs will \nbe lost. Businesses will lose access to critical employment support \nprograms, and the lives of our poorest families will be made even more \ndifficult.\n  Extending the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund is a common-sense \npolicy that enjoys broad support from public officials, private \nexperts, and bipartisan organizations, including: Mark Zandi, Chief \nEconomist at Moody's Analytics; the National Governors Association; the \nNational Conference of State Legislators; the American Public Human \nServices Association; and the National Association of State TANF \nAdministrators. I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a piece of \nlegislation just introduced, S. 3849, the Job Preservation for Parents \nin Poverty Act, which is simply an extension of a program that has \nplaced tens of thousands of people into jobs in this recession and is \nworking. We want to make sure it is extended because of how effective \nit has been to help people find and keep jobs. This legislation is \nfully offset. I wish to spend a couple minutes talking about the \nprovisions that make it so effective.\n  First, I thank a number of Senators who have led the fight--Senator \nKerry, as well as our assistant majority leader, Senator Durbin, for \nthe work they have done, as well as others--and for the testimony we \nreceived from people across the country. I know in my case one person \nwho spent a good deal of time making it clear to me and to others \nacross southern Pennsylvania and even across the State about the \neffectiveness of this program was Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia who, \nlike any mayor in the country in the middle of a recession, doesn't \nhave the luxury of dealing with programs that don't work. He can only \nsupport and endorse programs that are working to create jobs. In a city \nsuch as Philadelphia, which still has a high unemployment rate, Mayor \nNutter has relied upon this program, which is a rapid attachment effort \nto create jobs and keep people in those jobs.\n  We know the unemployment rates are intolerably too high. In our State \nwe have 585,000 people out of work, just about 9.5 percent \nunemployment. Our poverty figures are going through the roof at the \nsame time. We are seeing, in short, the real impact of this horrific \nrecession.\n  One of the best ways to deal with that crisis is to have an extension \nof an important program that we refer to in Pennsylvania as the \nPennsylvania Way to Work Program. It is helping keep people out of \npoverty and providing people with jobs; in this case, 12,000 people in \nPennsylvania. I could go down the list of other States as well, but I \nwon't. In our State, 12,864 adults have been helped by this program as \nwell as summer youth, more than 7,800, for a total of 20,718.\n  It is fully offset. If we don't extend it, in many, if not most, \nStates, these programs will be shut down. It is working. It is not only \ncreating jobs, it is keeping people out of poverty because they are \nworking. I would think everyone would want to support programs that are \nworking and keeping people out of poverty.\n  It is critically important that we extend the program. I am grateful \nfor the help our assistant majority leader, Senator Durbin, has \nprovided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania for speaking out for this important program. I know \nthere are many jobs in his State which are at stake with this decision \nby the Senate. There are some 26,000 jobs in Illinois that hinge on a \ndecision made by the Senate as to whether we extend this program. What \nwe are discussing this afternoon gets down to the heart of the \nquestion: Will we do everything in our power to help Americans find \nwork, particularly those who have struggled so hard in the past? Will \nwe give them a chance to continue working in many instances or to find \nwork? It is an important choice.\n  Here we have a stark example of this choice in the fate of a program \ncalled the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund. In my State, we call this \nprogram Put Illinois to Work. It helps States subsidize the cost of \nhiring workers in mostly private sector jobs.\n  This small program has had a huge impact in Illinois. Nearly 250,000 \njobs have been created in 37 States. It is a program that everyone of \nboth political parties should support. Rather than paying people to do \nnothing, this program helps private companies hire the employees they \nneed but can't quite afford. Yet Republicans, at least to this point, \nare saying we should not extend this program past this Thursday. The \nend of this program in my State means the loss of thousands of jobs. I \nthink the only reason there is opposition to this is the fact that it \nwas originally conceived and offered to the Senate in the President's \nRecovery Act.\n  Though many on the other side of the aisle have taken a party-line \nposition\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\nthat they will oppose that act no matter what it did is unfortunate, \nparticularly for people who are just trying to find a way to survive in \na very tough economy. Many of them earn $10 an hour. These are not jobs \non which one could get rich. They can survive on these jobs. We are \ntrying to make sure these people have an opportunity to survive. This \nis a stimulus that works. Who would argue with the concept or premise \nthat putting people to work is a lot better than paying them to do \nnothing?\n  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has a simple bill that would \nextend the jobs program by 3 months, but it is fully paid for by \nreducing the TANF program's future budget. The argument that it adds to \nthe deficit does not work. It doesn't add to the deficit. It is paid \nfor by future budgetary commitments. I am afraid that still we will \nfind an objection from the other side of the aisle. They have objected \nto continuing this program on the continuing resolution which more or \nless keeps government in business while we are in recess.\n  Mr. President, 26,000 jobs are at stake in Illinois, and losing that \nmany jobs would hurt my State. We already have an unemployment rate of \nover 10 percent. Governor Pat Quinn is trying to figure out how to save \nsome of these jobs, but it is difficult with the budgetary problems we \nface in the State capital. It is not just Illinois that would suffer; \n110,000 jobs would be lost in States represented by Republican \nSenators: 40,000 in Texas, which is represented by two Republican \nSenators; 20,000 in Georgia, represented by two Republican Senators; \n10,000 in Kentucky, 10,000 people who will lose work this week in \nKentucky represented by the minority leader. It is unfortunate that we \nhave allowed some of these ideological positions to get in the way. It \nmakes no difference that over 110,000 constituents represented by those \non the other side of the aisle will be impacted by this objection.\n  I am afraid at this point some of our partisan differences are going \nto cost a lot of innocent people a chance to bring home a paycheck. I \ndon't think that is what the American people want in Washington. I \nthink what they are looking for us to do is to extend this program and \nsave a quarter million Americans from losing their jobs.\n  I don't know if Senator Kerry is coming to the Senate floor, but I \nsee some Members on the Republican side of the aisle. I will make the \nunanimous consent request at this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 3849, the Job Preservation for Parents in \nPoverty Act; that the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that \nthe bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, the majority has known this program was going to expire at the \nend of this month all year and has taken no steps to reauthorize this \nimportant social safety net program. We are also in the position of \nhaving to pass an extension of TANF. I am not sure the Senator from \nIllinois is aware that the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee have put together a bipartisan 1-year extension of TANF. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 3850. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to clarify \nthe jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to \ncertain sporting good articles, and to exempt those articles from a \ndefinition under that Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill protect the great American traditions of hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational shooting from actions that will drive up the costs of \nparticipation and directly impact employment across the country. \nRecently, extremist groups have filed a petition with the U.S. EPA to \nprohibit the use of lead in the manufacturing of ammunition and fishing \ntackle. This effort would not only drive up the cost of ammunition and \nfishing tackle, but would, as a direct result, drive down the number of \npeople able to participate in these activities and directly hurt the \nmillions of Americans who depend on the hunting, fishing, and shooting \nindustries for part of their livelihoods.\n  Hunters and anglers are ardent conservationists and have proven \nthemselves willing to consider lead alternatives when the data \njustifies it. For instance, since 1991, waterfowl hunters have been \nrequired to use non-lead ammunition to protect waterfowl species which \nhave been scientifically proven to be vulnerable to exposure. However, \nEPA found in 1994 no scientific basis to proceed with a lead ban in \nfishing tackle. EPA rightly and quickly rejected the petition with \nregard to ammunition, stating that they did not have the authority to \nregulate ammunition under the Toxic Substances Control Act.\n  However, EPA is still considering a ban on lead fishing tackle. This \nban would drive up costs on a sport that's appeal lies in its \nsimplicity and accessibility to the broad American public. Lead sinkers \nare critical to both salt and freshwater anglers, and are frequently \nused in the types of fishing that attracts young people to this sport.\n  Moreover, a ban such as this would be a blow to thousands of people \nwho depend on fishing tackle and ammunition manufacturing for their \nlivelihoods. Companies like Remington in Lonoke, Arkansas employ over \n20,000 Arkansans. The 5,500 manufacturers of firearms and ammunition \nand almost one million people working in sport fishing do not need EPA \ntaking aim at their industry.\n  My bill simply clarifies that the components used in manufacturing \nshells, cartridges, and fishing tackle are exempt from EPA regulation \nunder the Toxic Substances Control Act. Taking this simple step will \nprovide certainty to these critical industries and prevent EPA and \nactivist litigators from dragging this issue out through the courts for \nyears.\n  I am confident that the sporting community will continue to work with \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service and State Fish and Wildlife agencies to \naddress issues around lead ammunition where and when the facts warrant \nit. But Congress must act to preserve our hunting and fishing \ntraditions by ensuring access to affordable, vital tools our hunters \nand anglers rely on.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hunting, Fishing and \n     Recreational Shooting Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The purpose of this bill is to promote positive \nmedia depictions of girls and women among our nation's youth.\n  The majority of 8- to 18-year-olds spend about 10 hours a day \nwatching television, on the computer, or playing video games. \nUnfortunately, the images they see often reinforce gender stereotypes, \nemphasize unrealistic body images, or show women in passive roles.\n  Positive and realistic female body images remain a problem. A recent \nsurvey by Girl Scouts of the USA's Research Institute found that 89 \npercent of girls feel the fashion industry places a lot of pressure on \nteenage girls to be thin. Even among girls as young as grades 3 through \n5, fifty-four percent worry about their appearance, and 37 percent of \nthese young girls worry specifically about their weight.\n  Women are often portrayed in passive or stereotypical roles, rather \nthan in positions of power. Violence against women continues to be \nprevalent throughout media. The Parents Television Council reports that \nbetween 2004 and 2009, violence against women and teenage girls \nincreased on television programming at a rate of 120 percent, compared \nwith the 2 percent increase of overall violence in television content.\n  In 2007, the American Psychological Association, APA, conducted a \nreport on the Sexualization of Girls and found that three of the most \ncommon mental health problems among girls--eating disorders, depression \nor depressed mood, and low self-esteem--are linked to the sexualization \nof girls and women in media. Boys are also negatively affected by the \nportrayal of girls because it sets up unrealistic expectations, which \nmay impair future relationships between girls and boys.\n  The bill I'm introducing today starts to tackle this problem by \npromoting positive media messages about girls and women among our \nnation's youth.\n  Specifically, this bill would direct the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, to award grants to nonprofit organizations to \npromote positive media depictions of girls and women among youth, and \nto empower girls and boys by developing self-esteem and leadership \nskills.\n  The bill also directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC, in coordination with the National Institute of Child Health and \nHuman Development to review, synthesize, and research the role and \nimpact of depictions of girls and women in the media on the \npsychological, sexual, physical, and interpersonal development of \nyouth.\n  Finally, this bill requires the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, to convene a National Task Force on Girls and Women in the Media \nin order to develop voluntary steps and goals for promoting healthy and \npositive depictions of girls and women in the media for the benefit of \nall youth.\n  We must reverse this trend for this generation of youth and for \nfuture generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3853. A bill to modernize and refine the requirements of the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act of 1993, to require quarterly \nperformance reviews of Federal policy and management priorities, to \nestablish Chief Operating Officers, Performance Improvement Officers, \nand the Performance Improvement Council, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nFederal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, \nand International Security, I offer a piece of legislation, along with \nmy distinguished colleagues Senators Warner, Akaka, Lieberman, Collins \nand Voinovich, that I believe will lead us on a path to a more \neffective and efficient federal government.\n  It has been more than 17 years since Congress passed the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, GPRA, to help us better manage our finite \nresources and improve the effectiveness and delivery of Federal \nprograms. Since that time, agencies across the federal government have \ndeveloped and implemented strategic plans and have routinely generated \na tremendous amount of performance data. The question is--have Federal \nagencies actually used their performance data to get better results?\n  Producing information does not by itself improve performance and \nexperts from both sides of the aisle agree that the solutions developed \nin 1993 have not worked. The American people deserve--and our fiscal \nchallenges demand--better results.\n  The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 which I offer today aims to assist \nand motivate--Federal agencies to put away the stacks of reports that \nno one reads and actually start to think how we can improve the \neffectiveness, efficiency and transparency of our Government.\n  This legislation represents the many lessons learned over the past 17 \nyears and brings a high level, government wide focus to making our \ngovernment work better for the American people. It builds off the \nimportant strides President Obama's administration has made in this \narea and pushes Federal agencies even further to not only make goals, \nbut to make individuals responsible for meeting them.\n  While the strength of our democracy rests on the ability of our \ngovernment to deliver its promises to the people, we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to be judicious stewards of the resources taxpayers \ninvest in America, and ensure those resources are managed honestly, \ntransparently and effectively. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 also \ncalls on the federal government to identify where we are not performing \nwell so we can make better decisions about where we should and should \nnot be putting our scarce resources.\n  Today we face unparalleled challenges both here and abroad, and these \nrequire a knowledgeable and nimble federal government that can respond \neffectively. With concerns growing over the mounting federal deficit \nand national debt, the American people deserve to know that every \ndollar they send to Washington is being used to its utmost potential. \nPerformance information is an invaluable tool that can ensure just \nthat. If used effectively, it can identify problems, find solutions, \nand develop approaches that improve outcomes and produce results.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to offer new legislation that I \nurge all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Carper, Akaka, Lieberman, Collins, and \nVoinovich as original cosponsors of this bill. The legislation we offer \ntoday, the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of \n2010, is directly aimed at improving operations and quantifying results \nacross the Federal Government.\n  I think most of my colleagues know I am a business guy. In fact, I \nhave spent more time in the business world than in the public sector. I \nhave always tried to apply commonsense business practices to the work \nof government, in my former job as Virginia Governor and now as \nSenator. This is a point I think most of us on both sides of the aisle \nwould acknowledge: If I ran a business or if we ran any business the \nway we run the Federal Government, I would be out of business in short \norder. If we do not change--as we hear the kinds of folks across \nAmerica say: We want to see more efficiency from our Federal \nGovernment--if we do not change, our government might get run out of \nbusiness as well.\n\n  As chair of the Budget Committee Task Force on Government \nPerformance, over the last 18 months I have been looking into how we \nuse data and information to improve government operations. Over the \nlast year, our task force has held a series of hearings, meetings, and \nconversations with public and private sector leaders from every level \nof government to learn more about what works and what does not work. \nHere is what we have learned.\n  At the beginning of every President's administration, it seems an \nentirely new performance agenda is established. The Bush administration \nhad the President's Management Agenda, and the current administration \nhas its own accountable government initiatives. With this frequent \nchange in approach every 4 to 8 years, it is difficult to ensure that \nwe are consistent in the data we collect, use the best tools and \ntechnology to analyze it, and then put the necessary accountability in \nplace to orderly track performance and the basic functions of what \ngovernment does. Let me give you a couple examples.\n  Agencies produce literally thousands of pages of data each year, but \ntoo often we do not use it. We do not use it in Congress. Public \ninterest groups do\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nnot use it. Enormous efforts are put into collecting this data, and \nthen it sits on the shelf. Typically, this performance data is only \nreported once a year, so it is often too late by the time we discover \nwhether we are improving or falling behind.\n  We also do not compare the results of similar programs. Too often, so \nmany of our government functions are siloed by agency or Department and \nrarely is this data analyzed in any kind of crosscutting fashion. We in \nthe task force took a look at this. We looked, for example, at \nworkforce training programs across the Federal Government. We are \ncurrently funding 44 separate Federal programs in 9 different \ndepartments to support workforce training. We all would agree that in a \nchanging world, workforce training is key to America's competitiveness. \nBut 44 programs in 9 different departments without any kind of \ncrosscutting analysis? No business could operate that way. And it is \nnot just workforce training. In food safety--a piece of legislation \nthat we are working on that I and I know the Presiding Officer hope we \npass before the end of the year to put new food safety standards in \nplace--in food safety, we currently fund 17 different entities within 7 \ndifferent departments involved in food safety activities. So how can we \nassess what is working and what is not working?\n  In short, government operates in silos. We report by agency and by \nprogram, but we do not know what we are doing in government in any \nparticular project area or specific policy goal area. We need a better \nsystem that enables us to review the results of each program as a whole \nin terms of how they feed into a policy objective, where we are having \nthe most impact, and, candidly, where we could find some room to cut or \ncurtail.\n  Our Federal performance system also needs to increase the \naccountability of senior agency leadership. In many agencies, the \nperformance planning and reporting is disconnected from the senior \nofficials and not part of the daily operations of the agency. In other \nwords, somebody's got this task, but their functions of performance \naudits and measurements and metrics do not have a direct line of \nreporting to whoever the chief operating officer of the particular \nagency is.\n  I can say that at the State and local level, we have actually made \nsome progress in changing this around. Let me parochially start with \nwhat we did in Virginia. This chart I have in the Chamber is a little \nbit busy, but we created a Virginia Performs Web site. We use this to \ntrack progress we are making in key policy areas that are important to \nVirginians. So whether it is the economy, education--and we set \ncommonsense goals that everyone can agree on across party lines, and \nthen we look at the measurement criteria that lead to that goal. This \nis one of the reasons Virginia has earned the recognition as the best \nmanaged State in the country.\n  It is not just happening in Virginia, though. In Indiana, a different \ntool has been created. It is called the Transparency Portal by GOV \nMitch Daniels. It again tries to bring transparency to the policy \ngoals. Then we can argue about how we get there or how we ought to fund \nhow we get there. But unless we have common agreement on the goal and \nthen see which programs lead to that goal and measure the effectiveness \nof the individual programs, we are not going to get, particularly in \nthese budget-constrained times, the best value for our Federal tax \ndollar.\n  I believe Washington has much to learn from these local and State \nlevel examples in setting goals, holding managers accountable, and \nusing performance metrics in a consistent, user-friendly way. State and \nlocal decisionmakers do not have to wait to look at the results once a \nyear. They do it constantly. That is what we did in Virginia. That is \nwhat we need to do in our Nation's Capital as well.\n  In addition to this reporting and crosscutting, we also need to \nrecognize that not all of these burdensome reporting requirements are \nof equal value. So the task force has focused on reducing reporting \nrequirements to identify what reporting might be consolidated or \neliminated. If you get overwhelmed with data at certain points, the \ndata becomes somewhat less useful. So we want to focus these agencies \non what are the key determinants on which they ought to report. I do \nnot want to just add new reports and data requirements on agencies. \nThere are bookshelves all over this town sagging from the weight of \nunread reports. So we must streamline and modernize what we are \ncurrently doing, and we need to examine outdated and overlapping agency \nreporting. We should only collect information that is useful.\n  The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act addresses \nmany of our findings to improve the operations and results across \ngovernment.\n  First, it will require all agencies to produce real-time data on \nresults. As I mentioned earlier, in the past, agencies would report on \nperformance only once a year. This bill would require agencies to post \nresults quarterly so the public and Congress can use that real-time \ninformation about what works on targeted goals. With today's technology \nand if you are collecting data on an ongoing basis, there is no reason \nwe should have this information only come out once a year. A quarterly \nrequirement will allow us to correct and fine-tune on an ongoing basis.\n  Second, the bill requires agencies to post data on a single public \nWeb site. This Web site will contain performance information from \nacross government so we can see how we are performing and how national \npriorities such as education, public health, and safety, are being met. \nAgain, I go back to Virginia Performs, which works. You agree on a top-\nline policy goal, and then you see across agencies how all these \ndifferent programs feed in. So posting this on a single public Web site \nrather than having Members of Congress or the public sort through the \nmyriad of sites right now is a step in the right direction.\n  Third, agencies will be required to identify low-priority programs \nthat are not adequately contributing to the overall results. Now, this \nis controversial. Every agency likes to talk about its best performing \nprograms. No agency likes to talk about which programs really are not \ngetting the job done. But as we face increasingly budget constraining \ntimes, we must make sure we look not only at the winners but that we \nhave the agencies themselves put forward those areas where programs are \nnot meeting the goals.\n  Fourth, we need to take important steps to improve the accountability \nof the senior officers in government agencies. We formally establish \nthat agency deputy secretaries are the chief operating officers and \nhold them accountable for the results the agencies are looking for. \nAgain, you have to have a chain of command so somebody knows who is the \nchief operating officer and those people who are performing are \nresponsible and those metrics are reported to that chief operating \nofficer. We also establish a performance improvement officer who \nreports directly to the COO and, again, works across agencies to meet \nour crosscutting goals.\n  We also feel these efforts will generate ``back office'' savings, and \nwe have as a policy goal--I do not believe this will be a stretch--a \nliterally 10-percent reduction in written reports.\n  We sometimes get overloaded with data. We want to fine-tune the data. \nWe want to make sure the more useful data is reported on a more regular \nbasis, that extraneous amounts--some of the kind of burdensome stuff \nthat has been put in in the past that may no longer be relevant--we \nwant to eliminate. And within the agency, we want to make sure there is \na clear chain of command.\n  I think the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act \nmoves us forward in a major way. So this legislation--commonsense \nbusiness practices, bipartisan, in an effort that will meet the 10-\npercent reduction in agency reports; the effort, finally, to make sure \nwe can look at policy goals not by individual department or agency but \nacross programmatic areas; the same kinds of business techniques that \nare used in Fortune 500 companies all across America and, for that \nmatter, all across the world--will bring these best practices into the \nFederal Government and make sure we do not have this kind of start-and-\nstop effort that has, unfortunately, plagued modernization efforts over \nthe past.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--since this is \nbipartisan supported--to join in this effort. As we think about many of \nthe major issues\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\nthat we kind of fight through in these remaining days of this Congress, \nI hope, for this kind of commonsense piece of legislation, that we \ncould get the time needed to get it passed. Again, I urge my colleagues \nto join us in this effort.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Carper, \nWarner, Collins, Lieberman, and Voinovich in introducing the GPRA \nModernization Act of 2010.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Government Performance and Results \nAct of 1993, often referred to as GPRA or the Results Act, I believe \nthe time has come to refine and enhance this landmark bill.\n  President Obama, in his inaugural address, observed:\n\n       The question we ask today is not whether our government is \n     too big or too small but whether it works.\n\n  This question captures the essence of what the Results Act seeks to \nachieve. While the original Results Act made significant progress in \nencouraging agencies to develop a results-oriented culture, it is time \nto modernize GPRA. Several long-standing challenges hinder agency \nefforts to answer this critical question. Our legislation is a \nbipartisan effort to empower agencies to overcome these challenges and \nbetter evaluate how to use taxpayer dollars in the most efficient and \neffective way possible.\n  Prior to 1993, Congress had never enacted a statutory framework for \nstrategic planning, goal setting, or performance measurement. According \nto the U.S. Government Accountability Office, before GPRA, few agencies \nhad results-oriented performance information to manage or make \nstrategic policy decisions. The Results Act was a bipartisan effort \nthat succeeded in establishing a comprehensive and consistent statutory \nfoundation of required agency strategic plans, annual performance \nplans, and annual performance reports. GPRA is and must remain a \ncornerstone of the Federal Government's efforts to strengthen strategic \nplanning across all agencies.\n  Lessons learned from nearly two decades worth of experience \nimplementing the Results Act, informed by numerous GAO reports and \nrecommendations; confirm the need to strengthen the statutory framework \nestablished by GPRA.\n  The legislation we offer today draws on this experience, applying \nlessons learned to amend GPRA to address the limitations identified by \nGAO and other observers. I will highlight a few of the important \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Our bill requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nto develop a Federal Government performance plan and to coordinate with \nagencies to develop Federal Government priority goals for management \nand policy issues that cut across agencies. This provision addresses a \nlong-standing GAO recommendation that the Federal Government develop a \ngovernment-wide performance plan to provide OMB, agencies, and \nCongress, with a structured framework for addressing crosscutting \npolicy initiatives and program efforts.\n  This legislation also strengthens the congressional consultation \nprovisions to require agencies consult with Congress when developing \nstrategic plans and identifying priority goals. GAO has found that \nregular consultation with Congress about the content and format of \nstrategic and performance plans is critical to ensure that both the \nexecutive and legislative branches are engaged in improving government \nperformance. Full congressional buy-in is a key element to building a \nsustainable performance management framework.\n  Our legislative proposal also addresses performance management skills \nand competencies, which GAO has identified as a critical factor in \ndetermining an agency's success in utilizing performance management \nsystems. A 2007 GAO survey of Federal managers found nearly half \nreported not receiving training that would assist in utilizing \nperformance information. Our bill addresses this training deficit by \nrequiring the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to \nidentify key performance management skills and competencies and \nincorporate them into relevant position classifications and training \ncurricula.\n  Congress has a responsibility to promote effective performance \nmanagement to enable Federal agencies to spend taxpayer dollars wisely, \nwhile carrying out critical missions. The GPRA Modernization Act is an \nimportant step towards accomplishing this goal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Kaufman):\n  S. 3854. A bill to expand the definition of scheme or artifice to \ndefraud with respect to mail and wire fraud; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Honest \nServices Restoration Act with Senator Whitehouse and Senator Kaufman. \nThe legislation will restore critical tools used by investigators and \nprosecutors to combat public corruption and corporate fraud, which the \nSupreme Court dramatically weakened in Skilling v. United States.\n  In Skilling, the Court sided with an Enron executive who had been \nconvicted of fraud, and in doing so, held that the honest services \nfraud statute may be used to prosecute only bribery and kickbacks, but \nno other conduct. That leaves other corrupt and fraudulent conduct \nwhich prosecutors in the past addressed under the honest services fraud \nstatute to go unchecked. Most notably, the Court's decision excluded \nundisclosed ``self-dealing'' by state and federal public officials, and \ncorporate officers and directors, which is when those officials or \nexecutives secretly act in their own financial self-interest, rather \nthan in the interest of the public or, in the private sector cases, \ntheir shareholders and employees. The Honest Services Restoration Act \nrestores the honest services statute to cover this undisclosed ``self-\ndealing'' by state and Federal public officials, and corporate officers \nand directors.\n  In a hearing earlier today, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony \nfrom experts who explored the kinds of problematic conduct that may now \ngo unchecked in the wake of the Skilling decision. The testimony also \nconsidered what Congress can and should do to fill those gaps and \nrestore strong enforcement to combat corrupt and fraudulent conduct.\n  It is clear that in recent years, the stain of corruption has spread \nto all levels of government. This is a problem that victimizes every \nAmerican by chipping away at the foundations of our democracy and the \nfaith that Americans have in their government. Recent years have also \nseen a plague of financial and corporate frauds that have severely \nundermined our economy and hurt too many hardworking people in this \ncountry. These frauds have robbed people of their savings, their \nretirement accounts, college funds for their children, and have cost \ntoo many people their homes.\n  Congress has acted, by passing the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act \nand other key provisions, to give prosecutors and investigators more \ntools to combat fraud. But we must remain vigilant, as the methods and \ntechniques used by those who would defraud hardworking Americans \ncontinue to change. Too often, loopholes in existing laws have meant \nthat corrupt conduct can go unchecked. The honest services fraud \nstatute has enabled prosecutors to root out corrupt and fraudulent \nconduct that would otherwise slip through those loopholes; we must \ntighten it so it can perform that important role again.\n  Congress must act aggressively but carefully to strengthen our laws \nto root out corruption and fraud. By preventing public officials and \ncorporate executives from acting in their own self-interest at the \nexpense of the people they serve, the Honest Services Restoration Act \ncloses a gap created by Skilling and strengthens a critical law \nenforcement tool. I look forward to working with Senators from both \nparties to quickly pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Definition of `scheme or artifice to defraud'.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. \n        Murray, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 3855. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe limitation on the issuance of new clean renewable energy bonds and \nto terminate eligibility of governmental bodies to issue such bonds, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill unleash a wave of investment in clean renewable energy. The Clean \nRenewable Energy Investment Act of 2010 will remove the arbitrary cap \non the amount of Clean Renewable Energy Bonds that can be issued by our \nNation's consumer-owned public power providers and cooperative electric \ncompanies. This legislation will generate significant private \ninvestment in renewable energy projects that will create thousands of \njobs nationwide.\n  Congress first created Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, or ``CREBs'' in \n2005 in an attempt to parallel the tax incentive offered by the Section \n45 tax credit for electricity produced from renewable resources. \nHowever, the incentives for consumer-owned utilities have never been \ntruly comparable to the subsidy we provide to for-profit, investor-\nowned utilities because unlike the section 45 tax credit, CREBs have \nalways been subject to an overall cap on the amount of bonds that can \nbe issued nationwide.\n  Since consumer-owned utilities operate on a not-for-profit basis and \nincur no Federal income tax liability, traditional production tax \ncredits otherwise available to for-profit utilities simply do not \nwork--because there is no Federal tax liability to offset with the \ncredit. Yet the nearly 3,000 public power utilities and rural electric \ncooperatives collectively serve 25 percent of the Nation's electricity \ncustomers. These utilities are often ideally situated in terms of both \ngeography and size to integrate clean and renewable technologies into \ntheir systems.\n  The original CREB program has been extended twice and was modified in \nthe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to make it more \nworkable for public power and more attractive to institutional \ninvestors. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided for an additional $2.4 \nbillion in CREB funding split equally between public power providers, \nrural electric cooperatives, and other governmental bodies. In March \n2010, Congress passed another very useful modification to the CREB \nprogram by giving issuers of CREBs the option to issue the bonds as \n``direct-pay bonds'', similar to the structure of Build America Bonds.\n  In the last round of CREBs, the demand for projects significantly \nexceeded the availability of the limited $800 million for each category \nof issuer. Public power and electric cooperative utilities have \nbillions of dollars in projects awaiting these incentives--with some \neven having the potential to use $800 million for a single project if \ngiven the opportunity.\n  This means we have an opportunity to unleash a wave of investments in \nclean energy. In Washington State, 50 percent of customers are served \nby public power providers. Nationwide, public power and cooperatives \nserve one in four electricity customers. Yet, if we look back over the \nhistory of the Section 45 tax credit and CREBs, Congress typically \nshortchanges the consumer-owned sector. Looking at the Joint Committee \non Taxations estimates of the cost of all the major energy tax \nlegislation since 2005, the resources allocated to CREBs have been \nroughly \\1/10\\ of the cost of extending or expanding, section 45.\n  My legislation would correct this inconsistency in our energy policy \nby removing the arbitrary cap on the volume of CREBs that can be \nissued, and would instead sunset the CREB program at the end of 2013, \nwhich is consistent with the expiration of most components of the \nsection 45 credit.\n  It would also remove the ``governmental bodies'' category from \neligibility for the bonds. The CREB program was originally developed \nfor utility-scale projects and this amendment reflects that intent and \nputs the program in line with the Production Tax Credit for investor-\nowned utilities. Since passage of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, Governmental bodies now have their own bond program. \nThey are eligible for the new Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds,\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nQECBs, which is a more suitable program for these entities as they can \nfinance both renewable and energy efficiency projects with QECBs. Under \nthis legislation, Tribal utilities would remain eligible issuers of \nCREBs.\n  In addition, the bill clarifies that any reimbursement with bond \nproceeds is governed by the reimbursement rules applicable to tax-\nexempt bonds. It is widely recognized in the public finance community \nthat the existing wording in Section 54A(d)(2)(D) is at best unclear, \nand at worst incorrect. State and local government issuers of bonds are \nfamiliar with the reimbursement rules applicable to tax-exempt bonds \nand there is no tax policy reason to have two sets of reimbursement \nrules.\n  Finally, the bill insures that any new CREBs allocated before the \ndate of enactment of this bill are not affected by any of these \namendments. The intent is to ensure that the ``government bodies'' \ncategory is still able to issue previously allocated CREBs and will not \nbe retroactively cut out of the program.\n  This bill is good energy policy because it will lead to the \ndevelopment of thousands of megawatts of renewable power. It is good \ntax policy because it maintains the integrity of the CREBs program, and \nit is overall good public policy because it provides parity between \ninvestor-owned and consumer-owned utilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3858. A bill to improve the H-2A agricultural worker program for \nuse by dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in these challenging economic times, dairy \nfarmers in Vermont, New York, and across America are experiencing \nparticularly difficult conditions. They face both rock-bottom milk \nprices, and a severe labor shortage. There is an immediate solution for \none of these issues. Labor shortages could be met with foreign \nagricultural workers under a special visa program, called H-2A, which \nallows farmers who are unable to fill labor needs with domestic workers \nto hire temporary or seasonal foreign workers. I have long sought to \ninclude dairy farmers in the H-2A program, but the Department of Labor \nhas consistently refused to interpret the law to allow dairy farmers \naccess to seasonal foreign workers.\n  Last fall, the Department of Labor initiated a rulemaking process to \nreconsider various aspects of the H-2A program. I repeatedly urged the \nDepartment to exercise its authority to give dairy farmers access to H-\n2A workers, both through comments I submitted in the formal rulemaking \nand by supporting the comments of the National Milk Producers \nFederation.\n  Nonetheless, on February 11, 2010, the Department released a final \nrule that continues to exclude the dairy industry from this valuable \nprogram. Inexplicably, while refusing to include the dairy industry \nbecause of its year-round needs, the Department of Labor extends new \naccess to the H-2A program to the logging industry, and continues to \noffer access to these purportedly seasonal worker visas to the year-\nround sheepherding industry.\n  Today, I introduce the H-2A Improvement Act with Senators Gillibrand \nand Schumer. This bill will finally end the inequity under current law. \nThe H-2A Improvement Act will make explicit in law that dairy farms can \nuse the H-2A program, ensuring that dairy farmers in Vermont, New York, \nand throughout the Nation can find the labor they need to stay in \nbusiness, meeting the needs of their communities and American families. \nThis legislation, which also gives statutory access to the H-2A program \nto sheep herders and goat herders, contains provisions to ensure that \nthe benefit that these workers provide to farmers is maximized. The \nlegislation authorizes this unique class of workers to remain in the \nUnited States for an initial period of 3 years, and gives U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services the authority to approve a worker \nfor an additional 3-year period as needed. After the initial 3-year \nperiod, the worker may petition to become a lawful permanent resident.\n  The failure to allow the dairy industry to participate in the H-2A \nprogram puts many dairy farmers in the situation of having to choose \nbetween their livelihoods and following the law. Late last year, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security audited at least four dairy farms in \nVermont. Although I strongly believe that the vast majority of dairy \nfarmers want to hire a lawful workforce, there is a critical shortage \nof domestic workers available to work on dairy farms. Dairy farmers are \noften ill-equipped to verify the authenticity of documents that job \napplicants present. As a result, some of the workers the farmers hire \nmay not be lawfully authorized to work. With all the challenges facing \ndairy farmers today, we should help dairy farmers hire lawful workers, \nnot leave them with the precarious choice of hiring workers who may be \nunauthorized, or hiring no workers at all.\n  Expanding the H-2A program to include dairy workers would protect \nboth American and foreign workers. It would protect American workers \nfrom having to compete with an unlawful work force, in which \nunscrupulous employers pay lower wages in often unsafe conditions. At \nthe same time, it would protect foreign dairy workers, by requiring \nthat employers comply with existing H-2A regulations and wage and hour \nand occupational safety laws. This legislation, if enacted, would give \nforeign workers who seek employment in the dairy industry the dignity \nand certainty of lawful status and the opportunity to be productive \nmembers of the communities in which they work.\n  In 2006 and 2007, I worked to include nearly identical provisions in \nthe Senate's comprehensive immigration bills. This legislation reflects \nthose provisions. The measure I introduce today is a simple, targeted \nfix to our immigration laws that will enable dairy farmers to gain the \nbenefits of this important program. While I recognize that many \nagricultural employers are frustrated by the current regulatory \nprocess, it is a critical first step, and a matter of basic fairness \nthat dairy farmers are afforded the same opportunities to obtain labor \nas all other agricultural sectors.\n  Although this legislation is necessary to meet the immediate needs of \ndairy farmers, I also want to make absolutely clear that I remain in \ncomplete support of the more comprehensive AgJOBS legislation, which I \njoined Senator Feinstein in introducing last year, and on which Senator \nFeinstein and others have worked tirelessly. I will continue to \nstrongly support that legislation, and Senator Feinstein in her efforts \nto see it enacted. AgJOBS is broader than the H-2A Improvement Act. It \nreforms the broader H-2A program to cover agricultural workers that are \ncurrently assisting American farmers, but who are not lawfully \nauthorized to work. It also makes important, negotiated changes to \nstreamline the H-2A regulatory process for employers and workers. I \nrecognize that farmers across the country need a comprehensive \nsolution--from Vermont's small dairy farms to the vast fields of \nCalifornia. The solution that the AgJOBS legislation proposes will \nbenefit agriculture across the Nation and is a solution I remain \ncommitted to making a reality.\n  I will also continue to work with Senate leadership and Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle to accomplish our shared goals for broader \nreform of our Nation's immigration system. In the meantime, America's \ndairy farmers must at least be placed on the same footing as other \nagricultural interests with respect to our current H-2A laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to express the sense of the Senate concerning the \nestablishment of Doctor of Nursing Practice and doctor of Pharmacy dual \ndegree programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the need for a \nhealth care professional skilled in caring for the specific needs of a \ngrowing elderly population. In the next 30 years we will see a unique \nchange in population demographics in this country. The geriatric \npopulation is increasing and by the year 2030, the over 65 age group \nwill make up 20 percent of the population. More people will reach the \n100-year mark. My home State of Hawai`i is home to more 100-year olds \nper capita than any other State. The risk for developing disease and \nillness becomes greater as one ages. As we see an increase in the age \nof our population, those living with chronic illnesses such as \ncardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes and cancer, will \ncontinue to rise in numbers as well. These are patient's who require \ncare in the ambulatory, hospital, and home care settings. The \nchronically ill geriatric patients usually are living with multiple co-\nmorbidities and possess poly pharmacy challenges. We are living in a \ntime when it is crucial to develop the skills and expertise to care for \nthese patients and provide them with the quality health care they \ndeserve in a cost effective manner.\n  While the terms dual, joint, double or combined degrees are used \ninterchangeably, the overall definition is students working for two \ndifferent and distinct degrees in parallel, completing two degrees in \nless time than it would take to complete each separately. Under the \nleadership of Katharyn F. Daub, EdD, CTN, CNE, Director School of \nNursing, John M. Pezzuto, Ph.D., Dean, College of Pharmacy, and Donald \nO. Straney, Ph.D., Chancellor, University of Hawai`i at Hilo, the \nUniversity of Hawai`i at Hilo has created a model that would partner \nboth their school of nursing and pharmacy to meet the needs of the \nchanging health care field through the implementation of a dual-degree \nprogram that would combine a Doctor of Nursing Practice, DNP, with a \nDoctor of Pharmacy, PharmD.\n  The overall purpose of this innovative cross cutting dual or joint \ndegree nursing program is to prepare nurses to expand the traditional \nscope of nursing practice, with the goal of strengthening health care \nteams. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing, AACN, 2009 \nsurvey of schools of nursing documents that there are over 100 nursing \nschools that offer dual degree programs: 74 MSN/MBA programs; 34 MSN/\nMPH programs; 10 MSN/MHA programs; 5 MSN/MPA programs; 4 MSN/MDIV \nprograms; and 3 MSN/JD programs. Currently there is no dual degree \nprogram that combines nursing and pharmacology.\n  Through this dual collaborative role we would be able to meet the \nunique needs of rural communities across age continuums and in diverse \nsettings. The nurse/pharmacist would enhance collaboration between DNPs \nand physicians regarding drug therapy. The program also would provide \nfor the implementation of safer medication administration. It would \nbroaden the scope of practice for pharmacists through education and \ntraining in diagnosis and management of common acute and chronic \ndiseases, and create new employment opportunities for private physician \nor nurse managed clinics, walk-in clinics, school/college clinics, \nlong-term facilities, veteran administration facilities, hospitals and \nhospital clinics, hospice centers, home health care agencies, \npharmaceutical companies, emergency departments, urgent care sites, \nphysician group practices, extended care facilities, and research \ncenters.\n  Additional research and evaluation would determine the extent of \nwhich graduates of this program improve primary health care, address \ndisparities, diversify the workforce, and increase quality of service \nfor underserved populations.\n  I urge you to consider the benefits of the development of a joint \ndegree in nursing and pharmacology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Doctor of Nursing Practice \n     and Doctor of Pharmacy Dual Degree Program Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The terms dual, joint, double or combined degrees are \n     used interchangeably, the overall definition is students \n     working for two different and distinct degrees in parallel, \n     completing two degrees in less time than it would take to \n     complete each separately.\n       (2) The overall purpose of the innovative cross cutting \n     dual or joint degree nursing programs is to prepare nurses to \n     expand the traditional scope of nursing practice, with the \n     goal of strengthening health care teams.\n       (3) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) \n     2009 survey of schools of nursing documents that there are \n     over 100 nursing schools that offer dual degree programs of \n     which 74 are MSN/MBA programs, 34 are MSN/MPH programs, 10 \n     are MSN/MHA programs, 5 are MSN/MPA programs, 4 are MSN/MDIV \n     programs, and 3 are MSN/JD programs.\n       (4) There is currently no dual degree program that combines \n     nursing and pharmacology.\n       (5) Recently, the University of Hawai`i at Hilo has \n     explored the option of nursing and pharmacy partnering to \n     meet the needs of the changing health care field.\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) there should be established a Doctor of Nursing \n     Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) dual degree \n     program;\n       (2) the development of a joint degree in nursing and \n     pharmacology should combine a Doctor of Nursing Practice \n     (DNP) with a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD);\n       (3) the significance of such a dual degree program would be \n     improving patient outcomes;\n       (4) through such a dual collaborative role, health \n     providers will be better able to meet the unique needs of \n     rural communities across the age continuum and in diverse \n     settings;\n       (5) such a dual degree program--\n       (A) would enhance collaboration between Doctors of Nursing \n     Practice and physicians regarding drug therapy;\n       (B) would provide for research concerning, and the \n     implementation of, safer medication administration;\n       (C) would broaden the scope of practice for pharmacists \n     through education and training in diagnosis and management of \n     common acute and chronic diseases;\n       (D) would provide new employment opportunities for private \n     physician or nurse managed clinics, walk-in clinics, school \n     or college clinics, long-term care facilities, Veteran \n     Administration facilities, hospitals and hospital clinics, \n     hospice centers, home health care agencies, pharmaceutical \n     companies, emergency departments, urgent care sites, \n     physician group practices, extended care facilities, and \n     research centers; and\n       (E) would assist in filling the need for primary care \n     providers with an expertise in geriatrics and \n     pharmaceuticals; and\n       (6) additional research and evaluation should be conducted \n     to determine the extent to which graduates of such a dual \n     degree program improve primary health care, address \n     disparities, diversify the workforce, and increase quality of \n     service for underserved populations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 3863. A bill to designate certain Federal land within the \nMonongahela National Forest as a component of the National Wilderness \nPreservation System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMonongahela Conservation Legacy Act of 2010. This important piece of \nlegislation sets aside 6,042 acres of the Monongahela National Forest \non North Fork Mountain in Grant County, WV, to be included in the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System.\n  West Virginians have a proud tradition of mining and logging that \nprovides needed resources for our entire country. I have no doubt that \nthis tradition will continue for many decades to come. However, at the \nsame time, new development is coming to West Virginia. This is needed \ndevelopment that provides jobs for West Virginians and helps support \nour economy. But with this increased development comes a responsibility \nto set aside some part of our natural environment for those who come \nafter us.\n  The Monongahela National Forest encompasses nearly 920,000 acres of \nland in the heart of the Appalachian Mountain Range and contains some \nof the most ecologically diverse regions in the country. North Fork \nMountain is one of these incredible areas and has earned the Forest \nService's highest rating for Natural Integrity in its Wilderness \nAttribute Rating System. The mountain is a nesting site for peregrine \nfalcons and home to 120 rare plants, animals, and natural communities. \nWith this wilderness designation all of these ecological treasures will \nbe permanently protected.\n  Over the years I have heard from hundreds of West Virginians about \nhow important wilderness is to them. I have heard from West Virginians \nwho want to make sure that they will be able to continue to fish \npristine streams and hunt in the forests. Wilderness is a major draw \nfor the outdoor tourism industry and will provide jobs.\n  Finally, I want to extend my thanks to Congressman Mollohan, who has \nintroduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives, for \nhis leadership on this issue. I will continue to work with all \nstakeholders involved to move this legislation forward and to address \nany concerns while ensuring the preservation of this truly special \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7635-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 652--HONORING MR.

Mr. DURBIN (for Mr. Kyl (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Burr, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Vitter)) proposed an \namendment to the bill H.R. 5566, to amend title 18, United States Code, \nto prohibit interstate commerce in animal crush videos, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Crush Video \n     Prohibition Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has a long history of prohibiting the \n     interstate sale, marketing, advertising, exchange, and \n     distribution of obscene material and speech that is integral \n     to criminal conduct.\n       (2) The Federal Government and the States have a compelling \n     interest in preventing intentional acts of extreme animal \n     cruelty.\n       (3) Each of the several States and the District of Columbia \n     criminalize intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty, such \n     as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, \n     or impaling of animals for no socially redeeming purpose.\n       (4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that \n     appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme \n     animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes \n     are commonly referred to as ``animal crush videos''.\n       (5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held \n     that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the \n     First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos \n     are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a \n     whole--\n       (A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex;\n       (B) are patently offensive; and\n       (C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or \n     scientific value.\n       (7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are \n     integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.\n       (8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is \n     intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive \n     for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the \n     serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The \n     primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, \n     distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the \n     animal crush video image.\n       (9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to \n     make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine \n     manner that--\n       (A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain \n     anonymous;\n       (B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the \n     jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of \n     extreme animal cruelty occurred; and\n       (C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred \n     within the statute of limitations.\n       (10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) \n     seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State \n     authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such \n     behavior.\n\n     SEC. 3. ANIMAL CRUSH VIDEOS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 48 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 48.

Animal crush videos.''.\n\n       (c) Severability.--If any provision of section 48 of title \n     18, United States Code (as amended by this section), or the \n     application of the provision to any person or circumstance, \n     is held to be unconstitutional,\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n     the provision and the application of the provision to other \n     persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4669.

Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program and the \n     National Cord Blood Inventory program under section 2 of the \n     Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005.\n       (f) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``remote \n     collection'' has the meaning given such term in section \n     379(d)(2)(C) of the Public Health Service Act.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010. I was pleased to \nhave been involved in the crafting of this bill, which is the product \nof months of bipartisan discussions, collaboration, and negotiation. I \nalso want to recognize the hard work and dedication of Senators Dodd, \nHatch, Burr, and Ensign in getting this bill across the finish line in \nthe Senate.\n  This bill offers promise to the tens of thousands of individuals \ndiagnosed with leukemia and lymphomas, sickle cell anemia, and rare \ngenetic blood disorders.\n  It will reauthorize the C.W. Bill Young National Marrow Donor \nProgram, which has been helping to connect individuals in need of a \nbone marrow transplant with donors since 1986, and the National Cord \nBlood Inventory, which has been helping to connect individuals in need \nof an umbilical cord blood transplant with donors since 1999.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill will remove a cap on the \nnumber of cord blood units that could be stored by qualified cord blood \nbanks in the National Cord Blood Inventory. The original law limited \nthe number to 150,000 units. As the science has evolved, we know that \n150,000 is nowhere near the amount necessary to meet the demands of \nthose in need of a cord blood transplant. And, in eliminating this cap, \nI am pleased that we have included provisions to encourage greater cord \nblood donation and collection as well as provisions to help shed light \nonto the obstacles to greater donation and collection.\n  I am proud that the Rhode Island Blood Center has contributed to the \nsuccess of the National Marrow Donor Program with over 61,000 \nregistered marrow donors. In addition, last year a new partnership \nformed between the Rhode Island Blood Bank and Women and Infants \nHospital in Providence, RI, to begin collecting umbilical cord blood \nunits as part of a pilot project. Over 1,000 units have already been \ncollected, and I look forward to the time when Rhode Island will be \ncontributing to the National Cord Blood Inventory.\n  The public registries made up of Rhode Island donors and those from \nall over the country have been a true lifeline for the Americans who \nhave found an unrelated match. By strengthening and enhancing the \nimportant programs operating these registries, many more\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nAmericans will be afforded the opportunity to find a match if they are \never in need.\n  I look forward to swift passage of this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives and the President signing this bill into law shortly \nthereafter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nS. 3751, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of \n2010 which reauthorizes the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of \n2005--P.L. 109-129--through the end of 2015. I am also grateful that \nSenators Dodd, Burr, Reed, Ensign, Franken and Coburn have joined me as \nsponsors of this bipartisan bill, which was unanimously approved by the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee last week.\n  S. 3751, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act, \nreauthorizes the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program--the \nProgram--and the National Cord Blood Inventory program--NCBI. These \nprograms maintain donor registries for individuals in need of bone \nmarrow and umbilical cord blood transplants. Today, more than eight \nmillion Americans are registered bone marrow donors, and in the 5 years \nsince NCBI was established, more than 28,600 cord blood units have been \ncollected. Cord blood transplantation accounts for over 40 percent of \nall transplants in the country.\n  I believe it is important for Senators to understand the specifics of \nS. 3751. Our bill reauthorizes the program through the end of Fiscal \nYear 2015. The authorization levels for the Program are $30 million \nfrom FY11 through FY14 and $33 million in FY15. The NCBI authorization \nlevels are $23 million from FY11 through FY14 and $20 million in FY15. \nThe total authorization level for both programs combined is $53 million \nannually, which is the same authorization level included in the Stem \nCell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005.\n  Our bill calls for the collection and maintenance of at least 150,000 \nhigh-quality cord blood units. In order to collect high-quality and \ndiverse units, the Health Resources and Services Administration--HRSA--\ncontracts with cord blood banks to collect and maintain umbilical cord \nblood units for the national inventory. To achieve the goal of \ncollecting at least 150,000 units, S. 3751 requires cord blood banks to \nprovide a strategic plan to increase collection, assist with the \ncreation of new collection sites, or contract with new collection sites \nwhen first applying for a contract or extending an existing contract. \nS. 3751 also requires cord blood banks to submit an annual plan for \nachieving self-sufficiency and demonstrates on-going measurable \nprogress toward achieving self-sufficiency of cord blood collection and \nbanking operations. The bill also extends the duration of a contract \nfrom 3 to 5 years and allows cord blood units to remain part of the \nnational inventory for at least 10 years.\n  Additionally, S. 3751 redefines the term ``first-degree relative'' as \na sibling of an individual requiring a transplant. Children are not a \nmatch for parents in need of a cord blood transplant, as the original \nlaw suggested. The bill also aligns the privacy protections provided to \nbone marrow donors and patients with umbilical cord blood donors and \ntransplant patients.\n  The legislation encourages the Program to support studies and \ndemonstration projects to increase cord blood donation and collection. \nMore specifically, S. 3751 directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices--HHS, acting though the HRSA Administrator, to submit to \nCongress an annual report on the National Program's activities \nincluding novel approaches for increasing cord blood unit donation and \ncollection. The HHS Secretary also is directed to set an annual goal of \nincreasing collections of high-quality and diverse cord blood units \nthrough remote collection or other approaches. In addition, S. 3751 \ndirects the HHS Secretary to identify at least one of these approaches \nto replicate and expand across the country. If a project is not \nidentified, the HHS Secretary shall submit a plan for expanding remote \ncollection of high-quality and diverse cord blood units.\n  S. 3751 requires the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory \nCouncil, to submit to Congress an interim report within 6 months after \nenactment, describing existing methods used to distribute Federal funds \nto cord blood banks. The report also would explain how cord blood banks \ncontract with cord blood unit collection sites and recommend how these \nmethods may be improved in order to encourage efficient collection of \nhigh-quality and diverse cord blood units.\n  Our legislation also requires the Advisory Council to submit \nrecommendations to the HHS Secretary 1 year after enactment on whether \nremote models for cord blood unit collection should be allowed with \nonly limited, scientifically justified safety protections. The Advisory \nCouncil would also make recommendations on whether HHS should allow for \ncord blood unit collection from routine deliveries without temperature \nor humidity monitoring of delivery rooms in hospitals approved by the \nJoint Commission.\n  Finally, S. 3751 requires the Government Accountability Office--GAO--\nto study existing cord blood donation and collection methods and the \nbarriers responsible for limiting donation and collection. GAO also \nwould analyze the methods used to distribute funds to cord blood banks \nand novel approaches to grow the NCBI.\n  S. 3751 proves that contrary to popular belief, bipartisanship still \nexists in the United States Congress. The original Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act passed Congress unanimously and became \nlaw--P.L 109-129--on December 20, 2005. This law offered a unique \nopportunity to assist those suffering from a serious illness requiring \ncord blood or bone marrow transplants. In 2005, our goal was to \nincrease the number of bone marrow and cord blood donors to meet our \ngoal of 150,000 high-quality and diverse cord blood units. Today, our \ngoal remains the same except we are encouraging the collection of at \nleast 150,000 units. The sponsors of this legislation want to do \neverything in our power to provide patients with the best transplant \noptions and signing this legislation into law is how we achieve this \nsecond goal. Transplant patients and their families deserve nothing \nless.\n  S. 3751 is supported by the following organizations: American Society \nof Bone Marrow Transplant, Aplastic Anemia and MDS Society, Center for \nInternational Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Colorado Cord Blood \nBank, Duke University Cord Blood Bank, Intermountain Primary Children's \nHospital, Jeff Gordon Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Foundation, \nLifeCord Cord Blood Bank, National Marrow Donor Program, Nevada Cancer \nInstitute, New Jersey Cord Blood Bank, New York Blood Center Cord Blood \nBank, Rhode Island Blood Center, St. Louis Cord Blood Bank, StemCyte \nInternational Cord Blood Bank, University of Utah's Cell Therapy \nFacility, Villanova football head coach Andy Talley, and Yale \nUniversity Hospital.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nsection by section analysis of S. 3751.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          Sec. 1. Short title\n\n       Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of \n     2010.\n\n\n  Sec. 2. Amendments to the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of \n                                  2005\n\n       (a) Instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) to enter into contracts with qualified cord blood banks \n     in order to create and maintain a national inventory of at \n     least 150,000 new high quality cord blood units suitable for \n     transplantation into unrelated recipients. The 2005 law \n     authorized a 3-year demonstration project to collect \n     umbilical cord blood units specifically for use in a first-\n     degree relative. The law instructed these units to be \n     combined with the national inventory at the end of the 3-year \n     demo. Since the FDA follows different collection and storage \n     requirements for cord blood units intended for use in a \n     first-degree relative and a stranger, the substitute \n     amendment eliminates this instruction and requires the units \n     collected for the demonstration program only be stored for \n     use in a first-degree relative.\n       Includes additional requirements for entities applying to \n     be qualified cord blood banks. First, the entity must provide \n     a plan to increase cord blood unit collections at collection \n     sites that exist at the time of application, assist with the \n     establishment of new collection sites or contract with new \n     collection sites. Second, contract recipients must annually \n     provide to the HHS Secretary\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\n     a plan for and demonstrate ongoing, measurable progress \n     toward achieving self-sufficiency of cord blood collection \n     and banking operations.\n       Extends the length of a cord blood bank contract from three \n     years to five years. A five year extension of cord blood \n     contracts will be permitted if such entities: (1) demonstrate \n     a superior ability to satisfy the requirements included in \n     the original statute to be federal cord blood banks; (2) \n     provide a plan for increasing cord blood unit collections at \n     collection sites that exist at the time of consideration of \n     such extension, assist with the establishment of new \n     collection sites, or contract with new collection sites; and \n     (3) annually provide to the HHS Secretary a plan for and \n     demonstrate ongoing, measurable progress toward achieving \n     self-sufficiency of cord blood collection and banking \n     operations.\n       Redefines the term, ``first-degree relative'' as a sibling \n     of the individual requiring a transplant. Authorizes \n     appropriations for the National Cord Blood Inventory Program \n     (NCBI) at $23 million in fiscal years 2011-2014 and $20 \n     million in fiscal year 2015. The substitute amendment \n     eliminates language in the law which allows funds to remain \n     available until expended since this is overridden by long-\n     standing policy in appropriations bills. The statutory \n     language was originally necessary because the 2005 \n     authorization law passed after funds had been appropriated.\n       (b) Clarifies that the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation \n     Program, known as the Program, shall support studies and \n     outreach projects to increase cord collection donation and \n     collection from a genetically diverse population, including \n     exploring novel approaches or incentives, such as remote or \n     other innovative technological advances that could be used to \n     collect cord blood units, to expand the number of cord blood \n     collection sites partnering with cord blood banks that \n     receive a contract under the NCBI program.\n       Directs the Secretary, acting though the Administrator of \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration, to submit \n     to Congress an annual report on activities conducted through \n     the National Program including novel approaches for the \n     purpose of increasing cord blood unit donation and \n     collection. Directs the Secretary to set an annual goal of \n     increasing collections of high quality cord blood units \n     through remote collection or other novel approaches. The \n     Secretary shall identify at least one of these approaches to \n     replicate and expand nationwide as appropriate. If such a \n     project cannot be identified by the Secretary, then the \n     Secretary shall submit a plan for expanding remote collection \n     of high quality cord blood units. Remote collection is \n     defined as cord blood unit collections occurring at locations \n     that do not hold written contracts with existing cord blood \n     banks for collection support.\n       Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory \n     Council, to submit to Congress an interim report not later \n     than 6 months after date of enactment, describing the \n     existing methods used to distribute federal funds to cord \n     blood banks; how cord blood banks contract with collection \n     sites for the collection of cord blood units; and \n     recommendations to improve these methods to encourage the \n     efficient collection of high quality and diverse cord blood \n     units.\n       Requires the Advisory Council shall submit recommendations \n     to the Secretary one year after enactment about whether:\n       1. remote models for cord blood unit collection should be \n     allowed with only limited, scientifically justified safety \n     protections; and\n       2. HHS should allow for cord blood unit collection from \n     routine deliveries without temperature or humidity monitoring \n     of delivery rooms in hospitals approved by the Joint \n     Commission.\n       Authorizes appropriations for the C.W.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5566, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5566) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to prohibit interstate commerce in animal crush videos, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass the \nAnimal Crush Video Prohibition Act. In doing so, we have taken this \nimportant step toward banning obscene animal crush videos, and I thank \nSenators Kyl, Merkley and Burr for their leadership on this issue. We \nworked on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this legislation respects \nthe first amendment and the role of our court system, while at the same \ntime giving law enforcement a valuable and necessary tool to stop \nobscene animal cruelty. I urge the House to quickly adopt the \nlegislation.\n  Earlier this year, in United States v. Stevens, the Supreme Court \nstruck down a Federal statute banning depictions of animal cruelty \nbecause it held the statute to be overbroad and in violation of the \nfirst amendment. Animal crush videos, which can depict obscene, extreme \nacts of animal cruelty, were a primary target of that legislation.\n  Two months ago, in response to the Stevens decision, the House \noverwhelmingly passed a narrower bill banning animal crush videos on \nobscenity grounds. The Senate Judiciary Committee regularly looks at \nquestions raised by Supreme Court decisions and the first amendment, \nand the House-passed bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for consideration.\n  There are a few well-established exceptions to the first amendment. \nThe United States has long prohibited the interstate sale of obscene \nmaterials, and the Supreme Court recognized this exception to the first \namendment in 1957. Earlier this month, the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing focused on the obscene nature of many animal crush videos. We \nheard testimony from experts who confirmed that many animal crush \nvideos depict extreme acts of animal cruelty which are designed to \nappeal to a specific, prurient, sexual fetish. Indeed, these animal \ncrush videos are patently offensive, lack any redeeming social value, \nand can be banned consistent with the Supreme Court's obscenity \njurisprudence. In drafting the substitute amendment to the House bill, \nwe were careful to respect the role that courts and juries play in \ndetermining obscenity. In any given case, it will be up to the \nprosecutor to prove and the jury to determine whether a given depiction \nis obscene, because obscenity is a separate element of the crime. The \nother element that occurs in animal crush videos and which warrants a \nhigher punishment than simple obscenity is that\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nit involves the intentional torture or pain to a living animal. \nCongress finds this combination deplorable and worthy of special \npunishment. That is why the maximum penalty is higher than general \nobscenity law.\n  The United States also has a history of prohibiting speech that is \nintegral to criminal conduct. The acts of animal cruelty depicted in \nmany animal crush videos violate State laws, but these laws are hard to \nenforce. The acts of cruelty are often committed in a clandestine \nmanner that allows the perpetrators to remain anonymous. The nature of \nthe videos also makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the \njurisdiction necessary to prosecute the crimes. Given the severe \ndifficulties that State law enforcement agencies have encountered in \nattempting to investigate and prosecute the underlying conduct, \nreaffirming Congress's commitment to closing the distribution network \nfor obscene animal crush videos is an effective means of combating the \ncrimes of extreme animal cruelty that they depict.\n  I have long been a champion of first amendment rights. As the son of \nVermont printers, I know firsthand that the freedom of speech is the \ncornerstone of our democracy. This is why I have worked hard to pass \nlegislation such as the SPEECH Act, which protects American authors, \njournalists and publishers from foreign libel lawsuits that undermine \nthe first amendment.\n  Today the Senate struck the right balance between the first amendment \nand the needs of law enforcement, while adhering to the separation of \npowers enshrined in our Constitution. I commend the bipartisan \ncoalition that worked hard, alongside the Humane Society and first \namendment experts, to strike this balance, and I look forward to the \ntime when obscene animal crush videos no longer threaten animal \nwelfare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the substitute at \nthe desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4668) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Crush Video \n     Prohibition Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has a long history of prohibiting the \n     interstate sale, marketing, advertising, exchange, and \n     distribution of obscene material and speech that is integral \n     to criminal conduct.\n       (2) The Federal Government and the States have a compelling \n     interest in preventing intentional acts of extreme animal \n     cruelty.\n       (3) Each of the several States and the District of Columbia \n     criminalize intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty, such \n     as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, \n     or impaling of animals for no socially redeeming purpose.\n       (4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that \n     appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme \n     animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes \n     are commonly referred to as ``animal crush videos''.\n       (5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held \n     that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the \n     First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos \n     are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a \n     whole--\n       (A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex;\n       (B) are patently offensive; and\n       (C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or \n     scientific value.\n       (7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are \n     integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.\n       (8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, \n     marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is \n     intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive \n     for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the \n     serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The \n     primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, \n     distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the \n     animal crush video image.\n       (9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to \n     make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine \n     manner that--\n       (A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain \n     anonymous;\n       (B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the \n     jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of \n     extreme animal cruelty occurred; and\n       (C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred \n     within the statute of limitations.\n       (10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) \n     seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State \n     authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such \n     behavior.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3219, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3219) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to make certain improvements in the laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating to insurance and \n     health care, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nH.R. 3219, the proposed ``Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010.'' The bill, \nas it comes before the Senate, is a compromise agreement developed with \nour counterparts on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I thank \nChairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer of the House Committee for \ntheir cooperation on this legislation. I also thank my good friend, the \ncommittee's ranking member, Senator Burr, for his cooperation as we \nhave developed this bill. A full explanation of the Senate and House \nnegotiated agreement can be found in the Joint Explanatory Statement, \nwhich I will ask be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The amended bill, which I will refer to as the ``compromise \nagreement,'' contains ten titles that are designed to enhance \ncompensation, housing, labor and education, burial, and insurance \nbenefits for veterans. I will highlight a few of the provisions.\n  The compromise agreement would make several important improvements in \ninsurance programs for disabled veterans. It would increase the maximum \namount of veterans' mortgage life insurance that a service-connected \ndisabled veteran may purchase from the current maximum of $90,000 up to \n$200,000. In the event of the veteran's death, the veteran's family \nwould be protected because VA will pay the balance of the mortgage owed \nup to the maximum amount of insurance purchased. The need for this \nincrease is obvious in today's housing market.\n  In addition, this legislation would increase the amount of \nsupplemental life insurance available to totally disabled veterans from \n$20,000 to $30,000. Many totally disabled veterans find it difficult to \nobtain commercial life insurance. This legislation would provide these \nveterans with a reasonable amount of life insurance coverage.\n  This benefits package also includes a provision that will expand \neligibility for retroactive benefits from traumatic injury protection \ncoverage under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program, \ncommonly referred to as TSGLI. Section 1032 of Public Law 109-13, the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \non Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, established traumatic injury \nprotection under the SGLI program. TSGLI went into effect on December \n1, 2005. Therefore, all insured servicemembers under SGLI from that \npoint forward are also insured under TSGLI and their injuries are \ncovered regardless of where they occur. In order to provide assistance \nto those servicemembers who suffered traumatic injuries on or between \nOctober 7, 2001, and November 30, 2005, retroactive TSGLI payments were \nauthorized under section 1032(c) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act \nto individuals whose qualifying losses were sustained ``as a direct \nresult of injuries incurred in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation \nIraqi Freedom.'' Under section 501(b) of Public Law 109-233, the \nVeterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006, \nthis definition was amended to allow retroactive payments to \nindividuals whose qualifying losses were sustained ``as a direct result \nof a traumatic injury incurred in the theater of operations for \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.''\n  However, without corrective action, men and women who were \ntraumatically injured on or between October 7, 2001, and November 30, \n2005, but were not in the OIF or OEF theaters of operation, will \ncontinue to be denied the same retroactive payment given to their \nwounded comrades. This legislation would correct that inequity.\n  This bill also modifies programs that provide adaptive assistance to \nveterans. It would increase and provide an index for an existing VA \ngrant program, which provides funds to assist severely disabled \nveterans in purchasing automobiles or other conveyances that can \naccommodate their disabilities. The increase to $18,900 would help \nprevent erosion of the value and effectiveness of this benefit.\n  Another provision included in this bill would expand this grant \nprogram to provide automobile and adaptive equipment assistance to \ndisabled veterans and servicemembers with severe burn injuries. Due to \nthe severe damage done to their skin, individuals with these \ndisabilities experience difficulty operating a standard automobile not \nequipped to accommodate their disabilities. This legislation would help \nthem obtain vehicles with special adaptations for assistance in and out \nof the vehicle, seat comfort, and climate control.\n  Another key part of this legislation is a provision to help homeless \nwomen veterans and homeless veterans with children. The majority of \nprograms and service providers currently available to homeless veterans \nhave historically\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nbeen designed to assist male veterans. However, due to the increasing \nnumber of women serving in the Armed Forces, more than 5 percent of \nveterans requesting assistance from VA and community-based homeless \nveteran service providers are women. More than 10 percent of these \nwomen have dependent children. In addition, there are reports of a \nsignificant number of male homeless veterans who have dependent \nchildren as well. To meet these changing needs of our Nation's veterans \nand correct this inequity, this bill will establish a grant program for \nthe reintegration of homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with \nchildren into the labor force.\n  This bill would also increase to 2,700 the number of veterans who are \nauthorized to enroll annually in a program of independent living \nservices. This important program is designed to meet the needs of the \nmost severely service-connected disabled veterans and more of those \nreturning from combat have suffered the kind of devastating injuries \nthat may make employment not reasonably feasible for extended periods \nof time.\n  This is not a comprehensive recitation of all the provisions within \nthis legislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide for \nAmerica's veterans and servicemembers. I urge our colleagues to support \nthis important legislation that would benefit many of this Nation's \nmore than 23 million veterans and their families. I also urge the House \nof Representatives to work on this matter expeditiously so that this \nmay be sent to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory \nStatement, which was developed with our colleagues in the House, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Joint Explanatory Statement for H.R. 3219, as Amended\n\n       H.R. 3219, as amended, the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, \n     reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the House and \n     Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs (the Committees) on \n     the following bills reported during the 111th Congress: H.R. \n     174; H.R. 466, as amended; H.R. 1037, as amended; H.R. 1088; \n     H.R. 1089, as amended; H.R. 1168, as amended; H.R. 1170, as \n     amended; H.R. 1171, as amended; H.R. 1172, as amended; H.R. \n     2180; H.R. 3219, as amended; H.R. 3949, as amended; H.R. \n     4592, as amended (House Bills); and S. 728, as amended; S. \n     1237, as reported; and S. 3609 (Senate Bills).\n       H.R. 174 passed the House on November 2, 2009; H.R. 466, as \n     amended, passed the House on June 8, 2009; H.R. 1037, as \n     amended, passed the House on July 14, 2009; H.R. 1088 passed \n     the House on May 19, 2009; H.R. 1089, as amended, passed the \n     House on May 19, 2009; H.R. 1168, as amended, passed the \n     House on November 2, 2009; H.R. 1170, as amended, passed the \n     House on May 19, 2009; H.R. 1171, as amended, passed the \n     House on March 30, 2009; H.R. 1172, as amended, passed the \n     House on June 23, 2009; H.R. 3219, as amended, passed the \n     House on July 27, 2009; H.R. 3949, as amended, passed the \n     House on November 3, 2009.

H.R. 1037, as amended, passed the Senate on \n     October 7, 2009.\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     H.R. 3219, as amended, to reflect a Compromise Agreement \n     between the Committees. Differences between the provisions \n     contained in the Compromise Agreement and the related \n     provisions of the House Bills and the Senate Bills are noted \n     in this document, except for clerical corrections, conforming \n     changes made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor \n     drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n       TITLE I--EMPLOYMENT, SMALL BUSINESS, AND EDUCATION MATTERS\n\nExtension and Expansion of Authority for Certain Qualifying Work-Study \n Activities for Purposes of the Educational Assistance Programs of the \n                     Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3485 of title 38, United States Code (U.S.C.), \n     permits certain students enrolled in a program of education \n     to participate in work-study programs. Approved work-study \n     activities are generally activities relating to processing \n     documents or providing services at Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) facilities. However, until June 30, 2010, \n     approved activities also included outreach services provided \n     by State approving agencies, care to veterans in State homes, \n     and activities related to the administration of national or \n     State veterans' cemeteries.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 1037, as amended, would require VA to conduct a five-\n     year pilot program to expand work-study opportunities by \n     adding to the list of approved activities positions in \n     academic departments (including positions as tutors or \n     research, teaching, and lab assistants) and in student \n     services (including positions in career centers and financial \n     aid, campus orientation, cashiers, admissions, records, and \n     registration offices).\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement would extend the \n     authority from June 30, 2010, to June 30, 2013, during which \n     qualifying work-study activities may include assisting with \n     outreach services to servicemembers and veterans furnished by \n     employees of State approving agencies, provision of care to \n     veterans in State homes, and activities related to \n     administration of a national cemetery or State veterans' \n     cemetery. In addition, effective October 1, 2011, it would \n     add to the list of qualifying work-study activities the \n     following:\n       Activities of State veterans agencies helping veterans \n     obtain any benefit under laws administered by VA or States;\n       Positions at Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student \n     Success;\n       Positions working in programs run jointly by VA and an \n     institution of higher learning; and\n       Any other veterans-related position in an institution of \n     higher learning.\n\n      Reauthorization of Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3692 of title 38 provides for the formation of a \n     Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education.

It would \n     clarify that the U.S. Office of Special Counsel has the same \n     authority as the U.S. Department of Labor to conduct \n     investigations and issue subpoenas when investigating USERRA \n     complaints.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement would require the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel to carry \n     out a 36-month demonstration project to start no later than \n     60 days after the Comptroller General submits a report \n     assessing the proposed methods and procedures for the \n     demonstration project; under the demonstration project, \n     certain USERRA claims against Federal executive agencies \n     would be received by or referred to the Office of Special \n     Counsel. It would also allow the Office of Special Counsel to \n     receive and investigate certain claims under USERRA and \n     related prohibited personnel practice claims. Finally, the \n     Compromise Agreement would establish general guidelines for \n     administration of the demonstration project; would require \n     the Department of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel to \n     jointly establish methods and procedures to be used during \n     the demonstration project and submit to Congress a report \n     describing those methods and procedures; would require \n     the Comptroller General to submit to Congress a report \n     assessing those methods and procedures; and would require \n     the Comptroller General to submit to Congress reports on \n     the demonstration project.\n\n               Veterans Energy-Related Employment Program\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law contains no relevant provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 4592, as amended, would create a Veterans Energy-\n     Related Employment Program pilot program, which would award \n     competitive grants to three States for the establishment of a \n     program that would reimburse energy employers for the cost of \n     providing on-the-job training for veterans in the energy \n     sector. The reimbursements would go to employers or labor-\n     management organizations. Each participating State would be \n     required to provide evidence that it can produce such \n     training to serve a population of eligible veterans, has a \n     diverse energy industry, and the ability to carry out such a \n     program, as well as certify that participating veterans would \n     be hired at a wage rate consistent with the standard industry \n     average for jobs that are technically involved and have a \n     skill-set that is not transferable to other non-energy \n     industries. It would authorize appropriations of $10 million \n     a year for five years, beginning in 2011 through 2015.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement would establish a \n     pilot competitive grant program (Veterans Energy-Related \n     Employment Program) as part of the Veterans Workforce \n     Investment Program for up to three States to provide grants \n     to energy employers that train veterans in skills particular \n     to the energy industry. States would need to repay funds not \n     used for the purposes outlined for this pilot program and \n     submit reports on the use of the grant funds to the Secretary \n     of Labor. This section would outline requirements employers \n     must meet to receive funds from a State and would prohibit \n     the use of funds for non-eligible veterans or eligible \n     veterans whose employment is funded through any other \n     governmental program. A report to Congress would be required \n     to be submitted by the Secretary. The administrative costs of \n     the Secretary would be limited to 2 percent of the \n     appropriations for this program and the Secretary of Labor \n     would be permitted to determine the maximum amounts of each \n     grant that may be used for administration and reporting \n     costs. Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement would \n     authorize $1.5 million for the grant program for each of \n     fiscal years 2012 through 2014.\n\n              Pat Tillman Veterans' Scholarship Initiative\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no relevant provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 1172, as amended, would require VA to provide and \n     maintain on its website by June 1, 2010, information \n     regarding scholarships that are available to veterans and \n     family members of deceased veterans. Information to be \n     provided on the website would include a list of organizations \n     offering scholarships and a link to their websites. VA would \n     also be required to notify schools and other organizations of \n     the opportunity to be listed on the website.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 107 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill but requires the VA, by June 1, 2011, to make available \n     on its website a list of organizations that provide \n     scholarships to veterans and their survivors. VA would be \n     required to make reasonable efforts to notify schools and \n     other organizations of the opportunity to be listed on the \n     website.\n\n               TITLE II--HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS MATTERS\n\n Reauthorization of Appropriations for Homeless Veterans Reintegration \n                                Program\n\n     Current Law\n       The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) was \n     initially enacted in 1987 as part of Public Law 100-77, the \n     Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, to expand \n     services beyond food and shelter to homeless veterans. Public \n     Law 107-95, the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance \n     Act of 2001, directed the Secretary of Labor to provide \n     homeless veterans with job training, counseling, and \n     placement services as part of a holistic approach to \n     reintegrating homeless veterans back into society. The \n     authorization of appropriations to carry out this program \n     expired at the end of fiscal year 2009.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 1171, as amended, would reauthorize, \n     through fiscal year 2014, the Department of Labor's HVRP.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill, except that it would reauthorize the HVRP through \n     fiscal year 2011.\n\n      Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless Veterans with Children \n                      Reintegration Grant Program\n\n     Current Law\n       Currently, under section 2021 of title 38, U.S.C., the \n     Secretary of Labor is required to conduct, directly or \n     through grant or contract, the HVRP. Through HVRP, the \n     Secretary selects programs that are appropriate to provide \n     job training, counseling, and placement services (including \n     job readiness, literacy and skills training) to expedite the \n     reintegration of homeless veterans into the labor force. HVRP \n     is administered through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for \n     Veterans' Employment and Training (VETS).\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 1237, as reported, would amend Subchapter \n     III of chapter 20 of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a new \n     section 2021A, entitled ``Grant program for reintegration of \n     homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with \n     children.'' This grant program would differ from the current \n     HVRP grants in that it would be strictly a grant program and \n     would focus specifically on providing services that will \n     assist in the reintegration into the labor force of homeless \n     women veterans and homeless veterans with children. Like the \n     current HVRP grants, services under this new grant program \n     would include job training, counseling, and job placement \n     services, including job readiness, literacy, and skills \n     training. Importantly, it would also include child care \n     services to serve more effectively the target population.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1171, as amended, would amend title 38, \n     U.S.C., adding a new section 2021A, entitled ``Homeless women \n     veterans and homeless veterans with children reintegration \n     grant program.'' That bill would direct the Secretary of \n     Labor to carry out a grant program to provide reintegration \n     services through programs and facilities that emphasize \n     services for homeless women veterans and homeless veterans \n     with children.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House Bill. However, the authorization of appropriations \n     to carry out this program is $1 million for fiscal years 2011 \n     to 2015.\n\n      Specially Adapted Housing Assistive Technology Grant Program\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no current provision in title 38, U.S.C., \n     authorizing grants to develop assistive technology for \n     specially adapted housing. The Specially Adapted Housing \n     (SAH) program was established in 1948 by Public Law 80-702, \n     an act to authorize assistance to certain veterans in \n     acquiring specially adapted housing which they require by \n     reason of their service-connected disabilities. The SAH \n     program provides grants to certain qualifying service-\n     connected disabled veterans to assist them in acquiring \n     suitable housing.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provisions.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 1170, as amended, would authorize a five-year pilot \n     program to promote research and development of adaptive \n     technologies that would be applicable to the SAH program. It \n     would also provide that VA retain a 30 percent interest in \n     any patent approved as a result of funding through this grant \n     program. The bill would further require that VA retain any \n     investment returns from these patents to assist in funding \n     grants, during the duration of this program. It would \n     authorize $2 million per year for purposes of\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n     this grant program; those amounts would be derived from \n     amounts appropriated for VA Medical Services.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House Bill. However, under the Compromise Agreement, the \n     Secretary would not retain any patent rights to the \n     technology developed by any grant recipient, the funding \n     amount would be reduced from $2 million to $1 million per \n     fiscal year to carry out this program, and the funding would \n     now come from amounts appropriated to VA for readjustment \n     benefits, not Medical Services. The effective date of the \n     five-year pilot program would be October 1, 2011.\n\nWaiver of Housing Loan Fee for Certain Veterans With Service-Connected \n                 Disabilities Called to Active Service\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law, section 3729(c)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., states \n     that a loan fee, normally collected from each person \n     obtaining a housing loan guaranteed, insured or made under \n     chapter 37, will be waived for a veteran who is receiving \n     compensation, or who, but for the receipt of retirement pay, \n     would be entitled to receive compensation.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 2180 would waive housing loan fees for certain \n     veterans with service-connected disabilities called back to \n     active service.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill.\n\n           TITLE III--SERVICEMEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT MATTERS\n\n                  Residential and Motor Vehicle Leases\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 305 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) \n     permits the cancellation of motor vehicle leases and \n     prohibits early termination penalties. It also permits \n     cancellation of residential leases, but it does not provide \n     protection from early termination fees.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 3949 would amend subsection (e) of \n     section 305 of SCRA to revise provisions concerning \n     arrearages and other obligations to prohibit a lessor from \n     charging an early termination charge with respect to a \n     residential, professional, business, or agricultural rental \n     lease entered into by a person who subsequently enters \n     military service, or for a servicemember who has received \n     orders for permanent change of station or for deployment in \n     support of a military operation. It would provide that unpaid \n     lease charges shall be paid by the lessee.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     bill.\n\n               Termination of Telephone Service Contracts\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 305A of SCRA permits certain servicemembers the \n     option to request a termination or suspension of their \n     cellular phone contracts if they are deployed outside of the \n     continental United States for a period of not less than 90 \n     days or have a permanent change of duty station within the \n     United States.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 3949 would amend section 305A of the \n     SCRA to allow a servicemember to terminate certain service \n     contracts if the servicemember has received military orders \n     to deploy for a period of not less than 90 days or for a \n     change of duty station to a location that does not support \n     such service. Furthermore, if the terminated contract was for \n     cellular or telephone exchange services, it would allow a \n     servicemember to keep the phone number to the extent \n     practicable and in accordance with applicable law. Covered \n     contracts would include cellular telephone service (including \n     family plans with the servicemember), telephone exchange \n     service, multi-channel video programming service and internet \n     service, as well as home water, electricity, home heating oil \n     and natural gas services. Servicemembers would be required to \n     deliver a written notice of termination of the service \n     contract and the military orders to the service provider by \n     hand delivery, private carrier, fax, or U.S. Postal Service \n     with return receipt requested and sufficient postage. A \n     service provider would be prohibited from imposing an early \n     termination charge, but could collect appropriate tax, \n     obligation or liability under the contract.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement would allow a \n     servicemember to terminate a contract for cellular telephone \n     or telephone exchange service at any time after receiving \n     notice of military orders to relocate for a period of 90 days \n     or more to a location that does not support the contract. It \n     would further require the telephone number of an individual \n     who terminated a contract to be kept available for a period \n     of not to exceed three years if the servicemember re-\n     subscribes to the service within 90 days of the last day of \n     relocation. Finally, section 302 of the Compromise Agreement \n     would permit certain family plan contracts for cellular \n     telephone service entered into by a family member of a \n     servicemember to be terminated.\n\n   Enforcement by the Attorney General and by Private Right of Action\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law contains no relevant provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 203 of H.R. 3949 would amend the SCRA to add a new \n     title, Title VIII--Civil Liability, which would authorize the \n     U.S. Attorney General to bring a civil action in U.S. \n     district court to enforce provisions of the SCRA. It would \n     also authorize the court to grant appropriate relief to \n     include monetary damages. The court would be authorized in \n     certain circumstances to impose a civil penalty that, for the \n     first violation, will not exceed $55,000 and, for any \n     subsequent violation, will not exceed $110,000. It would \n     provide intervenor rights to aggrieved persons for a civil \n     action that has already been started. In addition, it would \n     clarify that a person has a private right of action to file a \n     civil action for violations under the SCRA and that the court \n     may award costs and attorney fees to a servicemember who \n     prevails. Finally, it would provide that the rights granted \n     under sections 801 or 802 will not limit or exclude any other \n     rights that may also be available under Federal or state law.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House bill with some technical changes.\n\n                      TITLE IV--INSURANCE MATTERS\n\n   Increase in Amount of Supplemental Insurance for Totally Disabled \n                                Veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1922A of title allows eligible totally disabled \n     veterans to receive a maximum of $20,000 in Service-Disabled \n     Veterans' Insurance (S-DVI) supplemental life insurance \n     coverage.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     1922A(a) of title 38, U.S.C., to increase the amount of life \n     insurance available to totally disabled veterans by allowing \n     them to purchase an additional $10,000 in supplemental \n     insurance coverage. This would raise the maximum amount of S-\n     DVI supplemental coverage to $30,000.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill, except that the provision would take effect on October \n     1, 2011.\n\nPermanent Extension of Duration of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \n                 Coverage for Totally Disabled Veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       VA offers a variety of life insurance options for \n     servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Among these is \n     the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program, \n     which offers low-cost group life insurance for servicemembers \n     on active duty, Ready Reservists, members of the National \n     Guard, members of the Commissioned Corps of the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Public Health \n     Service, cadets and midshipmen of the four service academies, \n     and members of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. SGLI \n     coverage is available in $50,000 increments up to the maximum \n     of $400,000.\n       Public Law 93-289, the Veterans' Insurance Act of 1974, \n     established a new program of post-separation insurance known \n     as Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI). VGLI provides for \n     the post-service conversion of SGLI to a renewable term \n     policy of insurance. Persons eligible for full-time coverage \n     include former servicemembers who were insured full-time \n     under SGLI and who were released from active duty or the \n     Reserves, Ready Reservists who have part-time SGLI coverage \n     and who incur certain disabilities during periods of active \n     or inactive duty training, and members of the Individual \n     Ready Reserve and Inactive National Guard. VGLI coverage is \n     issued in multiples of $10,000 up to a maximum of $400,000.\n       Under current law, VGLI applications for coverage must \n     occur within one year and 120 days from discharge. However, \n     servicemembers who are totally disabled at the time of \n     discharge may have a longer period within which to convert \n     their SGLI coverage to VGLI. Public Law 109-233, the \n     Veterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of \n     2006, authorized VA to extend from one to two years, after \n     separation from active duty service, the period within which \n     totally disabled members may receive premium free SGLI \n     coverage and convert their coverage to a policy under the \n     VGLI program after separation from active duty service. \n     However, Public Law 109-233 mandated that on or after October \n     1, 2011, this two-year time period would be shortened to 18 \n     months.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of S. 3765 would amend section 1968(a) of title \n     38, U.S.C., to eliminate the expiration date for a potential \n     two-year extension of SGLI coverage available to\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n     servicemembers who are totally disabled when they separate \n     from service.\n     House Bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 3219, as amended, would amend section \n     1968(a) of title 38, U.S.C., to eliminate the expiration date \n     for a potential two-year extension of SGLI coverage available \n     to servicemembers who are totally disabled when they separate \n     from service.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the \n     language in both bills.\n\n Adjustment of Coverage of Dependents Under Servicemembers' Group Life \n                               Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, insurable dependents of servicemembers \n     on active duty, or Ready Reservists who are totally disabled \n     on the date of separation or release from service or \n     assignment, are authorized to continue receiving insurance \n     coverage long after the servicemembers' separation or release \n     from service. Servicemembers on active duty are potentially \n     eligible for continued coverage for up to 2 years after the \n     date of separation or release from service; Ready Reservists \n     are potentially eligible for an additional 1 year of coverage \n     after separation or release from an assignment. Thereafter, \n     the insurable dependents of covered servicemembers on active \n     duty are also potentially eligible for continued coverage for \n     up to 2 years after the date of separation or release from \n     service or, in the case of an insurable dependent of a Ready \n     Reservist, up to 1 year after the date of separation or \n     release from an assignment.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     1968(a)(5)(B)(ii) of title 38, U.S.C., so that no insurable \n     dependent, not even those of servicemembers who remain \n     covered for up to 1 or 2 years after service or assignment, \n     could remain covered under SGLI for more than 120 days after \n     the servicemember's separation or release from service or \n     assignment.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n    Opportunity to Increase Amount of Veterans' Group Life Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1977(a)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., limits the amount \n     of VGLI coverage a veteran may carry to the amount of SGLI \n     coverage that continued in force after that veteran was \n     separated from service.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 3765 would amend section 1977(a) of title \n     38, U.S.C., to allow VGLI participants who are under the age \n     of 60 and insured for less than the current maximum \n     authorized for SGLI the opportunity to obtain, without a \n     health care examination, an additional $25,000 in coverage \n     once every 5 years at the time of renewal.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 3219, as amended, would amend section \n     1977(a) of title 38, U.S.C., to allow VGLI participants who \n     are under the age of 60 and insured for less than the current \n     maximum authorized for SGLI the opportunity to obtain, \n     without a health care examination, an additional $25,000 in \n     coverage once every 5 years at the time of renewal.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement follows the \n     language in both bills.\n\n  Elimination of Reduction in Amount of Accelerated Death Benefit for \n    Terminally Ill Persons Insured Under Servicemembers' Group Life \n              Insurance and Veterans' Group Life Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       The current SGLI/VGLI Accelerated Benefits Option (ABO) \n     requires VA to discount or reduce the payout available under \n     both the SGLI and VGLI programs for terminally ill \n     servicemembers and veterans who exercise the option to use up \n     to half of their policy. Currently, VA discounts this payment \n     by an amount commensurate to the interest rate earned by the \n     program on its investment in effect at the time that a \n     servicemember or veteran applies for the benefits, thereby \n     often significantly reducing the amount of the ABO payment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 103 of H.R. 3219, as amended, would amend section \n     1980(b)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., by eliminating the \n     requirement that the lump sum accelerated payment be \n     ``reduced by an amount necessary to assure that there is no \n     increase in the actuarial value of the benefit paid, as \n     determined by the Secretary.''\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 405 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill.\n\n Consideration of Loss of Dominant Hand in Prescription of Schedule of \nSeverity of Traumatic Injury Under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, traumatic injury protection under \n     Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (TSGLI) provides for \n     payment to servicemembers who suffer a qualifying loss as a \n     result of a traumatic injury event. In the event of a \n     qualifying loss, VA will pay between $25,000 and $100,000, \n     depending on the severity of the qualifying loss. In \n     prescribing payments, VA does not account for the effect, if \n     any, that the loss of a dominant hand has on lengthening \n     hospitalization or rehabilitation periods.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     1980A(d) of title 38, U.S.C., to authorize VA to distinguish \n     in specifying payments for qualifying losses of a dominant \n     hand and a non-dominant hand.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 406 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill except that the provision would take effect on October \n     30, 2011.\n\n            Enhancement of Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, service-connected disabled veterans who \n     have received specially adapted housing grants from VA may \n     purchase up to $90,000 in Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance \n     (VMLI). In the event of the veteran's death, the veteran's \n     family is protected because VA will pay the balance of the \n     mortgage owed up to the maximum amount of insurance \n     purchased.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     2106(b) of title 38, U.S.C., to increase the maximum amount \n     of insurance that may be purchased under the VMLI program \n     from the current maximum of $90,000 to $150,000 effective on \n     October 1, 2012. The maximum amount would then increase from \n     $150,000 to $200,000 on January 1, 2012.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 407 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill, except that the provision would take effect on October \n     1, 2011.\n\n   Expansion of Individuals Qualifying for Retroactive Benefits From \n Traumatic Injury Protection Coverage Under Servicemembers' Group Life \n                               Insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, TSGLI provides coverage against \n     qualifying losses incurred as a result of a traumatic injury. \n     In the event of a loss, VA will pay between $25,000 and \n     $100,000 depending on the severity of the qualifying loss. \n     TSGLI went into effect on December 1, 2005. In order to \n     provide assistance to those servicemembers suffering \n     traumatic injuries on or before October 7, 2001, and November \n     30, 2005, retroactive TSGLI payments were authorized under \n     section 1032(c) of Public Law 109-13, the Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \n     on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, to individuals whose \n     qualifying losses were sustained as ``a direct result of \n     injuries incurred in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom.'' Under section 501(b) of Public Law 109-233, \n     the Veterans' Housing Opportunity Benefits Improvement Act of \n     2006, this definition was amended to allow retroactive \n     payments to individuals whose qualifying losses were \n     sustained as a ``direct result of a traumatic injury incurred \n     in the theater of operations for Operation Enduring Freedom \n     and Operation Iraqi Freedom.''

In addition, VA will pay a \n     $300 plot allowance when a veteran is buried in a cemetery \n     not under U.S. government jurisdiction if: the veteran was \n     discharged from active duty because of a disability incurred \n     or aggravated in the line of duty; the veteran was receiving \n     compensation or pension, or would have been if he/she was not \n     receiving\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n     military retired pay; or the veteran died in a VA facility. \n     The plot allowance may be paid to the State for the cost of a \n     plot or interment in a State-owned cemetery reserved solely \n     for veteran burials if the veteran was buried without charge.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 501 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would increase \n     payments for funeral and burial expenses in the case of \n     individuals who die in VA facilities and for plot allowances \n     up to $745 and would increase this amount annually by a cost-\n     of-living adjustment. These increases would be effective for \n     deaths occurring on or after October 1, 2010, but no cost-of-\n     living adjustment would be paid in fiscal year 2011.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement would increase the \n     amount paid for the burial and funeral of a veteran who dies \n     in a VA facility or the plot allowance for a deceased veteran \n     who is eligible for burial at a national cemetery from $300 \n     to $700, effective October 1, 2011.

Under subsections (m), (n), \n     and (o) of section 1114, higher levels of monthly \n     compensation are paid to veterans with severe disabilities if \n     certain criteria are satisfied. The criteria for compensation \n     under section 1114(m) include ``the anatomical loss . . . of \n     both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing \n     natural knee action with prostheses in place'' or ``the \n     anatomical loss . . . of one arm and one leg at levels, or \n     with complications, preventing natural elbow and knee action \n     with prostheses in place.'' The criteria for compensation \n     under section 1114(n) include ``the anatomical loss . . . of \n     both arms at levels, or with complications, preventing \n     natural elbow action with prostheses in place''; ``the \n     anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent \n     the use of prosthetic appliances''; or ``the anatomical loss \n     of one arm and one leg so near the shoulder and hip as to \n     prevent the use of prosthetic appliances.'' The criteria for \n     compensation under section 1114(o) include ``the anatomical \n     loss of both arms so near the shoulder as to prevent the use \n     of prosthetic appliances.''\n       Currently, the monthly compensation under subsections (a) \n     through (j) of section 1114 ranges from $123 per month for a \n     single veteran with no dependents rated 10 percent to $2,673 \n     per month for the same single veteran rated 100 percent. \n     Under section 1114(l) of title 38, U.S.C., VA provides a \n     higher amount of compensation, currently $3,327 per month for \n     a single veteran, if the veteran is ``in need of regular aid \n     and attendance.'' A veteran who requires regular aid and \n     attendance may be entitled to an additional $2,002 per month, \n     under section 1114(r)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., if the veteran \n     suffers from severe service-connected physical disabilities. \n     Also, under section 1114(r)(2), a higher level of aid and \n     attendance compensation, currently an additional $2,983 per \n     month, is provided to certain veterans with severe service-\n     connected disabilities who need ``a higher level of care'' in \n     addition to regular aid and attendance. Under section \n     1114(r)(2), this higher level of compensation generally is \n     provided only to a veteran who has suffered a severe \n     anatomical loss, who needs ``health-care services provided on \n     a daily basis in the veteran's home,'' and who would require \n     institutionalization in the absence of that care.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 205(a) of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend \n     subsections (m), (n), and (o) of section 1114 to remove the \n     provisions conditioning higher monthly compensation on the \n     site of, or complications from, an anatomical loss. Instead, \n     if the other requirements are satisfied, it would allow the \n     higher rates to be paid if any factors prevent natural elbow \n     or knee action with prostheses in place or prevent the use of \n     prosthetic appliances.\n       Section 205(b) of H.R. 1037, as amended, would add a new \n     subsection (t) to section 1114, which would provide that, if \n     a veteran is in need of regular aid and attendance due to the \n     residuals of traumatic brain injury, is not eligible for \n     compensation under section 1114(r)(2), and, in the absence of \n     regular aid and attendance, would require institutional care, \n     the veteran will be entitled to a monthly aid and attendance \n     allowance equivalent to the allowance provided under section \n     1114(r)(2).\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n    Cost-of-Living Increase for Temporary Dependency and Indemnity \n  Compensation Payable for Surviving Spouses With Dependent Children \n                          Under the Age of 18\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 1310 of title 38, U.S.C., VA provides \n     dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) to a surviving \n     spouse if a veteran's death resulted from: (1) a disease or \n     injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on \n     active duty or active duty for training; (2) an injury \n     incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on inactive \n     duty for training; or (3) a service-connected disability or a \n     condition directly related to a service-connected disability.\n       Section 301 of Public Law 108-454, the Veterans Benefits \n     Improvement Act of 2004, amended section 1311 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., to authorize VA to pay a $250 per month temporary \n     benefit to a surviving spouse with one or more children below \n     the age of 18, during the 2 years following the date on which \n     entitlement to DIC began. This provision was enacted in \n     response to a May 2001 program evaluation report \n     recommendation on the need for transitional DIC.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     1311(f) of title 38, U.S.C., by authorizing a permanent, \n     automatic, cost-of-living adjustment for this temporary DIC \n     payment so that the value of the benefit does not erode over \n     time.\n       This cost-of-living increase would occur whenever there is \n     an increase in benefit amounts payable under title II of the \n     Social Security Act, section 401 et seq., title 42, U.S.C.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     bill.\n\nPayment of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to Survivors of Former \n       Prisoners of War Who Died on or Before September 30, 1999\n\n     Current Law\n       Under chapter 13 of title 38, U.S.C., DIC is paid to the \n     surviving spouse or children of a veteran when the veteran's \n     death is a result of a service-connected disability. In \n     addition, VA provides DIC to the surviving spouses and \n     children of veterans who have died after service from a non-\n     service-connected disability if the veteran had been totally \n     disabled due to a service-connected disability for a \n     continuous period of 10 or more years immediately preceding \n     death or for a continuous period of at least 5 years after \n     the veteran's release from service.\n       Prior to Public Law 106-117, the Veterans Millennium Health \n     Care and Benefits Act,\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n     the survivors of former Prisoners of War (POWs) were eligible \n     for DIC under the same rules as all other survivors. Section \n     501 of Public Law 106-117 extended eligibility for DIC to the \n     survivors of former POWs who died after September 30, 1999, \n     from non-service-connected causes if the former POWs were \n     totally disabled due to a service-connected cause for a \n     period of 1 or more years, rather than 10 or more years, \n     immediately prior to death.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 208 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     1318(b)(3) of title 38, U.S.C., to make all survivors of \n     former POWs eligible for DIC if the veteran died from non-\n     service-connected causes and was totally disabled due to a \n     service-connected condition for a period of 1 or more years \n     immediately prior to death, without regard to date of death.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     bill.\n\nExclusion of Certain Amounts From Consideration as Income for Purposes \n                      of Veterans Pension Benefits\n\n     Current Law\n       Under chapter 15 of title 38, U.S.C., VA is authorized to \n     pay pension benefits to wartime veterans who have limited or \n     no income, and who are ages 65 or older, or, if under 65, who \n     are permanently and totally disabled.\n       When calculating annual income for purposes of these \n     pension benefits, section 1503 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     authorizes VA to include income received by the veteran and \n     from most sources. However, certain sources of income, such \n     as donations from public or private relief or welfare \n     organizations, are not taken into account.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 604 of the Compromise Agreement would exclude, for \n     purposes of determining income for pension eligibility, up to \n     $5,000, paid to a veteran from a State or municipality, if \n     the benefit was paid due to the veteran's injury or disease.\n\n Commencement of Period of Payment of Original Awards of Compensation \n   for Veterans Retired or Separated From the Uniformed Services for \n                        Catastrophic Disability\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 5110(b)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., if a veteran \n     files a claim for VA disability compensation within 1 year \n     after being discharged from military service, the effective \n     date of an award of service connection will be the day after \n     the date of discharge. However, under section 5111(a) of \n     title 38, U.S.C., the effective date for payment of \n     compensation based on that award will not be until the first \n     day of the month following the month in which the service-\n     connection award is effective.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 206 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     5111 of title 38, U.S.C., to provide that, if a veteran is \n     retired from the military for a catastrophic disability or \n     disabilities, payment of disability compensation based on an \n     original claim for benefits will be made as of the date on \n     which the award of compensation becomes effective. \n     ``Catastrophic disability'' would be defined as a permanent, \n     severely disabling injury, disorder, or disease that \n     compromises the ability of the veteran to carry out the \n     activities of daily living to such a degree that the veteran \n     requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home or \n     bed, or requires constant supervision to avoid physical harm \n     to self or others.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 605 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n Applicability of Limitation to Pension Payable to Certain Children of \n                      Veterans of a Period of War\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, a veteran with no dependents who is \n     entitled to receive pension under section 1521 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., cannot be paid more than $90 per month if the veteran \n     is in a nursing facility where services are covered by a \n     Medicaid plan. In instances where a veteran's surviving \n     spouse is entitled to receive pension under section 1541 of \n     title 38, U.S.C., the surviving spouse also cannot be paid \n     more than $90 per month if the surviving spouse has no \n     dependents and is in a nursing facility where services are \n     covered by a Medicaid plan. The $90 pension benefit may not \n     be counted in determining eligibility for Medicaid or the \n     patient's share of cost.\n       Under section 101(4)(A) of title 38, U.S.C., a child is \n     defined as a person who is unmarried and under the age of 18 \n     years; before reaching the age of 18 years, became \n     permanently incapable of self-support; or, after attaining \n     the age of 18 years and until completion of education or \n     training, but not after attaining the age of 23 years, is \n     pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational \n     institution.

However, it does not address what would occur in \n     the event an individual files for bankruptcy and a loan is \n     modified under the authority provided under section 1322(b) \n     of title 11.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 304 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     3732(a)(2) by adding a new subparagraph that would authorize \n     additional default procedures for VA home loans in the event \n     that a VA home loan is modified under the authority provided \n     under section 1322(b) of title 11. This new authority would \n     allow VA to pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid \n     balance of the obligation, plus accrued interest, due as of \n     the date of the filing of the petition under title 11, but \n     only upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery to VA in a \n     form and manner satisfactory to VA of all rights, interest, \n     claims, evidence, and records with respect to the housing \n     loan.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 802 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n Eligibility of Disabled Veterans and Members of the Armed Forces With \n      Severe Burn Injuries for Automobiles and Adaptive Equipment\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 3901 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     veterans and members of the Armed Forces are eligible for \n     assistance with automobiles and adaptive equipment if they \n     suffer from one of three qualifying service-connected \n     disabilities: loss or permanent loss of use of one or both \n     feet; loss or permanent loss of use of one or both hands; or \n     a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less or a peripheral \n     field of vision of 20 degrees or less.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 302 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would amend section \n     3901 of title 38, U.S.C., so as to include individuals with a \n     service-connected disability due to a severe burn injury, \n     effective October 1, 2010.

Section 303 would also direct VA \n     to establish a method of determining the average retail cost \n     of new automobiles for the preceding calendar year. The \n     maximum allowance would increase, effective October 1 of each \n     fiscal year, beginning in 2011, to an amount equal to 80 \n     percent of what VA determined to be the average retail cost \n     of new automobiles for the preceding calendar year.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 804 of the Compromise Agreement would generally \n     follow the Senate Bill. However, the amount of the allowance \n     was increased to $18,900 instead of $22,500. This allowance \n     would be adjusted October 1 of each year, beginning in 2011, \n     by a percentage equal to the percentage by which the Consumer \n     Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) \n     increased during the 12-month period ending with the last \n     month for which Consumer Price Index data is available. If \n     the Consumer Price Index does not increase, the amount of the \n     allowance will remain the same as the previous fiscal year.\n\n   National Academies Review of Best Treatments for Gulf War Illness\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law contains no relevant provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 601 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would require VA to \n     contract with the Institute of Medicine to gather a group of \n     medical professionals, who are experienced in treating \n     individuals diagnosed with Gulf War Illness, in order to \n     conduct a comprehensive review of the best treatments for \n     this illness. The individuals these medical professionals \n     must have experience treating must have served during the \n     Persian Gulf War in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, \n     or in Afghanistan, Iraq, or any other theater in which the \n     Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal is awarded for \n     service.\n       The final report on the review required by this section \n     must be submitted to VA and the House and Senate Committees \n     on Veterans' Affairs by December 31, 2011, and include \n     recommendations for legislative or administrative actions as \n     the Institute of Medicine considers appropriate in light of \n     the results of that review.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 805 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate Bill except that the final report is due to the \n     Committees by December 31, 2012, and the term ``chronic \n     multisymptom illness'' replaces the term ``Gulf War \n     Illness.''\n\nExtension and Modification of National Academy of Sciences Reviews and \n Evaluations on Illness and Service in Persian Gulf War and Post 9/11 \n                       Global Operations Theaters\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, required VA to enter \n     into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to \n     review and evaluate the available scientific evidence \n     regarding associations between illnesses and exposure to \n     toxic agents, environmental or wartime hazards, or preventive \n     medicines or vaccines associated with Persian Gulf War \n     service. Congress extended these reviews and evaluations in \n     Public Law 107-103, the Veterans Education and Benefits \n     Expansion Act of 2001. This requirement will expire on \n     October 1, 2010.\n       Public Law 105-368, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act \n     of 1998, required the National Academy of Sciences to examine \n     the scientific and medical literature on the potential health \n     effects of chemical and biological agents related to the 1991 \n     Gulf War. The requirement for this examination ended in 2009.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 602 of H.R. 1037, as amended, would extend until \n     October 1, 2015, the mandate for\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\n     the National Academy of Sciences to review and evaluate \n     scientific evidence regarding associations between illnesses \n     and exposure.

This report would \n     also include an assessment of the costs and benefits of \n     maintaining the office in the Philippines in comparison with \n     moving the activities of the office to the United States.\n\n           Extension of an Annual Report on Equitable Relief\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, VA is authorized to provide monetary \n     relief to persons whom the Secretary determines were deprived \n     of VA benefits by reason of administrative error by a federal \n     government employee. The Secretary may also provide relief \n     which the Secretary determines is equitable to a VA \n     beneficiary who has suffered a loss as a consequence of an \n     erroneous decision made by a federal government employee. No \n     later than April 1 of each year, the Secretary was required \n     to submit to Congress a report containing a statement as to \n     the disposition of each case recommended to the Secretary for \n     equitable relief during the preceding calendar year; the \n     requirement for this report was extended through December 31, \n     2009, by Public Law 109-233, the Veterans' Housing \n     Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contains no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement extends the requirement for the \n     report on equitable relief through December 31, 2014.\n\n  Authority for the Performance of Medical Disability Examinations by \n                          Contract Physicians\n\n     Current Law\n       In 1996, in Public Law 104-275, the Veterans' Benefits \n     Improvements Act of 1996, VA was authorized to carry out a \n     pilot program of contract disability examinations through ten \n     VA regional offices using amounts available for payment of \n     compensation and pensions. During the initial pilot program, \n     one contractor performed all contract examinations at the ten \n     selected regional offices.\n       Subsequently, in 2003, in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans \n     Benefits Act of 2003, VA was given additional, time-limited \n     authority to contract for disability examinations using other \n     appropriated funds. That initial authority was extended until \n     December 31, 2010, by Public Law 110-389, the Veterans' \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. VA continues to report high \n     demand for compensation and pension examinations and \n     satisfaction with the contracted examinations.\n     Senate Bill\n       S. 3609 would extend VA's authority, through December 31, \n     2012, to use appropriated funds for the purpose of \n     contracting with non-VA providers to conduct disability \n     examinations.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe inaugural USA Science & Engineering Festival.\n  As the only serving Senator who has worked as an engineer, I am proud \nto sponsor a resolution acknowledging the importance of science and \nengineering education.\n  I would also like to thank Majority Leader Reid and Senators Akaka, \nBaucus, and Rockefeller for joining me in introducing this resolution.\n  I have spoken many times on the Senate floor about the need to \ninspire a new generation of graduates educated in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, or STEM. According to a report released \nlast week by the National Academy of Sciences, the United States ranks \n27th among developed nations in the proportion of college students \nreceiving undergraduate degrees in engineering or science. This trend \nmust be reversed.\n  Last year, the science community of greater San Diego recognized this \nneed and launched the inaugural San Diego Science Festival. According \nto the festival's Web site, part of its mission was to demonstrate to \nstudents that careers in STEM are ``interesting, accessible, and a \npathway to a better future.'' By all accounts, the San Diego Science \nFestival was sensational and attracted more than 500,000 participants \nwhich inspired a national STEM effort--the USA Science & Engineering \nFestival.\n  Hosted by Lockheed Martin, the USA Science & Engineering Festival is \na grassroots collaboration of over 500 of the Nation's leading science \norganizations, including professional science and engineering \nsocieties, universities, government agencies, industry partners, and K-\n12 schools working to reinvigorate young people's interest in STEM. It \nalso has a strong advisory board including Nobel Laureates, leaders of \nFortune 100 technology and science companies, innovators, scientists, \nand STEM educators.\n  The festival launches in the Washington, DC area on October 10 and \nculminates in a 2-day expo on the National Mall on October 23 and 24. \nIt will feature more than 1,500 hands-on activities and more than 75 \nstage shows. At the same time, dozens of satellite locations will be \nhosting festival events across the country. This first-ever national \nscience festival is gearing up to be an extremely successful event.\n  I believe that encouraging more students to pursue careers in the \nSTEM fields, particularly young women and underrepresented minorities, \nis necessary to maintaining our economic and global competitiveness. \nCountries around the world have held science festivals in support of \nSTEM education and I am so pleased that the United States is on the eve \nof doing the same.

Res. 656\n\n       Whereas the global economy of the future will require a \n     workforce that is educated in the fields of science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``STEM'');\n       Whereas a new generation of American students educated in \n     STEM is crucial to ensure continued economic growth;\n       Whereas advances in technology have resulted in significant \n     improvements in the daily lives of the people of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas scientific discoveries are critical to curing \n     diseases, solving global challenges, and expanding our \n     understanding of the world;\n       Whereas strengthening the interest of American students, \n     particularly young women and underrepresented minorities, in \n     STEM education is necessary to maintain the global \n     competitiveness of the United States;\n       Whereas countries around the world have held science \n     festivals that have brought together hundreds of thousands of \n     visitors to celebrate science;\n       Whereas the inaugural 2009 San Diego Science Festival \n     attracted more than 500,000 participants and inspired a \n     national STEM effort;\n       Whereas the mission of the USA Science & Engineering \n     Festival is to reinvigorate the interest of the young people \n     of the United States in STEM by producing exciting and \n     educational science and engineering gatherings; and\n       Whereas thousands of individuals from universities, museums \n     and science centers, STEM professional societies, educational \n     societies, government agencies and laboratories, community \n     organizations, K-12 schools, volunteers, corporate and \n     private sponsors, and nonprofit organizations have come \n     together to organize the inaugural USA Science & Engineering \n     Festival across the United States, including a 2-day \n     exposition on the National Mall that will feature more than \n     1,500 hands-on activities and more than 75 stage shows: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the support of the Senate for the inaugural \n     USA Science & Engineering Festival to be held in October 2010 \n     in Washington, D.C.;\n       (2) commends the Nobel Laureates, institutions of higher \n     education, corporate sponsors, and all the various \n     organizations whose efforts will make the USA Science & \n     Engineering Festival possible; and\n       (3) encourages students and their families to participate \n     in the activities which will take place on the National Mall \n     and across the United States at satellite locations as part \n     of the inaugural USA Science & Engineering Festival.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe inaugural USA Science & Engineering Festival.\n  As the only serving Senator who has worked as an engineer, I am proud \nto sponsor a resolution acknowledging the importance of science and \nengineering education.\n  I would also like to thank Majority Leader Reid and Senators Akaka, \nBaucus, and Rockefeller for joining me in introducing this resolution.\n  I have spoken many times on the Senate floor about the need to \ninspire a new generation of graduates educated in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, or STEM. According to a report released \nlast week by the National Academy of Sciences, the United States ranks \n27th among developed nations in the proportion of college students \nreceiving undergraduate degrees in engineering or science. This trend \nmust be reversed.\n  Last year, the science community of greater San Diego recognized this \nneed and launched the inaugural San Diego Science Festival. According \nto the festival's Web site, part of its mission was to demonstrate to \nstudents that careers in STEM are ``interesting, accessible, and a \npathway to a better future.'' By all accounts, the San Diego Science \nFestival was sensational and attracted more than 500,000 participants \nwhich inspired a national STEM effort--the USA Science & Engineering \nFestival.\n  Hosted by Lockheed Martin, the USA Science & Engineering Festival is \na grassroots collaboration of over 500 of the Nation's leading science \norganizations, including professional science and engineering \nsocieties, universities, government agencies, industry partners, and K-\n12 schools working to reinvigorate young people's interest in STEM. It \nalso has a strong advisory board including Nobel Laureates, leaders of \nFortune 100 technology and science companies, innovators, scientists, \nand STEM educators.\n  The festival launches in the Washington, DC area on October 10 and \nculminates in a 2-day expo on the National Mall on October 23 and 24. \nIt will feature more than 1,500 hands-on activities and more than 75 \nstage shows. At the same time, dozens of satellite locations will be \nhosting festival events across the country. This first-ever national \nscience festival is gearing up to be an extremely successful event.\n  I believe that encouraging more students to pursue careers in the \nSTEM fields, particularly young women and underrepresented minorities, \nis necessary to maintaining our economic and global competitiveness. \nCountries around the world have held science festivals in support of \nSTEM education and I am so pleased that the United States is on the eve \nof doing the same. I commend those individuals who are working hard to \nmake the USA Science & Engineering Festival a success and I encourage \nstudents and families across the country to participate in this \nextraordinary event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7667-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7667-S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEDICATION OF THE HOOVER DAM\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 657\n\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam, a concrete arch-gravity storage \n     dam, was built in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River \n     between the States of Nevada and Arizona, forever changing \n     how water is managed across the West;\n       Whereas, on September 30, 1935, President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt dedicated the Hoover Dam;\n       Whereas the construction of the Hoover Dam created Lake \n     Mead, a reservoir that can store an amount of water that is \n     equal to 2 years average flow of the Colorado River;\n       Whereas the construction of the Hoover Dam provided vitally \n     critical flood control, water supply, and electrical power \n     and helped to create and support the economic growth and \n     development of the Southwestern United States;\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam has prevented an estimated \n     $50,000,000,000 in flood damages in the Lower Colorado River \n     Basin;\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam provides water for more than \n     18,000,000 people and 1,000,000 acres of farmland in the \n     States of Arizona, California, and Nevada and 500,000 acres \n     of farmland in Mexico, as well as produces an average of \n     4,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each \n     year;\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam, an engineering marvel at 726.4 feet \n     from bedrock to crest, was the highest dam in the world at \n     the time the Hoover Dam was constructed;\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam is an enduring symbol of the \n     ingenuity of the United States and the persistence of \n     hardworking Americans during the Great Depression;\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam is the model for major water \n     management projects around the world; and\n       Whereas the Hoover Dam is registered as a National Historic \n     Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places and is \n     considered 1 of 7 modern engineering wonders by the American \n     Society of Civil Engineers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates and acknowledges the thousands of workers \n     and families that overcame difficult working conditions and \n     great challenges to make construction of the Hoover Dam \n     possible;\n       (2) celebrates and acknowledges the economic, cultural, and \n     historic significance of the Hoover Dam;\n       (3) recognizes the past, present, and future benefits of \n     the construction of the Hoover Dam to the agricultural, \n     industrial, and urban development of the Southwestern United \n     States; and\n       (4) joins the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, and \n     the people of the United States in celebrating the 75th \n     anniversary of the dedication of the Hoover Dam.\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7668-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 658\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 17, 2010, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I resubmitted a \nresolution designating the third week of October as National Character \nCounts Week. Last year, Senator Grassley and I worked together on the \nissue of character education, and I am pleased to continue to designate \na special week to this cause. I hope that with this resolution we may \nhighlight the importance of character building activities in schools \nnot only this week but all year long.\n  Since 1994, when the Partnerships in Character Education Pilot \nProject was first established, I have worked to commemorate National \nCharacter Counts Week. Character Counts was founded on a simple notion: \nour core ethical values are not just important to us as individuals--\nthey form the very foundation of democratic society. We know that in \norder to face our challenges as communities and as a Nation, we need \nour children to be both well-educated and trained--and that begins with \ninstilling character in our children. Trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship--these are the six \npillars of character.\n  Character education provides students a context within which to learn \nthose values and integrate them into our daily lives. Indeed, if we \nview education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our children, \nthen we not only miss an opportunity, but we also jeopardize our \nfuture.\n  The American public wants character education in our schools, too. \nStudies show that approximately 90 percent of Americans support schools \nteaching character education. Character education programs work. \nCurrently, there are character education programs across all 50 States \nin rural, urban and suburban areas at every grade level. Schools across \nthe country that have adopted strong character education programs \nreport better student performance, fewer discipline problems, and \nincreased student involvement within the community.\n  This renewed focus on character sends a wonderful message to \nAmericans and will help reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved. With this resolution, it is my hope that even more \ncommunities will make character education a part of every child's life. \nI hope that my colleagues will support this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7668-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7668-S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPPORTING ``LIGHTS ON AFTERSCHOOL''\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 659\n\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences that help \n     children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs support working \n     families by ensuring that the children in such families are \n     safe and productive after the regular school day ends;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs build stronger \n     communities by involving students, parents, business leaders, \n     and adult volunteers in the lives of the youth of the Nation, \n     thereby promoting positive relationships among children, \n     youth, families, and adults;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     well-being of the children in the United States;\n       Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration \n     of afterschool programs held on October 21, 2010, highlights \n     the critical importance of high-quality afterschool programs \n     in the lives of children, their families, and their \n     communities;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home and 15,100,000 \n     children in the United States have no place to go after \n     school; and\n       Whereas many afterschool programs across the United States \n     are struggling to keep their doors open and their lights on: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of \n     afterschool programs.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I have submitted a \nresolution designating October 21, 2010, Lights On Afterschool Day. \nLights On Afterschool brings students, parents, educators, lawmakers, \nand community and business leaders together to celebrate afterschool \nprograms. This year, more than 1 million Americans are expected to \nattend about 7,500 events designed to raise awareness and support for \nthese much needed programs.\n  In America today, one in four youth--more than 15 million children--\ngo home alone after the school day ends. This includes more than 40,000 \nkindergartners and almost 4 million middle school students in grades \nsix to eight. On the other hand, only 8.4 million children, or \napproximately 15 percent of school-aged children, participate in \nafterschool programs. An additional 18.5 million would participate if a \nquality program were available in their community.\n  Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool \nprograms, is celebrated every October in communities nationwide to call \nattention to the importance of afterschool programs for America's \nchildren, families and communities. Lights On Afterschool was launched \nin October 2000\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nwith celebrations in more than 1,200 communities nationwide. The event \nhas grown from 1,200 celebrations in 2001 to more than 7,500 today. \nThis October, 1 million Americans will celebrate Lights On Afterschool.\n  Mr. President, quality afterschool programs should be available to \nchildren in all communities. These programs support working families \nand prevent kids from being both victims and perpetrators of violent \ncrime. They also help parents in balancing work and home-life. Quality \nafterschool programs help to engage students in their communities, and \nwhen students are engaged, they are more successful in their \neducational endeavors.\n  As co-chairmen of the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I \nhave been working for more than 5 years to impress upon our colleagues \nthe importance of afterschool programming. It is our hope that they \nwill join us on October 21 to celebrate the importance of afterschool \nprograms in their communities back home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "28", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/28/senate-section/article/S7669-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY PROGRAM PROMOTING \n   ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS\n\n  The resolution (S.
