Madam President, I rise with some of my colleagues today \nto discuss one of the issues that is going to have a huge impact on how \nthis health care issue is resolved or not resolved; that is, the \nquestion of what reconciliation is and what it implies relative to the \nlegislative process.\n  ``Reconciliation'' is an arcane term. It is a term that is tied to \nand created by the Budget Act under which we function in the Congress. \nIt is ironic that the use of reconciliation would become the central \neffort in buying votes in the House of Representatives in order to pass \nthe big, the giant health care bill, known as the Senate health care \nbill--which bill, as we all know, expands the size of government by \n$2.3 trillion and, in fact, we understand now there is a new score from \nCBO which is going to raise that number even further when it is \naccurately reflected.\n  It takes the government and puts it into basically the business of \ndelivering health care in this country in a way that is extraordinarily \nintrusive and will cost a lot of people who are on private insurance--\nthe insurance they have--which they probably feel fairly comfortable \nwith although it may be very expensive--and it still leaves 23 million \nAmericans uninsured while claiming to do a better job of insuring \nAmericans and improving our health care system when, in fact, what it \ndoes\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nis create massive debt that will be passed on to our children which \nthey cannot and will not be able to afford, explodes the size of \ngovernment and, in my opinion, will lead to a diminution of quality of \ncare in this country.\n  The way this big bill, which I outlined in the thumbnail process, is \ngoing to be passed in the House of Representatives is to have a trailer \nbill called a reconciliation bill, which is an art form developed \naround here relative to the budget process which is supposed to be used \nfor very specific efforts, certainly not for the purpose of buying \nvotes from the liberal constituencies in the House or to pass a bigger \nbill. But that bill needs to be discussed as to what its implications \nare.\n  A number of us have come to the floor of the Senate today to try to \nexplain what the reconciliation bill is and how it has historically \nbeen used but what the implications are relative to some of the things \nin the bigger Senate bill, in the giant bill, the giant spending bill; \nwhat the implications of the reconciliation changes in the \nreconciliation trailer bill will be on the bigger Senate bill, and what \nthe representations that are being made are and whether they are \naccurate.\n  Specifically, let's take one issue, and that is what is known as the \nCadillac tax. The tax on Cadillac policies, which is the appropriate \nway to describe this, is a proposal which was in the Senate bill to \nbasically eliminate the deductibility for health insurance policies \nthat exceeded a certain level of cost--$27,000, I believe, is the \nnumber. To the extent an insurance policy paid for by an employer \nexceeds that number in cost, the excess in amount--let's say it costs \n$32,000 a year for an employer to have an insurance policy for you. \nThat sounds like a lot of money, but actually there are a number that \ncost that much, especially of union programs. To the extent the \ndifference between the $27,000 and the $30,000 is paid for by your \nemployer, that will no longer be deductible by the employer as an \nexpense. It is done in a more complex way, but that is basically the \nway it works out.\n  The effect of that is fairly significant on what is known as the \nSocial Security trust fund because it actually creates a situation \nwhere there will be more taxable wages, which will mean that the Social \nSecurity trust fund will be getting more tax revenue.\n  This brings into play the question of whether you can even bring \nforward language of this type which affects the Social Security trust \nfund through the taxing of Cadillac policies in a reconciliation bill. \nI think this needs to be discussed because of a very important issue as \nto whether the House Members are being told correctly how this will be \ndealt with in the Senate.\n  I know my colleague wants to speak to the issue.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask my colleague, it seems to me, as he \ndescribed this reconciliation trailer bill that the House will use, \nfirst, to try to fix elements of the Senate bill they do not like, and \nthen that reconciliation bill would come back to the Senate, I ask the \nSenator: Is it not true that the House and Senate already passed their \nhealth care bills? Why then is this second vehicle, this reconciliation \nbill necessary?\n  It seems to me at least the House, if it were to vote on the Senate-\npassed bill, that would put into law most of the provisions that are \nincluded in that bill. So why is the second process necessary, I ask my \ncolleague from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. GREGG. It appears that the House Democratic membership is, first, \nafraid to vote on the bill. They are actually going to ``deem'' this, \nit appears, versus vote on it, which is an incredible act of political \ncowardice, in my opinion.\n  Secondly, they definitely do not want to go to conference. They do \nnot want to do what the traditional process around here calls for. When \nyou have two different bills--a Senate bill and a House bill--we take \nthem to conference and discuss those bills and come out with a final \nbill. Why don't they want to do that? Because they know they cannot \npass the final bill in the Senate. To get around that, they developed \nthis policy of reconciliation as a trailer bill so they will send back \nthe reconciliation bill to be voted on here--not on the big bill, a \n$2.5 trillion bill. Thus, not only will they avoid a vote in the House \non the big bill, they will avoid having to go to conference, and they \nwill have basically bypassed the constitutional process in this manner.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I have heard \nthis process whereby the House is going to deem the Senate bill passed \nand then pass a reconciliation bill which will then be sent over to the \nSenate as Speaker Pelosi is asking Members of the House to hold hands \nand jump off a political cliff, hoping the Senate will catch them by \npassing the reconciliation bill unaltered or just in the same form that \nit passed the House. But is it not true that complications arise in \nsection 313 of the Congressional Budget Act because of the Byrd rule?\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the Byrd rule, what points of order \nmight be appropriate in the Senate. I wonder if the Senator--he touched \non this a moment ago--would explain, with 41 Senators agreeing to \nsustain all points of order in the Senate, how many different holes can \nbe punched in the reconciliation bill passed by the House when points \nof order are sustained.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned the Cadillac tax. I note \nthat the president of AFL-CIO was visiting with President Obama at the \nWhite House on Wednesday seeking further reassurances that the tax on \nthe Cadillac plans would be deferred, and presumably that would be part \nof the reconciliation bill.\n  Can the Senator from New Hampshire explain what kind of jeopardy the \nByrd rule and points of order call into play that would make it \nunlikely that the President's promise to defer the tax on union \nCadillac plans could pass the Senate?\n  Mr. GREGG. In order to buy votes, as I understand it, in the House--\nand this is basically a vote-buying exercise--the reconciliation bill, \nin order to buy votes, they are going to put changes to the Senate bill \nin the reconciliation bill, and then send the reconciliation bill back \nhere to be voted on, on the theory that it only takes 51 votes to pass \nit.\n\n  The only problem with that approach is that a reconciliation bill is \npart of the budget process and has very strict limitations on what can \nbe in it. So much of what they are talking about putting in the \nreconciliation bill may well be knocked out in the Senate.\n  For example, the Senator from Texas mentioned the Cadillac tax. If in \nany way the Cadillac policy tax language impacts Social Security, it \nwill be subject to a point of order. In fact, it will be subject to two \npoints of order in the Senate, and it will take 60 votes to overwhelm \nthat point of order. Therefore, since 41 members of the Republican \nParty have signed a letter saying we are going to sustain the rules of \nthe Senate, we are going to stand by the laws that govern the Senate, \nthe procedures here, that language will be knocked out.\n  What is being represented to House Democrats as a way to get their \nvote, to vote for the big bill which is to change the language relative \nto the Cadillac policy tax in the smaller bill, the reconciliation \nbill, that probably will not survive the process and will probably be \nknocked out on a procedural move, a procedural challenge on the Senate \nfloor because it is inconsistent with the Senate rules.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will allow me another question to clarify \na point he made, and then certainly turn to the Senator from South \nDakota, the point of order we are talking about, is it true that under \nsection 313(B)(1)(F), that provision, that specific provision could \ndrop out of the bill, but under a separate point of order under section \n310(g) of the Congressional Budget Act, it could literally bring down \nthe entire bill? Is that a correct reading of the Congressional Budget \nAct?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Texas understands the rules very well. A \n310(g) challenge--to put it in understandable language--is a challenge \nthat says it affects Social Security. The language affects Social \nSecurity. If the Cadillac policy tax impacts the Social Security trust \nfund, which, in my opinion, it does, and the Parliamentarian rules that \nit does, then the entire bill will fall.\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me, if I might, explore this a little further with the \nSenator from New Hampshire and follow up with a question that the \nSenator from Texas asked.\n  As I understand this then, the Cadillac tax provisions that were in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nSenate bill--and that bill is now over in the House and going to be \nvoted on--because of the changes that have been proposed to it now, it \nwould delay the implementation of the Cadillac tax. Of course, the \nCadillac tax, as the Senator from New Hampshire explained, would cap \nthe amount of health care benefits that would be tax free, essentially, \nso above and beyond that would then become taxable. There is an \nassumption made that there would be a shift from health care benefits \nfrom employers to cash compensation, which would be taxable and \ngenerate more payroll tax revenues. That was the Senate bill as it \npassed here. The additions or modifications that are being considered \nin the House would delay the implementation date. Therefore, there is a \nlot of payroll tax revenue that would be coming in under Social \nSecurity that would no longer be realized or at least not be realized \nuntil the year 2018, which affects the amount of revenue that would be \ncoming in under the Senate-passed bill, if these changes are adopted.\n  As I understand what the Senator from New Hampshire is saying, that \nwill impact Social Security revenues. Those are payroll tax revenues, \nand any changes that are made to Social Security create a violation of \nthe reconciliation process in the Senate--the Byrd rule, as the Senator \nfrom Texas referred to--and, therefore, a point of order would lie \nagainst that reconciliation bill when it comes back over here.\n  The majority, I assume, would move to waive that point of order, but \nwhat happens if that point of order is not waived? If the majority is \nnot successful in having that point of order waived, what happens to \nthat reconciliation bill, which at that time would be under \nconsideration in the Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, there are two points of order available. One is the \nByrd point of order. If that were not waived, that section would go out \nof the bill. So people interested in that section, who used that \nsection as the reason they were justifying voting for the bigger bill, \nthat section would not survive. So they would have been sold a bill of \ngoods.\n  The second point of order would take down the whole bill, and it \nwould lose its reconciliation protections, which would mean the bill \nwould require 60 votes to pass here. I can absolutely guarantee you it \ncould not get 60 votes to pass. So you could presume the entire \nreconciliation bill would be dead. Again, people who are relying on the \nreconciliation bill in the House of Representatives--House Members on \nthe Democratic side who are being told we will fix it in \nreconciliation--may well be being sold a bill of goods, if it is \ndetermined that some of this reconciliation language affects Social \nSecurity because it is very likely the entire bill will go down in the \nSenate because it will violate our Senate rules.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Following up with what the Senator from New Hampshire is \nsaying by ``being sold a bill of goods,'' is he suggesting the \nleadership in the House and Speaker Pelosi are guaranteeing to House \nMembers that the bill they pass--the reconciliation bill--will pass the \nSenate intact and, thus, they will have political cover from their \nconstituents who don't like this bill, but they will be able to shape \nand affect the final outcome?\n  Is the Senator from New Hampshire suggesting that because the 41 \nSenators who have said we will vote against waiving any budget points \nof order, that there will either be holes punched in that \nreconciliation bill that will make it impossible for the Speaker to \nkeep her promise to the House Members ultimately or that it will bring \ndown the bill entirely? Is that what the Senator is saying when he \ntalks about selling them a bill of goods?\n  Mr. GREGG. Essentially, what I am saying is--and the Senator from \nTexas has certainly put it in context--the only reason they could \npossibly be using this vehicle, this reconciliation vehicle, this \nextraordinary process is because they are using it to get people to \nvote for the bigger bill that they do not like, and they are claiming \nthat bigger bill will be improved by this reconciliation vehicle. Yet \nit is pretty obvious that the reconciliation vehicle, when it comes \nover here, is going to be punched through and through with holes \nbecause it will violate the rules of the Senate on issues such as this.\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is particularly true of the promise the President \nhas apparently made to union leadership to defer the application of a \nCadillac tax--the excise tax on Cadillac health insurance plans. That \npromise, as the promise to televise the negotiations and pass the bill \non C-SPAN; the promise that if you have a policy you like, you can keep \nit; the promise that the bill would not raise taxes and the like; that \nwould be another promise that would not be kept--that promise would be \nbroken?\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be like a ``the check is in the mail'' type \npromise. I would not take it with a serious grain of salt.\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, is it possible, I would ask both my colleagues, that \nthe process the House is using--and by the way, this deeming the bill \npassed seems to be a very curious way of trying to pass legislation of \nthis consequence, which literally impacts one-sixth of our economy and \nliterally impacts every American in a very personal way--is meant to \nsomehow divorce themselves from the accountability or the \nresponsibility that comes with voting for this in the House; therefore, \nthey are going to use this deeming provision that would essentially \npass this bill without having to have a recorded voted on it? By the \nway, I find that incredibly ironic for a legislative body, which is \nsupposed to be about debating and voting on legislation.\n  But let's assume that happens and they pass the Senate bill and then \nattach this reconciliation vehicle, which both my colleagues have \nreferred to. Then it comes over here and these points of order that \nhave been raised against the bill, which the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from New Hampshire have both referred to--the Byrd point of \norder and this section 310(g), if that point of order is raised and the \nChair sustains it, I guess--or essentially validates that is a valid \npoint of order--there would be a motion to waive it. But this point of \norder on this extraneous Social Security provision that could be raised \nagainst the bill would sink the bill entirely, as I understand what the \nSenator from New Hampshire is saying. This other--the Byrd rule point \nof order--would punch holes in it, but it would, in any case, have to \ngo back to the House of Representatives.\n  So if you are a Member of the House of Representatives, the best you \ncan hope for is that you are going to get a bill back to the House that \nhas a lot of provisions you cared about knocked out. The worst is that \nit might completely tube that process in the Senate, if this point of \norder, the Social Security point of order that could be raised against \nit, is actually not waived by the Senate. Our Republican Senators--41 \nof us--have signed a letter saying we will oppose waiving points of \norder that are raised against the reconciliation bill when it gets to \nthe Senate.\n  I guess my question for my colleagues is: Under that type of \nscenario, what happens next? Do the House Members who are going to be \nvoting for this, assuming the Senate will fix all these things, then \nhave to have that bill come back? Is there any way in which all these \nfixes that they hope are going to be eventually attached to the Senate-\npassed bill will be attached or that these things they hope to fix in \nthis bill are going to be fixed?\n\n  It seems to me it is very curious that they are betting on the come, \nso to speak, and trusting the Senate to fix these things and that is an \nincredible leap of faith.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I think the Senator explained it very clearly. Put in \nthis larger context, can you imagine being asked to cast a career-\nending vote because the people in your district hate this bill. Yet you \nare following Speaker Pelosi's instructions to vote for it and defying \nthe wishes of your constituents. Can you imagine doing it in the \ncontext where there is so little certainty as to the outcome because of \nthis reconciliation process and the Byrd rule and the points of order \nwe have talked about.\n  Put that also in the larger context that the Senator mentioned of the \ndeeming of the bill passed. I think that is clearly unconstitutional. \nHave you ever heard of a bill becoming law that wasn't passed by the \nHouse and the Senate? There have been legal scholars who have written \nthis is clearly unconstitutional. I imagine there is going to be \nmonths, perhaps years, of litigation,\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\npossibly even going to the U.S. Supreme Court, challenging this bizarre \n``Alice in Wonderland'' procedure known as deeming the bill passed. \nHave you ever heard of such a thing?\n  Mr. GREGG. The concept where you would take the most important piece \nof legislation dealing with domestic policy in this country in the last \n50 years and not vote on it is an affront to the purpose of a \nconstitutional democracy. We are sent to the Senate to vote on a lot of \nissues and a lot of them not quite as significant as this one. But if \nyou have the most significant issue you are going to possibly ever have \nbefore you, certainly in my career, you would expect that you would \nwant to vote because you would want to express yourself.\n  I mean, why did you run for this job? Why did you want to serve your \nconstituents if you were not willing to stand on something of this \nimportance?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The hour of 10:10 has arrived.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, I wished to review a couple points with \nregard to where we are on health care.

We have a lot of discussions in the Senate and throughout \nWashington on process and procedure and numbers and all that, and that \nis important and relevant, but at the end of the discussion--the old \nexpression ``at the end of the day''--we have to be able to not only \ntalk to the American people, as we have over many months now--in some \ncases many years--about what this legislation will do, but also we have \nto be aware of what is concerning a lot of people, a lot of families.\n  I received a letter in the early part of 2009 from a woman in \nPennsylvania who lives in Berks County--kind of the eastern side of our \nState, just north of Philadelphia, a couple counties north of \nPhiladelphia, Berks County--and the woman who wrote to me, Trisha \nUrban, is someone whom I have come to know over the past couple years \nbecause of the tragedy in her own life which relates directly to health \ncare.\n  Trisha Urban related to me, in a letter she wrote to me but also in \nsubsequent conversations, her story, which was the subject of a lot of \ndiscussion and public notoriety in her home area. I wish to read \nportions of the letter--not the whole letter but I think the relevant \nparts of this letter. She talks about her husband, she and her husband \nhaving all kinds of trouble with health care, which relates directly to \nalmost every major issue we are talking about. Quoting from her, she \nsaid:\n\n       Like many Americans, we have difficulty with our health \n     insurance. My husband had to leave his job for 1 year to \n     complete an internship requirement to complete his doctorate \n     in psychology. The internship was unpaid and we could not \n     afford COBRA.\n\n  I will end the quote there for a second. We have had debates for \nweeks on extending COBRA health insurance to those who are unemployed--\na safety net not only for Trisha Urban and her family, at that time, \nbut so many American families--millions of them--especially in the \nmidst of a terrible recession.\n  Picking back up on her letter:\n\n       Because of preexisting conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues nor my pregnancy--\n\n  She talked earlier in the letter about her pregnancy.\n\n     --would be covered under private insurance. I worked four \n     part-time jobs and was not eligible for any health benefits. \n     We ended up with a second-rate health insurance plan through \n     my husband's university. When medical bills started to add \n     up, the insurance company decided to drop our coverage \n     stating the internship did not qualify us for the benefits.\n\n  I will comment on that section. In those few sentences, you have the \npreexisting condition problem and the ``insurance company dropped our \ncoverage'' problem. This is information we have heard over and over in \ntestimony from real people about what insurance companies in America \nare doing to these families. They are discriminating against families--\nlegally, apparently, under current law. That is part of why we want to \nchange what has been happening in America, change the law through \npassage of legislation to deal with the question of protecting families \nwith preexisting conditions.\n\n  At long last--we have talked about this issue for decades but \ncertainly in the last couple of years and more intensively in the last \ncouple of months--this opportunity we have, this legislation gives us a \nchance not just to talk and to pontificate about what is wrong with the \nsystem but to act, to vote and to act to change the system to protect \nfamilies.\n  Again, we are talking about preexisting conditions, we are talking \nabout people, families who are going to work every day, paying their \npremiums, doing their part of the agreement they have with an insurance \ncompany. Yet, despite paying their premiums, despite doing what they \nare supposed to do under the current system, they are being denied \ncoverage, they are being discriminated against because they have a \npreexisting condition or, even more outrageously, their children are \nbeing denied coverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  I have to ask myself--and I think a lot of Americans are asking this \nquestion--why do we tolerate this? Why do we go from year to year and \nsay: it is terrible, insurance companies deny people coverage because \nof preexisting conditions even though they have been paying their \npremiums; it is terrible that insurance companies drop their coverage; \nit is terrible that they put limits on the kind of care they will \nprovide, but they will put a dollar limit on it for a year or for a \nlifetime? That is really terrible, but there is nothing we can do about \nit.\n  That is basically what we have been saying for years. We complain \nabout the problem, and no one or not enough people here in Washington \nare willing to take on the insurance company and say: No, you are not \ngoing to do that any longer. We are going to make those practices \nillegal.\n  We have a chance, and it is an up-or-down vote situation. We have a \nchance over the next couple of days--I hope not weeks but certainly the \nnext couple of days--to decide these questions once and for all. We are \neither going to stand up to insurance companies or we are going to \nallow them to control people's lives in a way that is insulting to the \nAmerican people. It is damaging the ability for families to have \ncoverage and to have better health care.\n  I believe what insurance companies do on these discriminatory \npractices is harming our economy long term. How can you be a productive \nworker if you have to worry every day, even though you paid your \npremium, whether an insurance company can discriminate against you, \nagainst your family, and especially against your children?\n  That is what Tricia Urban was pointing to here, not because it was an \nissue in Washington but it was an issue in her life, in the life of her \nhusband, and eventually having an impact on her own pregnancy. I pick \nup the letter again, and I am quoting Tricia Urban again in the letter. \nShe talks about what the costs were for her and for her husband:\n\n       We were left with close to $100,000 worth of medical bills. \n     Concerned with the upcoming financial responsibility of the \n     birth of our daughter and the burden of current medical \n     expenses, my husband missed his last doctor's appointment \n     less than 1 month ago . . .\n\n  Meaning less than 1 month prior to February of 2009.\n  Here is where she begins to close the letter. I am quoting again.\n\n       I am a working class American and do not have the money or \n     the insight to legally fight the health insurance company. We \n     had no life insurance. I will probably lose my home, my car, \n     and everything we worked so hard to accumulate and our life \n     will be gone in an instant.\n       If my story is heard, if legislation can be changed to help \n     other uninsured Americans in a similar situation, I am \n     willing to pay the price of losing everything.\n\n  You might be wondering what happened to her, what happened in her \nlife. Was it just a situation where they got dropped from their \ncoverage? That is bad enough. Is it a situation where they got dropped \nfrom coverage and also were denied treatment or care or\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\ncoverage because of a preexisting condition? That would be bad enough \nin and of itself. But, no, the story gets worse from there. She talks \nabout the day when her water broke and she is about to go to the \nhospital to deliver her baby. The baby's name is Cora--just a little \nmore than a year old now. Here is what she says:\n\n       My water had broken the night before, we were anxiously \n     awaiting the birth of our new child. A half-hour later, 2 \n     ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were \n     assessing the health of my baby and me, the paramedic from \n     the other ambulance told me that my husband could not be \n     revived.\n\n  She walks out the driveway to get into the car to go to the hospital \nto deliver her daughter Cora, and she sees her husband dead on the \ndriveway, largely because or maybe exclusively because he missed his \ndoctor's appointment for a heart condition because he was worried about \npaying for the doctor visit.\n  This is not some screenplay or some theoretical story; this is real \nlife for people in America. We have to ask ourselves, on both sides of \nthe aisle--our friends on the other side have to ask themselves: Is \nthis good enough? Is this the best America can do, that we have to say \nsorry to Tricia Urban; sorry that happened to you about a preexisting \ncondition, but we do not have the guts or the ability here in \nWashington to stand up to insurance companies; sorry you were denied \ncoverage, but it is not going to change; sorry that a doctor's visit \nmight have cost too much at a particularly vulnerable point in your \nlife or the life of your husband; sorry that your husband died, but we \ndon't think we can be responsive to those situations.\n  Why do we tolerate this? Why do we allow insurance companies to \ncontrol our lives this way? This is not just another vote in \nWashington. This is not just some discussion about reconciliation or \nthe House vote and all that other stuff. This is about real life, and \nin the next couple of days we are either going to stand up to insurance \ncompanies or we are not.\n  I think it is a whole set of questions Tricia Urban is asking. She is \nasking me, she is asking all the Democrats in this Chamber and all the \nRepublicans.\n  Then there is another set of questions I have and I think a lot of \nAmericans have for our colleagues on the other side. They say they want \nhealth care reform, but they are not willing to support what we are \ntrying to do. You say: OK, if they do not support what you are trying \nto do, they probably have an alternative plan they have all come \ntogether on and worked on for months and they are going to propose that \nalternative; that is the American way.\n  They have an idea, we have an idea, we have a debate and vote, and \nsomeone wins, right? That is not the case. I am still waiting--we are \nall still waiting for Republican elected officials in Washington, House \nor Senate, to tell us what their plan is, to tell us definitively what \nthey really want to do. Do they really want to be responsive to this \nproblem of a preexisting condition? Do they really want to stand up \nagainst the insurance companies and say: No, you can't discriminate \nagainst families any longer.\n  Oh, by the way, they are going to do just fine, those insurance \ncompanies, because if our bill passes they are going to have 30 to 31 \nmillion more Americans covered. So they are going to do just fine. \nDon't worry about the insurance companies, they will do just fine even \nif we put a lot of protections in the bill.\n  We have to ask our Republican friends: You say you care about \ncovering Americans. Our legislation covers more than 30 million; how \nabout you? Their latest proposal covers 3 million Americans. That is \nnot even a serious attempt to cover Americans. We passed a bill last \nyear on children's health insurance where we are going from 4 million \nchildren covered and, because President Obama signed the \nchildren's health insurance reauthorization into law, we are going up \nto 7 million. We have already proven we can cover more children with an \nexpansion of an existing program than the other side of the aisle is \ngoing to cover in their entire health care plan. But there is not much \ndetail other than that. They say they want to cover 3 million. So it is \na choice: Shall we cover 31 million Americans and strengthen our \neconomy and give people the security of health care or give 3 million \ncoverage and pretend that is a serious proposal?\n\n  They say they care. They say they care on deficit reduction and \ncontrolling costs. Yet they will not support a proposal that at last \ncount reduced the deficit by $130 billion. We are getting new \ninformation that is just coming out today from the Congressional Budget \nOffice that number might still remain true from what it was in \nDecember--$130 billion of deficit reduction over the first 10 years and \nin the second 10 years maybe as high as $1 trillion or more. If you \ncare about deficit reduction, then why wouldn't you sign on to \nsomething that would provide maybe the most significant deficit \nreduction in American history in one piece of legislation?\n  They say they care about Medicare. We have heard that a lot over \nthere. They care about Medicare and all that. Then, when their proposal \ncomes out, they want to have vouchers for Medicare. Is that a serious \nproposal?\n  They have to answer some basic questions, and they have to \nspecifically answer the questions Tricia Urban is asking us because \nTricia Urban's story is a story we have heard in different forms all \nover the country, certainly all over Pennsylvania. Maybe not every \nstory has preexisting conditions, limiting coverage, jacking up rates \nso you can't afford to have coverage, and, tragically, a death in the \nfamily. Maybe not every story is that substantial. But we have heard \nstories over and over.\n  I also point to our businesses. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an Associated Press--Pittsburgh Tribune Review \narticle from earlier this month, ``Health Tops Pennsylvania Business \nWoes.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]\n\n                 Health Tops Pennsylvania Business Woes\n\n\n  state's small businesses also see the recession as a severe obstacle\n\n                            (By Joe Napsha)\n\n       Pittsburgh.--Pennsylvania's small businesses say rising \n     health care costs, along with the recession and business and \n     personal taxes, are the biggest challenges they will face \n     this year, according to a recent survey\n       ``It really confirms that in Pennsylvania, we need to zero-\n     in on health care costs and taxes,'' said Thomas Henschke, \n     acting president of the SMC Business Councils, a Churchill-\n     based trade association that conducted the Small Business \n     State Opinions survey in February SMC represents about 5,000 \n     businesses throughout western and central Pennsylvania.\n       About 71 percent of the 250 businesses that responded to \n     the survey said health care costs were their biggest \n     challenge. More than 70 percent said that high business and \n     personal taxes were a moderate-to-severe challenge to their \n     business.\n       Increases in health care costs--ranging between 7 and 12 \n     percent a year--are a ``huge problem'' for small business \n     that isn't being addressed by politicians in Washington, said \n     Peter Cady, president of Command Systems Inc. of Oakmont. The \n     company operates Advanced Mining Service, which repairs and \n     sells coal mining equipment.\n       ``You can't pass those costs along. Nobody wants to hear \n     that your health care costs went up,'' Mr. Cady said.\n       In response to a 23 percent jump in health care costs four \n     years ago to cover about 55 employees, Command Systems moved \n     to a high-deductible insurance plan, which makes it partially \n     self-insured. Command Systems pays 99 percent of the \n     insurance costs for its employees, Mr. Cady said.\n       In addition to health care, the poor state of the economy \n     was cited as a severe challenge by about 45 percent of the \n     respondents\n       ``Even before the recession, Pennsylvania was a very \n     difficult place to operate a business,'' compared to the \n     neighboring states, Mr. Henschke said.\n       The survey was released the same day that President Barack \n     Obama announced his latest version of health care reform.\n       ``That's politics. This is reality'' Mr. Henschke said.\n       ``Proposed reforms change daily, and you can't find \n     anything that is going to lower costs.''\n       Small-sized employers often believe they are overpaying for \n     health insurance for employees. But self-insurance for their \n     work force is really not available because the pool of \n     covered employees is ``too small to spread the risk out,'' \n     said Vincent Wolf executive vice president of Cowden \n     Associates Inc., a. Pittsburgh-based health care benefits \n     consulting firm.\n       Health care costs are a major concern for businesses, which \n     is driving their need to make changes in health care plans, \n     said Lorin Lacy, principal for the health and productivity \n     practice at Buck Consultants Inc., a Pittsburgh-based human \n     resources consulting firm. Those changes include revising\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\n     cost-sharing between employees and employers and the use of \n     wellness programs, Ms. Lacy said.\n\n                        COUNTY HEALTH COMPARISON\n                   [Ranking (Out of 67 Pa. counties)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Environmental\n                  County                      Overall     and lifestyle\n                                               health        factors\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLackawanna................................           51               19\nLuzerne...................................           57               37\nMonroe....................................           46               40\nPike......................................            6               20\nSusquehanna...............................           41               31\nWayne.....................................           62               21\nWyoming...................................           43              46\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: County Health Rankings Study.\n\n                        Overall health by county\n\n     1.

The \nsubheadline is ``State's Small Businesses Also See the Recession as a \nSevere Obstacle.''\n  If you are a small business owner in Pennsylvania, this survey shows, \nyou are worried about two things: the recession--no question about that \nhaving an adverse impact; that is why the recovery bill and jobs bill \nare so important to these small businesses--but also health care.\n  I am reading an excerpt here:\n\n       About 71 percent of the 250 businesses that responded to \n     the survey said health care costs were their biggest \n     challenge.\n\n  Health care costs. This is not a group of Democrats sitting around a \nroom in Pennsylvania saying: Let's pass health care. These are small \nbusiness owners in Pennsylvania. They might be Democratic, Republican, \nIndependent, or they may not have any affiliation. Their life is \nrunning a small business and raising their families, and 71 percent of \nthose surveyed describe health insurance as their ``biggest \nchallenge.'' We do not need any longer to debate whether this is an \nissue we have to deal with.\n  I want to walk through some of the basic provisions of what we have \nput in place in the Senate bill, what the House has been wrestling with \nall these months, and what President Obama has been trying to do. Just \na couple of quick highlights.\n  First of all, if we are successful in this opportunity to pass major \nhealth care reform, other issues we have talked about for years but do \nnot get a lot of attention are going to be finally the law of the land. \nQuality and prevention--the information and research on this is \nirrefutable. If you insist on prevention and you make it free or very \nlow cost, that person is going to be healthier because they are going \nto take steps that are preventive in nature. They are going to be \nhealthier, their family is going to be healthier, they are going to be \nbetter on the job and the economy will be stronger. But also we are \ngoing to strengthen our health care system in terms of costs. We are \ngoing to reduce costs in a lot of ways, but one of them is prevention \nand elevating the quality of our care. Sometimes people get the best \ncare in the world, but in some places that can be very limited.\n  The second point on cost and deficit. I mentioned that before. The \ndeficit reduction in the Democratic health care bill is $130 billion \nover the first 10 years. We will see if the Congressional Budget Office \nalters that.\n  But from what we are hearing today, some of the preliminary reports, \nthat number might hold up. Some thought that because of the passage of \ntime that number might go down $130 billion to $100 billion. But it is \na tremendous deficit reduction over 10 and over 20 years.\n  Protections. I talked about that before. I just want to highlight \nthat quickly. Basic protections for American families who have health \ninsurance coverage now, families going to work, paying their premiums, \nand not protected. They think they are protected because they have a \npolicy, an agreement, and they are paying their premiums. They are \ndoing their part. Then some insurance company bureaucrat or some other \nplayer in this marketplace comes to them and says: We know you are \npaying your premiums; that you are holding up your end of the bargain. \nBut we, the insurance company, do not think you or your child should \nhave coverage. Sorry. You are out of luck.\n  Well, we are dealing with that in a couple of ways. First of all, it \nis important for people to understand what will happen now and what \nwill happen later. If we get this bill passed, 6 months after the \nPresident would sign it into law, it would be illegal for an insurance \ncompany to deny a child coverage because of a preexisting condition. \nThat is a tremendous change in the first year--literally, after 6 \nmonths.\n  In that same time period and beyond that, if you are an adult, \ntechnically you would not have the legal protection because you cannot \ndo all of this at once. So we had to decide, do we do nothing in the \nshort term or do we at least protect children. We are protecting \nchildren in the first couple months of the bill. But even though \ntechnically an adult would not have legal protection until 2014, they \nwill have recourse. They will have an option to say: I am an adult. I \nhave been denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. I can go \ninto a high-risk pool and get coverage.\n  So there is recourse in the first--actually, that is in the first 3 \nmonths for the adult. So that is a very important protection. We can \ntalk more later about that.\n  Finally, and I will begin to close, on children's health insurance--I \ntalked about that before--it is important to note what the bill does on \na great successful program, the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  For example, in our State this is what children's health insurance \nhas meant. It has meant that we have been able to reduce our rate of \nuninsured children down to 5 percent. It is still not good enough; we \nstill want to go lower. But our uninsured rate among children in \nPennsylvania is 5 percent. With regard to adults between the ages of 18 \nand 64, it is 12 percent, so more than double for the adult uninsured \nprior to getting to the age of Medicare. That is more than double the \nchildren's uninsured rate. That is good for children that we have made \nprogress--we need to make more--but it is bad for adults who have not \nhad a strategy to help them.\n  That is part of why we are trying to pass the bill. At long last we \nare going to be helping many adults, tens of millions. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is extended under the bill for 2 years, until \nSeptember 30, 2015.\n  What the President wants to do as part of the so-called \nreconciliation process is to maintain--he proposes to require States to \nmaintain eligibility for children's health insurance to 2019, not just \n2015, 2019. He wants to fund it through 2016. I think that is a very \nimportant change that the President has proposed and that we have a \nchance to ratify in our debate.\n  There is a lot more we can talk about, but I am running low on time. \nBut I think the basic question for the American people is, Are we going \nto have an up-or-down vote on health care?\n  Some over there who have used this process before for other measures \nover many years seem to not want us to have an up-or-down vote on \nhealth care.\n  I think the American people want that, even if they disagree with \nparts of the bill. But the real question for our Republican friends is, \nWill they be responsive to Trisha Urban? Are they just going to say \nthat preexisting conditions are a problem; I know recisions are a \nproblem, I know limits on coverage are a problem for you and your \nfamily; I know that denying a child health care coverage because of a \npreexisting condition is a problem, but we are not going to do anything \nabout it; the insurance companies were too strong; we could not beat \nthem; we are just going to go the way that so many have gone in \nWashington.\n  I do not think that is going to be a good enough answer for Trisha \nUrban\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nand her family and for millions of Americans.\n  Finally, the question is, If you are not for our bill, if you are \ngoing to vote against it, what are you going to do about this? What are \nyou going to do if you vote against covering 31 million Americans? What \nare you going to do? Are you going to cover three? Is that a serious \nproposal?\n  If you say you care about Medicare, are you going to support--which \nis the Republican proposal--having vouchers for Medicare? If you say \nyou care about deficit reduction, you are going to vote against the \nbill that cuts the deficit by $130 billion, and let's say that number \ngoes down, the worst we could do is $100 billion. But the estimates \nmight hold up in the next couple of days. We will see what the \nCongressional Budget Office has.\n  So I think Republicans in the Senate and the House have to answer \nthose basic questions, not necessarily my questions or our questions \nbut the questions that Trisha Urban and others across our country and \nevery single State, the millions of Americans who have been denied \ncoverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  Notice I said millions over the last couple of years, according to \none estimate, one survey. They have some questions to answer over on \nthe other side of the aisle. We will see what their answer is, and the \nanswer will be the vote. How you vote on this will be one answer to all \nof those and many other questions.\n  So I hope we can have some conversions on the other side; that they \nwill see that it is important to cover Americans, it is important to \nprovide the kind of security and protection to families who are paying \ntheir premiums every day and not being given the protections they \ndeserve. I hope our friends do that.\n  I hope they do not just spend all of their time debating the finer \npoints of process in the Senate. People really do not care about what \nthe procedure is in Washington in the Senate. They want to know are we \ngoing to have, at long last, real protections for real families, or \nwill the insurance companies win again.\n  This is not complicated. That is one of the basic questions they are \nasking us to answer for them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I know I have less than 2 minutes, but I \nwanted to add a couple of things to the Record. One is an article from \nthe Los Angeles Times of February 4 of this year, headlined ``Anthem \nBlue Cross Dramatically Raising Rates for Californians With Individual \nHealth Policies.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 2010]\n\n  Anthem Blue Cross Dramatically Raising Rates for Californians With \n                       Individual Health Policies\n\n                           (By Duke Helfand)\n\n       Anthem Blue Cross is dramatically raising rates for \n     Californians with individual health policies. Policyholders \n     are incensed over rate hikes of as much as 39%, which they \n     say come on top of similar increases last year. State \n     insurance regulators say they'll investigate.\n       California's largest for-profit health insurer is moving to \n     dramatically raise rates for customers with individual \n     policies, setting off a furor among policyholders and \n     prompting state insurance regulators to investigate.\n       Anthem Blue Cross is telling many of its approximately \n     800,000 customers who buy individual coverage--people not \n     covered by group rates--that its prices will go up March 1 \n     and may be adjusted ``more frequently'' than its typical \n     yearly increases.\n       The insurer declined to say how high it is increasing \n     rates. But brokers who sell these policies say they are \n     fielding numerous calls from customers incensed over premium \n     increases of 30% to 39%, saying they come on the heels of \n     similar jumps last year.\n       Many policyholders say the rate hikes are the largest they \n     can remember, and they fear that subsequent premium growth \n     will narrow their options--leaving them to buy policies with \n     higher deductibles and less coverage or putting health \n     insurance out of reach altogether.\n       ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Mark Weiss, \n     63, a Century City podiatrist whose Anthem policy for himself \n     and his wife will rise 35%. The couple's annual insurance \n     bill will jump to $27,336 from $20,184.\n       ``I think it's just unconscionable,'' said Weiss, a member \n     of Blue Cross for 30 years.\n       Woodland Hills-based Anthem declined to say how many \n     individual policyholders will be affected or what a typical \n     increase will be under the new pricing, which will vary from \n     one individual to another. But the company defended its \n     premiums, even as it tried to strike a sympathetic tone.\n       ``We understand and strongly share our members' concerns \n     over the rising cost of healthcare services and the \n     corresponding adverse impact on insurance premiums,'' the \n     company said in a statement.\n       ``Unfortunately, the individual market premiums are merely \n     the symptoms of a larger underlying problem in California's \n     individual market--rising healthcare costs.''\n       About 2.5 million Californians have individual insurance \n     policies, accounting for a small portion of the state's \n     overall insurance market. By contrast, nearly 21 million \n     people in California are covered by health maintenance \n     organizations.\n       Individual policies are often the only option for those who \n     are uninsured, self-employed or do not receive health \n     coverage through employers.\n       Insurers are free to cherry-pick the healthiest customers \n     in the lightly regulated individual market. They can raise \n     rates at any time as long as they notify the state Department \n     of Insurance and prove that they are spending at least 70% of \n     premiums on medical care.\n       The size of the individual rate increases prompted state \n     Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner recently to call for a \n     review of Anthem's charges.\n       ``Commissioner Poizner is very concerned by these large \n     rate increases,'' spokesman Darrel Ng said.\n       Poizner directed his department to retain an ``independent \n     outside actuary to examine Blue Cross'' rates'' to ensure \n     that the company spends at least 70% of the premiums on \n     medical care, as required by state law, Ng said. Anthem said \n     it had already hired an actuary who found that the rates were \n     sound.\n       Anthem is not the only health insurer imposing double-digit \n     rate increases. Competitors such as Blue Shield of California \n     and Aetna also have raised premiums significantly in recent \n     years, insurance brokers said. But they said the impending \n     Anthem increases are the largest they have seen.\n       ``Do they really think they are going to keep clients this \n     way?'' asked Bill Robinson, a Palm Springs broker who has \n     informed his Anthem clients that they will face increases of \n     as much as 39% on March 1.\n       Anthem sent letters to agents a few weeks ago informing \n     them of the March 1 increases and followed up with similar \n     notices to policyholders last week.\n       That's when Mary Feller of San Rafael learned that the rate \n     for herself and her husband will jump 39%, or $465 a month, \n     driving the couple's annual premium to $19,896 from $14,316.\n       Feller, 56, said the premium for her 26-year-old daughter \n     also will rise 38%, costing the family an additional $1,572 a \n     year.\n       As a result, starting March 1, the Fellers' health \n     insurance bill will surpass the family's monthly mortgage \n     payment on their home north of San Francisco.\n       ``It's breathtaking,'' said Feller, an entertainment \n     journalist. ``We're going to have to cut back somewhere else. \n     This kind of stuff strikes fear in the heart.''\n       Feller said she was troubled by another part of the Anthem \n     letter. Besides detailing the premium increase, it said: \n     ``Anthem Blue Cross will usually adjust rates every 12 \n     months; however, we may adjust more frequently in accordance \n     with the terms of your health benefit plan.''\n       She and others voiced anger about the increases as Anthem's \n     parent company, WellPoint Inc., sees big profits. Last week \n     the company announced an eightfold increase in profit for the \n     last three months of 2009, a surge attributed largely to the \n     sale of subsidiaries.\n       Broker and insurance industry analysts said the California \n     rate increases will leave individual policyholders with few \n     good options: Anthem subscribers such as the Fellers can \n     switch to a company plan with a higher deductible. Or they \n     can try to switch insurers, a dicey proposition because \n     carriers in the individual market can reject applicants who \n     have preexisting medical conditions.\n       ``It's putting people's backs up against the wall,'' said \n     Shana Alex Lavarreda, director of health insurance studies at \n     the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. ``They are \n     finding new ways to create new problems for consumers.''\n       The insurer said it had a team of workers to help customers \n     balance costs and insurance.\n       ``Anthem offers a variety of health benefit plans,'' the \n     company said, ``and we are dedicated to working with our \n     members to find health coverage plans that are the most \n     appropriate and affordable for their needs.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Basically, many Americans have heard these stories and \nexperienced the pain of these health insurance premium increases. But I \nam going to read quick portions of it:\n\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n\n       Anthem Blue Cross dramatically raised rates for \n     Californians with individual health policies. Policyholders \n     are incensed over rate hikes of as much as 39 percent.\n\n  Going on to say: Anthem Blue Cross is telling many of its \napproximately 800,000 customers who may buy individual coverage--people \nnot covered by group rates--that their premiums will increase 30 to 39 \npercent.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nseries of statements contained in a 3\\1/2\\-page summary entitled ``GOP \non Reconciliation.'' This is a series of statements that Republican \nSenators have made over the years with regard to this process they are \ncomplaining about and think that we should not be able to use, even \nthough they supported it in the past. It is interesting reading which \nwe do not have time to highlight.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         GOP on Reconciliation\n\n\n                                 gregg\n\n       Gregg 2005: ``What's Wrong With Majority Rule?'' During a \n     floor debate on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR), Senator Gregg said, ``We are using the rules \n     of the Senate. That is what they are. Reconciliation is a \n     rule of the Senate set up under the Budget Act. It has been \n     used before for purposes exactly like this on numerous \n     occasions. The fact is, all this rule of the Senate does is \n     allow a majority of the Senate to take a position and pass a \n     piece of legislation, support that position. Is there \n     something wrong with majority rules? I don't think so. The \n     reason the Budget Act was written in this way was to allow \n     certain unique issues to be passed with a majority vote. That \n     is all that is being asked for here. . . . The point, of \n     course, is this: If you have 51 votes for your position, you \n     win.'' [Congressional Record, 3/16/05]\n       Gregg 2008: Reconciliation ``One Tool of Significance'' \n     Budget Committee Can Use. ``Reconciliation, as we know--those \n     of us who work here--is the one tool of significance which \n     the Budget Committee has. It allows us to change how \n     entitlement programs are funded and slow their rate of \n     growth--that was the purpose of reconciliation--and do it \n     without the changes being subject to the filibuster rule. It \n     is a vehicle basically directed on the purposes of the \n     Senate.'' [Gregg Floor Statement, 3/13/08]\n       Gregg 2005: Republicans Used Reconciliation to Avoid \n     Democratic Opposition to ANWR Drilling, Passing Medicaid \n     Savings. ``The ANWR language has been a source of controversy \n     all year, and along with Medicaid savings, was one of two \n     principal reason for attempting to pass a reconciliation bill \n     this year, according to Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg, R-\n     N.H. Either provision on its own could not have survived a \n     Democratic filibuster without the protection of budget \n     reconciliation, Gregg said.'' [CQ Today, 12/19/05]\n       Gregg 2005: Mocked Democrats' Use of the ``Byrd Rule'' to \n     Slow Reconciliation Bill, Said Democrats ``Enforcing Minutia \n     Over Policy.'' ``Anybody who knows the Byrd rule knows it's \n     an extremely arcane and incredibly complex piece of precedent \n     that we deal with. And we had received estimates from CBO \n     which said that all three items which points of order were \n     made against scored . . . But the point here, of course, is \n     there are so many rules in this institution that go to \n     minutia on instances, that if you are using rules to enforce \n     minutia over policy, you can have a pretty massive unintended \n     consequence. Now in this case, I think it's intended, but the \n     consequence of promoting minutia by use of the rules is that \n     Katrina money isn't going to go out, people aren't going to \n     see doctors because doctors aren't going to get paid, and \n     students aren't going to be able to get student loans and \n     it's potential that the welfare program won't have the funds \n     it needs in order to continue to go forward. That's the \n     consequence of promoting minutia in this instance.'' \n     [Republican Press Conference, 12/21/05]\n       Gregg 2005: Reconciliation is the Mechanism that Deals With \n     Entitlement Spending, Tax Policy. ``The letter asks that we \n     indefinitely postpone reconciliation, reconciliation being \n     the mechanism by which we address the entitlement spending \n     and tax policy here at the Federal level.

It is a, it is the one exception to the general \n     rules of the Senate\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\n     that was created about thirty or forty years ago, and Robert \n     Byrd was one of the people that helped to create it, to deal \n     with budget matters where you didn't want a filibuster to \n     prevent the balancing of the budget, in effect. I mean, \n     there's one thing you have to do. You have to be able to \n     either increase your revenues or reduce your spending in \n     order to balance the budget, theoretically. So they made that \n     one exception to the policy of the Senate, which otherwise \n     would have required sixty votes to do the big things. Now \n     that process is available for those kinds of monetary-related \n     subjects. And it has been used many times. That's true. The \n     Bush tax cuts were done as, through reconciliation, for \n     example. Now there have been a couple of other examples where \n     they ventured outside of pure monetary issues. They shouldn't \n     have. I wasn't there. I don't know why or how they did it. \n     But in any event, it is not available for large, substantive, \n     comprehensive kinds of legislation like this health care \n     bill.

So if you don't have 60 \n     votes, you've got to do the best you can. The best we can do \n     right now, I suspect, is not to make all these tax cuts \n     permanent but to extend them out as far as we can. If we had \n     a five-year budget this year, for example, we could extend \n     these tax cuts out through the year 2010. For example, that \n     would mean that with dividends and capital gains, we need to \n     take those two 15 percent rates and carry them forward two \n     more years, so that they would include not only 2008 but also \n     2009 and 2010. And we can do that with some of the other \n     rates as well. So with a five-year budget, that's doable. . . \n     .

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1586, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1586) to impose an additional tax on bonuses \n     received from certain TARP recipients.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Rockefeller amendment No. 3452, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Sessions/McCaskilll modified amendment No. 3453 (to \n     amendment No. 3452), to reduce the deficit by establishing \n     discretionary spending caps.\n       McCain/Bayh amendment No. 3475 (to amendment No. 3452), to \n     prohibit earmarks in years in which there is a deficit.\n       McCain amendment No. 3527 (to amendment No. 3452), to \n     require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to develop a financing proposal for fully \n     funding the development and implementation of technology for \n     the Next Generation Air Transportation System.\n       McCain amendment No. 3528 (to amendment No. 3452), to \n     provide standards for determining whether the substantial \n     restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the Grand \n     Canyon National Park has been achieved and to clarify \n     regulatory authority with respect to commercial air tours \n     operating over the Park.\n       Pryor amendment No. 3548 (to amendment 3452), to reduce the \n     deficit by establishing discretionary spending caps\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. will be divided equally between the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, and the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the title of the bill just reported is \nthe correct title. However, the legislation we are discussing inside \nthat bill does not relate so much to the title. This is the FAA \nreauthorization bill, reauthorizing a wide range of programs in the \nFederal Aviation Administration. This is the fifth day we have been on \nthe floor. Senator Rockefeller has been managing the legislation. He is \nnecessarily absent now and asked me, as chairman of the aviation panel, \nto manage in his stead. He has said--and I agree--we have put together \na piece of legislation that has substantial modernization pieces in it \nthat will modernize the air traffic control system, provide substantial \nimprovements in safety, improvements in the airport improvement program \nto invest in and expand the infrastructure in aviation. It contains a \nlot of things that are so very important.\n  I worry now, on the fifth day on this legislation, that if we don't \nget it done today, we may not get this bill done at all. That would be \na shame because this authorization has languished for a long time. \nRather than reauthorize the FAA with a new authorization, we have \nextended it 11 straight times. That describes how difficult it is to \nget things done.\n  Finally, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison have brought the \nbill to the Senate floor. Senator DeMint and I, as chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, worked on the bill with them. We have now \nbeen here 5 days. The question will be, between now and the end of \ntoday, will we get this done or does this dissolve as unfinished work? \nWe made a good try, but we just didn't make it happen, so it gets \nextended again and all of this work is for nought.\n  The fact is, every single Senator and every constituent of every \nMember has a big stake in getting this done. Anybody who flies on \ncommercial airlines--and that is a lot of Americans--has a big stake in \nthe issue of air traffic control modernization, improvements to safety, \nand the things that are included in this legislation. The failure to do \nthis would be a great disappointment, not only for us but for the \nAmerican people.\n  We have cleared a lot of amendments. As has been the case recently \nwith a lot of legislation, there has been a lot of delay. We have \nworked on amendments en bloc that have been cleared. There is an \nadditional group of amendments we hope we will clear.\n  At 2 o'clock today there will be votes on two amendments side by \nside, offered within the rules, although they do not relate to this \nparticular legislation. But we will vote on those and try to dispose of \nthose issues.\n  There is another issue, probably the last significant issue that is \nthere. That is the issue of the slots and the perimeter rule at \nNational Airport in Washington, DC. The slots and perimeter rule is \ncontroversial, complex, difficult. We have a number of amendments filed \nrepresenting different interests of how many additional flights should \nbe added to Washington National, how many flights might be added that \nwould extend beyond what is a perimeter rule at Washington National. I \nhope those who have filed those amendments will agree to stand down and \nallow us to try to resolve that in some way in conference.\n  The House, in its legislation, does address in part the slot rule. If \nwe get to conference with the House, if we can pass a bill through the \nSenate, it will be something we will need to resolve there.\n  What my great concern is, if this afternoon, following the votes, we \nget into long, protracted debate about the various amendments that have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nfiled on the slot and perimeter rules, this bill will not get done. A \nnumber of people who have offered amendments dealing with slots have \ngreat interest in making certain this bill gets done. My fear is, if it \nis not done today, it probably will not be done. We will probably not \ncomplete this legislation.\n  I will be visiting and talking with those who have offered those \namendments, asking if we can work with them as we go into conference \nand try to address the slot and perimeter rules with the House. It has \nto be a part of our conference because the House has a number of \nprovisions in their legislation dealing with those issues.\n  The frustration for 200-plus years in the Senate is nothing moves \nvery quickly. That remains a frustration in 2010. Nothing here moves \nvery quickly. That is part of the charm of the Senate, perhaps, and \npart of the abiding frustration of the Senate. At least on important \nissues during important times things really should move. There are \ncertain things that are urgent to get done.\n  One year has now passed since the last commercial aviation accident \nin Buffalo, NY. As a result of that accident and the investigation that \nensued, a number of new safety recommendations are included in this \nlegislation. It is important for us to understand the urgency of \npassing legislation that will substantially improve aviation safety. To \nignore it is to shortchange the American people.\n  We are working through the amendments. I expect this afternoon we \nwill have these votes. I also hope we can work with our colleagues on \nthe slot or perimeter rule amendments that have been offered in order \nto resolve them. My hope is we will resolve them not by protracted \ndebate, which will probably doom this bill because we will likely not \nhave additional time on the Senate floor after 5 full days, but resolve \nthem in a way that allows those who care about this to work with us as \nwe go into conference with the House on the slot and perimeter rules.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3548\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 minutes on my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise to talk about the Pryor amendment \nwe are going to take up this afternoon and have a vote on.\n  I wish to show my colleagues this chart I have in the Chamber that \ntalks about America's fiscal condition. This chart came out of the CQ \nToday edition of Tuesday, February 2. As you can see, it takes the \nfiscal year 2011 revenue estimates over here, with this pie chart on \nthe left, and it takes our proposed outlays with this other pie chart \non the right.\n  Of course, it is obvious to anyone who is paying attention, if you \nlook at these two numbers, it looks like we are taking in $2.5 trillion \nbut we are sending out $3.8 trillion. That is a big problem. That \nmeans, once again, we are in deficit spending. We have to get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  I do not know if my colleagues on both sides saw this reported this \nweek, but earlier there was a story in the New York Times--and it has \nbeen reported in other publications--that Moody's is looking at the \npossibility of downgrading America's credit from AAA down to something \nlower than that because of the enormous national debt we have and the \npersistent annual deficits.\n  This piece of the chart I think is very revealing, when you look at \nthe money that is going out through the Federal Government.\n  We see this purple slice. There are a couple of slices here of the \npurple pie chart, and we see one is $671 billion. That is nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. Then, on the national defense discretionary \nspending, it shows $744 billion, but everything else in here is \nmandatory spending or it is our interest on the national debt.\n  This little green sliver here--it may be hard to see on television--\nis actually what we are paying on the national debt. It is $251 billion \nin interest payments and paying back the national debt.\n  Nonetheless, we see that the majority of the money we are spending is \nfor mandatory spending. These are entitlements and various programs, \nthings such as Medicare, Social Security, and other entitlement \nprograms and other mandatory spending.\n  The amendment I have been working on this week tries to address our \nfiscal situation not merely by tapping into this discretionary \nspending, which, depending on which part of discretionary spending we \nare talking about, could be as little as 12 percent of the money we \nhave going out of the system or it could be as much as 25 or 30 \npercent. It depends on how you calculate and all we include. We can't \nfix our fiscal house using discretionary spending only. I think one of \nthe advantages of the Pryor amendment is we want to take the whole \npicture--all the mandatory spending, all the discretionary spending, \nand all the revenues--and use them to try to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  One of the best things about this chart that was in CQ Today is this \ngraph. It shows where we start during the Carter years, and it goes all \nthe way through the Obama years. So we have Carter, Reagan, George \nBush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and now Obama, and we can see this \npurple line. Unfortunately, most of these years it is below zero. The \nline is our annual deficit. This yellowish-orangey line shows as a \npercent of GDP what our deficit is.\n  One of the great things about this graph that gives me courage and \ngives me hope is that during the Clinton years, we went above the line. \nWe actually went into surplus spending. We did it for the last 4 years \nof his administration. The thing I get hope from is we can do it again. \nWe can do this. We can address this. If we do it in a bipartisan way, \nif we do it in a smart way, if we put everything on the table as they \ndid during the Clinton years, we can address our deficit and our \nnational debt and we can do it in a way that will be good for the \ncountry long term. Because every time we spend a dollar around here, we \nare making our children and our grandchildren pay for that. At some \npoint down the road they will have to pay for it.\n  We need to stop the reckless course we are on, everybody agrees. \nWhether it is the chairman or the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, whether it is outside economists, or whether it is people \nsuch as those on Wall Street who analyze all of this, everybody agrees \nthat we are on an unsustainable course. So what the Pryor amendment \ntries to do is address our deficit spending, not just the spending part \nbut our whole picture to look at our annual deficits.\n  One thing I wish to comment on is when I look at this graph, this is \na graph of political courage. Because the easiest thing in the world \nfor a politician to do--the easiest thing that any of us can do around \nhere--is to cut taxes and increase spending. That is what has happened \nin recent years. That didn't happen during the Clinton years, but that \nhas happened in recent years. The easiest thing to do is to go into \ndeficit spending and push the problem down the road to somebody in the \nfuture. The time is now for us to stop doing that. The time is now for \nus to reverse these purple lines and get them going up, above zero.\n  The truth is, we can't do it in 1 year. We probably can't do it in 5 \nyears given the economic and fiscal condition we are in right now, but \nover a period of years, we can get this moving in the right direction. \nI promise my colleagues the markets will love it. I promise my \ncolleagues the global economy will love it. They will love to see some \nAmerican leadership. Everybody in the world looks at how we spend money \naround here and they shake their heads, because they know we are on an \nunsustainable course.\n  This graph is a graph of political courage. Back during this time, \nwhen they did this Balanced Budget Act, back in 1993--and I have a lot \nof colleagues who were here and casting those hard votes back then--\nthose were\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nacts of courage. It wasn't always popular because they made some hard \nchoices, and that is what we have to do again. That is, hopefully, what \nthe Pryor amendment will get us on track toward doing.\n  Madam President, I know I just have a couple of minutes left. How \nlong do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will try to wind down. The Pryor amendment freezes all \ndiscretionary spending caps at the level proposed by President Obama in \nthe year 2011. So it does have a discretionary freeze. It freezes all \ndiscretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 at 40 \npercent of the difference between President Obama's budget proposal and \nlast year's budget proposal.\n  The reason we are doing that is because Senator Sessions and Senator \nMcCaskill have worked very hard on their amendment--in fact, I voted \nfor their amendment a couple of times in its previous forms--but they \nused some different numbers. I thought in order to be fair we need to \nsplit the difference with their numbers, and these two freezes we are \ntalking about will reduce discretionary spending by at least $77 \nbillion over 15 years. That is major. That is a big chunk out of \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Where we make up the difference is then we ask the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to find at least--at \nleast--an additional $77 billion of deficit reductions over the next 3 \nyears to close the gap between projected revenues and entitlement \nspending. So we pretty much give this to the commission and say: Look, \ncommission, you are set up. The President has put you together. We have \nsix or eight Members from the Senate on that commission, other Members \nfrom the House. You all sit down and you all work through this. You \nhave a year to do it. You need to work through this and find the other \n$77 billion worth of savings.\n  In comparing the two amendments, the Pryor amendment actually saves a \nlittle bit more money over the next 3 years than the Sessions \namendment, but one of the reasons is because we are looking at deficit \nreduction, not just spending. I think their amendment--again, which I \nhave supported in the past--focuses on spending, but ours is more about \ndeficit reduction and trying to take a full picture into account.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, let me say I support the Senator's amendment. Both \namendments have some merit. It is not unworthy to be talking about \ntrying to tighten belts in every area of public spending, but some \npublic spending is more important than others, and we ought to be \njudicious as we deal with it.\n  The difference, as I understand, between these amendments is one \nsays, Let's cut spending in one area, which is domestic discretionary \nspending, which is a rather small part of the budget, and it doesn't \naddress the other issues of the spending that goes on through the Tax \nCode, the entitlement spending, and other larger issues as well. Even \nas we vote on these issues--and I intend to vote in support of your \ninitiative, which I think is the right initiative--I have to say I \ndon't think this is complicated in terms of what has happened to our \ncountry and what we have to do to put it back on track.\n  You can't send kids off to war and then say we are going to charge \nall the costs of war. We have been involved now in the war against \nterrorism, the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, and not paid for a \npenny of it because throughout the last decade the President said we \nare going to make all of this emergency spending. Some of us said, \nWell, let's pay for it? And President Bush said, If you try to pay for \nit, I will veto the bill.\n  So it is not particularly complicated to understand what has happened \nhere. Government has to pay its bills. Dealing with the entire area of \npublic spending here is very important, and I think the Senator has \noffered a piece of legislation, an amendment, that has great merit and \nI hope will get the substantial support of the Senate.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3453\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nPryor amendment and in favor of the Sessions-McCaskill amendment on us \ntrying to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Right now in America, most families are figuring out where they can \ncut the budget. Most families are figuring out what the extras are that \neven though we don't want to give them up, we have to give them up. \nThat is what America is doing right now. Most local governments are \ndoing the same thing. They are sitting around rooms trying to figure \nout where they can cut budgets because their revenue is down.\n  In Missouri, the Governor has had to cut the budget significantly. \nEven with the stimulus money we sent to Missouri to help them balance \ntheir budget, they are cutting programs. They are cutting employees. \nThey are doing what they have to do to balance the budget. Then we get \nto Washington. Everybody in America is cutting back except Washington.\n  We came very close a few weeks ago--59 votes--to a very modest baby \nstep. We are not talking about something that is earth shattering here. \nWe are talking about limiting the size of growth. We are not cutting \nanything. The Sessions-McCaskill amendment cuts nothing. All it does is \nlimit the size of growth, of discretionary spending in both the defense \nbudget and the domestic budget. We had 59 votes to limit the growth of \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Would it be great if we could do the same thing with mandatory right \nnow? I think it would be. I think it would be terrific if we could \nlimit the size of growth of mandatory spending right now. Could we, in \nfact, roll back some of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest? I would \nbe for that. The bottom line is we have 59 votes for a baby step.\n  So what happens around here when we have 59 votes for a baby step? We \ncome up with an amendment, frankly, that is more cover than substance. \nIt is time to take a hard look in the mirror. If we can't do Sessions-\nMcCaskill, what can we do around here? What can we do to show the \nAmerican people we understand that government can't continue to grow \nwhen revenues aren't? We have done some big, bold things--and I have \nbeen supportive of all of them--to bring us back from the brink of a \nrecession. They were very important. But I have been so discouraged by \nwhat has been going on around here the last few days: the circling of \nthe wagons.\n  This amendment, with all due respect--and he is my friend; we have \nworked together on many things--but 50 votes to waive, are you kidding? \nYou have to have 60 votes now to waive, and they are lowering it to 50. \nThe only changes we have made to the Sessions-McCaskill amendment since \nthat 59-vote margin we got a few weeks ago is we moved down how many \nvotes you have to have for emergency spending. It is no longer subject \nto a 67-vote point of order. This was done to address the concerns that \nsome Members had about Congress's flexibility to respond to \nemergencies, though it is very hard to find any emergency in history \nthat Congress hasn't addressed with more than 67 votes. We moved that \nnumber down. Now the caps only cover 3 years. A 1-percent growth over \nthe next 3 years, when every other government in America is cutting? A \n1-percent growth over 3 years. Is that so hard? There are no caps on \nthis year in this amendment and no caps for 2014. The Pryor amendment \nonly has 1 year of caps and it can be waived with 50 votes, and then it \npurports to try to mandate that the fiscal commission do some things. \nBy the way, if the fiscal commission doesn't do it in time, then none \nof this counts.\n  We are outsourcing our responsibilities here. I was for the fiscal \ncommission. I was a cosponsor. I think we have to be honest about what \nthis body is capable of doing and what it is not capable of doing. But \ndid I think this body was not capable of 1 percent of growth for 3 \nyears in discretionary spending? I had no idea this body wasn't capable \nof that. The pressure that is being put on Members as part of that 59 \nis depressing to me.\n  This is one of those moments where I separate from leadership of my \nparty. I am proud to separate from leadership\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nof my party, because this is the right thing to do right now. America \ndoesn't think we get it, and you know what. They are right. We don't. A \n1-percent growth in government in discretionary spending for the next 3 \nyears is a reasonable approach to what we are looking at in terms of \nboth our deficit and our debt.\n  I am sorry leadership does not agree with me on this. I am sorry \nleadership does not think this is good public policy. But I have to \ntell you, we worry around here about elections. I will tell you, the \nfolks who are thinking this side by side is somehow going to cover them \nfrom the wrath of the American people when it sinks in that we are not \neven willing to limit growth in a meaningful way in this country--when \nI am in the grocery store when I go home on the weekends, that is what \nI am constantly told when I run into people: It just doesn't feel like \nyou guys get it. If we end up with less than 59 votes today, if we go \nbackward rather than forward, do you know what I am going to have to \ntell them when I see them in the grocery store this weekend? You are \nright, the majority of my party does not get it.\n  By the way, I am willing to stand right now and cosponsor anything we \nwant to limit the growth in mandatory. I am for that too. I am for \ndoing whatever we need to do to make sure we look at the revenue side. \nI am for that also.\n  But this is a baby step, and if we cannot take the baby step right \nnow at this moment in history with this mess we are facing in terms of \nfinances, then I think we are in a world of hurt, just a world of hurt.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator McCaskill, who is a person of courage and conviction and made a \ndecision that we need to do better in our country about spending. As \nshe said, is a simple truth. Our amendment is a small but significant \nstep. It is a statement that we are going to take some action that will \nhave some benefit in containing the growth, not requiring cuts but \ncontaining the growth of spending in our country.\n  Unfortunately, as we have gotten so close to having it passed, now an \norganized effort appears to be underway to try to see if they can pull \nback a growing number of votes that have been cast for it. We started \nout with 56 votes, then went to 59 votes. Every Republican and 18 \nDemocrats voted for it. We just need one more vote and we will be able \nto take this significant step of having a statutory cap on spending.\n  The level of spending we are limiting it to is the level in the \nDemocratic budget that passed this year. The amount is not anything \nother than what the budget already calls for that was passed by a \nDemocratic majority. It is the kind of numbers we probably could do \nbetter on and we probably could and should cut some programs.\n  Regardless, what we are saying is, one of our big problems is we do \nnot stick to whatever budget we have. We constantly violate the budget. \nRepublicans have done this too. The debt now is spiraling out of \ncontrol to a degree we have never ever seen in the history of our \ncountry. It is not responsible, and we have to stop it.\n  I say this about my colleague from Arkansas--we were celebrating a \nbipartisan effort just last night when he and I and others worked on \nbalancing the crack and powder cocaine penalties so they are more fair \nand more realistic. That was a good bipartisan step.\n  I think we are on the way to a bipartisan bill. I am disappointed we \nnow have what can only be referred to as a cover amendment that does \nnot have the teeth or the strength of the amendment we have offered. It \nprovides an opportunity for people to vote for it and say they have \nvoted to contain spending: I was all for it; I didn't vote on the \nMcCaskill-Sessions amendment, but I voted on this other amendment, and \nit is just as good.\n  It is not just as good, and it does not have as much ability to \ncontain spending. It does not. It should not be substituted.\n  The American people are frustrated with us. The polling numbers for \nCongress are perhaps as low as we have ever seen in this country. One \nof the reasons is, they are tired of us manipulating and maneuvering to \ntry to make ourselves look good and the interest of the country takes \nthe hindmost. People are tired of that and in my view they are correct.\n  Some of our colleagues say that is populist; they are just angry; \nthey will go away. Americans have a right to be concerned about what we \nare doing and how these activities are occurring on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The Democratic leadership obviously decided this amendment might be \nin a position to pass. They didn't want it to pass. They conjured up \nwhat we call a cover amendment. It should not be what we adopt.\n  I note the caps are higher in this amendment than the budget \nresolution passed by Congress--the Democratic budget resolution just \nlast year. It would allow about $38 billion more in nondefense spending \nover 3 years than what was in our fiscal year 2010 budget resolution. \nThe side by side, the cover amendment, does not follow the President's \nproposal to freeze nondefense discretionary spending for 3 years. It \nwaives the fiscal 2012 and 2013 caps. It has only a 51-vote threshold.\n  I wish we could have talked some more about what Senator McCaskill \nand I have offered. Maybe we could have made some changes to the plan \nwe have. Frankly, this will be the third time we made changes in the \nlegislation to try to assuage concerns Members had that we thought were \nlegitimate and worthy of putting in the bill. I would have liked to \nhave made those changes.\n  The American people are unhappy about this situation. I know polling \nnumbers are not supposed to be the end all in Congress, but we ought to \nunderstand we work for our constituents; they do not work for us. That \nis what I am hearing out there: You work for me, Sessions, and I am \nconcerned about what you are doing up there. We want a better response \nfrom you guys.\n  This is a CNN opinion poll:\n\n       Which of the following comes closer to your view of the \n     budget deficit--the government should run a deficit if \n     necessary when the country is in a recession and at war, or \n     the government should balance the budget even when the \n     country is in a recession and is at war?\n\n  That is a pretty hard question. I think some people who are very \nfrugal might worry about how to answer that question. But look at the \nnumbers: 67 percent, two-thirds, of the American people said balance \nthe budget. Only 30 percent said run a deficit.\n  I tell you, the American people have it right. The threat to our \neconomy in the long run is one thing: debt--irresponsible, reckless, \nunsustainable growth in debt. If we would get that under control, the \ngreat American entrepreneurial spirit, the work ethic of our people, \nthe exceptional capabilities of our business leaders will allow us to \ncompete with anybody. But if we tax and spend ourselves into debt, we \nare threatening our future.\n  How big a threat is it? Look at these numbers. This is the debt. In \n2008, it was $5.8 trillion. Since the beginning of the American \nRepublic, we had accumulated $5.8 trillion in debt. It was projected by \nCBO that in 2013, it will be $11.8 trillion. In a little over 3 years, \nwe will be doubling the total American public debt. Finally, by 2019, \nbased on the budget we are operating in today and the laws that are on \nthe books today, it will triple to $17.3 trillion. Consider the \ninterest on that debt--we have to borrow the money. Does anybody \nunderstand that? We borrow the money. We are borrowing it on the world \nmarket. Interest rates are sure to surge in the years to come. Right \nnow, with the economy shaky, people are willing to buy government \nbonds, even if they pay low rates. We are getting a bargain on interest \nrates right now. But this debt isn't going to be a bargain in the \nfuture--not a bargain for the good of the country.\n\n  This chart shows the interest that will be paid. In 2009, last year, \nwe paid $187 billion in interest. In 2020, according to the President's \nbudget analysis that he submitted, it will be $840 billion--$840 \nbillion in interest in 1 year. The Federal highway bill is $40 billion \na year. Does that give us some perspective? It is bigger than the \ndefense budget.\n  These are stunning numbers. That is why every economist, Republicans \nand Democrats, the Heritage Foundation and Brookings Institution, \nformer CBO\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nDirectors and OMB Directors of both parties all say repeatedly we are \non an unsustainable course.\n  The deficits continue to surge in the outyears. They are not coming \ndown. People say: When are we going to pay it back? We are not paying \nit back. In these years, in the outyears, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, they \nare projecting steady but lower growth--but growth every year, no \nrecessions. The deficits are going to be about $1 trillion a year. They \nare not going down. We are still going into debt $1 trillion a year.\n  I guess what I am saying is, what we need to do is focus on \ndiscretionary accounts, and this amendment is it. Some say only the \nmandatory, only the entitlements count. That is not so. As of this \nmoment, this year, every penny of the surging debt--and this year's \ndeficit will be $1.5 trillion--every penny of that debt will be the \nresult of spending in the discretionary accounts, not Social Security \nand not Medicare.\n  Some say: Oh, that can't be so. Social Security and Medicare together \nare now still in net surplus. We take the money, that surplus, and we \nspend it and we give a bond back to Social Security and Medicare.\n  I guess what I am saying is, don't think the discretionary problem is \nnot a big part of the problem. It is the problem today. In the future, \nit will be an actuarial challenge of monumental proportions because the \nexpenses of Medicare and Social Security are going up and the revenue \nis going down and we are going to be in serious trouble. We need to \ndeal with this now.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to share these remarks. I \nurge my colleagues to take a good vote. Vote for the Sessions-McCaskill \namendment and oppose the Pryor amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I wish about 3 minutes to respond to my \ncolleagues.\n  I commend both Senator Sessions and Senator McCaskill for the work on \ntheir amendment. As I said, I voted for previous editions of it. I \nthink it has one major flaw, and that is it only deals with \ndiscretionary spending. I know it does affect the deficit, and that is \nvery important. But it focuses just on the spending.\n  When we did multiyear discretionary spending caps--they were a key \npart of the 1990, 1993, 1997 deficit reduction patches--they worked. \nHowever, those deficit reduction patches looked at all spending--\nmandatory and discretionary--as well as revenues. That is what our \namendment does. It takes the whole picture.\n  If we are going to walk the walk on having our fiscal house in order, \nwe need to look at the entire picture, and I think we need to do it in \na bipartisan way, as they did in previous Congresses when they made \nserious efforts to get the deficit under control. It needs to be \nbipartisan. One of the problems I have is, if we fix discretionary \nspending, it will be difficult for us to reach a bipartisan agreement \non mandatory as well as the revenue pieces of our budget.\n  Senator McCaskill mentioned this is a baby step. I don't know if it \nis a baby step. What they are proposing is a very solid first step to \ntry to get our fiscal house in order. I am just concerned it might \nclose the door.\n  I wish to make this point in closing. If we look at these purple \nlines on this graph, we see these years are the Obama years. Certainly, \nhe inherited a lot of things the first year, so the first year probably \nis not fair to give to him.\n  If you look to these years, to the President's credit, he says he \nwants to freeze discretionary spending. He says he wants the purple \nlines to get shorter. That is good, but it is not enough. It is not \nenough. The President's budget, in his proposal, in my estimation, is \nnot enough. We need to get this moving back in the right direction.\n\n  If you look at just discretionary spending and throw in the military \ndiscretionary spending as well, that is about 25 percent of the \nbudget--just discretionary alone. Domestic discretionary is only about \n12 percent. But put those two together, and let's say it is about 25 \npercent. The real flaw in the McCaskill-Sessions is that we are using \n25 percent of the budget to fix 100 percent of the budget. We need to \nput 100 percent of everything on the table so we can then use our good \njudgment and make those hard decisions to try to get us back to a \nbalanced budget.\n  We are not going to do this in 1 year. We are probably not going to \ndo it in 5 years. I wish we could do it in 5 years. But these numbers \nare not enough, and we need to move it back in the right direction. My \napproach actually helps this picture quite a bit more than their \npictures help.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3475\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of amendment No. 3475, \nwhich I have introduced. As I have stated several times already, the \namendment is very simple. It would place a moratorium on all earmarks \nin years in which there is a deficit. I am joined in this effort by my \ngood friend from Indiana, Senator Bayh, and I again thank him for his \nleadership and courage on this issue.\n  Last year, I reminded my colleagues about the current fiscal \nsituation. I think it is important to again review the facts. The \nTreasury Department, a week ago, announced the government racked up a \nrecord-high monthly deficit of $220.9 billion. We now have a deficit of \nover $1.4 trillion and a debt of $12.5 trillion, and unemployment \nremains at close to 10 percent. The list goes on and on.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate rejected an amendment offered by Senator \nDeMint. This amendment called for a moratorium on all earmarks for \nfiscal years 2010 and 2011. There wasn't anything earth-shattering \nabout that amendment. It wouldn't have shaken the foundations of our \ndemocracy. It is simply the political equivalent of calling a timeout. \nYet, sadly, 68 Senators voted against this modest proposal, including \n15 from my own party.\n  So I have no illusions about the outcome of this amendment. I have \nbeen around here long enough to see what goes on. But it doesn't mean I \nwill quit fighting, nor does it mean the American people will quit \nfighting to eliminate the waste and abuse of this system, and indeed \nthe corruption that is part of this earmarking.\n  I have listened to the arguments some of my colleagues continue to \nstate; that eliminating the earmarks isn't necessary because they \naccount for such a small part of our annual budget. Is that a reason to \ncontinue this practice?\n  I am aware that earmarks consume a small percentage of a budget \nmeasured in the trillions, but given the seriousness of our current \nsituation and the problems that are confronting American families who \nwake up every morning wondering if they are going to lose their job or \ntheir house, or if they will still be able to afford their children's \neducation, it is deeply offensive to them. It is deeply offensive that \nwe in Congress can't exercise some fiscal discipline. It is all the \nmore offensive given that we have had in recent times all the evidence \nwe should require to understand that earmarks are so closely tied to \nacts of official corruption.\n  In a report entitled ``Why Earmarks Matter,'' the Heritage Foundation \nwrote:\n\n       They Invite Corruption: Congress does have a proper role in \n     determining the rules, eligibility and benefit criteria for \n     Federal grant programs. However, allowing lawmakers to select \n     exactly who receives government grants invites corruption. \n     Instead of entering a competitive application process within \n     a Federal agency, grant-seekers now often have to hire a \n     lobbyist to win the earmark auction. Encouraged by lobbyists \n     who saw a growth industry in the making, local governments \n     have become hooked on the earmark process for funding \n     improvement projects.\n       They Encourage Spending: While there may not be a causal \n     relationship between the two, the number of earmarks approved \n     each year tracks closely with growth in Federal spending.\n       They Distort Priorities: Many earmarks do not add new \n     spending by themselves, but instead redirect funds already \n     slated to be spent through competitive grant programs or by \n     States into specific projects favored by an individual \n     member. So, for example, if a member of the Nevada delegation \n     succeeded in getting a $2 million earmark to build a bicycle \n     trail in Elko in 2005, then that $2 million would be taken \n     out of the $254 million allocated to the Nevada Department of \n     Transportation for that year. So if Nevada had wanted to \n     spend that money fixing a highway and rapidly expanding Las \n     Vegas, thanks to the earmark, they would now be out of luck.\n\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n\n  On March 17, a Roll Call editorial, ``Earmark Action,'' stated the \nfollowing:\n\n       Even though they represent just a small fraction of Federal \n     spending, earmarks have accounted for an outsized proportion \n     of Congressional embarrassment over recent years, so we are \n     pleased to see House Democrats and Republicans moving to \n     limit them. But until the Senate goes along, or until \n     President Barack Obama determines to veto earmarks when they \n     come his way, the spectacle of special interest spending \n     won't stop--nor, with it, the public's suspicion that many \n     earmark projects are bought with campaign contributions.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the editorial from Roll Call from which I just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Mar. 17, 2010]\n\n                       Editorial: Earmark Action\n\n       Even though they represent just a small fraction of federal \n     spending, earmarks have accounted for an outsized proportion \n     of Congressional embarrassment over recent years, so we are \n     pleased to see House Democrats and Republicans moving to \n     limit them.\n       But until the Senate goes along, or until President Barack \n     Obama determines to veto earmarks when they come his way, the \n     spectacle of special interest spending won't stop--nor, with \n     it, the public suspicion that many earmarked projects are \n     bought with campaign contributions.\n       After House Democrats announced that they would ban all \n     earmarks directed toward for-profit companies, Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a self-congratulatory statement that \n     ``over the past three years, we fought to replace a culture \n     of corruption with a new direction of transparency and \n     accountability, including earmark reforms in the last \n     Congress.''\n       She added that the new ban would ``ensure good stewardship \n     of taxpayer dollars by the federal government across all \n     agencies.''\n       It's true, there has been improvement in transparency. \n     Members are now required to disclose each project they are \n     requesting, along with its beneficiary. The value of earmarks \n     has fallen from $29 billion in fiscal 2006 to $19.6 billion \n     in 2009 and an expected $14 billion to $16 billion for 2010, \n     according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government \n     Waste.\n       Still, the ``culture of corruption'' has not been expunged. \n     As Roll Call reported last week, the House ethics committee \n     exonerated some of Congress' most prolific earmarkers \n     without--so far as anyone can tell--conducting a serious \n     investigation of their possible connection to campaign \n     contributions.\n       House Democrats have now announced there will be no more \n     appropriated earmarks to for-profit entities and have \n     directed federal inspectors general to audit 5 percent of all \n     earmarks directed to nonprofit entities to ensure they are \n     not providing cover for for-profit enterprises.\n       Watchdog groups have given qualified praise to those moves. \n     They've given even more plaudits to House Republicans, who \n     imposed a unilateral one-year moratorium on all of their \n     earmark requests, including those to nonprofits, plus special \n     interest tax and tariff breaks secured through the Ways and \n     Means Committee.\n       However, Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-\n     Hawaii) has ruled out any similar limits on his side of the \n     Capitol, and it remains to be seen whether Sen. Jim DeMint's \n     (R-S.C.) move to ban earmarks will ever come to a vote.\n       As we've often said before, a Member of Congress is elected \n     to look after the welfare of his or her district or state as \n     well as that of the nation--and part of that involves \n     sponsoring economic development projects.\n       But those actions should take place through regular order--\n     approval in a federal agency competitive procedure or, if \n     that fails, authorization and appropriation by Congress.\n       In the absence of a Senate ban, it's up to Obama--a \n     declared foe of earmarks--to use his veto to stop special \n     interest spending. He has a mixed record. He used persuasion \n     to keep earmarks out of last year's stimulus bill, but he has \n     yet to veto anything. This year, the Senate will give him \n     opportunities to show he's serious.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the following articles: the article in the Wall \nStreet Journal of March 17 entitled ``Earmarks in Reverse,'' the \nWashington Post article of March 12 entitled ``All Earmarks Should Be \nBanned in the House and Senate,'' the Steven and Cokie Roberts article \nentitled ``A Bribe By Any Other Name,'' the editorial of the Las Vegas \nReview-Journal entitled ``Going All In,'' and finally, the article of \nMatthew Bandyk of March 15, 2010, entitled ``Why Earmark Reform Has Not \nChanged Much In Congress.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 17, 2010]\n\n                          Earmarks in Reverse\n\n       There's nothing like a 25% approval rating and the prospect \n     of an electoral rout to focus the Congressional mind. And so \n     it is that three years after vowing to clean up earmarks, \n     House Democrats are embracing some reform--and in the process \n     inspiring some healthy earmark one-upsmanship.\n       Alarmed by public dismay at their spending, House \n     Democratic leaders last week announced an indefinite ban on \n     budget earmarks to for-profit entities. Not to be outdone, \n     House Republicans surprised even themselves by pledging a \n     total one-year ban. In the Senate, South Carolina's Jim \n     DeMint jumped in with a proposal to require a one-year \n     moratorium for both parties. Senator John McCain--that long-\n     time scourge of pork--is preparing an amendment to ban all \n     earmarks until the federal deficit is eliminated. This is one \n     political rivalry worth applauding.\n       It's also long overdue. Nancy Pelosi became Speaker in 2006 \n     in part because her party promised to clean up the earmark \n     excesses that had earned the GOP a reputation for corruption \n     and Bridges to Nowhere. Yet aside from a few stabs at \n     transparency, Democrats have practiced business as usual. \n     According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, fiscal 2010 spending \n     bills contained 9,499 earmarks worth $15.9 billion, an \n     increase over fiscal 2009's $15.6 billion.\n       The reluctance to change is rooted in the Congressional \n     belief that earmarks are the main guarantee of incumbency. \n     Earmarks were relatively rare until the rise of the Tom DeLay \n     Republicans in the late 1990s. By 2005, the high-water mark \n     of the earmark craze, both parties had linked arms to add \n     13,500 pet projects to spending bills. Legislators crow about \n     their largesse and use it to land campaign money from earmark \n     recipients.\n       This cash-for-votes mentality has become a symbol of \n     everything Americans hate about Washington. The recent \n     decision by the House ethics committee to put aside \n     allegations that seven House Members had awarded earmarks in \n     order to secure campaign donations was another sign that \n     Congress wasn't serious about changing this culture of \n     special favors.\n       So the Democratic turnabout is welcome, if incomplete. The \n     ban on for-profit earmarks will apply to a small portion of \n     pet projects. By the Appropriations Committee's estimate, the \n     for-profit ban would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks, \n     worth about $1.7 billion, in fiscal 2010.\n       The ban would miss what Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona \n     has shown to be ``shadow'' nonprofits that exist to funnel \n     money to private contractors. House Appropriations Chairman \n     David Obey has mandated that federal inspectors spot-audit \n     some earmarks to check for this practice, which might deter \n     or uncover some funny business. The GOP moratorium--which \n     appears to encompass even tax and tariff earmarks--would be \n     better, but give Democrats credit for starting the bidding.\n       The obstacle now is in the Senate, where Minority Leader \n     Mitch McConnell is lukewarm and Thad Cochran of Mississippi \n     argues that such a ban interferes with Congress's power of \n     the purse and won't save much money in any case. In fact, \n     Congress still determines where nearly all federal money is \n     spent, whether or not Members shovel billions to parochial \n     projects.\n       As for spending restraint, it's true that ObamaCare's \n     subsidies will swamp even decades of earmark restraint. But \n     you have to start somewhere, and earmarks are often a gateway \n     drug to larger fiscal addictions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 2010]\n\n         All Earmarks Should Be Banned in the House and Senate\n\n       Seven House members, including Northern Virginia Rep. James \n     P. Moran Jr. (D), collected more than $840,000 in political \n     contributions from employees and clients of a lobbying firm, \n     Paul Magliocchetti and Associates Group (PMA), during a two-\n     year span. In that same period, the lawmakers, strategically \n     situated on the Appropriations defense subcommittee, directed \n     more than $245 million in earmarks to clients of PMA.\n       If you think those two facts are unrelated, you are \n     qualified to be on the House ethics committee. The panel \n     recently found that ``simply because a member sponsors an \n     earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign \n     contributor does not, on these two facts alone, support a \n     claim that a member's actions are being influenced by \n     campaign contributions.''\n       The ethics committee acknowledged that ``there is a \n     widespread perception among corporations and lobbyists that \n     campaign contributions provide enhanced access to members or \n     a greater chance of obtaining earmarks.'' Gee, how could \n     anyone have gotten that impression? Maybe because the \n     lawmakers targeted those seeking earmarks for campaign \n     contributions? Sent their key appropriations staffers to \n     fundraisers?\n       For instance, in 2008, the appropriations director for Rep. \n     Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.) told corporations interested in \n     obtaining earmarks that they needed to submit requests by \n     Feb. 15. On Feb. 27, Mr. Visclosky's campaign manager sent a \n     letter to companies that had sought his help on defense \n     matters inviting them to a fundraiser on March 12. Mr. \n     Visclosky's political committees received $35,300 from \n     clients of PMA that month, plus another $12,000 from the \n     lobbying firm and its employees. A week after\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\n     the fundraiser, which was focused on defense contractors and \n     attended by his chief of staff and appropriations director, \n     Mr. Visclosky requested earmarks for six PMA clients, \n     totaling more than $14 million.\n       House leaders understand that voters may not be quite as \n     obtuse as the ethics committee seems to assume, and their \n     extreme embarrassment--over this and other scandals--may lead \n     to useful action. The House is right to ban lawmakers from \n     earmarking government funds for for-profit companies. It \n     should go further, and extend the prohibition to nonprofit \n     and educational institutions as well. Some nonprofit \n     institutions spend enormous sums on lobbyists, who dispense \n     campaign donations in hope of obtaining earmarks. More \n     important, the Senate must follow suit, as much as it appears \n     disinclined to do so. A system that aligns campaign cash and \n     earmarks is inherently unseemly, if not outright corrupt, and \n     the Senate is tainted by this setup as well.\n       We say this fully aware that the Constitution grants \n     Congress the power of the purse and that earmarks are not \n     close to the biggest reason for out-of-control spending. And \n     that lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to reduce the \n     number of earmarks and make the process more open. And that \n     eliminating earmarks would not end every instance in which \n     private interests lobby for--and make campaign contributions \n     in hope of obtaining--particular favors.\n       It would, however, eliminate the worst such abuse. The \n     House Ethics Manual cautions members ``to avoid even the \n     appearance that solicitations of campaign contributions are \n     connected in any way with an action taken or to be taken in \n     an official capacity.'' The ethics committee, dismissing that \n     caution and a recommendation by the newly created independent \n     Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate two of the \n     seven representatives, decided there was nothing to worry \n     about in the PMA case. With standards this lax, the only \n     reasonable choice is to end the earmarks that fuel this \n     sleazy process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Arizona Daily Sun, Mar. 11, 2010]\n\n                       A Bribe by Any Other Name\n\n                      (By Steve and Cokie Roberts)\n\n       An executive for the Sierra Nevada Corp., a defense \n     contractor based in Nevada, wanted to know why he should \n     contribute $20,000 to Rep. Peter Visclosky, an Indiana \n     Democrat. A colleague replied that Sierra Nevada was working \n     with PMA, a Washington, DC-based lobbying firm, to curry \n     favor with Visclosky, a key member of the subcommittee that \n     funded defense projects.\n       ``That's what each of the companies working with PMA and \n     Visclosky have been asked to contribute,'' explained the \n     second official. ``He has been a good supporter of SNC. We \n     have gotten over 10M in adds from him.'' (``Adds'' refers to \n     earmarks, special amendments filed by a single legislator \n     that awards contracts to a specific firm with no competitive \n     bidding.)\n       ``Bride'' is a hard term to define legally. But we know a \n     payoff when we see one. And that e-mail exchange could not \n     have been clearer: Sierra Nevada delivers for Visclosky \n     because Visclosky delivers for Sierra Nevada. And yet the \n     House Ethics Committee recently cleared Visclosky--and six \n     other lawmakers who had similar dealings with PMA clients--of \n     any ethical wrongdoing.\n       Here's what they said: ``The Standards Committee (the \n     panel's official name) found no evidence that members or \n     their official staff considered campaign contributions as a \n     factor when requesting earmarks.''\n       No evidence? The evidence of collusion was slapping them in \n     the face. Yet the committee chose the narrowest possible \n     standard of proof: If there's no smoking gun, no direct and \n     specific record of a quid pro quo, then cash-for-clout \n     transactions are entirely proper.\n       In the past, ethics panels have denounced the \n     ``appearance'' of impropriety, even when the letter of the \n     law has not been breached. But that standard has apparently \n     now been jettisoned. Leave the money on the dresser, honey. \n     Just don't ask for a receipt.\n       Full disclosure: We have many friends and relatives who are \n     lobbyists. It's an honorable profession, and campaign \n     contributions are a legitimate expression of free speech. But \n     there should be reasonable limits on how campaign cash \n     affects public policy, and the House Ethics Committee has \n     just made those limits looser, not tighter. The door to \n     greater abuse of the system has been wrenched wide open.\n       ``This will embolden members,'' Rep. Jeff Flake, an ardent \n     foe of earmarks, told the New York Times. ``In essence, \n     unless you're caught on the phone with a lobbyist saying, \n     `Contribute or else you don't get an earmark,' they you're \n     fine. That's the clear message here.''\n       That message is particularly untimely because the Supreme \n     Court ruled last January that corporations could spend their \n     own money directly on campaign advertising. As a result, \n     government contractors like Sierra Nevada are freer than ever \n     to buy influence in the political marketplace.\n       It's also untimely because President Obama campaigned \n     heavily against earmarks and vowed to curb their impact. But \n     the administration has not said a word about the ruling that \n     gutted House ethics rules. And Obama's goal of reducing the \n     role of earmarks remains largely unmet. In the last fiscal \n     year, Congress spent $15.9 billion on special-interest \n     projects, up from $15.6 billion the previous year.\n       Why should we care? That amount spent on earmarks accounts \n     for less than 2 percent of the federal budget. But the issue \n     is important for at least four reasons. First, that's the \n     taxpayer's money Congress is throwing around. As the \n     president himself said last year, ``On occasion, earmarks \n     have been used as a vehicle for waste, and fraud, and \n     abuse.'' And ``the context of a tight budget'' makes that \n     waste even more costly.\n       Second, the earmark system distorts national priorities and \n     violates principles of fairness. As Ryan Alexander, president \n     of Taxpayers for Common Sense, put it, ``Powerful lawmakers \n     are hoarding cash for their districts while the rest of the \n     Congress fights for table scraps.''\n       Third, appearances do matter. Earmarks reek of corruption \n     even if they do not violate bribery statutes. Just becaause a \n     practice is technically legal does not make it right or \n     ethical.\n       Most important, confidence in government has plummeted. \n     Americans believe that Washington rewards power and money \n     while ignoring the interest of ordinary people, and the \n     earmark system is a visible symbol of their disillusionment. \n     Obama himself has talked about ``the need for further reforms \n     to ensure that the budget process inspires trust and \n     confidence instead of cynicism.''\n       He's right about that. But the House Ethics Committee, run \n     by the president's own party, has taken a step back, not \n     forward. They have encouraged the triumph of cynicism over \n     confidence when that's the last thing we need.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Mar. 12, 2010]\n\n                        Editorial: Going All In\n\n       Facing a monumental washout this November, House Democrats \n     underwent an election year conversion this week and announced \n     they'll ban earmarks to for-profit entities.\n       Republicans promptly called their bluff and went all in.\n       With a handful of Democrats encountering ethical \n     difficulties, and the recent investigation of several House \n     members over defense earmarks, House leaders clearly took \n     their step in order to seize an election-year issue from the \n     GOP.\n       But Republicans quickly grabbed it back, vowing not to lard \n     up any spending bills this year with any earmarks.\n       ``We have a real possibility of regaining the majority, and \n     I think a lot of members realize that we have to regain the \n     voters trust somehow,'' said Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. \n     ``Earmarks are the most visible thing that we can do because \n     we abused it so badly in the past.''\n       Hear, hear.\n       Earmarking is the term used to describe it when a member of \n     Congress drops a pet project into a spending bill. These \n     grants or direct payments may benefit a local government, a \n     community organization or a profit-making entity. They have \n     come to symbolize congressional profligacy at a time when \n     many voters are now demanding fiscal restraint and \n     responsibility.\n       Rep. David Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the \n     Appropriations Committee, said he hoped that banning the \n     practice when it comes to for-profit entities would result in \n     1,000 fewer earmarks and help Congress alter the perception \n     that members routinely hand out lucrative contracts and \n     grants to campaign contributors.\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense notes that last year's defense \n     appropriations legislation included 1,720 earmarks worth $4.2 \n     billion. ``For-profit earmarks are really where the rubber \n     meets the road as far as corruption,'' Steve Ellis of the \n     watchdog group told The Associated Press.\n       That's great, as far as it goes. But add up all the \n     spending bills--not just defense--and Congress crammed \n     through 10,000 earmarks worth about $16 billion. If members \n     remain free to route the pork fat back home to nonprofit \n     entities, the problem has not been adequately addressed. Why \n     should the people of Nevada have to pay to remodel Lawrence \n     Welk's boyhood home in North Dakota?\n       ``I've long said that earmarks are the gateway drug to \n     spending addiction in Washington,'' said Sen. Tom Coburn, the \n     Oklahoma Republican who has crusaded against the practice. \n     ``Banning earmarks is a long overdue, common sense step that \n     will help Congress win back the trust of the public and \n     tackle our mounting fiscal challenges.\n       That's why House Republicans did the right thing this week \n     by going all in. Let's hope Sen. Coburn can convince GOP \n     senators to follow suit. And if the Democrats don't match the \n     pot, many of them may be out of the game come November.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From U.S. News and World Report, Mar. 15, 2010]\n\n          Why Earmark Reform Has Not Changed Much in Congress\n\n                          (By Matthew Bandyk)\n\n       Call it good timing. Shortly after an ethics investigation \n     concluded that several members of Congress did not trade \n     earmarks for campaign cash, both parties in the House \n     announced new moratoria on earmarks in spending bills. \n     Earmarks are provisions that members of Congress stick into \n     larger bills that direct federal dollars to specific \n     projects. This spending is often labeled ``pork barrel'' \n     because of the perception that earmarks benefit only local \n     constituents and special interests. While the changes \n     announced by Congress last week substantially\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\n     alter the earmarking process, they do little to change \n     Congress's ability to pursue pork barrel spending.\n       Rep. David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and chair of the \n     House Committee on Appropriations, announced that his \n     committee would no longer accept earmarks that fund private \n     for-profit entities. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied that \n     this move was connected to the ethics investigations, calling \n     the timing a coincidence. ``It just had to do with the time \n     of the year, the beginning,'' she said at a news conference. \n     ``Members are making their requests for earmarks, and we \n     thought it would be important to let them know that they \n     probably should not make a request for an earmark for a \n     business.''\n       Shortly after, House Republicans went a step further and \n     declared a unilateral moratorium on all earmarks. Minority \n     Leader John Boehner explicitly linked this move to the \n     perception that special interests have excessive influence in \n     Washington. ``For millions of Americans, the earmark process \n     in Congress has become a symbol of a broken Washington,'' he \n     said in a statement.\n       But even with both parties taking actions against earmarks, \n     there are a few reasons why pork barrel spending will \n     continue in many forms.\n       1. Every member of the House and senator could agree to \n     never put an earmark in another bill, but billions of \n     dollars' worth of projects for special interests could \n     continue. That's because there are many provisions in large \n     spending bills that resemble earmarks, but Congress does not \n     define them as such. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit \n     taxpayer watchdog group in Washington, estimates that there \n     were about 91 provisions worth about $5.9 billion in fiscal \n     year 2010 alone that TCS considers earmarks but Congress does \n     not. For example, in the fiscal year 2010 defense spending \n     bill, there was $2.5 billion to build 10 C-17 Globemaster \n     Strategic Airlift Aircraft, despite the fact that the Defense \n     Department said the 205 C-17s it already has are sufficient. \n     This spending is not considered an earmark by Congress, and \n     thus would not be affected by either the Democratic or \n     Republican earmark reform. ``They've decided that it's not an \n     earmark, even though it walks like an earmark and talks like \n     an earmark,'' says Steve Ellis, vice president of TCS.\n       2. As the majority in Congress, Democrats have the most \n     influence over earmarks at the moment. They have decided not \n     to allow earmarks ``directed to for-profit entities.'' But \n     evidence suggests that this move affects only a small \n     minority of earmarks. It can be difficult to find out which \n     percentage of earmarks are for private interests and which \n     fund nonprofit groups or state and local governments. Finding \n     out which is which is time-consuming. It requires combing \n     through the sometimes thousands of earmarks in a given bill \n     because ``Congress doesn't tell you right off the bat who the \n     beneficiary [of an earmark] is,'' says Ellis. According to \n     Representative Obey's announcement, the new earmark reform \n     would have affected about 1,000 earmarks for 2010 had it been \n     enacted last year. But according to TCS, there were about \n     9,000 earmarks in fiscal year 2010. Citizens Against \n     Government Waste, another watchdog group, counts 10,160 \n     earmarks, of which the Democratic reform affects only 10 \n     percent.\n       Furthermore, some of the earmarks that critics have cited \n     as particularly wasteful are directed to public entities, not \n     private companies. For example, last year, a federal spending \n     bill set aside $1.7 million for pig odor research at a \n     Department of Agriculture facility in Iowa.\n       3. Perhaps the most infamous earmark of all time is the \n     ``Bridge to Nowhere,'' a $400 million proposed bridge for a \n     tiny Alaska town. The earmark was axed in 2005 but would not \n     have been canceled by Obey's recent move because the money \n     would have gone to a local government. But ``even if [the \n     money] was going to Alaska Construction Inc., it would not be \n     affected'' by the Democrats' earmark reform, says Ellis. \n     That's because the change only applies to bills that come \n     from the Appropriations Committee. The Bridge to Nowhere was \n     originally placed in legislation by Rep. Don Young, an Alaska \n     Republican who was chair of the Transportation Committee. \n     This committee passes highway bills, which tend to be some of \n     the most earmark-heavy. Citizens Against Government Waste \n     counted more than 6,000 earmarked projects in the 2005 \n     highway bill.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The reason I add those to the Record is because it isn't \njust my opinion, it is the opinion of the Wall Street Journal, the \nWashington Post, and many other periodicals to this effect.\n  Also, we perhaps in the Congress might pay attention to the fact that \na poll in the last couple of days shows a 17-percent approval of \nCongress. Our approval ratings are at an all-time low. There are a \nvariety of reasons. It isn't all because of earmarks. It is because of \nthe economic situation, it is because of the frustration, it is because \nof the belief by many Americans that we are not responsive to their \nproblems and challenges they face, which are unprecedented in these \ndays, especially when we are spending $1 million to rehabilitate a \nbathhouse at Hot Springs, AR, $1 million for a waterless urinal \ninitiative, $250,000 for turf grass research, $500,000 for a teapot \nmuseum in North Carolina, $2 million for the Vulcan monument in Alabama \nor $556,000 for the Montana Sheep Institute.\n  Some may argue these are small amounts of money. But Americans don't \nunderstand when they can't stay in their homes or educate their kids or \nthey can't keep their jobs, why Congress continues to engage in this \npractice.\n  Let me just say, in the interest of full disclosure, this problem was \nexacerbated when Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress. \nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       The reluctance to change is rooted in the Congressional \n     belief that earmarks are the main guarantee of incumbency. \n     Earmarks were relatively rare until the rise of the Tom DeLay \n     Republicans in the late 1990s. By 2005, the high-water mark \n     of the earmark craze, both parties had linked arms to add \n     13,500 pet projects to spending bills. Legislators crow about \n     their largesse and use it to land campaign money from earmark \n     recipients. This cash-for-votes mentality has become a symbol \n     of everything Americans hate about Washington. The recent \n     decision by the House ethics committee to put aside \n     allegations that seven House Members awarded earmarks in \n     order to secure campaign donations was another sign that \n     Congress wasn't serious about changing this culture of \n     special favors.\n\n  So I think, Madam President, we could take a major step in the \ndirection of restoring confidence in us if we would just stop using the \nearmark process until the deficit is erased. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this proposal and to reconsider their opposition to it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today in support of the bill \nthat is before us--the FAA reauthorization legislation, which is \ncurrently on the Senate floor. I thank Senator Dorgan, the neighboring \nState to Minnesota, for his leadership on the committee and on the \nsubcommittee. I am proud to be a member of that subcommittee and to \nhave worked on this bill.\n  The air transportation system is important to all Americans and \ncertainly to the people of my State. Minnesota is the childhood home of \nCharles Lindberg. Today, Minnesota is a major hub of Delta, which was \npreviously Northwest Airlines. It flies people literally all over the \nworld. We are also home to Cirrus Aircraft, which is one of the \nmanufacturers of smaller planes up in Duluth. We have thousands of \npilots and airline employees who fly each and every day, both for their \nenjoyment as well as for their livelihood.\n  As anyone who has recently flown on an airplane knows, our airport \ntransportation system is strained and it is subject to increased \ncongestion and delay. Recent notable incidents have, in fact, called \ninto question the safety of our commercial aircraft as well as the \ntraining of a few of the pilots who fly them. We know, for the most \npart, that we have a very good air system, but we also know there must \nbe improvements, especially if we are going to compete on a global \nbasis with other countries that are working to update their air traffic \nsystems.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nAviation and someone who has worked hard to bring this legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate, I know this bill will address many of the \nconcerns of people around our country.\n  First, this legislation incorporates important safety improvements. \nThe tragedy of Colgan Air Flight No. 3407, which crashed outside of \nBuffalo in February of last year, brought the safety of our airlines \nback into the public eye and raised new questions about the safety of \nregional aircraft and the training and experience of the pilots who fly \nthem.\n  We have had many hearings, thanks to Senator Dorgan, on this tragedy. \nEvery single time there were families of people who were killed in that \ncrash in the hearing room to remind us of the changes that need to be \nmade.\n  Pilots for these regional carriers are, in some cases, not trained as \nwell as for major carriers. They are overtired and underpaid. In fact, \nsome regional pilots earn so little that they take second and sometimes \nthird jobs. Many pilots live far away from their bases, leading to long \ncommutes and even longer hours spent waiting in airports.\n  The facts surrounding the Buffalo crash bear this out. The first \nofficer,\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nwho earned around $20,000 a year, flew to Newark on a red-eye flight on \nthe day of the accident. She arrived at 6:30 a.m. and reports indicate \nshe spent the entire day in the Newark airport sending text messages to \nher friends before her shift began. The evidence also suggests the \npilot was up for large parts of the night before the flight. Once on \nthe plane, the pilot and the first officer broke FAA policy by engaging \nin nonessential banter and conversation during critical times of the \nflight. And the flight data recorder indicated the crew was \ninexperienced, poorly trained, and ill-prepared for the tough weather \nconditions that night.\n  As the first officer told the pilot--and this is an exact quote--and \nI will never forget this because being from Minnesota, we have a lot of \nice issues, and it is where, in fact, Senator Wellstone was killed in a \ncrash, in part because of poor pilot training and icing issues. This is \nthe quote of the first officer on that plane, before that plane went \ndown in Buffalo:\n\n       I've never seen icing conditions. I've never de-iced. I've \n     never experienced any of that.\n\n  Imagine the chilling effect of those words on the families of those \nwho died in that crash.\n  Many people in my State rely on regional jets to connect them to each \nother and to the world. As I have said before, a passenger should be as \nsafe on a regional carrier going from Minneapolis to Duluth as they \nwould be on a Boeing 767 flying from Los Angeles to New York.\n  This legislation will help us do just that. In particular, the bill \nwill require the FAA to adopt new rules on pilot fatigue, rules that \nhave not been updated since the 1950s. And the bill will boost pilot \ntraining requiring that the pilots meet certain standards before being \nallowed in the cockpit so we will not have to hear those words again, \nSenator Dorgan, ``I've never seen icing conditions. I've never de-iced \n. . . I've never experienced any of that.''\n  In short, this legislation will help raise the safety standards for \nregional jets and pilots and ensure one level of safety for all \ncommercial aircraft in this country. The thing I most remember is there \nis an argument, in fact, that regional flights are even more difficult \nthan the big passenger planes. Why? They have to land and land and \nland, have shorter flights, and they actually are more tiring and they \nhave a better chance of encountering difficult weather conditions, so \nwe should have one level of safety for all commercial aircraft in this \ncountry.\n  Recent safety incidents have not only highlighted concerns with \nregional airlines but with major carriers as well. In 2008 we learned \nthat some major carriers had kept flying aircraft in need of necessary \nrepairs and that the FAA may have actually known about it. The \ndisclosure of these safety lapses led to thousands of flight \ncancellations, and these safety lapses and cancellations raised \nquestions about the FAA's ability to enforce our safety laws and \nregulations.\n  What we learned is troubling. The Department of Transportation's \ninspector general described an ``overly collaborative relationship'' \nbetween FAA management and the airlines they regulated.\n  To help recalibrate the balance between the FAA and the carriers, \nSenator Snowe and I introduced the Aviation Safety Enhancement Act to \nensure that the FAA does more than just trust that the airlines comply \nwith all Federal safety regulations. In particular, the legislation, \nwhich has been incorporated into the FAA reauthorization bill we are \nnow considering, puts a stop to the so-called revolving door between \nthe FAA and the carriers by requiring a cooling-off period for FAA \ninspectors before they can work for the airlines and interact with the \nFAA.\n  It also establishes a whistleblower office in the FAA and creates a \nroving ``National Review Board'' that will travel around to various FAA \ninspection offices to conduct safety reviews and unannounced audits. \nThese unannounced safety audits are important.\n  I tend to straighten up my house a bit before I know my mother-in-law \nis coming over and that is why I know that if you have an unannounced \nvisit, you might have a different result than an announced visit. These \nunannounced safety audits will be very important to make sure things \nare in order, that facilities are in order, and help ensure that the \ncarriers remain focused on safety and that the FAA remains true to its \nmission, to protect the American flying public.\n  We also need to pass this FAA reauthorization bill because it would \nput a passenger bill of rights into law. The need for a passenger bill \nof rights was made clear to me and other Minnesotans last summer. Just \nask Link Christin. On August 7, Link was aboard Continental Flight \n2816, a flight from Houston Intercontinental Airport to Minneapolis-St. \nPaul when it was redirected to the Rochester airport in Rochester, MN \ndue to severe weather. It landed in Rochester around midnight and the \npassengers were not allowed off the plane until 6 a.m. the next day, \nmidnight to 6 am. The passengers aboard the flight described the \nexperience as a ``nightmare,'' saying they were not given any food or \ndrinks during the time waiting, things smelled, there were babies on \nthe plane. It is as if common sense had flown out the window, but the \nwindows were not open. No passengers should have to go through what \nLink and the other passengers aboard Continental Flight 2816 went \nthrough--forced to remain on the tarmac for 6 hours without food, in an \nincreasingly uncomfortable cabin atmosphere, and denied the opportunity \nto deplane when the airport was only yards away. The FAA \nreauthorization bill we are considering today helps ensure we don't \nhave any more stories such as Link Christin's. I appreciate Secretary \nLaHood's leadership on this already, but we should be putting this into \nlaw.\n  In particular, the bill requires that airlines provide passengers \nwith food, water, and adequate restrooms during a delay. The passenger \nbill of rights would also require airplanes to return to the gate once \nthe plane has sat on the ground for 3 hours--or 3.5 hours if the pilot \nthinks the plane will take off before then.\n  Finally, this bill helps upgrade our air traffic control system to \nthe next generation, the NextGen system of air traffic control \ntechnology. We have focused a lot lately on roads and bridges which I \nknow, coming from Minnesota where the bridge fell down in the middle of \na summer day, are critically important parts of our Nation's \ninfrastructure, but our national aviation infrastructure is just as \nimportant. The current air traffic control technology, developed in the \n1950s and used by the FAA today, is based on outdated technology that \nrelies on ground-based radar systems, voice communications, and \nfragmented weather forecasts. With NextGen, a system that uses \nsatellites rather than ground-based radar, both pilots and controllers \nwill have the benefit of virtual maps, up-to-date weather reports, and \nother real-time information.\n  The result is a more efficient use of our airspace, safer skies, and \nless congested airports. That is something we should all be able to \nsupport.\n  In this bill we make sure that NextGen is a national priority by \ngiving it the resources and the attention it needs to get the program \nup and running.\n  The aviation system is too crucial a part of our Nation's \ninfrastructure and too important to our Nation's economy to let the \nproblems go unaddressed. This bill modernizes our air traffic control \nsystem, our air transport system, it puts in that passenger bill of \nrights, it does something about pilot safety and training, and all the \nthings we know need to get done here. It helps to ensure that our \nsystem is in fact the safest in the world. We have waited too long to \npass this bill. But now is the time when the rubber meets the runway. \nIt is time to pass the FAA reauthorization and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to briefly comment about the \nPryor amendment that has been offered as an alternate, a side-by-side, \nor cover amendment to the Sessions-McCaskill amendment that would take \nthe budget limits that were passed by this Congress and make those more \ndifficult to violate by creating a two-thirds vote for it. I would say \na couple of things about the Pryor amendment.\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n  It is not good and we should not vote for it. It pretends to have \ngood motives, and maybe it does have good motives. But in fact it would \nallow $62 billion more in spending over 3 years than the McCaskill-\nSessions amendment. It would instruct the deficit commission to propose \ntax increases and entitlement cuts to pay for increases in \ndiscretionary spending. The deficit commission was not meant for \nraising taxes and cutting entitlements to pay for new discretionary \nspending increases. The whole purpose of that was to figure out a way \nto deal with the surging entitlements that are growing out of control \nand to contain their growth.\n  How are we going to do that? We are going to do it two ways, \nprimarily. I suppose they will propose some sort of tax increases, \nincrease in Social Security withholding or increase in Medicare \nwithholding, and they will cut Medicare and Social Security benefits. \nThat is what real life is.\n  But this would instruct the commission to cut entitlement benefits, \nMedicare, and Social Security, to increase taxes, and use it to fund \nmore discretionary spending. That is not good. People should not vote \nfor an amendment that would do that. We are going to have to wrestle \nwith the entitlement commission. It does not have binding authority, it \nis a recommendation to us, and maybe they will have some \nrecommendations we can all support. But it is not going to be fun. It \nis not going to be easy. There is no free lunch. Nothing comes from \nnothing. Somebody must pay to fix the entitlements. They are at the \npresent time in surplus and the surplus they are producing from the \nrevenue from Social Security withholding and Medicare withholding is \nbeing spent for discretionary spending. So to raise their income for \nthose accounts and to cut spending in those accounts to allow even more \nspending on the discretionary side I think would be very unwise. \nPerhaps that is not what was intended but that is what appears to me to \nbe pretty plainly what is going on in this amendment.\n  Second, the Republican counsel on the Budget Committee has advised \nthat the amendment would not only abandon the two-thirds requirement \nthat Senator McCaskill and I are proposing to violate the budget, but \nit actually would eliminate the point of order that currently requires \n60 votes to violate the budget. Currently, if somebody proposes a \nspending amount that violates the budget, any Senator can object and it \nwould take 60 votes to waive the budget to allow this extra spending to \noccur. The way we are reading this amendment is that it would \ndramatically weaken the existing law and eliminate this point of order \nthat would even require 60 votes. That has not proven to be a very \neffective tool. The two-thirds vote would be better.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to share these remarks and \nurge my colleagues to resist the Democratic leadership's injunctions \nand pressures to vote against the Sessions-McCaskill amendment. I know \n18 Democrats have already voted for it. It is a bipartisan bill. We \nworked at it together in a good way. It has the ability to take a \nsignificant, though not dramatic, but a solid step in the right \ndirection. I am disappointed we are now proposing an alternative \namendment that will not be as effective and that the leadership on the \nDemocratic side is opposing. If Senator Reid and Senator Durbin said: \nFine, you can vote for this if you like or: We are going to vote for \nit, do what you want, Senator, it would pass like that. But it is their \nleadership decision that has put us in a difficult position and makes \nit more difficult for us to get 60 votes. I hope we can, but it may not \noccur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise today to speak about this \ncritical legislation we have before us--The Federal Aviation \nAdministration Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement \nAct.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman Dorgan, Ranking \nMembers Hutchison and DeMint for their hard work on this critical \nlegislation.\n  I share the concerns raised by Chairman Dorgan, as he spoke on the \nfloor about the need to advance this legislation, and implement a \nnumber of vital improvements to the safety and security of our aviation \nsystem\n  On the night of February 12, 2009, Continental flight 3407, operated \nby Colgan Air, departed Newark Airport bound for Buffalo, NY.\n  The 45 passengers and 5 crewmembers were just miles from the airport \nwhen a series of events resulted in the death of all aboard as well as \na father on the ground whose home was the unfortunate final resting \nplace of flight 3407.\n  Over this last year, I have gotten to know many of the families of \nthe victims very well. They are a constant presence here in Washington, \nDC, working to improve safety conditions so that others are spared from \nthe horror and loss that they have experienced.\n  Sitting in my office last spring, as the NTSB began to release \ninformation on the crash, I discussed with the families the tremendous \nvalue of their advocacy. For decades the system has been slow to change \nand in the mean time innocent lives have been lost.\n  We discussed the possibility of seizing on this very legislation as a \nvehicle of change--to bring accountability and transparency to the \nsystem--to strengthen the training requirements and push forward to \nachieving not just ``one level of safety'' but a ``higher level of \nsafety''.\n  That conversation began a year-long campaign by the families who, on \ntheir own dime, have been here at every aviation-safety hearing both in \nthe Senate and House and have frequented Senator's offices with the \nsteadfast determination to turn this tragedy into a clarion call for \nchange.\n  We must remember the people we lost in the Buffalo crash.\n  An expecting mother, a community health advocate, a young couple in \nlove, an international human rights leader, a second-year law student. \nThese were mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters, \ntaken suddenly, their passions and dreams left for those closest to \nthem to honor and pursue.\n  Beverly Eckert died in that crash. She was a national leader, who \ntook her personal tragedy of losing her husband on September 11, and \nbecame a leading advocate for the 9/11 families. She was on her way to \nBuffalo that night to celebrate her late husband's birthday with \nfamily, and to honor a student at Canisius High School with a \nscholarship named for her husband.\n  Gerry Niewood, was a noted jazz musician, Rochester native and \ngraduate of the Eastman School of Music and University at Buffalo. \nGerry was on his way to Buffalo to join his long-time friend and Grammy \nwinner Chuck Mangione in a concert with the Buffalo Philharmonic \nOrchestra.\n  The details surrounding the tragedy of flight 3407 have been well-\ndocumented.\n  We know that for the 2 days prior to that night, the captain, who had \na history of training failures, had not slept in a bed, commuting from \nhis home in Florida.\n  The copilot, who had complained of illness during the trip, had also \nnot slept in a bed the night before, commuting from her home in \nSeattle, with a stop in Memphis, to her duty station at LaGuardia.\n  I don't know of many jobs, especially those where people's lives are \nin your hands, that can be done under these circumstances.\n  Although not specifically addressed in this underlying bill, this \nissue of commuting and duty time, is but one of many factors that came \ntogether to result in this tragedy.\n  Working with my colleague, Senator Schumer, we advanced legislation \nthat would raise the minimum standards for new commercial pilots. A \nversion of this proposal, which was endorsed by the Families of Flight \n3407, has been secured in this underlying legislation.\n  The new standards would increase the minimum flight hours for \ncommercial hires from the current 250 hours to 800 for copilots. Apart \nfrom just more flight time experience, the new regulations would \nincrease the quality of that training, not just the quantity.\n  The proposal requires the Administrator of the FAA to engage in \nrulemaking that requires that beyond the 800 hours minimum pilots must \ndemonstrate effective operation of aircraft in: multipilot conditions; \nadverse weather conditions, including icing conditions, as was the case \nwith flight\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\n3407; high altitude operations; and basic standards of cockpit \nprofessionalism and operations in part of the airline industry.\n  A major concern that I share with the families, is that often times, \nwhen left to their own, the FAA has a poor track record in acting on \nupdating regulations.\n  This legislation will give the FAA until end of next year to enact \nthese new regulations or a more stringent set of regulations will \nbecome the across-the-board standard.\n  Also, included in this bill is the crux of the Flight 3407 Memorial \nAct, my legislation that would require the FAA to report back to \nCongress on all new safety recommendations issues by the National \nTransportation Safety Board investigative reports.\n  Time and time again the FAA has failed to enhance training \nrequirements and other safety measures. The version of the reporting \nrequirements that I secured in the underlying bill will not only \nrequire the FAA to respond to NTSB recommendations, but let the \nAmerican people know what actions they are taking, and the timeline by \nwhich they will act on recommendations.\n  This will ensure that the voices of the families are not only heard, \nbut responded to.\n  Instituting this level of oversight is critical as we look to assure \nthe Families of Flight 3407, and all Americans who travel by air, that \nthose responsible for acting on the recommendations of safety experts, \nare not simply filing those recommendations away in a filing cabinet, \nnever to see the light of day. They are listening and implementing \nsafer standards and procedures.\n  I am grateful for the hard work of the Commerce Committee and \nleadership in bringing this important bill forward.\n  The steps taken in this legislation begin to address the culture of \ninaction that helped contribute to the crash outside Buffalo.\n  It is time to learn the lessons of the past, change the culture of \ninaction, and make air travel safer for all of us.\n  We owe it to those lost to never forget, and to continue our work to \naddress the serious concerns raised over the last year.\n  I look forward to seeing these improvements contained in this \ncritical legislation enacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, let \nme say that the families of the victims of the Colgan crash--the \ntragedy that occurred just about a year ago now--have been unrelenting \nin coming to the Congress, appearing at every single hearing, meeting \nwith Members of Congress, saying: We want these changes.\n  I just wanted to say I know the families know but New Yorkers should \nknow the work Senator Gillibrand has done, and Senator Schumer as well, \nto try to include in this legislation, the FAA Reauthorization Act, \nsome very needed changes, safety changes, that resulted from what we \nlearned in investigating that accident.\n  Senator Gillibrand talked about the fact that 2 people entered the \ncockpit of a commercial plane that evening, and then a number of \npeople--45 people--entered from another door and filled that commercial \nairplane and set off at night, in bad weather, with icing conditions. \nThe two people in the cockpit--the person flying in the left seat, the \ncaptain, had not slept in a bed for 2 nights, and the copilot had not \nslept in a bed the night before. As Senator Gillibrand indicated, she \nhad deadheaded from Seattle, WA, which is where she lived, to go to \nwork, to a workstation in La Guardia. This is a young copilot who was \npaid between $20,000 and $23,000 a year in salary deadheading across \nthe country to get to her duty station, not feeling particularly well, \nsitting in the crew lounge, where there is no bed.\n  The point is, we have learned that is just the fatigue issue and the \ncommuting issue. We learned about training issues in that cockpit with \nthe stick pusher, the stick shaker, icing conditions, and other things. \nSo I want to say we have learned so much from that tragedy.\n  Our hearts go out to the victims of the crash, and, yes, the pilot \nand copilot lost their lives as well, and our hearts go out to their \nfamilies. But it is important for us to learn from this. The diligence \nof Senator Gillibrand and Senator Schumer, especially, and I would say \nespecially the witness exhibited by the families of the victims over \nall of these months have been extraordinarily important in putting in \nthis bill some very needed safety changes. So I thank Senator \nGillibrand for her diligence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I would like to speak on my amendment \nhere for a few minutes, somewhat in response to Senator Sessions but \nreally more just to ask my colleagues to please consider voting for the \nPryor amendment.\n  This reminds me of a conversation I had a few years ago with a friend \nof mine in Arkansas. He is kind of a member of the deficits-do-not-\nmatter club. This was probably 6 years ago. I was a pretty new Senator \nhere.\n  I said: Look, we have to start to get this thing turned around. Some \nof the policies we have done here are not good, not sustainable for the \ncountry.\n  He told me back then that deficits do not matter. And where I \ndisagree with him and others like him I said: Look, anytime any of us \nwalk into a bank or some other financial institution and want to borrow \nmoney, the first question they ask is, How are you going to pay it \nback? That is what they want to know: How are you going to pay it back? \nThe problem we have had around here for years now is that we have no \nplan to pay this money back--none. We have no plan to pay this money \nback, and that is why we are just pushing it off down the road to \nwhere, you know, we do not have to make the hard decisions.\n  But I want to tell you right now, our children and grandchildren do \nnot appreciate what we are doing to them. We have to take \nresponsibility for us living beyond our means. The way I look at this \nis that in America for too long, we have lived beyond our means. Our \ngovernment has done that. Corporate America has done that. There is too \nmuch debt in corporate America. We have seen that over the last year \nand a half. Also, individuals and families have done that. We have done \nthat on a personal basis with too much debt. And we all need to take \nresponsibility. We all need to manage that and manage our way out of \nthat situation.\n  My amendment basically, as much as anything, communicates to the \nAmerican public, it communicates to the global economy, it communicates \nto all of the economists and all of those experts on Wall Street, all \nother places all around the world, that we are capable of making these \ndifficult decisions and that we are willing to make the hard calls in \norder to get this done.\n  I know one of the criticisms we are going to have on the Pryor \namendment is that it may lead to raising taxes. Certainly, I hope it \ndoes not. But we have to be willing, in this Chamber and in that \nChamber down the hall and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we have to be \nwilling to make these hard choices, these hard calls. That is what we \ncall leadership and that is what we call democracy.\n  People elect us to come to Washington to make difficult calls. The \neasiest thing we can do is to be fiscally irresponsible. It is like in \nour own personal house. Hey, I would love to have a bass boat. I would \nlove to buy a new car every year. I would like to have a lake house. \nBut I cannot afford those things. In this Nation, we have gotten to the \npoint where we cannot afford to have it all.\n  The Pryor amendment really gets us back in the zone where we can \nmanage this fiscal picture we have, and hopefully what we can do, over \nthe next 10, 12, 15 years, however long it is going to take, we can \nactually get back to a surplus and make a significant dent in paying \noff the national debt. I think we have to do that. It is imperative \nthat we start now.\n  That is what the Pryor amendment is about and really the biggest \nadvantage over the Sessions-McCaskill amendment. Again, I have total \nrespect for these two Senators. They have spent a long time on this. \nThey have been working on this for a long time. But I think the \nlimitation of their amendment and really the big shortfall there is \nthat it only deals with discretionary spending. As I showed you earlier \nin\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nthe pie chart, that is a very small piece of the fiscal pie. We need to \nput it all on the table, and we need to show the American public we are \nserious. We need to show them that we are willing to take this on; that \nwe have the discipline it requires to restore fiscal responsibility \nhere in this government; that we can reduce the deficit, and that we \ncan return our Nation once again back to a fiscally sound path. That is \nreally what this issue is about today.\n  I very strongly encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to look \nat the Pryor amendment. I encourage you to vote for mine. I think it is \na more comprehensive approach than Senator Sessions' and Senator \nMcCaskill's. As I said, I voted for that one twice before in previous \niterations of it. It has changed a little bit. I voted for it before. \nBut I have come to the conclusion that we need a comprehensive \nsolution. We need to put it all on the table. And we need to show the \nleadership--this country is crying out for leadership. We need to show \nsome leadership on this issue and show people we are serious and \nwilling to do what it takes in order to get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are on the FAA reauthorization bill. I want to comment \non the discussion of my colleague from Arkansas, but I will do that \nbriefly.\n  I did want to say before that, however, that we really threaten to \nlose this bill. We have been on the floor now 5 days. We have a number \nof amendments. We are going to vote at 2 o'clock today on a couple of \namendments that are properly filed, but they have nothing to do with \nthe underlying bill. We have some other amendments still waiting that \nhave nothing to do with the underlying bill. And then we have this \nissue of slot rules and perimeter rules with National Airport, which is \nunbelievably complicated. I think we have eight amendments, and my hope \nis that we can convince people not to offer those amendments. We will \ntry to deal with them in conference because the House has a couple of \nprovisions. But if we do not complete this bill today, after 5 days, \nthen I worry we will never get back to it and once again the issues of \naviation safety and airport improvement funds and all of those issues \nwill be left at the starting gate.\n  We have extended this 11 times. Rather than reauthorizing the FAA \nbill, we have extended it 11 times.\n  Now we finally have legislation that deals with aviation safety, \nwhich is so unbelievably important, a passengers' Bill of Rights, AIP \nimprovement funds. Let's get this done today. I urge colleagues, if \nthey have amendments to offer, offer them.\n  As to the vote at 2 o'clock, Senator Pryor has offered an amendment \nthat one of my colleagues described as a cover amendment, not very \nserious. That is unfair to Senator Pryor. His amendment is not only \nserious, it is so much better than an amendment described as a baby \nstep. It is OK to take baby steps, but we don't exactly face baby \nchallenges. We have unbelievable fiscal policy challenges. It should \nnot surprise anybody that we face these unbelievable challenges. Ten \nyears ago, we had a budget surplus. President George Bush said: I want \nvery large tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to the wealthiest \nAmericans. Some of us said no. I said no. Katy bar the door, it \nhappened. It accounts for about 50 percent of the current deficit, as a \nmatter of fact, going forward.\n  Then we had a recession. Then we had a 9/11 attack. We had a war \nagainst terrorism, a war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now back in \nAfghanistan. None of that was paid for. All paid for with emergency \nmoney stuck on top of the Federal debt. This is unsustainable. There is \nno question how serious it is. But when we do address it, let's address \nit in a way that tends to grab this problem and begins to fix it. My \ncolleague seemed to suggest, let's clean house, and we will only do the \nsmallest room. That doesn't make any sense to me. Senator Pryor has \noffered an amendment that says: Let's look at all areas. I know why it \nis the smallest room. Because the minute you talk about taxes, some \npeople here have an apoplectic seizure. What about asking people who \naren't paying their fair share to do so. What about asking those \nearning the highest incomes in the land and paying a 15-percent tax \nrate to begin paying what the rest of the American people pay? How \nabout that? Is that a tax increase? I suppose for somebody who makes \n$3.6 billion in a year, which is $300 million a month or $10 million a \nday, and that person, who incidentally was the highest income earner \nrunning a hedge fund in 2008, that person not only got $10 million a \nday in income but, because of the generosity of this Chamber and \nothers, gets to pay a 15-percent rate, one of the lowest income tax \nrates.\n  Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece some while ago. I like Warren \nBuffett. I have known him for some years, one of the world's richest \nmen. They did a little survey in his office in Omaha. Of the people who \nwork in that office, if you take a look at the taxes paid, income taxes \nand payroll, the lowest tax rate paid was by one of the world's richest \npeople. A higher tax rate is paid by his receptionist than by him. \nThink of that. Warren Buffett is the first to say that is not fair. It \nis not right. You need to straighten that out. Under what we are going \nto vote on proposed by the Sessions-McCaskill amendment, you couldn't \ndo that. They want to keep that over here because that would be trouble \nif you decided to ask those folks to pay their fair share.\n  It is not a tax increase to ask others to pay what most Americans \npay. If you want all the benefits America has to offer, how about \nmeeting the responsibilities to your country?\n  That is a lengthy way of saying, Senator Pryor has offered an \namendment that says: Let's look at everything. Let's ask those who are \nnot paying their share to pay. Let's look at discretionary spending but \nnot only that. Look at all of it: Defense, entitlements, do it all, and \ndo it in a serious way with the seriousness of purpose that says to the \npeople looking to the future, we are going to get this under control. \nWe are going to seize this deficit and debt problem and tame it. We \ndon't have a choice. If we don't reestablish some confidence in the \nfuture among the American people, this economy will not recover.\n  I briefly taught economics in college. I used to teach that this is \nall about confidence. If people are confident, they do things that are \nexpansive to the economy--buy a suit, a car, a home, take a trip. They \ndo things that expand the economy. When they are not confident about \ntheir families, about the future, they do exactly the opposite. They \ndelay the purchase. That contracts the economy. We need to do some \nthings that will give the American people some confidence that we are \nnot going to stay on this path. This path is unsustainable. It requires \nus to look at every aspect of fiscal policy and domestic policy and \nfind a way to tame these deficits.\n  I strongly support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArkansas. I don't agree it deserves to be called a cover amendment. It \nhas a much greater seriousness of purpose than the Sessions-McCaskill \namendment. I hope the Senate will see fit to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Pryor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Unless my colleague from Arkansas wants to respond, I will \nproceed.\n  Let me comment on the suggestion by the Senator from North Dakota \nthat we need to move on with this legislation. I agree. It could be \nconcluded this week. On the other hand, the matter that relates to the \nperimeter rule and slots at the airport, while every bit as complicated \nas my colleague suggested, is also very much in need of resolution. One \nway or another, we will have to get that resolved on this bill. I am \nhoping that after a meeting we will convene in a little less than an \nhour, a compromise can be achieved such that we can move forward and \nget something adopted. But we will not finish that bill until that \nimportant issue is dealt with.\n  I will refrain from talking further about that in the hopes that \nthere is a compromise we can support.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Surely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me observe that we were able to get that bill out of \nthe Commerce Committee because we did not deal with the slot issue. I \nunderstand there is an appetite for slots and perimeters. The only way \nwe will get an FAA reauthorization bill done is if\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nwe get it out of the Senate and get into conference somehow. That is \nthe dilemma. If we get involved in a lengthy debate with multiple \namendments on slots and perimeters, we may never get the FAA \nauthorization off the floor. We will never have the opportunity to get \nall the other things that relate to that bill.\n  It seems to me we could in conference, even as it goes to conference, \nwork on a solution that would resolve some of the issues the Senator \nmentioned.\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly appreciate the sentiment of my colleague. The \nunderlying bill is important to get done. These perimeter rule \nrevisions are important too. Our fear is, unless there is some action, \nit will not be resolved, as it hasn't been in the past. I don't think \nit has to be a lot of amendments or a huge amount of debate. I do think \nwe need the opportunity to have a vote or two on a couple of these \namendments. If they don't prevail, then so be it. But that is an issue \nwe will have to deal with one way or the other.\n  What I would like to do is change the subject a little bit and talk \nabout the proposals made by Senators Sessions and Pryor in a different \ncontext. We just got the word from the Congressional Budget Office that \nthe new cost of the legislation on health care is going to be over $940 \nbillion. Each iteration of this bill has seen an increase in the cost. \nThis is striking because, as we know, even though the Congressional \nBudget Office has had to take the legislative language as it has been \ngiven to them in providing the pricetag and, therefore, alleges that it \nwill not put us in deficit, the truth is, it will. If you double count \nsavings, if you assume savings that will not exist and so on, then you \ncan project a budget-neutral bill. I think most objective observers \nhave acknowledged that the bill will be far out of balance and that the \n$940 billion price tag will not be paid for by the various taxes and \nspending reductions ostensibly a part of the bill.\n  There is nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion dollars in Medicare cuts. Most people \nthink that is unrealistic. We have never been able to find that much \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the past. It is going to be hard to find it \nin the future. You can't assume we will save all that money.\n\n  It is true this new bill will also raise taxes. There are 12 or 13 \nnew taxes in the bill. It supposedly raises about $\\1/2\\ trillion in \ntaxes. That includes on seniors, the chronically ill, and on the very \ndrugs and devices that help us when we are sick. I wonder how long \nthose taxes are going to last.\n  The bottom line is, we will be adding to the deficit under this \nlegislation or paying a lot more in taxes than we do today. The irony \nis, we are not even solving the core problem we started out to try to \nsolve, which was to reduce the cost of health care premiums. CBO \nconfirms over and over again that premiums will continue to rise. They \nsay, in the individual market, this bill will cause premiums to soar by \n10 to 13 percent in the year 2016 because the government is going to \nforce patients to buy benefits packages with coverage they may not need \nor want.\n  According to Lewin Associates, an objective observer, the premiums \nwill go up even more. A third study, Oliver Wyman & Associates, has \nprojected that prices will exceed a 50-percent increase--in my State of \nArizona, a 72-percent increase in premiums--as a result of this \nlegislation. That is almost incomprehensible and it is wrong. The irony \nis, the increases will be paid by small businesses that we are asking \nto hire more people. It is going to paid for by young families and \nindividuals forced to buy insurance they don't believe they need right \nnow. Right now they have relatively low premiums because they have \nrelatively low health care needs. The bill will raise the cost of \ninsurance for many Americans and then, through new mandates, force \neveryone to buy a policy and not just any policy but one that has \nactually been written in Washington.\n  It adds a new entitlement we can't afford. There are so many other \nthings wrong with it. My point was not to go through all the things \nwrong with the health care bill but, because we now know or we believe \nthe bill will be voted on in the House perhaps as early as Sunday and \nwe now have the new score, the biggest score yet of almost $1 trillion, \nit is worth talking about in the context of the amendments on the floor \nto try to deal with escalating spending.\n  During his campaign, President Obama made almost a fetish out of \nsaying he would fix the way Washington works. There would be no more \nbusiness as usual. But from what we have seen on the health care \ndebate, there has been arm-twisting and backroom deals and sweetheart \ndeals that end up buying the votes they need to pass the legislation \nbut add dramatically to the cost, as well as the unfairness, because \ncertain provisions of the bill are made inapplicable to certain favored \nconstituencies.\n  I have always thought, if the bill is such a great idea, why would \nMembers exempt their own constituents from the application of the bill. \nOne of the areas in which this is done is the cuts to Medicare. About \nhalf of that comes from reducing the benefits under Medicare Advantage. \nMedicare Advantage is enjoyed by a great many seniors who are on \nMedicare, about 330,000 in my State of Arizona. Their benefits will be \ndramatically decreased under the bill. Our colleague from Florida heard \nan earful from his constituents, senior citizens, who said: Don't cut \nmy benefits under Medicare Advantage. He said OK. We will grandfather \nyou, and we will grandfather some folks from other States. But my \nconstituents in Arizona don't get grandfathered. Their benefits are \ngoing to be cut. How is that fair? How is that right?\n  Let me run through a couple of these other special deals. \nUnfortunately, not everybody gets the advantage of these special deals. \nThere was the so-called ``Louisiana purchase,'' $300 million. I don't \nknow the page of the new bill, but in the old bill it is section 2006, \npage 432, line 14. The ``Gator aid,'' which is the thing I was just \ntalking about, grandfathers Medicare Advantage patients to the tune of \nabout $25 to $30 billion from the cost of rather than from the effects \nof reducing their Medicare Advantage benefit. There are some other \nStates that get specific benefits as a result of Medicaid patients who \nare added to the rolls: Vermont, $600 million; Massachusetts, $500 \nmillion.\n\n  There are three targeted FMAP provisions: bonuses for Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and Nebraska. Vermont gets a 2.2-percent FMAP increase \nfor 6 years for their entire program. Massachusetts gets a half-a-\npercent increase for 3 years. Nebraska gets a 100-percent FMAP increase \nfor newly eligibles forever. That was this new particular deal.\n  Under the disproportionate payment section, Hawaii is alone among the \nStates that get an extension. Michigan and Connecticut get a special \nbenefit under section 508 so that their hospitals have an option to \nbenefit under that section if it means higher payments. This was also \ndone in previous legislation.\n  Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming get a special deal: \nan amendment that adds 1 percent to the hospital wage index for those \nStates. There are other States that would qualify but would not benefit \nbecause they are already above the 1-point wage index value. It also \nestablishes a 1.0-practice expense floor for physicians in those \nparticular States.\n  One of my colleagues got a benefit for his constituents in Libby, MT: \nMedicare coverage for individuals. The EPA has announced there is a \npublic health emergency at a Superfund site there, so they get a \nspecial advantage.\n  It is interesting that while the Nebraska ``Cornhusker kickback'' got \na lot of attention, two other benefits for Nebraska entities did not. \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska and Michigan Blue Cross Blue \nShield and also Mutual of Omaha get special benefits--so two in \nNebraska and one in Michigan. They get a carve-out. One of them gets a \ncarve-out from the insurance fee for Medigap policies and the other the \ninsurance fee paid to these two particular companies.\n  Connecticut hospital--Senator Dodd from Connecticut took credit for \ngetting $100 million for a hospital in his State.\n  I could go on and on.\n  The point is, the process by which the legislation has been put \ntogether, as well as its substance, is what has caused the American \npeople to have an extraordinarily low opinion of Congress. The latest \ntrick, this so-called\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nscheme to deem the legislation the Senate passed--passed without a \nvote; in other words, passing a law without ever voting on it--is just \nthe latest of the chicanery that appears to be engaged in, in the House \nof Representatives now, in order to get around the Senate bill, which, \nas the Speaker said, her Members do not like and do not want to vote \non.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial from this morning from one of my hometown \nnewspapers, the Arizona Republic, which discusses what they call the \nend run by Democrats as a travesty, and they discuss this so-called \nscheme to deem in the editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 18, 2010]\n\n                     End Run by Dems Is a Travesty\n\n       Last Sunday, The Arizona Republic published a brief \n     editorial chiding Democrats in the U.S. House for considering \n     an elusive, patently preposterous method for passing their \n     epic health-care legislation.\n       In point of fact, we did not believe at the time they were \n     serious. We saw desperation. A grasping at straws. A \n     passionate willingness to consider any means necessary, even \n     something like ``deeming''--a sleight of hand that in theory \n     might leave no fingerprints.\n       But we did not truly believe the Congress of the United \n     States ever would attempt to pass a measure reconfiguring an \n     entire sector of the American economy by obscure \n     parliamentary trickery. Without a real vote on the measure at \n     hand.\n       We thought they would come to their senses. They have not. \n     Aghast, astonished and still agog at the brass on display, we \n     can only say . . . this . . . is . . . not . . . right.\n       In one of the more memorable acknowledgements in this \n     historic fight over health-care reform, House Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi said Monday that ``nobody wanted to vote for the \n     Senate bill.'' That may be the case, but it does not justify \n     this end run.\n       The intent of the Democrats is to vote to pass a package of \n     amendments to the Senate legislation passed on Christmas Eve. \n     Once the amendments bill is passed, Pelosi intends to invoke \n     a ``self-executing rule'' to ``deem'' the legislation on \n     which the amendments is based--the Senate bill--passed, sans \n     vote.\n       Their mission is to throw a thick cloud of smoke over \n     events, thus giving (make that, attempting to give) reluctant \n     Democratic members of Congress plausible deniability \n     regarding their vote.\n       The Democrats' majority leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer, insists \n     the practice ``is consistent with the rules'' and is \n     ``consistent with former practice.'' It is neither, if by \n     rules and ``former practice'' one means abandoning a clear \n     Constitutional expectation that a bill should pass by vote of \n     both houses of Congress, especially a bill costing trillions \n     and impacting one-sixth of the nation's economy.\n       The tactic has been employed by both parties but never \n     regarding anything nearly this substantive. Indeed, \n     Democrats, including Pelosi, took Republicans to court in \n     2005 to oppose its use. They said it was unconstitutional. \n     They were outraged. Really.\n       Any vote in support of an abomination like this ``self-\n     executing rule'' should be viewed for what it is: an \n     abdication of responsibility regarding the most significant \n     social legislation in 70 years. It will not provide the cover \n     Pelosi thinks. We will see the fingerprints.\n       The positions of Arizona's congressional delegation \n     regarding support for the Senate health-care bill and the \n     deeming procedure, as of Thursday:\n       Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-District 1: Would vote in support \n     of the bill. Has not indicated whether she would support \n     deeming.\n       Rep. Trent Franks, R-District 2: Opposed to the bill and \n     deeming.\n       Rep. John Shadegg, R-District 3: Opposed to the bill and \n     deeming.\n       Rep. Ed Pastor, D-District 4: Officially uncommitted, but \n     support for the bill is considered likely. Position regarding \n     deeming unknown.\n       Rep. Harry Mitchell, D-District 5: Positions unknown. \n     Spokesman says it would be ``irresponsible to speculate on \n     hypothetical procedures, bills, votes.''\n       Rep. Jeff Flake, R-District 6: Opposed to the bill and \n     deeming.\n       Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-District 7: Officially uncommitted, \n     although many vote tallies consider Grijalva a likely \n     supporter of the bill. Position regarding deeming unknown.\n       Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-District 8: Has indicated \n     support for both the Senate bill and deeming.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, will the Senator from Arizona take a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, I will. I was about to get to the final point, which is \nthe matter on which my colleague from Tennessee is the expert, and that \nis the latest item to try to flavor the legislation to get more votes; \nnamely, to have the Federal Government take over student loans. But, \nyes, I will yield.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator, and I will sit down and listen to \nhis explanation on the other issue. But I heard the Senator mention the \nnews this morning, that the new bill--which we have not seen, and \nwhich, suddenly, of course, as is usually the case, we have to rush and \npass over the weekend before we read it--is going to save the \ngovernment money. I do not think very many Americans believe that.\n  But my question is this: I wonder if the Senator knows whether this \ncomprehensive health care bill--which is going to ``save'' the \ngovernment money; not run up the deficit--includes the amount of money \nit costs the government to pay doctors to serve Medicare patients. If \nit does not include that amount--which I believe I heard the \nRepresentative from Wisconsin say was $371 billion in the President's \nbudget over 10 years--would that not be like asking the Congressional \nBudget Office to tell you the cost of a horse farm without the horses? \nCan the Senator from Arizona imagine a comprehensive health care \nprogram that does not include the cost of paying doctors to serve \nMedicare patients? If it does not, does that not clearly mean that just \nthat one provision will guarantee that the bill will increase the \nFederal deficit?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, my colleague from Tennessee is exactly \ncorrect. Just that one item alone--of course it is part of Medicare; \nyou have to pay doctors to take care of you in Medicare--and if you do \nnot include the cost of that, then obviously you are not identifying \nthe true costs of the legislation, and just that item alone would be \nenough to knock it out of balance.\n  I did not even get into all the double counting and the other ways in \nwhich they try to game the system so it makes it look like you have \nsaved money, but you have not. One of our friends, Stephen Moore, I \nheard, had this analogy. He said: This is a great deal: Gee, you cover \nan additional 30 million people and you save money. Gee, at that rate, \nwe should cover everybody in China. We could really reduce the deficit.\n  Well, I think it makes the point. The American people have broken the \ncode here. We are not going to save money by adding more people to the \nrolls. That may be a good idea. It may be that we should subsidize \npeople, but let's acknowledge the true cost, and that gets back to the \namendment of our colleague from Alabama, the amendment that is pending \non the floor. He says we have to stop spending so much, so let's do \nsomething very modest. Let's put a cap using last year's budget. We are \nnot talking about cutting way back. We are not cutting into muscle or \nbone or anything like that; we are just saying: OK, if it was good \nenough for 2010, let's stop there. Let's have a little hold, let's have \na little pause here before we add a whole lot more money to the \ndeficit.\n  My State of Arizona has had to cut well over $1 billion out of its \nbudget. I think it is closer to $2 billion. They are cutting \nsignificant elements that the State has paid for in the past. The city \nrepresentatives were in seeing us yesterday and last week the county \nrepresentatives. They are all having to dramatically cut what they \nprovide in the way of government services.\n  But we in the Federal Government, we keep right on going as if there \nwere no problem at all. That is why the amendment that is pending--I \nguess we are going to vote on it in about an hour--the amendment by \nSenators McCaskill and Sessions is one we need to support and to vote \nagainst any other amendments that appear to try to provide savings but, \nin fact, do not.\n  I will close here because I see my colleague on the floor. The last \nthing I want to mention is the latest gimmick to get support for this \nhealth care legislation: adding something that has nothing to do with \nhealth. It is the Federal Government takeover of the student loan \nprogram. A lot of folks in the country have gotten student loans for \ntheir kids to go to college. It is a process that has worked. It is \nfederally guaranteed so banks are able to make those loans at a \nrelatively low rate of interest. It is a good deal for kids who want to \ngo to college.\n  Well, the Obama administration--which has taken over car companies, \ntaken over other insurance companies, now wants to take over health \ncare and has taken over, partially, banks--now\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\nwants to take over student loans. It has made them part of this \nlegislation. We do not know for sure exactly how because we have not \nseen the bill yet. But allegedly it is made a part of this legislation.\n  My colleague from Tennessee has been very good at pointing out that \nactually it is going to cost people more money because the government \ngets to borrow money at 2.8 percent interest, then it is going to loan \nit out at 6.8 percent interest, and then take the difference in the two \nand pay for additional government programs.\n  To me, though, one of the most pernicious things is that after July, \nyou are not going to be able to pick the lender that best fits your \nneeds or your kids' needs to go to college. You get to go to a Federal \nbureaucrat who is going to decide that for you. Instead of something \nlike 3,000 different places where you can go to get this, I think there \nare going to be four call centers. Good luck. If you think it is slow \ndown at the motor vehicle division or the Post Office, good luck trying \nto get a loan for your kid now to go to college.\n  As my colleague, Senator Alexander, wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       [Y]ou'll work longer to pay off your student loan to help \n     pay for someone else's education--and to help your U.S. \n     representative's reelection.\n\n  This is a bad idea. To try to fold this into the health care \nlegislation is a doubly bad idea. The bottom line is, our House \nDemocratic colleagues who are now being very strongly pressured to vote \nfor this health care legislation are not going to be able to fix any of \nthis. Because when the bill comes over to the Senate, and they \nsupposedly have put the fixes in it, the reality is that every one of \nthose things that is subject to a point of order will be stricken from \nthe bill on a point of order. Some things can be amended, of course. So \nthe House is going to have to deal with the bill at least one more time \nif, in fact, they pass it this weekend. The Senate is not going to bail \nthem out, as some of them apparently think may be the case.\n  So I throw that note of caution to my colleagues in the House who may \nbe thinking of supporting this bill on the grounds that the Senate is \ngoing to clean it up. In fact, that is not going to happen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Kyl, you have worked on this issue for \nmany years. You are one of the Senate's leaders, the assistant \nRepublican leader, and a leader in the Finance Committee. Isn't it true \nwe have known for some time that we are losing doctors who are \ndeclining to do Medicare work and that if we do not take action, they \nwill have a dramatic 20-plus percent cut in their pay? Every year we \nhave known that cannot happen, so we have found the money to put back \ninto it. One of the announced purposes for the President's health care \nreform was to fix this problem.\n  First, I understand from your conversation with Senator Alexander \nthat this problem has not been fixed in the bill at all. Then of \ncourse, when you figure out how much the bill costs, it does not \nreflect that we need, under the new estimates, $300 billion more. So if \nthey are claiming the bill is going to create a surplus of $130 \nbillion, you would have a $200 billion or so deficit on the doctor fix \nalone; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Madam President, my colleague is exactly correct, and \nthe math is correct as well. It is very disappointing to me because \nmost of the doctors with whom I have spoken are very afraid of this \nlegislation. They are afraid of what it will do in their practices in \nthe way they will be able to deal with their patients. They are also \nafraid because they can see this continued downward pressure on \nreimbursements they receive. Frankly, a lot of them are saying: We are \nnot going to be able to take Medicare patients in the future.\n  In my own State of Arizona, in fact, the Mayo Clinic has already \nannounced that at two or three of its facilities, it is not going to \ntake new Medicare patients. So that is one of the things that should be \nfixed in the health care bill. It is not fixed.\n  It disappoints me that even though the medical association has urged \nthey take out a very pernicious amendment that deals with specialty \nhospitals--basically, it cuts specialty hospitals off in the future; \nand the AMA has fought very hard to allow specialty hospitals to exist, \nbut that is not going to get fixed in this bill--even though they have \nsought to be excluded from the Medicare cuts that are in the Medicare \nCommission here--that is supposedly going to save $250 billion or so; \nthat has not been fixed--and even though they need to have the basic \nreimbursement section, the so-called SGR, fixed--and as my colleague \nhas just pointed out, it is not fixed in the legislation--what is \ndisappointing to me is--and those are three of the most critical \nelements of this bill because of the effect it will have on the \ntreatment of their patients--the American Medical Association is still \ntoying with the idea of supporting the legislation, when the vast \nmajority of physicians in the country, in my opinion, do not support \nthe legislation. Again, it is primarily because of the effect they \nthink it will have on their patients.\n  I would close by saying, all of these----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have one more question of the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. OK.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The way this new benefit is funded, as I understand it, \nis through a $500 billion cut to Medicare and increased Medicare taxes. \nWouldn't it be the correct thing for policymakers to take that money \nfirst and strengthen Medicare and pay the doctors whom we owe instead \nof starting an entirely new program, leaving the doctors unpaid, and \nraiding Medicare benefits?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will conclude by saying, absolutely yes. \nThis is one of the good ideas Republicans had. Rather than creating a \nnew entitlement, taking money from Medicare to fund that new \nentitlement, the savings we believe we can achieve in Medicare should \nbe applied to keeping Medicare solvent for another 17 years or whatever \namount of time this money could provide.\n  Then, if we are going to expend money, let's use it to pay the hard-\nworking physicians and all the other providers, the RNs, the folks in \nthe hospitals, and everybody else whom we want there to take care of us \nwhen we get sick. Let's make sure that money is available there and \nthat we have some kind of permanent resolution of this problem so we do \nnot have to come back and try to fix it every year.\n  Those are just some of the things we believe should be done rather \nthan to scrap the whole system we have, replace it with this new \ngovernment-operated behemoth that takes over this big section of our \neconomy, pushes government bureaucrats between patients and their \nphysicians and ends up providing enormous new taxes, without cutting \nthe premiums--in fact, allowing premiums to go up even more than they \nwould have otherwise. Other than that, it is a nifty idea. Of course, I \nam being facetious. The health care bill, in my opinion, is not a good \nidea.\n  My last point is simply to urge my colleagues in the House to \nappreciate the fact that the Senate is not going to bail them out by \ncleaning up the Senate bill, which we already passed here, and they \nshould not be voting for this legislation under the false assumption \nthat somehow we are going to make all those changes in the Senate bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN Of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks \non health care, Senator Tester be permitted to take the floor to talk \nabout health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I don't know where to start. I \nlistened to Senator Kyl, whom I really do like personally, and respect, \nbut I just hear so much. Of course, it is not just Senator Kyl; it is \nalmost all of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have \njust engaged in scare tactics.\n  First, they try to scare the middle class and scare people who have \nparents who are older by talking about\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\ndeath panels. Well, that didn't work because nobody believed that. Some \npeople believed it, but most rational people didn't believe it. Then \nthey try to scare people who have health insurance by saying it is \ngoing to be taken away. Then they try to scare senior citizens by \nsaying we are going to cut Medicare. Now--this is almost funny--they \nare trying to scare House Members. These poor, innocent House Members \nwho can't figure things out on their own, we need Senate Republicans to \ntell them all about these House rules and Senate rules and \nreconciliation. It is a little bit funny but, again, it is not very \nfunny because it is standing in the way of what we need to do for the \nAmerican people.\n  I am particularly amused--again, probably a wrong choice of words--\nwhen my Republican colleagues talk about cutting Medicare. Just look at \nthe history. They have built careers trying to destroy Medicare. I \nhaven't been around here since 1965 by a long shot, but I sure read \nabout 1965. The Presiding Officer knows this history. She has talked to \npeople in Charlotte and Winston-Salem. I have talked to people in \nDayton and in other areas of my State about it.\n  In 1965, Republicans used the same arguments. They thought that \nMedicare might be a government takeover. Then, the John Birch Society \nmade all of these claims about Medicare, as the tea party is doing \ntoday about this health care bill. It wasn't true. It didn't matter \nthat it wasn't true. They said government bureaucrats were going to get \nbetween you and your doctor. That is what they predicted with Medicare, \nand that is what they predict now. It didn't happen. In 1965, half of \nAmerica's seniors had no health insurance. Today, 1 percent of \nAmerica's seniors have no health insurance.\n  It didn't just end in 1965 when Republicans in large numbers and \nthese same insurance company interest groups--I might add, the \nRepublicans' most important benefactor is the insurance industry. That \nis why they are coming to the floor acting as if they are defending \nseniors, acting as if they are defending the middle class and the poor, \nand health care. They are defending the insurance companies. That is \nthe way they do it. Just as they defend the oil companies on energy \nlegislation, and just as they help and defend the drug companies; just \nas they defend the drug companies that send jobs overseas, that is why \nthey are against trade agreements. That is why they always support the \noil industry in climate change and everything else. That is why they \nsupport the drug companies and insurance companies. They are their \nbiggest benefactors. That is who helped them get elected, although \ndon't say that on the floor: I am against this bill because the \ninsurance company is against it. No, they try to scare the Medicare \nbeneficiaries. They try to scare the middle class and rural \nconstituents and urban constituents and suburban constituents. But it \njust doesn't wash.\n  Now they have brought in the student loan bill: We have to protect \nmiddle class, working class students so they can get student loans. No, \nthey want to protect the banks. This is about: Should we give direct \nloans to college students or should we let the banks skim off and leave \nsome of the money. Then they have the nerve to say the money we save in \nthis will be put back into the government bureaucracy. No, the money we \nsave by saying to the banks, no more skimming off student loans, no \nmore taking your cut, giving worse service at higher interest rates, \nthat money goes for Pell grants. So the money we take back from the \nbanks--the decade of George Bush subsidies for the banks--is, instead, \ngoing to students so they can afford to go to college.\n  Back to the health care issue itself. I hear my colleagues so \nliberally--if I could use that word to define them--quote Lowen & \nAssociates. Every time Lowen & Associates puts out a new study, they \ncome to the floor and they ponderously and seriously say: Lowen & \nAssociates says this bill--da, da, da.\n  Lowen & Associates is owned by United Health Care, which is one of \nthe biggest health insurance companies in the country. So quoting Lowen \n& Associates on health care is like quoting the oil companies on energy \nlegislation or climate change or quoting the drug companies or the \nMedicare giveaway to the drug companies bill. Just forget about Lowen & \nAssociates. If they want to comment on something that has nothing to do \nwith insurance, maybe they are reputable. They used to be reputable, \nbut then United Health Care got them. Sorry. That is just the way it \nis.\n  With all of this, let's stop the scare tactics. Let's take a deep \nbreath. Let's look at what this bill is about.\n  What this bill is really about is helping people who have lost their \ninsurance, who have had insurance and found out it wasn't much good \nbecause of what the insurance companies did to them, as Senator Tester \nknows. He has people in Billings and in Helena and in White Fish who, \nbecause of a preexisting condition, lost their insurance or they got \nsick and then their illness was so expensive the insurance company \nsaid: We don't want to insure them, we want to cut them off.\n  I wish to share a couple of letters, and then I will turn it over to \nSenator Tester because this is what it is all about. They can talk \nabout tax increases. They are wrong about it. They kind of make up some \nstuff. They can talk about budget-busting legislation. I am a little \ncurious about their saying that because the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which we kind of agree with--whether you are a moderate \nDemocrat such as Senator Carper or a conservative Republican such as \nSenator Kyl or a progressive Democrat such as the Presiding Officer, we \nall agree that the Congressional Budget Office is pretty much reliable. \nThey are not partisan. They don't cheat. They don't scam the system. \nThey don't lie to us. The Congressional Budget Office says this \nactually pays for itself and then some. It will help to retire the \nbudget in the first 10 years and do even better in the second 10 years.\n  With all of that debate, why does this matter? This matters because \nwe have constituents in Wilmington, in Chicago, and in Butte, as I do \nin Youngstown and Toledo, who thought they had good health insurance \nand then they get sick and then they find out they didn't.\n  I have read letters on this floor since July from people who, a year \nago, if you asked them, they would say: My health insurance is pretty \ngood. Then they found out it wasn't because they really needed it. This \ntells the story, to me, why this is important. Forget the political \nside. Forget the accusations. Forget the charges. Forget the \ncountercharges. Forget the philosophy. We need to help people and this \nbill does it.\n  Gwen is from Claremont County, a very conservative county. Her \ndaughter is a recent college graduate who has been denied insurance. \nShe writes:\n\n       My 22-year-old daughter is a recent college graduate. While \n     looking for a permanent job, she's working full time as a \n     waitress. Her employer will not give her health insurance, \n     and she can't stay on my policy because she is no longer in \n     college.\n       She takes no prescriptions and is one of the healthiest \n     young people you can find. One insurance company offered her \n     a policy for $750 a month.\n       I am a teacher and my husband has been unemployed for a \n     year, and even if he were working full time, we could not \n     afford $750 a month.\n       Our present insurance system decides who can have health \n     insurance at what price.\n       That's a moral and ethical decision no insurance company \n     should decide.\n\n  We know what this bill does. This bill says these pages sitting in \nfront of us--they are not yet in college. They come home, they can't \nfind a job with insurance, perhaps, when they are 23 years old--\nalthough they are all so young and bright they will, but most people \ncan't at this age. They are 23, 24. They come home from college. They \nhave no insurance. Our bill says: You can go on your parents' insurance \nplan until you are 26. That takes care of that problem. That is barely \ndebatable. That makes sense for Republicans and it makes sense for \nDemocrats.\n  The second letter is from Tammy from Preble County, another \nconservative rural county. This one is; the other one is a conservative \nsuburban county. This story is much more tragic. Tammy writes about her \nbest friend who died in January at the age of 31 from cervical cancer. \nShe was a nursing assistant, a single mother of five children. She \nworked her way out of low-income housing into her first home. When she \ncouldn't afford health insurance, she was able to roll her children \ninto Medicare. She writes:\n\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n\n       By the time my best friend could afford health insurance \n     and went to a doctor, it was too late. She learned she had \n     cervical cancer and that it was spreading throughout her \n     body.\n\n  A woman with breast cancer in this country without insurance is 40 \npercent more likely to die than a woman with breast cancer with \ninsurance. People say: Well, conservatives seriously don't want \ngovernment involvement--whatever that means, even though Medicare works \nfor millions. Conservatives say: Well, they can just go to the \nemergency room and get care.\n  If you have breast cancer, you don't go to the emergency room to get \ncare. They will only take care of you right before you die or right \nbefore you have an episode. If you are a chronic asthmatic or have \nchronic diabetes, they won't take care of you in the emergency room \nunless you have an insulin attack or unless you have a terrible \nsituation with your asthma or you can't breathe. They are not going to \nhelp you maintain your health so you don't end up in the emergency \nroom.\n  That is what this bill is all about. This bill will prevent \nsituations such as Tammy's friend. Pure and simple.\n  Thomas from Cincinnati is writing about his brother Jim who has been \nin hospice care after being diagnosed with lung and brain cancer less \nthan a year ago. He doesn't have much longer to live. He wanted his \nstory told, as Jim said, to anyone who would listen. He doesn't have \nhealth insurance and can't afford the cost of cancer treatment.\n\n       My dying brother is an example, and the countless stories \n     we hear from others are examples of why we need protection \n     from the insurance industry.\n\n  I have a lot of insurance companies in my State. I don't hate \ninsurance companies. I understand they are in a situation where to \ncompete with each other they have to have a business model. The \nbusiness model is--if Senator Carper and Senator Tester and I run an \ninsurance company, do you know what we all do? We hire a bunch of \nbureaucrats to keep people from buying insurance that might be \nexpensive. If you are sick, and you are sick, and you are not, well, I \ndon't want to insure you because you are sick. You are going to cost \ntoo much and affect my bottom line. Then they hire a bunch of \nbureaucrats on the other end for people who actually have insurance \npolicies and get sick to deny their claims.\n  So this is a business model where you don't insure people who are \nsick and you try to slough off people who get sick whom you insure, and \nthat is the way you make a lot of money. If you don't do that, you go \nout of business.\n  So I don't have any problems with insurance executives. They are paid \ntoo much, but I don't have any problems with what they do except their \nbusiness model forces them to do this. I think they should come to us \nand say: Senator Carper, Senator Tester, Senator Brown, thank you for \nbailing us out from doing bad things because you are going to set new \nrules so we can't do that anymore.\n  It is outrageous that we have a system--we are the only country in \nthe world that does this. A lot of countries have private insurance \ncompanies running their health care system, but they are private, not-\nfor-profit insurance companies. They are not Aetna and Cigna and all of \nthese companies that pay their executives an average of literally $11 \nmillion a year to the CEO. Why do we want a system where for-profit \ninsurance forces these companies to keep people from buying insurance \nif they are sick, keeps them out if they might get sick, and denies \nthem care if they do get sick. It doesn't serve the public interests, \nperiod. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I was wondering if the Senator from Ohio \nwould yield for just a few questions.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Yes.\n  Mr. TESTER. One of the previous speakers spoke about President Obama \ntaking over our health care system with government health care. In the \nSenate bill we passed and that the House is about to take up, is there \ngovernment health care in that bill?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, there is already Medicare, which \nseems to work for a lot of people, and Medicaid, which seems to work \nfor a lot of people. You have military bases in your State, as I do, \none of the greatest Air Force bases in the country, and they have \nsomething called TRICARE that works pretty darn good. This isn't a \ntakeover. This still allows lots and lots and lots of private \ninvolvement. But we have some government involvement in the health care \nsystem, I would say.\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. We have Medicare and the VA and TRICARE and \nthose kinds of things.\n  As far as government taking over the health care system, is there \nanything in the bill that would create anything different than we have \nnow?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Not that I see.\n  Mr. TESTER. How about health care costs overall in this country. Does \nthe Senator see those health care costs, if we do nothing, declining or \ngoing up?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. They keep talking about our bill. Health care \ncosts will go up. Health care costs are going to go up a lot faster. It \ndoubled in the last 7 years, and it will double again, if we do \nnothing, in the next 6 or 7 years. Who is going to pay for that?\n  Mr. TESTER. Exactly. How about insurance companies. If we do nothing, \nis there going to be accountability for health insurance companies in \nthis country?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. If you count accountability, still allowing them \nto cut people off for preexisting conditions, no. It allows them to \nkeep abusing the system the way they have.\n  Mr. TESTER. What happens to Medicare? If we do nothing, where is it \nheaded?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. It is more and more expensive. If you follow what \nsome of my colleagues want to do, they want to privatize it further.\n  Mr. TESTER. Isn't it a fair statement that doing nothing is not an \noption here?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. To me it is. Clearly, if we do nothing, small \nbusinesses are going to get creamed, taxpayers are going to get hurt \nand, most importantly, patients.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I rise today with some startling news from the State of Montana. I do \nnot think it is singular to the State of Montana. It is news that \ndrives home the need to get a handle on America's health care problem.\n  Being a Senator is a tough job, but it is not the toughest job I ever \nhad. The toughest job I had was serving on a school board back in Big \nSandy, MT. I also am a former teacher. So as a former school board \nmember and a former teacher, I appreciate the long, hard, often \nthankless hours teachers put in. To say they are not the highest paid \nprofession would be an understatement.\n  I was shocked when I heard about the bad news hitting teachers all \nacross Montana. This week, my staff and I spoke with folks such as the \nones in Elysian school district in Billings, MT. Employees there just \nreceived word that their health insurance rates are going up, and I \nmean way up. Normally, a big rate hike might be something like 10 \npercent or 20 percent. Sometimes we hear folks getting slammed for 30 \npercent or 40 percent. But the rates of the folks in Elysian are \nskyrocketing this year by 69 percent.\n  And you think that is bad. Talk with the folks in Hinsdale or Saco, \nMT. They just found out their rates are going up, too, by more than 70 \npercent. Then in the Nashua school district, rates are going up by 72 \npercent. The rate given to those employees who purchase family \ninsurance is going up by 83 percent.\n  Let me repeat that. Health insurance rates are going up by 83 percent \nin 1 year. For those in Congress who think nothing is the best option \nwhen it comes to health care, I have one question: How much more of \ntheir paychecks are Montanans supposed to fork over before Congress \nfinally reforms our broken health care system?\n  The folks I am talking about do not belong to any big nationwide \ncorporate insurance system. They are not paying for anyone's big \nmillion dollar salaries or lobbyists or advertisements. It is just the \ncost of health care going through the roof that is breaking these \nMontana families.\n  For those in Congress who say the American people do not want or need \nreform, let them talk with the folks I\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\nhave talked with, such as the teachers seeing these rate increases, \nsuch as the Montanans being forced to sell their family farms and \nranches because of medical bills, such as the Montana small business \nowners who cannot afford to insure their employees.\n  On Christmas Eve, I stood in this Chamber and cast a vote to keep \ngovernment out of health care, to cut the national deficit, to hold \ninsurance companies accountable, to strengthen Medicare, and to slow \nthe rise of health care costs. I am very proud of that vote.\n  This week, after months of listening, debating, and voting, Congress \nhas a chance to work together to get something done. If Congress does \nnothing, we know what will happen: Medicare will go bust. Costs will \ncontinue to break Montana families and this country, and no one will \nhold insurance companies accountable. And year after year, hard-working \nMontanans will continue to see more of their hard-earned paychecks \neaten up by health care costs.\n  I am not in the do-nothing camp, especially when hard-working Montana \nfamilies are trying to make ends meet with 83-percent rate hikes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we are in full mode on health care reform. \nI am going to stick to that subject this afternoon. I have heard my \ncolleagues say a couple of things I am going to emphasize, but I am \ngoing to have a different take on some of this as well.\n  It is not that I actually am writing down what some of my \nconstituents in Delaware have said to me about health care and concerns \nabout our legislation which may or may not pass, but among the things I \nheard is: We have the best health care system in the world; why mess \nwith it?\n  I heard: What we are going to do will be government run, it will be \ngovernment funded and the government doesn't do anything well.\n  I heard concerns about the size of our budget deficits and how this \nis going to add to those budget deficits and make them worse.\n  I heard folks who expressed concerns about whether we would be \nrobbing Medicare to provide health care to illegal aliens and other \nfolks and set up death panels.\n  I heard concerns about abortion on demand and using tax dollars to \npay for that.\n  I heard we are not going to do anything on medical malpractice \nreform, and we ought to do something.\n  I heard a lot about process, how we are going to use the process of \nreconciliation, the House might use a process called ``deeming'' in \norder to pass health care reform legislation.\n  Let me take these one at a time.\n  Do we have the best health care system in the world? Sadly, we do \nnot. Did we ever? I am not sure we ever did. We do not have the best \ntoday; we have the most expensive.\n\n  A couple weeks ago, I hosted exchange students from all over the \nworld, including Japan. We talked about a lot of issues. One of the \nissues we talked about was the health care system, what ours is like \nand what theirs is like. There were kids from Japan. In Japan, they \nspend about half of what we do as a percentage of GDP. They spend about \n8 percent of GDP for health care. We spend almost 16, 17 percent. They \nget better results. It is not even close. By any objective measure, \nthey get better results. They cover everybody. We have 40 million or 45 \nmillion people whom we do not cover. Think about that. They spend 8 \npercent of GDP, we spend twice that much; they get better results than \nwe do and they cover everybody. We have a lot of people who are not \ncovered.\n  My thinking in reflecting on that, the Japanese are smart people but \nthey cannot be that smart and we cannot be that dumb. We can do a lot \nbetter than we are doing.\n  Does it have to be government run or government funded? We actually \nhave a system in this country that is government run and government \nfunded, and it is called VA. I am a Navy veteran. The VA system is a \ngreat system. It is not inexpensive, but it is a great system for our \nveterans. The closest thing to a government-run system is VA.\n  Look around the world at other health care delivery systems. One that \nis government run and government funded, where the government pays for \nstuff and basically you show up and get care and are provided for by \ngovernment doctors and government nurses is Great Britain. We are not \ninterested in doing that here. We are not interested in making the rest \nof our health care delivery system look like the VA.\n  What we are trying to do is borrow from something that works, and \nthat is creating large purchasing pools, much like we have for Federal \nemployees, including us, but it is a large purchasing pool of about 8 \nmillion people. We only get to choose from for-profit health insurance \nproducts. A lot of companies want to sell their products to us. We have \nvery low administrative costs because when you have 8 million people in \na purchasing pool, you drive down the administrative costs.\n  The role of government I think is to row the boat, not steer the \nboat. I think those are the words of David Osborne--row the boat, not \nsteer the boat. The role of government is as Lincoln said. Lincoln said \nthe government should do for the people what they cannot do for \nthemselves.\n  What we propose to do in our legislation is to replicate what works, \nto take this idea of a large purchasing pool and say to every State: We \nwant you to create a large purchasing pool. We will call it an \nexchange. In the military, if you go to an exchange, you go on base to \nbuy something. We talk about an exchange where people go over the \nInternet to buy health insurance.\n  Who can do it? Small businesses, individuals, families, people with \ncoverage, without coverage. They will have a bunch of health insurance \nproducts from which to choose. It will not be government funded or \ngovernment run, but they will have a lot of choices. The idea there is \nto get the kind of competition in each of those State exchanges we \nenjoy as Federal employees under the Federal health benefits plan.\n  Some would say we ought to be able to sell or buy health insurance \nacross State lines. I am sympathetic to that argument. What we do in \nthat legislation--use Delaware as an example. Our neighboring States \ninclude Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Currently, we cannot \nbuy health insurance products that are sold in New Jersey, Maryland, or \nPennsylvania. But under this legislation, Delaware can enter into an \ninterstate compact with Maryland or New Jersey or Pennsylvania or all \nof the above. We would create a large purchasing pool, a regional \npurchasing pool with millions of people in it to help drive down \nadministrative costs, and the insurance sold in those four States could \nbe sold across State lines, increasing the number of options and \nincreasing consumer choice and competition that I think will benefit \nnot the insurance companies but consumers.\n  A side note here. The beauty of having a large purchasing pool, such \nas the one we are in, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, is \nthat our administrative costs are 3 percent of premium dollars. If we \nwere to go on the outside and try to buy for a family or small \nbusiness, we would not pay 3 percent administrative costs--maybe 33 \npercent but not 3 percent.\n  What we want to do is replicate what works. Large pools work, the \nability to sell across State lines works, the idea of having a lot of \noptions for consumers works. In fact, to take it one step further, \namong the health insurance plans that we can choose from as Members of \nCongress or Federal employees, Federal retirees, or dependents are \nmulti-State plans, almost like national health insurance plans. They \nwill be offered on the exchanges so people who are buying their health \ninsurance in my State, Illinois, Alabama, or any State in the future \nmay be able to choose from amongst the same plans that Members of \nCongress can choose.\n  Another concern that has been raised that has already been addressed \nby previous speakers--and I want to mention it again--is that we are \ngoing to further blow up the national debt. In the first 8 years in the \nlast decade, from 2001 to 2008, we literally ran up as much new debt as \nwe did in roughly the 208 years of our Nation's history. We are adding \nto that every day. It is an enormous concern to me, and I know it is to \nour Presiding Officer and to others.\n  As it turns out, the referee for us when we pass legislation, whether \nit is\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\ntax legislation or whether it is spending legislation, is the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is not Democratic or Republican. If I \nwant to cut taxes or raise taxes, if I want to cut spending or raise \nspending, I have to go to the Congressional Budget Office and ask them \nto tell us what the estimate is, what it will actually do to the \ndeficit going forward.\n  Whenever we have tried to offer different approaches on health care \nreform legislation, we had to go to the Congressional Budget Office and \nsay: What is going to be the impact on the budget and the deficits \ngoing forward? They have dutifully, for months now, been scoring the \ndifferent approaches.\n  The approach we have already voted on in the Senate for the most \npart--and in the House they will be taking up this weekend--the \nCongressional Budget Office has announced this morning that the \nlegislation, when you put it all together, does not increase budget \ndeficits. They are saying it lowers budget deficits I think in the next \n10 years by about almost $140 billion. It is a $140 billion deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years.\n  The real question, though, in my mind, is: What does it do for the 10 \nyears after that? For the 10 years after that, the CBO says the deficit \nwill be reduced over those 10 years by as much as $1.2 trillion. Think \nabout that. It is hard to estimate with any great accuracy what we are \ngoing to do over the next 20 years. I would much rather be looking at \nestimates that say deficits go down by $138 billion in the first 10 \nyears and deficits down by another $1.2 trillion in the next 10 years. \nI would rather be looking at the arrow going that way than the arrow \ngoing the other way.\n  Think about it, though. I think what CBO is telling us is that the \nbudget savings in what will be this final combined legislation will \nsave more money, reduce the deficit by more than either the House or \nSenate bill. This legislation will cover more people--95 percent of the \npeople in our country--than either the House or Senate bill. They also \nadd that it will make insurance more affordable for a lot of people and \nbetter quality health care, better coverage for a lot of people.\n  Another concern we have had is what we are going to do will somehow \nbadly damage Medicare. Medicare, as we know, is running out of money. \nIt is estimated to run out of money in about 7 or 8 years. I believe \nthis legislation will pretty much double the life of the Medicare trust \nfund; not forever, but it will double it. That is a pretty big step in \nthe right direction.\n  We need to do more, and we will be coming back to this later this \nyear when the Presidentially appointed and congressionally appointed \ndeficit panel comes back with a recommendation.\n  Some of my senior citizens said to me: I am concerned you will be \ntaking a lot of money out of the Medicare trust fund and reducing \nservices to us. What we are doing is we are trying to say to Medicare \nAdvantage Programs that are spending, in some cases, way more money \nthan I think can be substantiated or supported, that they are going to \nbe getting less money. And they do not like that. It is not for all \nMedicare Advantage programs but the ones that get the highest premium \ndollars and the most support from taxpayers that are going to get less \nmoney in the future.\n\n  Another concern about Medicare, though--one of my concerns--is that \nwe don't do a very good job of primary care in this country. A lot of \npeople never get a physical in their life. They never get an annual \nphysical.\n  I became a Navy midshipman at Ohio State when I was 17 years old. I \nthink almost every year of my life since then I have gotten a physical. \nI was in the Navy for about 27 years, so all those years and even now I \nget an annual physical. I know my colleagues do as well. We have a lot \nof people who never get a physical in their lives.\n  A few years ago, when we adopted the Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation, we said Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare recipients should \nget at least one physical in their lives. Now, under current law, when \nthey turn 65 and join Medicare and are eligible, they get one physical \nunder the Medicare Program. That is it. If they live another 40 years, \nthey do not get another physical provided for by Medicare. This \nlegislation we will pass, every year a person who is eligible for \nMedicare will be eligible for a physical. That is the kind of \npreventive care and prevention we need to do.\n  The Medicare prescription drug program, if you happen to be poor, is \na really good program. If you happen to use a whole lot of expensive \nmedicines, it is a pretty good program. If you happen to be somewhere \nin between, it is not such a good program because of the so-called \ndoughnut hole, where if a person's prescription drug costs exceed \n$2,500 a year, up to about $5,500 a year, Medicare doesn't pay for any \nof that. In the legislation that is before us, Medicare will \ndramatically increase its participation and support for prescription \ndrug costs for people who run in that area between $2,500 and $5,500 on \ntheir prescription drug costs. They call it filling the doughnut hole. \nAnd over time, I hope we will fill it completely, but this will at \nleast get us started in the right direction.\n  Another problem I hear about with regard to our health care system is \nthat doctors are doing what we used to call in the naval aviation \ntrying to protect their 6 o'clock or cover their 6 o'clock, which means \nprotecting themselves from lawsuits. They provide more tests, more \nvisits, more MRIs, more everything--more lab tests, you name it--in \norder to reduce the likelihood they will be sued. I don't blame them, \nbut it runs up the tab for health care. It is the cost of defensive \nmedicine, and we need to do something about that. We need to try to do \nanything in terms of figuring out what works to reduce the incidence of \nmedical malpractice, what works to reduce the incidence of defensive \nmedicine, and what works to improve outcomes. While we reduce lawsuits, \nreduce defensive medicine, how can we do that and improve outcomes?\n  There are some pretty good laboratories of democracy out there in the \nStates. As an old Governor, I like to look to the States to see what is \nworking.\n  Let's say the Presiding Officer is my doctor in Michigan. At the \nUniversity of Michigan, he performs a procedure I don't like. He \nbotches it, and the outcome is bad for me, and he knows he screwed up. \nIn Michigan, they provide an opportunity for the doctor and the patient \nto have a chance to meet in private. The doctor will apologize, he will \noffer a financial settlement to the patient, and the patient accepts \nit--either they can or they can't--and that has reduced by 50 percent \nthe incidence of medical malpractice lawsuits. Most of the offers are \naccepted, and most patients feel it is a pretty good thing. That \nconversation that takes place between the doctor and the patient can \nnever be used in a court of law against the doctor. And that works.\n  We have what are called certification panels in a number of States. \nThey are a little different from State to State. For example, ``Dr. \nBurris''--actually, Senator Burris--performs on ``patient Carper'', in \none approach, a procedure I don't like. I am unhappy with it, and I \nwant to sue him. Before I can go to court, I have to go to a \ncertification panel. Some have a right to say: You don't have a case. \nThat is it; you are out. Others can say: You can go forward, but if you \nlose, you pay the doctor's legal fees. Others say: Well, bring the case \nto the certification panel, and if they say you don't have a case, you \ncan still go forward. That is pretty much the approach in my State, and \nit has literally cut by 40 percent the number of medical malpractice \nlawsuits.\n  There are other ideas out there--health courts. We have bankruptcy \ncourts where the judges are lawyers. How about health courts where the \njudges are medical specialists. Another idea which I think has a lot of \nvirtue is what we are calling safe harbors. Again, a doctor is working \nwith a patient and does everything he or she should have done--or a \nnurse or hospital--given the symptoms and the medical history and all. \nEverything is done by the book; everything that should have been done \nis done. The idea is to provide the doctor a safe harbor from lawsuits, \nallowing that doctor at least a rebuttable presumption.\n  Those are all ideas that are working in different places around the \ncountry--maybe around the world but especially around the country. \nLet's figure out which of those will work best to reduce medical \nmalpractice lawsuits, reduce the incidence of defensive medicine, and \nimprove outcomes. And there\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nis money in the legislation before us to robustly demonstrate and test \nthose approaches and figure out which ones work best and try to \nreplicate those all over the country.\n  There is a last point or two I want to make. One of those is that if \nwe can accept that we really don't have the best medical system in the \nworld, that we actually do have the most expensive and we don't get the \nbest outcomes--we can get by that argument; if we can sort of get by \nthe argument that what we are trying to do is to set up a government-\nfunded, government-run system; if we can get by the idea that not only \nare we not exploding the deficits but that we will reduce them by $138 \nbillion, roughly, in the next 10 years and maybe another $1.2 trillion \nin the next 10 years after that; if we can get by the idea that we are \nnot stealing money out of the Medicare trust fund and paying for \nabortions and health care for illegal aliens; if we get by the \narguments that we are not doing anything on medical malpractice or \nreducing the incidence of defensive medicine, well, then, what are we \narguing about? Well, what we can argue about is process. We can argue \nabout process. And we are having a big argument about that today.\n  While I won't get into all the details of this process called \nreconciliation, it is basically used at the end of the budget process \nto reduce deficits. It pretty much focuses on deficits--either raising \nrevenues or reducing spending in order to reconcile the budget deficit \nand make it smaller.\n  It sometimes is used to pass major legislation. When the Republicans \nwere in the majority here, we used it to pass welfare reform \nlegislation and to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. When \nthe Republicans were in the majority, we used it to provide for major \ntax cuts adopted during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Those were \nall adopted during reconciliation. I think maybe 20, 22 times, since \n1980 or so, reconciliation has been used to pass significant \nlegislation, and 16 out of the 22 times were when our Republican \nfriends were in the majority--not Democrats but Republicans--and we \ndidn't hear criticism of using reconciliation as an approach during \nthose times.\n  Let me say that I objected when the idea was first raised about using \nreconciliation to pass comprehensive health care. I have been vocal \nabout that. I didn't like that. It is the wrong thing to do. We end up \nwith legislative Swiss cheese because through the reconciliation \nprocess it is hard to legislate prevention, primary care, insurance \nreform, and those sorts of things. That process doesn't lend itself to \nhealth care reform legislation. So we have proceeded along regular \norder here and passed health care legislation, unfortunately on a \npartisan basis--60 to 40--at Christmastime last year.\n  I must say that one of my great regrets here is that we didn't pass a \nbipartisan bill. We would have had a better bill if we had a bipartisan \nbill. But it is what it is.\n  Over in the House, they are trying to determine whether to deem the \nlegislation as passed, through some kind of process in the Rules \nCommittee. But where did they get that idea? Well, they got the idea \nfrom when the Republicans were in majority in the previous Congresses. \nIt worked a number of times for them, so maybe the House Democrats will \nuse it as well. There is an old saying that imitation is the most \nsincere form of flattery. In this case, for better or worse, I think we \nare seeing the Democrats trying to emulate what our Republican \ncolleagues have done in past Congresses.\n  One last point on focusing on what works. I took a day and went to \nOhio State. I spent some wonderful years of my life in Ohio. I went to \nCleveland a time or two, but I went back to Cleveland last year to the \nCleveland Clinic.\n  I had been hearing a lot about Cleveland's clinic and the Mayo Clinic \nand Geisinger Health Care from Pennsylvania and how Kaiser Permanente \nin California and Intermountain in Utah and these big health care \ndelivery systems are able to deliver better health care and better \noutcomes for less money. I was intrigued by that, so I went to the \nCleveland Clinic to spend a day with them. I found out that the health \ncare delivery systems in Cleveland and at the Mayo Clinic and Geisinger \nand Intermountain are all pretty similar. They have a number of things \nin common. First of all, their doctors and nurses are all on salary. \nThey are not out there as free agents, they are all on salary--for \nexample, at the Cleveland Clinic. Second, they focus on primary care. \nThird, they focus on prevention. They focus on wellness. All the \npatients have electronic health records. They coordinate their care. \nThey focus on diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart, pulmonary, and \nthey treat them in a holistic way. They coordinate their care and the \ndelivery in those places, and they get a better result for less money.\n  They have been able to go to high-cost areas--for instance, Mayo went \ndown to Florida to provide health care down there in a high-cost area, \nand they replicated what they do in Minnesota.\n  Part of what we try to do in this legislation is to incentivize other \nhealth care delivery systems in the country--other than the ones I have \nmentioned--to learn from what works to lower health care costs and \nprovide better outcomes in Minnesota through Mayo, at Geisinger in \nPennsylvania, and so forth.\n  Let me close with this, if I can. I was invited to attend the \nDelaware annual agricultural dinner about a month ago in Dover. It is \nan annual event. Probably those kinds of things happen in Illinois, in \nNorth Dakota--I know they have them in North Dakota--and in Alabama as \nwell. People had already gone through the buffet line by the time I \narrived--I was a little late--but as I went through the line to get my \nfood, a guy came up to me and said: Don't vote for any health care. \nDon't vote for any health care. I said: Why? And he mentioned some of \nthe arguments I have raised here before.\n  So I thought about that as I sat down and was eating my dinner, and \nwhen I was announced and got up to speak to the audience that night, I \nsaid: I know some of you aren't in favor of our doing anything on \nhealth care because you have heard the argument that it is going to \nblow up the deficit or you have heard about death panels and you name \nit--all this stuff. Let me just ask you this. You raise food. You are \nfarmers. You feed us, and you are pretty good at it, too, because too \nmany people in this country are overweight. I said: Let me change this \nfrom talking about health care to talking about food. Let's put it in a \nfood context. What if we lived in a country where we paid twice as much \nfor food as every other nation--twice as much. What if we lived in a \ncountry where the food was not as good--in fact, it was so bad it was \nunhealthy for us. What if we lived in a country where 40 million people \nwent to bed every night hungry. What if we lived in a country where \ntens of thousands of people died every year because of starvation. What \nif we lived in a country where our goods and services--the products we \nare selling in marketplaces in the world--cost way more money, our cars \ncost $15,000 or $20,000 more than cars they build in Japan because of \nthe cost of food in our country. What if the rest of us paid more money \nfor our food--maybe a thousand more for our food per year--to provide \nfood for other people who didn't have anything to eat. That is pretty \nmuch the situation we are in in this country, but not with respect to \nfood, with respect to health care.\n  We can do better than this. The legislation we passed, that is before \nthe Congress--before the Senate and the House--if we pass it, will not \nbe perfect, but it is sure going to be better than our living in a \nnation where we pay twice as much for health care as any other advanced \nnation, where they get better results and they cover just about \neverybody and we don't. They can't be that smart and we can't be that \ndumb. Hopefully, not just with this legislation but with what may flow \nfrom it, we will improve on it in years to come, and we will show just \nhow smart we have become.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. May I ask the Senator from Alabama a question. How much \ntime does he intend to use?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent that \nimmediately after the Senator from Alabama speaks, I be recognized for \n5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was pleased to listen to the remarks \nby my good friend and most respected Member of the Senate, Senator \nCarper, about his analysis of the health care reform bill that is \nbefore us. I would say I disagree on a number of areas.\n  First, I disagree that we do not have the best medical care in the \nworld. Yes, we have people who are overweight. We have a higher \nhomicide rate. We have other problems that affect health. But if you \nare treated, you get the best health care all over. Even in rural areas \nof Alabama you get well-trained physicians and nurses who can give you \nfirst-rate care. I reject that. But I do agree we pay too much. I hoped \nthat would have been a basis for our bipartisan agreement as to how we \ncan execute some changes that would help bring down the cost and create \na more effective health care system. I certainly think we should go in \nthat direction.\n  I do think it is important that the American people believe the \nprocess is legitimate. The President said--I suppose in his interview \nyesterday; I saw it this morning--basically: I don't care what the \nprocess is. Just do it, House. You can deem a piece of legislation that \nis not a part of the bill, and just make it law by deeming it without \nactually putting it up for a vote or amendment or a process. That is \nhistoric. They say it has been done before.\n  I am hearing from my constituents: I do not care what you have been \ndoing before. We expect you guys to honestly bring up legislation, \nhonestly vote on it, and not sneak it through in the dead of night \nwithout people having a chance to read it, without fully knowing what \nit means.\n  That is a legitimate request and demand from the American people that \nI am hearing. I think it is true all over the country. Even in \nMassachusetts, Senator Brown said: This bill is no good, and I am \nrunning against it. If you elect me as the Senator from Massachusetts, \nI am going to vote no. He was elected by a big margin in a stunning \ndevelopment. The American people are unhappy about this.\n  What I wanted to take a minute to talk about, and this is very \nimportant, the Speaker today, just a few hours ago, reiterated that \nthis legislation would create a surplus. If it is going to ensure 30 \nmillion more Americans, if it is going to close the doughnut hole and \nis going to do all these things, how can that be? The American people \nare dubious at best about that claim. But they say the CBO says so.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Delaware, that is not what \nCBO said. They have misrepresented the CBO's statement in one of the \nmore dramatic flimflameries in history, I submit. I wrote the CBO. \nRight before I voted on December 24 I got a letter back that explained \nthe details of how it could appear to be one thing when it is really \nanother. I want to point that out right now.\n  This was a subsequent letter from them on January 22 of this year \nwhen asked about how to analyze the cost of this bill. I am quoting \nfrom a letter to me, Jeff Sessions, from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, January 22, Doug Elmendorf, the Director--basically hired by \nthe Democratic majority in Congress. He says:\n\n       Thus, the act's effects on the rest of the budget--other \n     than the cash flows from the HI trust fund, the Medicare \n     trust fund--would amount to a net increase in the federal \n     deficits of $226 billion over the same period.\n\n  A net increase in the deficit.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Thus, the resources to redeem government bonds in the HI \n     trust fund and thereby pay for Medicare benefits in some \n     future year will have to be generated from taxes or other \n     government income, or government borrowing in that year.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Unified budget accounting shows that the majority of the HI \n     [Medicare] trust fund savings under the PPACA--\n\n  That is this health care reform bill--\n\n     would be used to pay for other spending and therefore would \n     not enhance the ability of the government to pay for future \n     Medicare benefits.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Therefore, enacting the PPACA--\n\n  The health care reform bill--\n\n     would increase debt held by government accounts more than it \n     would decrease debt held by the public and would thus \n     increase gross federal debt.\n\n  Here we have the Speaker of the House taking the floor again, \nrepeating what the President and other colleagues are saying, that \nsomehow this is creating a surplus. It is not. Let me tell you why and \nhow they do it. Hopefully, I can take just a minute to do that.\n  Right before I voted in the Senate on December 21, President Obama \nsaid:\n\n       And Medicare will be stronger and its solvency extended by \n     nearly a decade.\n\n  Same statement, he says:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office now reports that this bill \n     will reduce our deficit by $132 billion over the first \n     decade.\n\n  That is basically the number they were using this morning; basically \nthe number that has been referred to on the floor earlier today. This \nis how it is done and why that is a total misrepresentation of the \nultimate significance of what we are doing. This chart does it.\n  What happens? With regard to the Medicare account, we are increasing \nMedicare taxes. That brings more money into Medicare. If this passes, \neverybody--upper income Medicare payers--will pay more money. So it is \ngoing to increase taxes.\n  Second, there has been a substantial reduction in Medicare benefits \npaid from this account. So, therefore, it creates a saving, right? You \nincrease taxes into Medicare, you cut Medicare expenses, Medicare looks \nto be in better shape. That is true if we use the money to maintain \nMedicare, if we use the money paid in by seniors all over this country \nso when they retire they can have Medicare, and if we use that money to \nstrengthen Medicare. But we are not using it to strengthen Medicare.\n  What are we doing with it? We are shipping it over to the Treasury so \nthe Congress can spend it on a new health care bill. Obviously, we have \na problem there.\n  How do we get money out? You heard people refer to the Medicare trust \nfund--and there really is one--and a Social Security trust fund--and \nthere is one. There are bonds out there that Social Security holds in \nWest Virginia. The surplus in Medicare is given to the Treasury. But \nsomething else is not mentioned because it is an internal debt, an IOU \nto Medicare, a bond back to Medicare. The U.S. Treasury owes Medicare \nfor the money they borrowed, and Medicare is heading into default.\n  So what is going to happen? They are going to call the notes, they \nare going to call the IOUs, and take this money back.\n  What is going to happen to the U.S. Treasury when that happens?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to have 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent the other Senator \ngets 5 minutes, and we will move at 2 o'clock to a vote, so----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am entitled to ask the Presiding Officer for it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am required to object. By a unanimous consent \npreviously ordered, we have a 2 o'clock vote, and the Senator from New \nYork has asked for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As a result of the conventions of accounting, it may \nappear this money can be spent twice, as Mr. Elmendorf said is \nhappening. But the truth is, we cannot spend the money twice. It is \nincreasing the debt, and there is no doubt about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to start by saying how much \nI admire the family members of the victims of Colgan Air Flight 3407. \nThey are an amazing group of people. They have advocated tirelessly for \na year, making numerous trips to Capitol Hill, all in honor of the \nbeloved loved ones who tragically lost their lives on a Buffalo-bound \nflight from Newark airport.\n  They have done this with intelligence, with focus, and, given their \noverwhelming grief--at least as far as I witnessed--no anger, which was \namazing to me. I am sure when they go home at night there is a hole in \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nhearts, and it would be quite human for many of them to be angry, but \nthey have channeled all of that into an amazingly well-focused attempt \nthat now is on the edge of success: to make our commuter flights safer.\n  We all remember the night over a year ago now when flight 3407 \ncrashed in Clarence, NY, and claimed 50 lives. It is a tragic reminder \nthat our Nation's aviation industry is not immune to tragic accidents. \nLast month the NTSB issued its final conclusion on the cause of the \nflight failure. The conclusion, though not surprising, based on the \nreports we have heard for almost a year now, is still heartbreaking.\n  The NTSB determined the probable cause of the accident was ``the \ncaptain's inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, \nwhich led to an aerodynamic stall from which the plane did not \nrecover.''\n  That is a heart-wrenching conclusion to hear because it means the \naccident was entirely avoidable.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee has included numerous important \nprovisions, safety provisions, in the FAA bill. I am especially \ngrateful to all the members of the committee, particularly the chair, \nSenator Rockefeller, and the subcommittee chair, Senator Dorgan, for \nhelping us obtain an amendment that I authored that will require all \nflight crewmembers to have more flying experience before they can be \nhired by an airline such as Colgan Air. The copilot can currently be \nhired by a regional carrier with as little as 250 flight hours. That is \nunacceptable.\n  The amendment will require the FAA to require that copilots have at \nleast 800 hours of flying experience, and that experience will have to \nbe performed in adverse flying conditions like those that flight 3407 \nmet over a year ago on a cold, icy night outside of Buffalo.\n  Senator Dorgan, as I mentioned, was instrumental in helping to make \nthe safety goals of flight 3407 family members a reality. I thank him \nand Senator Rockefeller and their staffs for their hard work and \nleadership, not only on the crewmembers' experience but on the FAA bill \nas a whole. I would also like to thank all the cosponsors of the \noriginal bill for their support--Senators Gillibrand, Lieberman, Leahy, \nCasey, Collins, Snowe, Kerry, Wyden, Scott Brown, Risch, Burris, and \nMerkley.\n  We firmly believe everyone flying a plane, both pilot and copilot, \nshould have proper training and experience to handle adverse flying \nconditions.\n  NTSB concluded that the pilot and copilot's poor training was evident \nfrom the start of the flight when they incorrectly entered airspeeds in \nthe aircraft's computer system. When the Q400 airspeed dipped to a \ndangerously low level, their reactions were of shock and confusion, not \nof problem solving. When the stick-pusher activated so the pilot could \ncoax the aircraft out of a stall, he pulled back instead of pushing \nforward. His copilot did not recognize or correct any of his mistakes.\n  It is unacceptable that a passenger on a regional carrier should fly \nin less capable hands than a passenger on a larger commercial carrier, \nwhere hiring standards are considerably higher. That is why passage of \nthe FAA bill is of utmost importance in the Senate. We need to bring \nall commercial air travel to the same level of safety.\n  I have said this before. It bears repeating. The families of flight \n3407's victims have been almost saintly, and I do not say it lightly. \nThey have taken this tragedy and turned it into this moment, a moment \nwhere we are on the verge of making critical reforms in airline safety \nthat are long overdue.\n  If we pass this bill, we will make changes in airline safety that \nwill impact the country for decades to come. The journey that these \nfamilies have traveled has been too long and too hard to stop now.\n  In conclusion, I can never say enough about how humbled I am by the \nwork of all flight 3407 family members. It is a tribute to their loved \nones' lives that they continue to come to Washington to advocate for \naviation safety, and I am honored to help in their cause.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the body will consider two amendments \ntoday that propose to limit some discretionary spending. Regrettably, \nboth amendments contain significant flaws, and I will oppose both of \nthem for that reason.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and \nthe Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, propose to limit some \ndiscretionary spending over the next 5 fiscal years. However, those \nlimits include a giant loophole, as the proposal includes a complete \nexemption for spending on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The proposal \nin no way requires that such funding be offset, or be subject to the \nusual supermajority thresholds that the Senate imposes on spending \nbeyond that for which the body budgets. Under the amendment, spending \non those wars is completely unrestrained, and would be added right onto \nthe government's budget deficits.\n  This is not a small matter. To date, spending for those wars has \ntotaled roughly $1 trillion and not one cent has been paid for. The \ncost of those wars has been added directly to our budget deficits, \nswelling our already mountainous public debt, and increasing the burden \nwe are leaving our children and grandchildren to bear. The question of \nwhether these wars are in the best interest of our national security \nis, of course, a primary concern. Having made the decision to pursue \nthat course, though, we should not just shove the cost off on future \ngenerations. But that is just what this amendment would do.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, and \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, also limits discretionary spending, \nbut it, too, carves out a loophole for the spending on these wars. \nWhile it doesn't provide the unlimited exception included in the \nSessions-McCaskill proposal, it still permits another $150 billion to \nbe spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars over the next 3 years without \nhaving to be offset.\n  Beyond the matter of pushing the cost of these wars on to our \nchildren and grandchildren, the war-spending exceptions included in \nthese two amendments invite continued budget gaming that has been a \nbyproduct of the supplemental spending requests submitted on behalf of \nwar spending. Those supplemental bills have been used as a way to boost \ndefense spending unrelated to the wars, circumventing the budget caps \nCongress has set as part of annual budget resolutions. Both of these \namendments risk inducing more of the same.\n  I support establishing discretionary spending limits in law, and have \ndone so in the past. But we should do so in a way that does not provide \na massive escape hatch for hundreds of billions in discretionary \nspending.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has made a good-\nfaith effort to address many of flaws in the Sessions amendment.\n  First, this amendment would require savings from discretionary \nspending, mandatory taxes and revenues.\n  Second, it wisely eliminates the requirement for a two-thirds \nmajority to increase spending, leaving in place the supermajority 60-\nvote requirement already included in the budget act.\n  And, it reduces the amount of discretionary savings from the Obama \nrequest by more than half--to $77 billion over 3 years.\n  While it is a far better alternative to the Sessions amendment, I \nmust still oppose it.\n  The matter for determining how much deficit reduction the country \nneeds over the next three years should be left up to either the Budget \nCommittee or the Deficit Reduction Commission. It should not be \ndetermined by an amendment on the Senate floor.\n  In addition, the burden of taking half the total cut from \ndiscretionary spending is too great when the real deficit problem has \nbeen caused by runaway mandatory spending and tax cuts for the rich.\n  The 3-year cuts of $77 billion in discretionary spending would still \nbe crippling to the Obama budget plan.\n  The Senate should debate this matter on the budget resolution which \nthe Senate is expected to consider next month, instead of on the FAA \nReauthorization Act that is before us today.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator's efforts to achieve a more \nbalanced amendment, but I regrettably must still oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment from the Senator from Alabama seeks to \nconstrain discretionary spending at the levels agreed to in last year's \nbudget resolution. He says his intent is to cap spending for the next 3 \nyears. Now we all understand that discretionary\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nspending is likely to be frozen this year as the President has \nproposed, but this proposal goes way beyond what the President has \nrecommended.\n  The President has proposed a modified spending freeze which caps \nnonsecurity related spending.\n  The President allows growth in homeland security; this amendment does \nnot assume growth.\n  The President has requested more than $732 billion in his budget for \nNational Defense for fiscal year 2011 including the cost of war. This \namendment only allocates $614 billion.\n  Specifically, this amendment only allows $50 billion for the cost of \noverseas deployments. As such it fails to fully cover the cost of the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq as estimated by DOD for fiscal year 2011 \nby $109 billion.\n  While the proponents of this amendment note that it waives the $50 \nbillion war allowance if we are at war, why does the amendment not \nsupport the full request? Some could interpret the provision to mean if \nwe want to support our men and women deployed overseas we would need to \nget 60 votes. Does the Senate really want national defense to be \nhostage to a 60-vote threshold?\n  This is not the same as President Obama's plan. Over the 3 years in \nthe Sessions amendment, the caps he would put into place are $141 \nbillion below President Obama's 3-year plan--$50 billion below Defense, \nnot including the cost of war, and $91 billion below nondefense \nspending.\n  If we adopt the Sessions caps we will have to gut the President's \nagenda for discretionary spending--education, green jobs, and homeland \nsecurity.\n  The critical flaw in this amendment is it fails to do anything \nserious about deficits. It fails to address the two principal reasons \nwhy our fiscal house is out of balance.\n  It is a fact that the growth in the debt has resulted primarily from \nunchecked mandatory spending and massive tax cuts for the rich. This \namendment fails to respond to either of those two problems. In short, \nthis amendment is shooting at the wrong target.\n  Moreover, this amendment also wants to raise the threshold on \ndiscretionary spending increases to 67-vote approval allowing one-third \nof the Senate to dictate to the majority.\n  We already have a threshold of 60 votes required to increase \ndiscretionary spending above the budget resolution. I for one cannot \nbelieve the Senate wants to let a mere one third of the Senate dictate \nto the other two thirds whether there is a bona fide need for increased \nspending.\n  This is the wrong direction for this institution. Mandatory spending \nhas increased substantially the last few years. Tax cuts for the rich \nhave constrained revenues, but neither tax cuts nor mandatory spending \nincreases would be subject to 67 votes.\n  The Senator from Alabama says this approach worked to help balance \nthe budget in the 1990s. Well, that is only partially correct and it is \ncritical that my colleagues understand the difference.\n  In the 1990s our budget summits produced an agreement to cap \ndiscretionary spending, but they also decreased mandatory spending and \nthey increased revenues at the same time.\n  It was only by getting an agreement on all three areas of the budget \nat the same time that we were able to achieve a balanced budget.\n  Now let's be clear, many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are happy to put a cap on discretionary spending, but they don't \nwant to put policies in place to make sure we have enough revenues to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Any honest budget analyst can tell you we will never achieve a \nbalanced budget just by freezing discretionary spending. We could \neliminate all discretionary spending increases for defense, other \nsecurity spending, and nondefense and still not balance the budget.\n  Moreover, if we cut discretionary spending without reaching an \nagreement on mandatory spending and taxes we will find it very hard to \nget those who do not want to address revenues to compromise.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the administration has just \nannounced that it will create a Deficit Reduction Commission to help us \nget our financial house in order. It will look at both revenue and \nspending and find the right balance to restore fiscal discipline.\n  They will make their recommendations to the Congress and the majority \nleader has committed that the recommendations of that Commission will \nbe brought to the Senate for a vote.\n  Rather than rushing to address only one small portion of the issue, \nthe Senate should await the judgment of the Deficit Reduction \nCommission which will cover all aspects of the problem.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I agree that everyone \nshould tighten their belts. The problem with this amendment is that all \nthe tightening will be done on a small portion of spending, while \nrevenues and mandatory spending will still be unchecked.\n  The Senate has already rejected this flawed plan twice in the last 2 \nmonths. This amendment hasn't gotten any better in the intervening \nperiod. It still is shooting at the wrong target. It still fails to \naddress the real causes of our deficits and national debt. It is far \nless that the President has requested. I urge my colleagues once again \nto vote no.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3453\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the Sessions-McCaskill amendment \nNo. 3453.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there are those in this body who will \nsay vote for the side-by-side because it does more.\n  It does not. It is cover. It is very weak; 50 votes to waive. \nEverybody would love to go after mandatory spending. We do not have the \nwill to go after discretionary spending. It is a joke if anybody thinks \nthis body is ready to take on mandatory spending.\n  This is a very baby step to control growth by 1 percent beginning \nnext year for 3 years. When you look at what State governments are \ndoing and local governments are doing and what America's households are \ndoing, and we cannot control growth of 1 percent for 3 years? We are \ncutting nothing. We are cutting nothing. Everyone in the country is \ncutting but here, where we print money.\n  This is a reasonable approach. If we cannot take this baby step, then \nwe have got to admit to the American people we do not get what they are \ngoing through; we are completely out of touch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senate has already rejected this \nflawed plan twice in the last 2 months, and this amendment has not \ngotten any better in the intervening time.\n  If we adopt the Sessions caps, we will have to gut the President's \nagenda for discretionary spending, including education, jobs, and \nhomeland security. This amendment still fails to address the real \ncauses of our deficit and national debt. It is far less than the \nPresident has requested. I urge my colleagues to once again vote no.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr.\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\nByrd), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3548\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the Pryor amendment No. 3548.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to look at my \namendment. It reduces discretionary spending caps by $77 billion \nrelative to President Obama's budget in 2011, 2012, and 2013. It also \nrequires the fiscal commission to find an additional $77 billion to \nreduce the deficit. It moves the vote from 67 back to 60, as it is \nunder our normal Senate rules. It also increases the chances of a \nbipartisan agreement on deficit reduction. We need that around here. We \nneed a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction. This reduction could \npotentially add $13 billion more in deficit reduction than what the \nSessions-McCaskill amendment does.\n  As much as I respect and appreciate all the work Senators Sessions \nand McCaskill did, I certainly would appreciate people voting for the \nPryor amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we were within one vote of bipartisan \nlegislation to help constrain the growth in spending and allow for \ngrowth but not quite as much. But Senator Pryor's amendment is \nabsolutely the wrong thing. It is a budget-busting amendment. It allows \nthe Congress or the appropriating committees to spend $62 billion more \nthan the present budget allows. It busts the budget. Second, it \ninstructs the deficit commission to propose tax increases and \nentitlement cuts to fund increases in discretionary spending. That is \nnot what the commission is supposed to be about. It is to try to get \nour entitlements back on sound footing, not to create money to spend on \na new program.\n  I urge colleagues to vote no. It is not the right thing to do.\n  I make a budget point of order that the pending amendment contains \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment under section \n306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable \nbudget resolutions, and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 27, the nays are \n70. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed for a few moments on \nmy leader time.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Democratic leaders in the House say \nthey are giddy because of CBO's latest estimate of their $1 trillion \nhealth care spending bill. That is what you call trying to get out in \nfront of the news. Because if you look at the details, if you look \nunder the hood, you will see this latest bill is even more painful than \nthe Senate bill that Democrats over in the House are afraid to take a \nvote on.\n  Democratic leaders are bragging about this bill's impact on the \ndeficit. They say it reduces the deficit by $130 billion over 10 years. \nThe more important question is: How do they get there? They get there \nwith even higher taxes and even deeper Medicare cuts than the first \nSenate bill. Let me say that again. This second bill that is coming \nalong has even deeper Medicare cuts and even higher taxes than the \nfirst Senate bill that over in the House they don't seem to want to \nhave a recorded vote on.\n  Let's start with the Medicare cuts. The Senate bill Speaker Pelosi \nsaid Democrats are so afraid to take a vote on originally cut Medicare \nby $465 billion. That is the original Senate-passed bill that passed on \nChristmas Eve. The latest bill increases those cuts by $60 billion \nmore.\n  How about taxes? The Senate bill the Democrats over in the House are \nso afraid to take a vote on raises taxes by $494 billion--$494 billion. \nThe second bill coming along increases taxes by at least $150 billion \non top--on top--of the $494 billion original tax increase.\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\n  So if you were worried about raising taxes in the middle of a \nrecession, this bill raises taxes even more. If you were worried about \ncutting Medicare for seniors, this bill cuts it even more.\n  So here is how Washington works. Democrats want to spend trillions of \ndollars on this bill in order to save $130 billion 1 week after voting \nto add nearly that much to the deficit in a single vote. If Democrats \nare giddy about this CBO score, then they must get a kick out of higher \ntaxes and Medicare cuts because that is what this bill will mean--even \nhigher taxes and deeper Medicare cuts than the original Senate bill.\n  If wavering Democrats needed any more evidence that this bill is \nactually worse than the Senate bill, they got it from the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee just this afternoon. If our Democratic friends in \nthe House were counting on the Senate to fix the original Senate bill \nthey don't want to vote for because it is so bad, I wouldn't count on \nthe Senate. The Budget Committee chairman over here is already warning \nthat if that reconciliation bill comes over to the Senate, it will have \nto go back to the House once again for changes. So don't count on us to \nfix this bill for you, I would say to my Democratic friends in the \nHouse. Don't count on us.\n  Republicans have been saying for nearly a year now that this bill is \nunsalvageable. The latest CBO score proves our point.\n  I would suggest the President not scrap his trip to Indonesia. He \nshould scrap this bill and start over on a bill that Americans can \nembrace and that lawmakers from both parties will actually be proud to \nvote for.\n  Taking a bill that House Democrats are too embarrassed to vote for, \nadding more than $150 billion in new taxes and slashing $60 billion \nmore from our seniors' Medicare and keeping sweetheart deals may make \nsome Washington Democrats giddy, but that is not reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the regular order is amendment No. 3475?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order.\n  The Senator has the right to call the regular order.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3549 to Amendment No. 3475\n\n       (Purpose: To reduce the deficit by establishing \n     discretionary spending caps for non-security spending)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment No. \n3459 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3549 to amendment No. 3475.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, March 17, \n2010.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is a fairly simple bill. I have \nspoken on the floor several times about this bill. As I made very clear \nbefore, and there is no sense debating it now, I have been opposed to \nsome of the moratoria we have been talking about on earmarks because, \nNo. 1, they don't save any more if you kill an earmark and, No. 2, it \nis something I have serious problems with in terms of our oath of \noffice. We raise our hands, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, and \nswear to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. We \ndon't say we are disenfranchising ourselves from article I, section 9 \nof the Constitution, which is very clearly the responsibility of the \nlegislative branch to pass or to introduce authorization bills and \nappropriations bills.\n  This bill--I do have quite a few cosponsors on this--is a proposal \nthat would freeze discretionary spending at the 2008 level. Here is the \nreason I am doing this. President Obama and some of the Democrats had \nproposed that they would freeze the nonsecurity discretionary spending \nat 2010 levels. The problem I have with that is, this is after it has \nalready been increased by 20 percent, so it is kind of a big deal. You \nincrease it by 20 percent and then you freeze it. What I am doing is \ntaking the same interpretation or the same definition of the \nnonsecurity--this would exempt Defense, Homeland Security, State, \nVeterans' Administration, and national security functions of Energy, so \nit is the same language that is in the Obama proposal, but I am taking \nit back to 2008. This would have the effect over a period of time, over \na 10-year budget cycle, of reducing the amount by about--just under $1 \ntrillion, $900-some billion.\n  So I wish to have this considered. I would inquire of the Chair if I \nam now in the queue or what is the status of this at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is now a pending amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is the pending amendment. We have \nother amendments that have been filed, properly filed, and we are \nhoping to have additional votes this afternoon.\n  What we hope to do is complete this bill this afternoon. We have a \nnumber of issues that I think are being resolved in meetings off the \nfloor. It is now 3 o'clock, and I know the majority leader would very \nmuch like to complete this bill. This is the fifth day we have been on \nthe floor trying to pass an FAA reauthorization bill that should have \nbeen passed 11 times previously but was extended 11 successive times. \nThis deals with commercial aviation safety, airport improvement, \ninfrastructure improvement, a passengers' bill of rights, so many very \nimportant things. Some have said: Well, this will not get done this \nyear either. But after 5 days on the floor of the Senate, I remain with \nsome hope that we can get this done if we could get a bit of \ncooperation from our colleagues who have amendments to come over and \noffer them and we will have votes on them and the Senate will make \ndecisions and we will have a final vote on this bill.\n  This bill should not be controversial. It is bipartisan. It came out \nof the Commerce Committee with support from Republicans and Democrats, \nso we ought not have controversy on the floor of the Senate about when \nwe will get this bill completed.\n  I know one of the issues that remains unresolved at this point are \namendments dealing with what are called the slot rules at National \nAirport and the perimeter rule, kind of a complicated set of rules with \nrespect to how many slots are allowed for takeoffs and landings at \nNational Airport per hour and also how far those airplanes can fly \nbecause there have been some limitations with respect to the perimeter. \nThere are fewer nonstop flights from Washington National. Most of the \nnonstop flights, particularly coast to coast, happen from Dulles \nAirport in this region.\n\n  There are amendments on the slots and the perimeter rule with respect \nto National Airport. I hope we can get this resolved. We decided not to \naddress that issue in the Commerce Committee because it is very \ncontroversial and it is an open issue when we go to conference with the \nHouse because the House does address it.\n  The best approach, in my judgment, would be for those who wish to \noffer amendments on the slot and perimeter rules to withhold those \namendments here, and we will reach an agreement when we go to \nconference on how we can create the Senate position in terms of what we \nwant to do on these issues. It is an open issue and, undoubtedly, we \ncan resolve it in conference. If we have eight amendments on slot rules \nand perimeter rules and debate them for a few more days, this bill may \nvery well be a casualty of time.\n  After 5 days, I think the majority leader feels--appropriately--and I \nfeel and I know Senator Hutchison and others feel as well that we want \nto get this bill done today. If people have amendments, come down and \noffer them and debate them. If they do have amendments they want to \noffer, I hope some epiphany will occur to suggest to them they do not \nneed to come down and offer them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for colleagues to \ncome and offer amendments to the underlying bill, let me speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will relinquish the floor if colleagues come and wish \nto offer amendments to the FAA bill. That is what I prefer happen at \nthe moment.\n\n\n                             Travel to Cuba\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to visit in morning business about legislation \nthat Senator Mike Enzi from Wyoming and I have worked on now for some \nlong while. It has 38 cosponsors, 38 Senators cosponsoring, Republicans \nand Democrats. It deals with the question of travel to Cuba.\n  As you know, what we have at the moment and have had since 1962 is a \nprohibition on the American people's ability to travel to the country \nof Cuba. Cuba rests about 90 miles off our shore. We have, obviously, \nhad massive disagreements with the Castro regime for many years. In \norder to punish the Castro regime, we have restricted the rights of the \nAmerican people to travel.\n  We can travel unimpeded to many other countries. We can travel to \nCommunist China. We can travel to Vietnam, a Communist country. We can \ntravel to North Korea, if you can get a visa to get in. No restrictions \nthere. The American people just cannot travel to Cuba.\n  Let me describe the absurdity of this which leads Senator Enzi and me \nto offer this legislation. We have not offered it on the underlying \nbill today, but we will offer it on an authorization bill in the near \nfuture. With 38 cosponsors, we feel this bill would pass the Senate \nwith some ease.\n  Let me point out that the New York Philharmonic Orchestra is the \noldest symphony orchestra in America, founded in 1842. The New York \nPhilharmonic Orchestra is one of our most renowned cultural ambassadors \naround the world. In 1959, the New York Philharmonic played in the \nSoviet Union in Moscow. Last year, the New York Philharmonic has also \nplayed music in Communist Vietnam. In 2008, the New York Philharmonic \nplayed music in North Korea. By the way, if anyone has a chance to go \nto YouTube and/or the Internet and look at the reaction of the North \nKoreans to the New York Philharmonic playing music in Pyongyang, it is \nextraordinary--quite a cultural experience for our country to send this \nphilharmonic orchestra to those countries.\n\n  The only place they were not able to play was Havana, Cuba, in \nOctober 2009. Plans for those concerts had to be canceled. Think of \nthat: the New York Philharmonic was able to go and play music in Moscow \nat the height of the Cold War, in North Korea, in Vietnam, but it \nwasn't able to play in Havana, Cuba.\n  Why? Well, we have had now, through 10 Presidencies, an embargo in \nplace. An embargo has been in place that not only embargoes the \nmovement of goods to Cuba but also punishes the American people by \nsaying: You can't travel to Cuba. That is what Senator Enzi and I and \n37 other Senators wish to say is inappropriate, and we want to lift \nthose travel restrictions.\n  I understand the Castro government has restricted the freedoms of the \nCuban people. I understand this country has no use for the Castro \ngovernment. I have no use for the Castro government. I want the Cuban \npeople to be free. I think the most likely approach to freedom for the \nCuban people is to allow them to hear other voices, other than just the \nCastro government. Opening up Cuba to travel by Americans, it seems to \nme, will provide those other voices.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows we have under the current U.S. \npolicy, criminal penalties for violating sanctions of travel to Cuba: \n10 years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, and $250,000 for \nindividuals.\n  Well, let me show a few people who have run afoul of the law against \ntraveling to Cuba. This is Joni Scott. Joni Scott went to Cuba. She \nwent to Cuba with a church group to distribute free bibles in the rural \nareas--free bibles, distributing free bibles to Cuba. She got back to \nour country and, guess what. Our country sent her a letter because she \nwas honest and said she had been in Cuba distributing bibles. She got a \nletter saying: We are fining you $10,000.\n  So we fine an American citizen $10,000 for going to Cuba to \ndistribute free bibles? That is unbelievable.\n  But it is not just Joni Scott. Here is another Joan. This is Joan \nSlote. I have met both these women, by the way. Joan Slote was in her \nmid seventies when she went to Cuba. She was a Senior Olympian. She is \na bicyclist, and she joined a Canadian cycle group to go ride a bicycle \nin Cuba. She came back and found out that her government was going to \nlevy a $10,000 fine. Then, by the way, they decided to try to attach \nher Social Security payments because she hadn't responded. She hadn't \nresponded because she had gone to her son's side, who was suffering \nfrom brain cancer, and she didn't get the mail. So this woman, for \ncycling in Cuba, was told she should pay her government $10,000 in \nfines.\n  This is Sergeant Lazo--SGT Carlos Lazo. We actually had a vote about \nCarlos Lazo on the floor of the Senate on an amendment I offered one \nday. He fled from Cuba on a raft, joined the U.S. Army and went to Iraq \nto fight for our country. He won a Bronze Star Medal fighting for \nAmerica in Iraq. He came back to this country and discovered one of his \nchildren--he has young children who, by the way, were still living in \nCuba--one of his children was sick. Sergeant Lazo wanted to go to Cuba \nto visit his sick child. Having won a Bronze Star Medal on the \nbattlefield in Iraq, he was told by his government: You have no right \nto see your sick child in Cuba. Unbelievable.\n  So that is what we have, this restriction on travel to Cuba. Senator \nEnzi and I believe it is past the time, long past the time to eliminate \nit; to stop punishing the American people by restricting their right to \ntravel.\n  The last chart I have is a photograph of an airplane that flies \naround distributing television signals into the country of Cuba. We \nhave spent $\\1/4\\ billion in our country sending television signals \nthat the Cuban people can't receive because they are routinely blocked \nby the Cuban Government. We send television signals to the Cuban people \nto tell them how wonderful freedom is, when they know that by listening \nto Miami radio stations. We have spent $\\1/4\\ billion doing it, and I \nhave tried to eliminate that expenditure time and time again and have \nbeen unsuccessful.\n  Talk about government waste. Government waste even has cosponsorship \nin the United States on this issue.\n  The point is very simple. Senator Enzi and I, and many other \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate, believe we ought to stop \npunishing the American people for the actions of the Cuban government.\n  Many years ago, we also had a complete embargo on all shipments and \ngoods to Cuba, which included food, which I felt was immoral. So I and \nthen-Senator Ashcroft sponsored a resolution that passed the Congress \nand became law that opened up just a bit in the embargo to say: You can \nsell food into the Cuban marketplace and ship medicine into the Cuban \nmarketplace. You can do that, but it has to be paid for in cash, and \nyou can't run the cash through an American bank. So running these \ntransactions through European banks for cash, our farmers now have sold \na substantial amount of commodities in the Cuban marketplace, just as \nthe Canadian farmers have always done, and just as the European farmers \nhave always done.\n  So just that little bit of change in the embargo, opening up \nopportunities to sell food and medicine into the Cuban marketplace, was \na significant step. But I think this embargo has been an unbelievable \nfailure, through 10 Presidencies, and I think it is time for us to \ndecide the best way to promote freedom in Cuba--and I think 39 of us \nbelieve this in the Senate, having cosponsored the legislation, and \nmany more would vote for it--is to stop punishing the American people, \nto stop restricting travel.\n  The Castro government will have a very difficult time if an onslaught \nof Americans go to travel in Cuba, and\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nCubans hear other voices other than the Castro government. Again, we \nhave tried to address this issue of travel for a long while. I would \nhope most who are engaged in this would hang their heads with some \nshame that we are spending our time tracking down someone who is under \nsuspicion of taking a vacation to Cuba so we can levy a $10,000 fine.\n  What an absurd contradiction for a country that measures its health \nand freedom. What an absurd contradiction.\n  We have something down at the Treasury Department called OFAC Office \nof Foreign Assets Control. OFAC has the main mission of shutting down \nthe flow of money to terrorist organizations. That is what they are \nsupposed to be doing. The fact is, they have a Miami office, and for a \ngood part of the last decade they spent 60 percent of their money \ntrying to track American citizens who were suspected of vacationing in \nCuba. Again, are we daft? Have we lost all sense? That doesn't make any \nsense to me at all.\n  We had a couple of colleagues from the Senate in the newspaper the \nother day encouraging people not to go. There is a trip to Cuba \ndescribed in the paper--I believe they have a license to go--but some \ncolleagues were encouraging people not to go. Well, with respect to \nChina, for example, a Communist country, we have always said that \nconstructive engagement through trade and travel is what will lead to \ngreater human rights in China. That has always been the belief of this \ncountry. It is the way we deal with China, the way we deal with \nVietnam, it is the way we would deal with North Korea if they would \nallow Americans in because we don't restrict the American right to \ntravel to North Korea or Vietnam or China--only to Cuba.\n  Some of us believe it is an archaic, absurd contradiction for our \ncountry to continue doing this. I hope, perhaps, in the name of \nSergeant Lazo or, perhaps, Joni Scott, or any number of others--and I \ndidn't mention the young man from the State of Washington whose father \ndied. His father had previously been a minister at a church in Cuba. \nThis young man, when his father died and was cremated, took his ashes \nto Cuba to have the ashes placed on the grounds of the church his \nfather served in in Cuba. He did that. That was his father's last wish.\n  When he came back to this country, he was tracked by his government \nand levied a fine. That is not what this government ought to be doing. \nSo if the Congress can and will pass the amendment Senator Enzi and I \nhave constructed, which has wide support in the Senate, I think we will \nhave done something that is important.\n  Having said all that, I expect there will be things written tomorrow \nby those who watched these proceedings to say that this amendment is \nsomehow sympathetic to the Cuban government. It is not. That is an \nabsurd proposition. It is not sympathetic to anything except \nsympathetic to freedom for the American people. Let's stop punishing \nthe American people for others' transgressions.\n  The fact is, the American people ought to have the right to travel \nwhere they wish, where they choose--and they generally do, with this \nexception. But what is happening now is that the Office of Foreign \nAsset Control--which is supposed to be tracking Osama bin Laden and \nother known terrorists and tracking their finances to try to shut down \nthe financing of terrorism--is diverting its attention to see if they \ncan't nab a couple of Americans who went to take a vacation in Cuba.\n  This country is better than that, and we can do better than that by \npassing the legislation I and Senator Enzi have authored.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Financial Market Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of minutes, if I \ncan, this afternoon. I realize we are getting toward the close of the \nend of the week, and Members will be heading off to their respective \ndistricts and States for the weekend. We will be coming back on Monday \nor Tuesday.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes, because next week we will be \nhaving a markup in the Senate Banking Committee of the financial \nregulatory reform effort that we have been involved in now for about 2 \nyears.\n  It was 2 years ago this past weekend that the collapse of Bear \nStearns occurred in 2008. Not that that was the beginning of the \nproblems; that was merely the evidence of how deep the problems were. \nOf course, the events that unfolded in 2008 only confirmed what was \nhappening in March was the beginning of a near total collapse of the \nfinancial system in this country.\n  During those last 2 years, we have had countless hearings and \nmeetings, gathering information from all sorts of sources both here as \nwell as around the country to determine what best steps we could take \nto see to it that the country would never again face that kind of near \ncollapse of our financial system; to see to it that the tools would be \nthere, so that when the next emergency arose, as it surely will to one \ndegree or another, that the next generation would have the tools \nnecessary to avoid the economic system sort of spinning out of control, \nas it did over these last 2 years; and, thirdly, to make sure that in \nour efforts to plug the gaps that created the problems in the first \ninstance, and the tools necessary to deal with future ones, we were not \ngoing to strangle the financial system of our Nation so that we could \nnot create jobs, have credit flow, capital move, so that our Nation \ncould again prosper economically.\n  The interrelationship between our financial system and economic \ngrowth is inseparable. Without a strong and dependable, secure, safe \nfinancial system, the idea of economic growth in our country is, of \ncourse, a fiction. So we have a deep and serious challenge, as we have \nhad over these past 2 years, to reform a system that has not been \nreformed since the 1930s. There have been various new regulators who \nhave been added, additional restrictions imposed at one time or \nanother, but not the kind of comprehensive view that I think the \ncountry expects in light of the events that have unfolded over the last \ncouple of years.\n  As chairman of the committee over the last 36 months, since I became \nchairman in January of 2007, we have tried to respond to this issue, \nfirst in 2007, by focusing on the root cause of the problem. That was, \nof course, in the mortgage lending market, where mortgages were going \nout the door from lending institutions that the borrowers did not \nunderstand, and could never afford, and the lenders knew that at the \ntime. As a result, we began to see the collapse of our economy when \nthose mortgages were then securitized and sold to investors only to \ndiscover that, of course, these mortgages were worth a lot less than \nthe rating agencies claimed they were. That was not a minor problem. We \nhave now had 7 million people in this country who have had their homes \nin foreclosure. Many of them, if not most of them, will lose their \nhomes as a result of what happened.\n  The unemployment rate has cost 8\\1/2\\ million people their jobs in \nthis country, and in certain parts of the Nation unemployment rates \nhover around 17 percent, on average a little less than 10 percent.\n  There are good signs that are occurring that indicate our economy may \nbe recovering at certain levels. But tell that to the person who lost \ntheir job today, lost their retirement income, lost their homes, lost \nthat sense of self-worth and value that you can never put a pricetag on \nbut is essential for our Nation's sense of optimism and strength in \nthese difficult days.\n  For all of those reasons, we have tried to craft a bill here that \ndeals with those goals of plugging the loopholes, the gaps, providing \nthe tools for the future, and creating a system that will allow our \neconomy to grow and prosper once again.\n  There are four major areas of the bill I have talked about. One is \nfor once and all end the notion that any financial entity never can \nbecome so complicated, so interconnected, so big, that it has an \nimplicit guarantee that the taxpayers of this country are going to bail \nit out when it begins to fail, or fails.\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n  The $700 billion paycheck the American people wrote in order to \nstabilize our financial institutions in the fall of 2008 should never, \never happen again. The bill I have crafted, along with my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, we believe achieves that goal. I owe a \nspecial thanks, a very special thanks to two of our colleagues, a \nDemocrat and a Republican, who have worked over many weeks to try to do \nexactly what I have described doing for you, and that is to shut down \nthe possibility that the American taxpayer will ever again be asked to \nwrite that kind of a check. So my thanks to Mark Warner of Virginia, a \nnew Member of this body, one who, in his previous life, before being \nthe Governor of Virginia, worked in the financial services arena of our \ncountry and knows it well. His partner in this was another member of \nthe Banking Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, another new Member of \nthis Chamber. He served as the mayor of Chattanooga, TN, a very \nsuccessful businessman in his own right, who also understands these \nissues as well, if not better, than most Members who serve here, with \nall due respect.\n  The two of them have worked along with the Treasury Department and \nothers. They have listened to an awful lot of people in crafting this \ntitle I and title II of our bill dealing with systemic risk and with \n``too big to fail.''\n  In November I offered a proposal, what I called a ``discussion \ndraft,'' for our consideration. Since that time we have modified that \nbill substantially as a result of the input and suggestions of Senators \nWarner and Corker--and others, I might add; not exclusively but they \nhave been the leaders on this issue.\n  Earlier we had an independent agency with rule writing authority to \naddress systemic risk. In our new version we created a Treasury-led \ncouncil with the ability to make recommendations and rule writing. \nSenator Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican and former chairman \nof the Banking Committee, made those suggestions. That is different \nfrom what existed in November. It is a stronger provision; it makes \nmore sense.\n  Working with Senator Corker and Senator Warner, we have included his \nand Senator Warner's ideas with respect to the power of the council to \nact as an early warning signal, and the establishment of a new Office \nof Financial Research at the Treasury Department to standardize, \ncollect, and analyze financial data, to inform the work of the council. \nThey were very worthwhile suggestions.\n  We have also taken Senator Corker's and Senator Warner's ideas on \nending, as I said, ``too big to fail.'' We have a process in place for \nplacing failing financial companies in receivership and liquidating \nthem, unless they can go into bankruptcy. At Senator Shelby's request, \nwe have this mechanism available for any failing financial firm, not \njust those who were previously subject to heightened regulation.\n  The Fed's emergency lending authority has also been changed. At \nSenator Shelby's request, we have significantly cut back on the Fed's \nuse of its emergency lending authority, the so-called 13(3) section \nunder the Fed rules.\n  No longer can the Federal Reserve Bank bail out a company such as \nAIG, which is what they did. Instead, the Fed must create broad \nprograms subject to rulemaking and approval by the Treasury. Only then \ncan the Fed lend against good collateral.\n  We have made a host of other changes, including in the area of credit \nrating agencies, audits of the Federal Reserve, Federal governance \nchanges, securitization, credentialed supervision to protect the dual \nbanking system, and on and on, of modifications to the November \ndiscussion draft that I offered last Monday as this new proposal.\n  The last thing I would do is claim perfection. I am trying to put \ntogether a bill that reflects the various ideas of our colleagues, \nnecessary to garner the necessary support in order to move from the \ncommittee to the floor of this Chamber for further consideration. That \nis not easy. What I have tried to do is to maintain these principles of \neliminating ``too big to fail,'' setting up that systemic risk radar \noperation, so we have far more early warnings of the kinds of looming \nproblems that could threaten our economy and threaten the financial \nsystem of this Nation and others.\n\n  This bill does that in a very strong way. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, for their contributions \nthat are now reflected in the bill that I proposed on Monday, and it \nwill be the subject of our markup of that bill beginning on Monday, \nlate Monday afternoon, early Monday evening.\n  We made other changes as well. In November, I offered a proposal to \ncreate a free-standing consumer protection agency. I thought it made \nsense to do so. But there were suggestions that have come from my \ncolleagues here, both Democrats and Republicans, to place that agency, \nrenting space, nothing more than that, at the Federal Reserve.\n  There is a good reason for doing that, in my view, in terms of the \nbudgetary authority and how we fund the operations. But I insisted that \nwe have four major principles associated with consumer protection. I \nwould remind my colleagues, never, ever before have we had a focused \noperation in this Nation that was dedicated to protecting the users of \nfinancial services.\n  We have all read about Toyota and the problems with its braking \nsystem. I am not here to characterize the legitimacy or the accuracy of \nthose complaints. But what is not in doubt is that there is an agency \nof government today which exists which allows a consumer of a bad \nproduct, such as an automobile, or an appliance, or food they eat, to \nbe able to register that complaint and get redress, so that other \nconsumers would not be adversely affected by a bad product, a consumer \nproduct, something you buy, something you use, something you eat, \nsomething you drive, something you manipulate.\n  What we have never had in this country is a counterpart to that kind \nof protection when it comes to the mortgage you buy, the credit card \nyou engage in, the loan you make, the check you deposit, the insurance \npolicy you buy, or the stock you purchase.\n  This country deserves, in the 21st century, to be able to say to \nconsumers of financial products, there is a place where we can offer \nsome protection for those who might abuse you in the process, as \nhappened in this most recent crisis.\n  But we try to do it in a responsible way, because we recognize there \ncan be a conflict. I am not confident this happens as frequently as \nsome might suggest, but if there is a conflict between the safety and \nsoundness rules of a financial institution and the consumer protection \nof those who are the purchasers or users of financial services, we have \nnow changed the proposal I offered on Monday.\n  This new proposal has our consumer protection agency renting space, \nif you will, at the Federal Reserve, but it is independent in its \nrulemaking, it is independent in its examination and its ability to \nhave an enforcement of those financial institutions that have assets, \nparticularly on examination enforcement above $10 billion, which means \nit will go after the largest institutions and the marketers of these \nfinancial products. But those principles of having a presidentially \nappointed director, confirmed by the Senate, having an independent \nsource of funding, are now all reflected in this bill with the changes \nwe have made.\n  There are other changes as well. For the first time, large financial \ncompanies will be subject to Federal examination enforcement as well. \nThis means that for the first time, community banks will see their \nnonbank competitors examined and regulated on a level playing field as \nwell. Small banks have a legitimate complaint, that they have been \nsubject to regulation, but the nonbanks are not, and that is unfair.\n  Nonbanks also dispense financial products, and the users or the \npurchasers of those products ought to have the same degree of \nprotection. Our bill that we presented on Monday does that.\n  There will be no assessments on small banks or large banks or \nnonbanks. The Federal Reserve will pay the freight of this agency. \nConcerns have been raised that somehow consumer protection will create \nsafety and soundness. I already suggested to you, we have a mechanism \nhere that I think will ease or eliminate any concerns people have about \nany potential conflict that could possibly occur.\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n  The point I wanted to make in these two areas, one on ``too big to \nfail,'' systemic risk councils, looking at the consumer protection \narea, I have been listening carefully to my colleagues, all 22 \nDemocrats and Republicans on the committee. We had over 50 hearings \nalone, I believe is the number, this past year on the subject matter.\n  Since November, it has been 4 months that have gone by with ideas \nthat have been brought to the table, and they are reflected in this \nbill that I offered for consideration on Monday. Beginning on Monday of \nnext week, we will begin the process of doing what we do here in this \ninstitution of the Senate, we will begin the so-called markup of a \nbill, where we sit around, all 23 of us, and try to narrow the \ndifferences that may exist as we try to come forth with a product for \nthe full consideration of the Senate.\n  I am looking forward to the amendments that will be filed by noon \ntomorrow. It will give us the weekend to analyze those amendments, many \nof which I hope we will be able to accept to improve this bill; in \nothers there may be differences that we cannot resolve in the markup of \nthe committee.\n  But I have assured my good friend from Alabama, the ranking \nRepublican on the committee, Senator Shelby, that I am determined to \nget a bill, to do it in an orderly fashion, to have the markup of this \nsubject matter which is so important to all Americans be done in a \ncivil fashion, so we listen and respect each other as we craft these \nideas to try and make a difference and see to it that we never again \nsee our country face the kind of near brink of utter disaster that we \ncame close to accomplishing as a result of the gaps that have existed \nin our financial regulatory system.\n  I thank my colleagues for indulging me these few minutes to kind of \nshare with you some of the changes that have occurred since November in \nthe draft we have offered. There are many more I have not gone into in \nthese few minutes that are reflected in the proposal.\n  But it is a balanced bill, one that is designed to be fair and clear, \none that will give us better lines of authority reflecting the changes \nthat have occurred in our country over many years, allowing for a \ngreater, I think, sense of confidence that certain things will be done.\n  One of the changes we made, my good friend from Alabama made the \nsuggestion and I have included it in the bill. Up to now, the New York \nFed, which is a very important regional Federal bank--the Chair of that \nbank has always been chosen by the very banks the New York Fed \nregulates. Under our proposal, the head of that New York Fed will be \nchosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate. That is a major \nchange. I know it may not seem like much to others, but imagine the \ninherent potential contradiction that the very people you are charged \nwith regulating decide who the regulator is going to be. This bill \nchanges that, along with many other suggestions. Again, that one came \nfrom my friend from Alabama. I thank him for it, along with many other \nideas reflected in the bill.\n  I know we have our differences. We have not resolved all of them, but \nthat is why we are here--to resolve differences and come forward. I am \nconfident we can do that and that we will end up in the next number of \nweeks with a financial reform package that will enjoy broad-based \nsupport in the Senate. We will work with our colleagues in the other \nbody and offer to the President for his signature the first major \ncomprehensive reform of financial services institutions since the Great \nDepression. The task is a huge one. It is daunting in many ways. The \nbill is almost 1,400 pages long. It is a reflection of weeks and months \nof work. It is not something crafted over the last weekend and thrown \ntogether. It is a reflection of hours and hours of consultation among \nDemocrats and Republicans, stakeholders, advisers, and other people who \nbring a great deal of wealth and knowledge to this debate.\n  I felt the time had come to lay down a product and ask my colleagues \nto react to it, to ask those knowledgeable about the issue to examine \nit and then for us to get about the business we are sent here to do; \nthat is, to change laws where they need changing, to strengthen \nregulators where they need strengthening, to create oversight and \nregulation where it is missing so that we can have a renewed confidence \nin our economic system. That was my goal at the outset. It is my goal \nwith the presentation of the bill. It is my confidence that my \ncolleagues will embrace this as well when we have a chance to cast \nfinal votes in this body.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 4:15 p.m. be equally divided and controlled in the usual form and \nthat at 4:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed; that prior to each vote there \nbe 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that the second vote in the sequence be a 10-minute vote and no \nintervening amendments be in order: Inhofe amendment No. 3549; McCain \namendment No. 3475.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will be voting at 4:15 on two amendments. Following \nthat, we have 17 amendments en bloc that have been agreed to by both \nsides. We can't get them here and have them voted on because of \nobjection, but by and large, they have been agreed on by both sides. \nFollowing that, the issue of the slot rules and perimeter--if we can \nfind a way to resolve that, we should be able to finish the bill this \nafternoon. If not, if there are some who insist they intend to offer \namendments, that will be problematic and we probably will not be able \nto finish this bill. This bill is about aviation safety, modernization, \na passenger bill of rights. I hope that we will be able to have some \ncooperation by Senators--this is the fifth day we have been on the \nfloor with this bill--to get this done today. I hope that will be the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3549\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in 5 minutes we will be voting on an \namendment I have. I have explained the amendment several times. I first \nintroduced it as S. 3095, the Honest Expenditure and Limitation Program \nAct of 2010. Let me say what it is. We will be voting, if this goes \ndown, on the McCain amendment and another amendment like we voted on \nbefore. There is an honest difference of opinion.\n  What I thought would be appropriate is, since we will be voting, very \nlikely, on another earmark amendment and since I don't think anyone is \ngoing to question the fact that defeating an earmark doesn't save a \nnickel, if we have an alternative that really does mean something, this \nwould be our chance to vote on it.\n  What I would like to do is briefly explain what the amendment is that \nwe will be voting on in a few minutes.\n  Some time ago, President Obama came out with his program where he \nsaid, during the State of the Union: I plan to freeze nondefense \ndiscretionary spending at 2010 levels. A lot of people applauded, \nbelieving that to be some type of a gesture that was a conservative \ngesture that would reduce spending when, in fact, it didn't because he \nwas talking about the 2010 levels--that is after 1 year--and it has \nbeen increased by 20 percent. What he was saying is we are going to \nraise the nondefense discretionary spending by 20 percent and then \nfreeze it. Rather than raise it by 20 percent and freeze it, the \nfiscally responsible thing to do is to go ahead and freeze it at the \nprevious level.\n  Quite often, we have heard President Obama say what he inherited from \nthe previous administration. I always hasten to say that, yes, there \nwere some\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\ndeficits during the Bush administration. But the deficit in the first \nyear of the Obama administration--about $1.5 trillion--is more than the \nlast 5 years collectively of President George W. Bush. It is important \nfor people to understand that.\n  We have an unsustainable debt. You are looking at someone who has 20 \nkids and grandkids. It is the next generation that is going to face it. \nWe can't continue to do this. Yes, it is a nice gesture. A lot of \npeople think you can eliminate earmarks and eliminate funding. That has \nnothing to do with it. You don't save a nickel. But you do with this. \nIf we pass this amendment, we would be able to effectively reduce the \nexpenditures over a 10-year budget cycle of just under $1 trillion.\n  What we are trying to do is have a freeze on discretionary spending \nat 2008 levels for all nonsecurity appropriations, worded the same way \nPresident Obama's effort was worded. The only difference is that we use \nthe 2008 spending level. We have a lot of cosponsors. I hope people \nwill seriously consider this. If they really want to reduce spending, \nthis is their chance to do so.\n  I understand we have a vote that is coming at 15 after the hour; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, in the name of reducing our national \ndebt, this amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma seeks to \nfreeze discretionary spending at fiscal year 2008 levels for the next \n10 years.\n  While I understand and support the need to restrain discretionary \nspending as a part of the solution to our debt problem, this draconian \napproach is most certainly not the way to accomplish that task.\n  As I have said before, it is a fact that the growth in the debt has \nresulted primarily from unchecked mandatory spending and massive tax \ncuts for the rich. This amendment, as have several offered from the \nother side of the aisle, fails to respond to either of those two \nproblems. For this reason alone, my colleagues should not support it.\n  We need a comprehensive solution to the national debt, one that \naddresses spending, mandatory programs, and revenues. Any honest budget \nanalyst can tell you we will never achieve a balanced budget just by \nfreezing discretionary spending. We could eliminate all discretionary \nspending increases for defense, other security spending, and non-\ndefense and still not balance the budget.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues if we cut discretionary spending \nwithout reaching an agreement on mandatory spending and taxes we will \nfind it very hard to get those who do not want to address revenues to \ncompromise.\n  For exactly that reason, the administration has just announced that \nit will create a Deficit Reduction Commission to help us get our \nfinancial house in order. It will look at both revenue and spending and \nfind the right balance to restore fiscal discipline.\n  They will make their recommendations to the Congress and the majority \nleader has committed that the recommendations of that Commission will \nbe brought to the Senate for a vote.\n  If we adopt the Inhofe caps we will have to effectively eliminate the \nPresident's agenda for discretionary spending--education, green jobs, \nand homeland security. And this amendment would keep the spending caps \nin place for ten years. With one amendment, we would actually be tying \nthe hands of the next administration as well.\n  In my time as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have \nconsistently advocated for regular order. Regular order allows all of \nour colleagues to participate, debate and offer amendments to the \nappropriations bills. It allows the budget committee to play the \nessential role that it does. The Inhofe amendment turns regular order \non its head.\n  This amendment fails to do anything serious about deficits. It fails \nto address the two principal reasons why our fiscal house is out of \nbalance.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I agree that everyone \nshould tighten their belts. The problem with this amendment is that all \nthe tightening will be done on a small portion of spending, while \nrevenues and mandatory spending will still be unchecked.\n  The Senate has already rejected a less draconian version of this plan \nthree times in the last 2 months. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes now evenly divided on the \nSenator's amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Well, Madam President, I will go ahead and \ntake my minute.\n  This amendment is something that would reduce expenditures, do \nsomething about the deficit. I know there are a lot of my Democratic \nfriends and Republican friends alike who would like a chance to do \nthis. I know there is a feel-good vote coming up on earmarks, but that \ndoes not reduce anything in terms of the expenditures.\n  If you vote on an earmark, and you defeat the earmark, it does not \ncut the amount of money, but the underlying bill will go back to some \nbureaucracy. It can be the Department of the Interior. It can be the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It can be any number of departments. \nThen an unelected bureaucrat will be making that decision.\n  It was interesting the other day when, in a three-part series, Sean \nHannity had on his program 102 earmarks. When he was all through--and I \nread all of these Monday on the floor--the interesting thing about it, \nwhat they all had in common was not one of those earmarks was a \ncongressional earmark. They were all bureaucratic earmarks. That is \nwhere the problem is, not the congressional earmarks. So I am going to \nurge my friends to support a real effort, a sincere effort, and an \neffective effort to reduce government spending by voting for my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield back the time.\n  I make a point that the pending amendment deals with matter within \nthe Budget Committee's jurisdiction.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)3 of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3475\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes, evenly divided, before \na vote with respect to the McCain amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this is a very complicated and complex, \ndifficult amendment to understand. It would place a moratorium on all \nearmarks on years in which there is a deficit.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the reason I proposed the previous \namendment is because it would do something about the runaway spending \nand the deficit we have. It would have had the effect of reducing just \nunder $1 trillion in a 10-year period.\n  This doesn't work. I know everyone thinks they want to jump on the \nbandwagon on earmark reform, but there is not any earmark that if you \nkill it, it saves one nickel. To me, it is deceptive to the public. For \nthose people on this side of the aisle, I would only say that if you \nwant to give President Obama that much more money to deal with, this is \nyour opportunity to do it, because if you kill an earmark, it goes back \ninto the bureaucracy and that is where he will have the choice.\n  The other night when we had the 102 earmarks that the ``Sean Hannity \nShow'' talked about, not one was a congressional earmark. So I don't \nthink the votes are going to change but, nonetheless, nothing will be \nsaved by this.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3475.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sunshine Week\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there is finally some sunshine on the \nCapitol dome today, and it is a welcome change from all the snow we \nhave had this winter, so it is appropriate that this is Sunshine Week. \nBut that is not a reference to the weather. Sunshine Week is a \nnonpartisan, open-government initiative led by the American Society of \nNews Editors.\n  It is a good time, then, to talk about congressional oversight and \nthe need for Congress to keep a watchful eye on the executive branch. \nThat is what oversight is all about--checks and balances in government.\n  I would like to refer to the President's inaugural address and use it \nas a benchmark for measuring sunshine in government. President Obama \npromised in the inaugural address to bring more sunshine to the Federal \nGovernment, and I want to quote him.\n\n       Those of us who manage the public's dollar will be held to \n     account, to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our \n     business in the light of day, because only then can we \n     restore the vital trust between a people and their \n     government.\n\n  So let's just see how what has taken place in the last 15 months \nmeasures against this very good standard the President set in the \ninaugural address. I couldn't agree more with the President on what he \nsaid. The government should do its business in the light of day. \nUnfortunately, in my work, I have noticed no improvement in the \nopenness of the Federal Government.\n  One vital step the President could have taken to ensure greater \ntransparency would have been to order agencies to be more forthcoming \nin responding to requests from Congress--not just from this Senator but \nfrom any Senator. He could have instructed them to review and revise \nsome of the secretive policies that have developed over the years. \nThese policies are not required by law and simply serve to frustrate \nthe ability of Congress to gather information we need in order to act \nas a check on the power and responsibilities of the executive branch. \nHowever, the President has apparently not taken that step because the \nagencies have been as aggressive as ever in withholding information \nfrom Congress.\n  Throughout my career here in the Senate, I have actively conducted \noversight of the executive branch, regardless of who controls Congress \nor the White House. So that means, for me, as a Republican, I feel I \nhave been just as aggressive, or more so, with a Republican President \nas with a Democratic President because it is our constitutional duty as \nlegislators to do this.\n  These issues are typically about basic good government and \naccountability. They are not about party politics, and they surely \naren't about ideology. The resistance is often fierce--resistance from \nthe bureaucracy, that is--protecting itself in what the bureaucracy \ndoes best. It loves to protect itself from scrutiny, and it works \novertime to keep embarrassing facts from Congress and, in turn, from \npublic scrutiny.\n  When the agencies I am reviewing get defensive and refuse to respond \nto my requests, you know what. It makes me simply wonder what they are \ntrying to hide. They act as if documents in government files belong to \nthem. These unelected officials seem to think they alone have the right \nto decide who gets access to that information--collected, by the way, \nat taxpayers' expense. Well, I have news for them. These documents in \nthe government files belong to the people, and the elected \nrepresentatives of the people have a right to see them. That right is \nessential to carry out our oversight functions under the Constitution.\n  I had hoped President Obama's commitment to a more open government \nwould mean major changes that would enable more effective congressional \noversight. As he said in his inaugural address, those who manage public \ndollars ought to be held to account and do business in the light of \nday. But actions always speak louder than words. Given my experience in \ntrying to pry information out of the executive branch, I am \ndisappointed to report that the principles the President articulated so \nwell are not being put into practice.\n  The administration seems to act as if government officials ought to \nbe held\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\nto account and do business in the light of the day except when they do \nnot want to. There are too many exceptions to count, and I am just \ngoing to list a few. Let's contrast the President's words with the \nagencies' actions. The President's words say that government should do \nbusiness in the light of day. The agencies' actions say except when it \ncomes to improper payment of Medicare.\n\n  As a part of my oversight function of Medicare, Congress reviews \nannual reports that the administration is required to produce. One of \nthese reports is on improper Medicare payments. That was due last \nNovember. Congress is still waiting to see the numbers for improper \npayments made to specific types of health care providers and for \nspecific services. Improper payment rates vary widely among different \ntypes of providers and, of course, services. So this information would \nhelp us to determine where to focus our efforts. We have not received \nsuch breakdowns of improper payments since the year 2007. We need these \nnumbers to evaluate how the Federal Government is addressing fraud, \nwaste, and abuse and to inform our discussions on legislation about \nhealth care financing.\n  Let's go to another example because I want to repeat the President's \nwords: Government should do business in the light of day. Their actions \nsay: Except when it comes to potential Medicaid fraud. Overutilization \nof health services and health care fraud play a significant role in the \nrising cost of our health care system.\n  I wrote to the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services 3 months ago about what they \nare doing about overutilization of health care services. I specifically \nasked about a Medicaid prescriber in south Florida who--now hear this--\nwho wrote over 96,000 prescriptions for mental health drugs, nearly \ntwice the number written by the second highest prescriber. It was just \na simple question about one Medicare prescriber, and I am still waiting \nfor a response.\n  On another example--his words would say government should do business \nin the light of day. The actions of the administration say except when \nit comes to protecting the privacy of an al-Qaida terrorist.\n  Listen to this. In preparation for a hearing on Christmas Day bombing \nattempts, my Republican colleagues and I on the Judiciary Committee \nrequested a copy of something very simple, a copy of the bomber's visa \napplication. We wanted to learn more about why he was given permission \nto enter the United States in the first place, and why his visa wasn't \nrevoked after his father warned the U.S. officials that he might be \nplanning something.\n  The State Department first tried to withhold the document on grounds \nthat it might be evidence in a criminal proceeding. But after the \nJustice Department said that was not an issue, you know what. The State \nDepartment comes along and tries to not cooperate. The State Department \nchanged its position and claimed that a provision in the immigration \nlaw required them to protect the al-Qaida terrorist's privacy by \nwithholding documents about how he was given permission to enter the \ncountry.\n  After going through all that, all I can say is--transparency, on a \nlittle simple visa application, and it cannot be given to us?\n  On another example, the President says: Government should do business \nin the light of day. Their actions say: Except when it comes to \ninformation about how Treasury officials allowed AIG executives to make \noff with millions of taxpayer dollars. Since last December, I have \nexchanged a series of letters with Treasury Secretary Geithner and his \nstaff. I have some detailed questions about exactly which executives \nreceived which kind of payments under which contracts, and then why the \nTreasury Department did not do more to stop those payments. I even \naddressed the issue directly with Secretary Geithner at a Finance \nCommittee hearing. He promised that I would get the information I was \nseeking. Yet Treasury Department lawyers are still withholding the \ndocuments on the grounds that they have to protect the privacy of AIG \nexecutives.\n  Is government doing its business in the light of day? No. They are \nstill refusing to answer questions about why Treasury regulators \nallowed AIG to make large severance payments, even though the statute \nprovided the authority to stop those payments.\n  On another example, and to repeat the President's words: Government \nshould do business in the light of day. What do the actions show? \nExcept when it comes to allegations of misconduct in the Department of \nJustice.\n  When Attorney General Eric Holder and I met during his confirmation \nprocess, I provided him with a binder that thick full of unanswered \nletters that I had written regarding the FBI and Justice Department \noversight issues in the Bush administration. I was trying to give the \nAttorney General an opportunity to clear the deck so somehow it was not \nmixed up with the new administration. I had promises of renewed efforts \nto accommodate my information requests. The Department has not altered \nits policies of withholding documents relating to personnel matters and \nany other matter that might be the subject of internal reviews in the \nJustice Department.\n  For years I have been seeking internal Justice Department e-mails \nrelated to the FBI's use of so-called exigent letters, together with \ntelephone records of Americans, without a subpoena, and even when there \nis no legitimate emergency. At first the excuse was that the Congress \nhad to wait for the inspector general to finish a review, but that \nreview is complete at long last. Yet the documents that were supposed \nto be provided are still being withheld.\n  Congress is not the only one from whom the executive branch is \nwithholding information. I asked the Government Accountability Office \nin September about its difficulties in obtaining access to records and \nother information from the Federal agencies over the last year. As an \ninvestigative arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office \ninvestigates how the Federal Government spends taxpayers' dollars, and \nin order to do that work the GAO requires access to agency documents.\n  So what has been the record of the Government Accountability Office? \nThey have told me that it generally receives good cooperation, but it \nhas and continues to have access issues at certain agencies such as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, Homeland Security has ``posed continual access \nchallenges for GAO since the department began operations in 2003.''\n  The Government Accountability Office also indicated that access to \ninformation at the Justice Department and the FBI is also particularly \nproblematic. Despite a bipartisan request--get this--a bipartisan \nrequest from both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to audit \nthe FBI's human capital management of its counterterrorism division, \nthe Government Accountability Office has been stonewalled by the \nJustice Department with new and unprecedented claims that the FBI's \nintelligence-related functions are off-limits for GAO review.\n  Understand this: This is the top Republican, top Democrat on the \nHouse Judiciary Committee and counterparts on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. So it is bipartisan and it is bicameral. Even the Government \nAccountability Office has trouble getting the information.\n  The public has also been stonewalled when making requests for records \nunder the Freedom of Information Act. When he first took office, the \nPresident back-issued a memo on the Freedom of Information Act to the \nheads of executive agencies. Listen as I quote. Who is not going to \nagree with this? The President is doing what a President who campaigned \non openness and transparency in government and accountability should be \ndoing. He is doing what he said he was going to do in the campaign. But \nhaving it come out the other end of the pipeline, it doesn't seem to \nwork that way.\n\n       The Government should not keep information confidential \n     merely because public officials might be embarrassed by \n     disclosure, because of errors and failures that might be \n     revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\n\n  Then he goes on to instruct the executive agencies to:\n\n       . . . adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order \n     to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in the \n     Freedom of\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\n     Information Act, and to usher in a new era of open \n     government.\n\n  I compliment the President of the United States. Such a good \nstatement, and just what government ought to be standing for because \nthe public's business ought to be public.\n  The President may have issued a pledge of openness and transparent \ngovernment, but this week we had the National Security Archive release \nfindings of its Freedom of Information Act audit and found that the \nadministration ``has not conquered the challenge of communicating and \nenforcing that message throughout the Executive Branch.''\n  Particularly, the organization found that requests as old as 18 years \nstill exist in the freedom of information system. Somebody made a \nrequest 18 years ago, and it has not been granted? Probably the guy who \nasked for it, or whoever asked for it, is dead and buried now. Why \ncan't something like that be done? It does not meet the commonsense \ntest that we are interested in bringing to Washington--Washington, an \nisland surrounded by reality. And only in the unreal world could there \nbe a freedom of information request 18 years old that has not yet been \ngranted.\n  This organization also found that five agencies appear to be \nreleasing less and withholding more information, even since this \nPresident's Executive order has been in place. How can people thumb \ntheir noses at the President of the United States if they are working \nunder his direction? The White House has said it is committed to more \nopen and transparent government. In his memo to the heads of the \nexecutive agencies, the President said ``openness will strengthen our \ndemocracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government,'' and \nthat ``transparency promotes accountability.''\n  Again--extreme compliment to the President of the United States for \nsetting a standard. That is absolutely in the spirit of representative \ngovernment. But somehow the message has clearly not gotten through.\n  It comes back to us and our constitutional responsibilities of checks \nand balances. It is our job in Congress to ensure that agencies are \nmore transparent and responsive to the people we represent. Congress is \nnot doing its job if we do not hold agencies accountable and ensure \nthat executive policies reflect the interests of our constituents. In \nother words, the public's business ought to be public.\n  I will continue doing what I can to hold feet to the fire. It would \nbe helpful if the President would use his authority to require agencies \nto change their actions to be consistent with his words.\n  I do not get a chance to compliment this President very much, but he \nsurely has set the standard here that we ought to have in our \nGovernment. It just proves, if he really wants it to happen, even if \nyou are President of the United States, it is difficult to get people \ndown in the bowels of the bureaucracy to carry out what you want.\n  You wonder why people in this country are cynical. That is one \nreason. But the President can do it. He ought to call all these birds \nin that are frustrating his principles and look them in the eye and \ntell them: Either do what I want or get out of government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I have come to the floor to again talk \nabout the health care bill that is being worked on over in the House \nthat will potentially be voted on--we are hearing this weekend--and to \ntalk about the myths around this bill, what is being told to the \nAmerican people and what the facts are, so the American people can know \nwhat this Congress is trying to get them into. In this past week, I \ncame to the floor and spoke about 10 myths about this health care bill. \nI do not wish to go through in detail all those myths today, but we \nhave some new information about a couple of them that I wished to focus \non and go over the list of those myths.\n  Myth 1 was: You get to keep your health insurance if you like what \nyou have. The President has been saying this all around the country. We \nknow that is not true because, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, between 9 and 17 million people are going to lose their health \ninsurance from their employer when their employer is going to drop that \ninsurance and make their employees go into the new public system. So \nyou are not going to get to keep it.\n  We know folks on Medicare Advantage are not necessarily going to get \nto keep their Medicare Advantage because we are going to cut Medicare \nAdvantage by $120 billion. To the more than 1 million people in Florida \nwho have Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part C, which offers them \nwellness benefits, hearing benefits, eyesight benefits, programs they \nlike, we know over time they are not going to get to keep that in the \nway they have it now.\n  We also know health insurance premiums are not going to go down. That \nis myth No. 2. The very reason why this country wanted health care \nreform, the No.1 reason: to lower the cost of health insurance. We know \nhealth insurance has gone up more than 130 percent in the last 10 \nyears. Yet this bill does little or nothing to lower the cost of health \ninsurance for the 159 million Americans who have health insurance.\n  Some may see their rates go down 3 percent--that is the best it \ngets--while those in the individual market may see their rates go up 10 \nto 12 percent in the next 10 years. We are supposed to be about the \nbusiness of health care reform, and we are not going to lower the cost \nof health insurance.\n  We talked about whether this would just lower the overall cost of \nhealth care itself. That was the third myth we discussed. But we know \nthat Federal outlays for health care are going to increase by more than \n$200 billion in the next 10 years.\n  This idea that this health care plan is going to reduce the deficit, \nthat is just funny math. We know this bill has 6 years of spending, 6 \nyears of benefits, if you will, and 10 years of taxes. Only in \nWashington could someone try to say you were going to spend $1 trillion \nand save $100 billion.\n  We know it does not even take into account the fact that we have to \ngive doctors more money in the Medicare system. The Democrats put that \nin a separate bill, so we do not score that $300 billion cost because, \nif you did, there would be no deficit reduction. We also know emergency \nrooms are not going to be less burdened. If we look at the example of \nMassachusetts that instituted health care reform, they are seeing just \nas many people crowd their emergency rooms because the folks there tell \nthem it is more convenient than to wait in line to see their doctor.\n  See, when you push more people into the system and do not provide \nadequate funding for more health care providers, you do not change and \nmake the system more user friendly, so the folks still show up at the \nemergency room.\n  Another myth we busted is that this plan takes on the insurance \ncompanies, when, in fact, it is going to put millions of more people \ninto an insurance program. That is why the insurance companies like it.\n  We also busted the myth that this health care reform is going to \nimprove the doctor-patient relationship. It is not. There is still \ngoing to be a third-party payer. We still fundamentally miss the \nopportunity of getting you, the patient, back involved in the consumer \ndecision.\n  If we would have taken a page from what we proposed on our side of \nthe aisle and given you a tax credit to let you go in the market and \nbuy insurance yourself, we know that would have driven costs down \nbecause you would have been a consumer.\n  Right now, my wife and I are about to have our fourth child any day \nnow. I remember getting those bills from the hospital on our previous \nboys when they were born. Similar to most folks, you do not read it, \nyou just look at the bottom and see what you owe. You do not look at \nall the line-by-line items. You would have to hire someone to help make \nsense of all that. We have to put consumers back in the health care \ngame. We have to know what we are buying and what we are paying for \nbecause we know as consumers we will make a good decision.\n  We do it in the car insurance market and guess what. The companies \nthat\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\ncompete nationally, unlike health care companies that compete only \nwithin certain States, they are advertising to us on TV: ``So easy a \ncaveman can do it.'' ``Do you have 15 minutes? You can save 15 percent \non your car insurance.''\n  We know all these slogans because the market is working. The market \ndoes not work in health care, and this legislation does nothing to fix \nit.\n  We know that eventually under this program, the taxes will go up not \ndown because every government program we put together, certainly \nentitlement programs, always cost more than we think. They always cost \nour children and our grandchildren more as we have this ever-increasing \nnational debt, now $12 trillion, a debt our kids are going to have to \npay and our grandchildren, a debt that could make this country not the \nsame place of opportunity that we all have experienced and we all \nenjoy.\n  But I wished to specifically talk about a couple of the myths that \nthere has been some recent information about. One thing I talked about \nearlier this week is this idea about premiums. The President of the \nUnited States, this week when he was campaigning, said that health care \noverall, lower premiums will be achieved by this legislation and that \nthose premiums will go down double digits.\n  The fact is, that is not true. As we talked about before, the fact \nis, the best it is--and I put this chart from the Congressional Budget \nOffice into the Congressional Record earlier this week--the best it is, \nis 3 percent down.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Associated Press \ncalled: ``Fact Check: Premiums would rise under Obama plan,'' by Mr. \nRicardo Alonso-Zaldivar, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Fact Check: Premiums Would Rise Under Obama Plan\n\n                      (By Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar)\n\n       Washington.--Buyers, beware: President Barack Obama says \n     his health care overhaul will lower premiums by double \n     digits, but check the fine print.\n       Premiums are likely to keep going up even if the health \n     care bill passes, experts say. If cost controls work as \n     advertised, annual increases would level off with time. But \n     don't look for a rollback. Instead, the main reason premiums \n     would be more affordable is that new government tax credits \n     would help cover the cost for millions of people.\n       Listening to Obama pitch his plan, you might not realize \n     that's how it works.\n       Visiting a Cleveland suburb this week, the president \n     described how individuals and small businesses will be able \n     to buy coverage in a new kind of health insurance \n     marketplace, gaining the same strength in numbers that \n     federal employees have.\n       ``You'll be able to buy in, or a small business will be \n     able to buy into this pool,'' Obama said. ``And that will \n     lower rates, it's estimated, by up to 14 to 20 percent over \n     what you're currently getting. That's money out of pocket.''\n       And that's not all.\n       Obama asked his audience for a show of hands from people \n     with employer-provided coverage, what most Americans have.\n       ``Your employer, it's estimated, would see premiums fall by \n     as much as 3,000 percent,'' said the president, ``which means \n     they could give you a raise.'\n       A White House press spokesman later said the president \n     misspoke; he had meant to say annual premiums would drop by \n     $3,000.\n       It could be a long wait.\n       ``There's no question premiums are still going to keep \n     going up,'' said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family \n     Foundation, a research clearinghouse on the health care \n     system. ``There are pieces of reform that will hopefully keep \n     them from going up as fast. But it would be miraculous if \n     premiums actually went down relative to where they are \n     today.''\n       The statistics Obama based his claims on come from two \n     sources. In both cases, the caveats got left out.\n       A report for the Business Roundtable, an association of big \n     company CEOs, was the source for the claim that employers \n     could save $3,000 per worker on health care costs, the White \n     House said.\n       Issued in November, the report looked generally at \n     proposals that Democrats were considering to curb health care \n     costs, concluding they had the potential to significantly \n     reduce future increases.\n       But the analysis didn't consider specific legislation, much \n     less the final language being tweaked this week. It's unclear \n     to what degree the bill that the House is expected to vote on \n     within days would reduce costs for employers.\n       An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of earlier \n     Senate legislation suggested savings could be fairly modest.\n       It found that large employers would see premium savings of \n     at most 3 percent compared with what their costs would have \n     been without the legislation. That would be more like a few \n     hundred dollars instead of several thousand.\n       The claim that people buying coverage individually would \n     save 14 percent to 20 percent comes from the same budget \n     office report, prepared in November for Sen. Evan Bayh, D-\n     Ind. But the presidential sound bite fails to convey the full \n     picture.\n       The budget office concluded that premiums for people buying \n     their own coverage would go up by an average of 10 percent to \n     13 percent, compared with the levels they'd reach without the \n     legislation. That's mainly because policies in the individual \n     insurance market would provide more comprehensive benefits \n     than they do today.\n       For most households, those added costs would be more than \n     offset by the tax credits provided under the bill, and they \n     would pay significantly less than they have to now.\n       The premium reduction of 14 percent to 20 percent that \n     Obama cites would apply only to a portion of the people \n     buying coverage on their own--those who decide they want to \n     keep the skimpier kinds of policies available today.\n       Their costs would go down because more young people would \n     be joining the risk pool and because insurance company \n     overhead costs would be lower in the more efficient system \n     Obama wants to create.\n       The president usually alludes to that distinction in his \n     health care stump speech, saying the savings would accrue to \n     those people who continue to buy ``comparable'' coverage to \n     what they have today.\n       But many of his listeners may not pick up on it.\n       ``People are likely to not buy the same low-value policies \n     they are buying now,'' said health economist Len Nichols of \n     George Mason University. ``If they did buy the same value \n     plans . . . the premium would be lower than it is now. This \n     makes the White House statement true. But is it possibly \n     misleading for some people? Sure.''\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. This article goes through specifically these points. The \nPresident of the United States campaigned this week saying that:\n\n       You'll be able to buy in, or a small business will be able \n     to buy into this pool. And that will lower rates, it's \n     estimated by up to 14 to 20 percent over what you're \n     currently getting. That's money out of pocket.\n\n  Then he says:\n\n       Your employer, it's estimated, would see premiums fall by \n     as much as 3,000 percent, which means they could give you a \n     raise.\n\n  They later corrected the record to mean $3,000, your premiums could \nfall $3,000. Well, with all due respect, there is no evidence of this \nin an analysis of this bill. That is what the Associated Press says in \ntheir fact check.\n  In fact, for those in the individual marketplace--and this is not the \nSenator from Florida speaking, this is the Congressional Budget \nOffice--increases of up to 10 to 13 percent; for everybody else, either \nstays the same, goes up a little or maybe goes down 3 percent, and that \nis if they got it right.\n  So it is important to bust this myth. Your insurance is not going \ndown under this plan. If you thought we were going to enact health care \nreform and you were going to have a lower cost of health insurance, \nyou, unfortunately, similar to many millions of Americans, were given \nthe wrong impression because this bill does nothing of the sort.\n  Let me talk a minute also, if I may, about what this is going to mean \nand what sort of the future of health care is. The system does not work \nnow for the point I made a moment ago, which is that we as consumers \nare not involved in the equation. I can't think of anything else in our \nlife where we have so little knowledge of what we are buying, and we \nhave so little knowledge of what the cost is.\n  Do we know what the cost of these procedures are that we undertake? \nIf we have to get an MRI or a CAT scan or a stent put in our heart, do \nwe know what the market price for that is? We do not. The reason why is \nbecause the system has become so complex with a third-party payer. What \nthat means is either your insurance company pays or your government \npays through Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, and we as consumers do not \npay.\n  Because of that, we have broken what we know works in the \nmarketplace. You want to control costs, you have to put the consumer \nback in the driver's seat. That is why our proposal on this side of the \naisle to give consumers who cannot afford health insurance now a tax \ncredit to let them go in the marketplace and to shop around and get \ninvolved in their health care decisions, we know that would lower \ncosts. This plan is not going to lower costs. In fact, it is going to \nraise costs.\n  But let me tell you where we are going with this new government plan. \nI am an optimist about this country, so I hate to talk about something \nthat is pessimistic. But it is my responsibility to tell you facts. We \nhave three major\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\nhealth care programs in this country: Veterans, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  Medicare is health care for seniors. Medicaid is health care for the \npoor. I wish to talk about the latter two. Those systems are not \nworking, and they are increasingly not working for more and more \nAmericans. The reason why is, they are not properly funded. There is no \nway to control costs. So what are we finding? We are finding that \ndoctors are not taking Medicare and Medicaid anymore. If you want to \nknow what the future of Medicare is, which is health care for seniors, \ntake a look at Medicaid, which is in worse shape than Medicare.\n  We know both these programs are huge entitlement programs that, under \ntheir current form, we cannot afford. We know there is going to be this \nhuge debt that our children are going to have to pay. It may not be our \nchildren, it may be here in the next few years because we have not \nproperly funded these programs and we have not controlled costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. \nIt is from the March 17, 2010, Seattle Times, an article by Janet Tu, \nwhich is entitled: ``Walgreens: no new Medicaid patients as of April \n16.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, Mar. 17, 2010]\n\n           Walgreens: No New Medicaid Patients as of April 16\n\n                            (By Janet I. Tu)\n\n       Effective April 16, Walgreens drugstores across the state \n     won't take any new Medicaid patients, saying that filling \n     their prescriptions is a money-losing proposition--the latest \n     development in an ongoing dispute over Medicaid \n     reimbursement.\n       The company, which operates 121 stores in the state, will \n     continue filling Medicaid prescriptions for current patients.\n       In a news release, Walgreens said its decision to not take \n     new Medicaid patients stemmed from a ``continued reduction in \n     reimbursement'' under the state's Medicaid program, which \n     reimburses it at less than the break-even point for 95 \n     percent of brand-name medications dispensed to Medicaid \n     patents.\n       Walgreens follows Bartell Drugs, which stopped taking new \n     Medicaid patients last month at all 57 of its stores in \n     Washington, though it still fills Medicaid prescriptions for \n     existing customers at all but 15 of those stores.\n       Doug Porter, the state's director of Medicaid, said \n     Medicaid recipients should be able to readily find another \n     pharmacy because ``we have many more pharmacy providers in \n     our network than we need'' for the state's 1 million Medicaid \n     clients.\n       He said those who can't can contact the state's Medical \n     Assistance Customer Service Center at 1-800-562-3022 for help \n     in locating one.\n       Along with Walgreens and Bartell, the Ritzville Drug \n     Company in Adams County announced in November that it would \n     stop participating in Medicaid.\n       Fred Meyer and Safeway said their pharmacies would continue \n     to serve existing Medicaid patients and to take new ones, \n     though both expressed concern that the reimbursement rate is \n     too low for pharmacies to make a profit.\n       The amount private insurers and Medicaid pay pharmacies for \n     prescriptions isn't the actual cost of those drugs but rather \n     is based on what's called the drug's estimated average \n     wholesale price. But that figure is more like the sticker \n     price on a car than its actual wholesale cost.\n       Washington was reimbursing pharmacies 86 percent of a \n     drug's average wholesale price until July, when it began \n     paying them just 84 percent. While pharmacies weren't happy \n     about the reimbursement reduction, the Department of Social \n     and Health Services said that move was expected to save the \n     state about $10 million.\n       Then in September came another blow. The average wholesale \n     price is calculated by a private company, which was accused \n     in a Massachusetts lawsuit of fraudulently inflating its \n     figures. The company did not admit wrongdoing but agreed in a \n     court settlement to ratchet its figures down by about 4 \n     percent.\n       That agreement took effect in September--and prompted a \n     lawsuit by a group of pharmacies and trade associations that \n     said Washington state didn't follow federal law in setting \n     its reimbursement rate, and that that rate is too low. The \n     lawsuit is pending.\n       ``Washington state Medicaid is now reimbursing pharmacies \n     less than their cost of participation,'' said Jeff Rochon, \n     CEO of the Washington State Pharmacy Association.\n       Pharmacies that continue to fill Medicaid prescriptions at \n     the current state reimbursement rate are ``at risk of putting \n     themselves out of business altogether,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. So here we are. Walgreens, a major pharmacy in Seattle, \nis not going to take Medicaid anymore. Why are they not going to take \nMedicaid? They are not going to take Medicaid because the Federal \nGovernment is not reimbursing enough for them to make any money.\n  Medicaid is a Federal-State match. But more and more we are seeing \nthe health care providers will not take Medicaid. We know that in major \nmetropolitan areas, if you are a new Medicaid patient and you are \nlooking for a specialist, that 50 percent of the doctors will not see \nyou.\n  There is another article here that came out this week in the New York \nTimes, March 15, 2010. It is an article by Kevin Sack: ``With Medicaid \nCuts, Doctors and Patients Drop Out.''\n  It is a story from Flint, MI. It talks about a lady by the name of \nCarol Vliet, about her cancer. She has tumors metastasizing to her \nbrain, her liver, her kidneys, and her heart.\n  The President of the United States and my colleague on the other side \nof the aisle like to give individual examples about people who are \nsuffering without health insurance. Here is a lady who has Medicaid, a \ngovernment-run program. The only solace she has is she has found a \ndoctor she likes, Dr. Sahouri.\n  He has given her a regimen of chemotherapy and radiation for the past \n2 years that is giving her some relief, but she was devastated when she \nfound out from Dr. Sahouri a couple months ago that he could no longer \nsee her because, like a growing number of doctors, he had stopped \ntaking patients with Medicaid.\n  It is not just Medicaid; it is also now Medicare. We know that if you \nare trying to get into Medicare, only about 78 percent of providers are \ntaking Medicare. Here we are, we are about to create a huge new \ngovernment entitlement program to put 31 million more Americans into a \nhealth care system funded by the government. In the programs we have \nnow, doctors and health care providers are dropping the patients. These \nprograms are broken. Yet we are going to create a new one. We are going \nto create a new one by taking money out of Medicare, a program where \nthe health care providers are increasingly more and more not seeing \npatients. We are going to take more than $500 billion out of Medicare. \nIn fact, we have found out, from this new bill that came from the House \ntoday, that the number has gone up, that it is now more than $500 \nbillion that is going to be taken out of Medicare. We are going to take \nmoney out of a program already having problems to start a new one. It \nmakes no sense.\n  This is why the American people are extremely upset with this health \ncare proposal. There isn't a Senator who doesn't want health care \nreform. There isn't a Member of Congress today who doesn't want to \nprovide more access and lower the cost of health care insurance for \nthose who have it. But this plan does not do that, and it creates a \nhuge new entitlement program by robbing Peter to pay Paul. We are going \nto jeopardize health care for seniors and turn Medicare into Medicaid, \na program where pharmacies and doctors are dropping patients.\n  I am new to the Senate. My experience is in State government and \nbusiness. There are men and women of good will in this body. I believe \nif we could get together and work in a good faith fashion, we could \nfigure out how to do this in a step-by-step approach, to lower cost and \nincrease access without breaking the bank and putting a huge burden on \nthe children in a world where we already have a $12 trillion debt. But \nthe people of this Chamber and the one down the hall have to get about \nthe business of doing the people's work and remember they are the boss \nand that we work for them. The time for partisanship is over. The time \nfor getting things done and being problem solvers is here. I am one \nSenator--and I know there are many--who is willing to work with anyone \non the other side on any important issues facing the country who is \nwilling to work with me.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, in Washington there is a great deal of \ntalk about what health care reform will mean for various segments of \nthe population. In particular, many of us spend a lot of time talking \nabout 47 million Americans who do not currently have health insurance \nand how they stand to benefit from our reform bill. This debate has \ncentered on these folks, especially the 31 million people who will gain \naccess to coverage under our proposal. In my opinion, this alone should \nbe reason enough to pass health care reform. Expanding access to \ncoverage will improve relative health outcomes and save money across \nthe board. It will shift our focus from sick care to preventive care \nand will reduce wait time in emergency rooms. This will have a profound \neffect on the lives of millions, and it speaks to the profound need for \ncomprehensive health care reform. But that is only a part of the story.\n  Many of my friends in this Chamber and many people across the country \nrecognize the need to expand health coverage. But they are also worried \nabout the effects that health reform will have on their insurance. \nMiddle-class Americans hear all this talk about helping people with no \ninsurance at all and they say: That is great, but I need help too. My \npremiums are going up, and benefits are disappearing. I am worried that \nI don't have stable coverage, or that I won't have access to care when \nI need it. How will reform help me?\n  I think it is time to take a deeper look at these folks. It is time \nto provide some answers to their questions. It is time to explain how \nour proposal would affect their lives. I wish to talk about what our \nreform bill will mean for the middle class and especially the minority \ncommunity that have felt the worst effect of our economic crisis.\n  As I address this Chamber today, there are 88 million people who lack \nstable health coverage. That is almost a third of the total population \nwho live in fear that their coverage would vanish at any time. \nUnfortunately, those fears reflect a harsh reality that it is \nimpossible for middle-class families to ignore. In Illinois alone, \nthere are some 612,000 people who have nongroup insurance. These folks \nwill see their premiums go up by as much as 60 percent this year. I am \nsure my colleagues can agree, that is outrageous.\n  But it doesn't have to be this way. If we pass a final health care \nbill and send it to President Obama, middle-class America will start to \nsee the benefits almost immediately. Our legislation would bring \nunprecedented stability to the market. No one would have to fear that \ntheir insurance providers would drop their coverage. No one could be \ndenied care because of a preexisting condition. Our bill will give the \nAmerican people more power and more choices. It will bring real \ncompetition to the insurance market. It will create significant cost \nsavings, and it will restore accountability in the insurance industry.\n  For the average American, this means saving hundreds or even \nthousands of dollars a year. It means more time with family doctors and \nless paperwork and redtape. It means free preventive care and \ndiscounted premiums for those who stay in shape, quit smoking, and \ncontrol their weight. It means no one can be denied coverage because of \na preexisting condition, and no one will be forced to pay higher \npremiums because they get sick. If we pass a final health care bill, \n1.8 million people in Illinois will be able to get coverage for the \nvery first time. The 612,000 people in the nongroup market will have an \noption to buy affordable coverage on the insurance exchange. This will \nreduce their premiums and improve the quality of their coverage almost \novernight.\n  But it doesn't stop there. One million additional Illinoisans could \nqualify for tax credits that could make it easier to afford insurance \nand perhaps, most importantly, 144,000 small businesses would benefit \nfrom a tax credit designed to make coverage more affordable. This \nstrikes at the heart of the debate we have been having in recent weeks, \nespecially as it relates to the middle class.\n  My friends across the aisle are trying to stop us from passing \nreform. They want us to focus on job creation instead. But what they \nfail to realize is that these two problems go hand in hand. We can't \nsolve one problem without addressing the other. If we make health \ninsurance more affordable, American companies and especially small \nbusinesses will be able to hire more workers. They will be able to \nafford full coverage for their employees, and there will no longer be \nany incentives to lay off older workers or to save on premiums. This \nwill make a profound difference in the lives of ordinary folks in my \nhome State and across the country.\n  About 75 percent of Illinois businesses are small businesses. Under \nthe current system, only 41 percent of them have been able to offer \nhealth benefits. But if we pass comprehensive reform--if we will extend \na tax credit to 144,000 Illinois small businesses and millions of \nbusinesses nationwide--it will reduce the burden on working families. \nIt will help businesses recover from the recession, and even start to \nexpand again. It will help create jobs.\n\n  That is what our health care reform bill will mean for middle-class \nAmericans: stability, security, better coverage; freedom to shop around \nand find a good price; competition in the market; renewed \naccountability. That is what health care reform will do for millions of \nordinary folks across the country.\n  For minority communities, these effects will be even more pronounced. \nIn Illinois, more than 21 percent of minorities do not have health \ninsurance, compared with 12 percent of Whites. This places them at a \ngreater risk for problems down the road--problems ranging from higher \ninfant mortality to increased rates of chronic diseases in later life. \nCombine these risks with a higher property rate, and you have a recipe \nfor disaster.\n  But our bill will help to change all of this. It will change that. \nOur bill will expand coverage, invest in preventive care, and help spur \njob creation. It will have a dramatic effect on the hard-hit \ncommunities and minority areas that need the help the most.\n  So on behalf of middle-class Americans and minority individuals and \nsmall businesses, on behalf of millions of ordinary folks in Illinois \nand across the country, I call upon my colleagues to pass this bill \nwithout further delay.\n  Our reform proposals will ensure that everyone is part of the \nsolution to America's health care crisis. So let's seize this \nopportunity. Let's move forward together. Let's extend the benefits of \nhealth reform to the middle class. That way, America can move forward \nin this 21st century.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and to be followed by Senators Casey and Kaufman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         START Follow-On Treaty\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about arms \ncontrol and the President's negotiations with Russia over a replacement \nto the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START. This new treaty will \nbe an important enhancement to American national security, and I look \nforward to considering it on the Senate floor once it has been signed.\n  As you may recall, the original START treaty was ratified by the \nSenate in 1992 by a bipartisan vote of 93 to 6. It went into force in \nlate 1994, with a predetermined life of 15 years, causing it to expire \nthis past December.\n  Soon after taking office, the Obama administration began careful and \ndiligent work to negotiate a successor treaty with Russia. As START was \nexpiring in early December, President Obama and President Medvedev of \nRussia issued a joint statement making clear that our two countries \nwould effectively abide by the expiring treaty until the new one comes \ninto force.\n  I think we can all agree that the original START was a landmark \nachievement. It brought about historic reductions in nuclear weapons. \nIts verification measures and the communication between the United \nStates and Russia that they fostered served to build confidence between \nthe two countries at an uncertain moment. It helped our nations to move \ntoward a post-Cold-War mentality, providing strategic stability between \nthe world's two greatest nuclear powers.\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\n  I am confident the successor to START will be equally historic. The \nworld has changed, and this will be a new treaty for a new world with a \nnew set of nuclear challenges. But the bottom line for the new treaty \nremains the same as it was for the original START: The treaty must--and \nit will--advance our national security interests.\n  When the new treaty is signed and presented to the Senate, there will \nbe plenty of opportunity to discuss and debate in detail the specific \nnumerical limitations on strategic offensive arms. President Obama and \nPresident Medvedev determined these would be in the range of 500 to \n1,100 for strategic delivery vehicles, and in the range of 1,500 to \n1,675 for their associated warheads. Likewise, we will carefully \nexamine the counting rules for those limitations, the monitoring and \nverification measures for implementing the agreement, and all its other \nprovisions.\n  I look forward to discussing all these specific matters when the \nSenate fulfills our responsibility to offer our advice and, as \nappropriate, our consent. But the core reasons this treaty will make us \nsafer are already clear.\n  The verifiable reduction of nuclear weapons by the United States and \nRussia will provide us with strategic stability and mutual confidence. \nIn other words, it ensures transparency and predictability between the \ntwo countries that possess 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.\n  The new treaty will do this while streamlining the elaborate and, in \nsome cases, outdated and unnecessarily burdensome verification measures \nfrom the original treaty. The new treaty will also reduce the risk of \nnuclear theft or loss from our countries, and we know just how \nimportant this last point is in a world where terrorist groups would \ngive anything to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n  This new treaty will also allow us to lead by example in arms \nreduction, and this will in turn greatly aid our vital nonproliferation \nefforts. Indeed, while the arms reductions in the treaty will be \nrelatively modest, entering into the treaty will be a significant step \nin the renewal of our arms control and nonproliferation agenda for the \n21st century. It will put us on firmer ground as we confront the \ndangers of nuclear weapons in this new world.\n  I want to dwell briefly on this last point. The centerpiece of the \nglobal nonproliferation framework is aptly named the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. This treaty requires that states without nuclear weapons pledge \nnot to acquire them. But it also imposes a responsibility on nuclear \nstates which must pursue reductions in weapons.\n  When we fulfill that responsibility, it strengthens the global \nnonproliferation framework that centers on the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. It strengthens our hand in dealing with nonnuclear states, \nwhether they are allies pursuing civilian nuclear power or adversaries \nwith unclear nuclear intentions.\n  The point is not that untrustworthy adversaries will suddenly be \ntransparent about their intentions or fulfill their obligations under \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty. Rather, we can negotiate with and \npressure adversaries more effectively when we are meeting our own \nresponsibilities. Likewise, we can work more effectively with our \nfriends--and rely on them for multilateral support--when we ourselves \nlead by example. In other words, arms control agreements like the new \nSTART follow-on treaty are themselves powerful tools in our \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  The START follow-on treaty is only one element of President Obama's \nambitious nonproliferation and arms control agenda to reduce and \nultimately eliminate the threat from nuclear weapons. But until we are \nable to realize this end goal, it remains important to maintain an \neffective deterrent. This treaty will in no way--in no way--take away \nthat deterrent.\n  Likewise, it is critical for us to support the administration's \nincreased budget request for ensuring the safety and reliability of the \nnuclear stockpile and the complex and experts who maintain it. Such a \ncommitment to a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal goes hand in hand \nwith minimizing the danger from nuclear weapons through arms control \nand nonproliferation. We must pursue the limitation of nuclear weapons \nwhile maintaining an effective deterrent. And that is just what the \nSTART follow-on treaty will do. It will make us safer without \njeopardizing our effective deterrent.\n  I look forward to a robust discussion and ultimately, I hope, to \nbipartisan consent to the resolution of ratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, I thank our colleague, Senator Franken, for his remarks \non this issue. I am going to be speaking just for a few moments as in \nmorning business. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am grateful to be joined by Senator \nKaufman after me.\n  Almost two decades after the end of the Cold War, the United States \nand Russia maintain more than 90 percent--90 percent--of the world's \ntotal stockpile of 23,000 nuclear weapons. Each of these weapons has \nthe capacity to destroy a city, and a large-scale nuclear exchange \ncould extinguish most life on this planet. As you are aware, massive \nnumbers of nuclear weapons increase the risk of catastrophic accidents, \nerrors, or unauthorized use.\n  There is a serious imperative in the United States to address this \nissue. The United States--and especially this administration--has \nrightly focused on nuclear nonproliferation as a top priority. In his \nPrague speech, the President of the United States, President Obama, \nsaid:\n\n       As long as these weapons exist, the United States will \n     maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any \n     adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies. But we \n     will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.\n\n  So I think it is important to note that the President used a number \nof important words there: ``safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter \nany adversary.'' But he also said we have responsibilities.\n  The first test of that commitment is the new START agreement.\n  In October, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said:\n\n       [T]he United States is interested in a new START agreement \n     because it will bolster our national security. We and Russia \n     deploy far more nuclear weapons than we need or could ever \n     potentially use without destroying our ways of life. We can \n     reduce our stockpiles of nuclear weapons without posing any \n     risk to our homeland, our deployed troops or our allies. \n     Clinging to nuclear weapons in excess of our security needs \n     does not make the United States safer. And the nuclear status \n     quo is neither desirable nor sustainable. It gives other \n     countries the motivation or the excuse to pursue their own \n     nuclear options.\n\n  So said the Secretary of State.\n  As we know, Secretary Clinton is in Moscow now, and we all hope we \nwill be able to make progress on the START follow-on treaty during her \nvisit. We want to thank and commend her for the work she is doing not \nonly as Secretary of State every day but at this time especially in \nMoscow.\n  The START follow-on treaty would reduce deployed nuclear weapons in \nthe United States and Russia and would provide crucial verification \nmeasures that would allow a window into the Russian nuclear program. \nWhile this treaty has taken a little longer than expected to complete, \nI applaud the leadership of Assistant Secretary for Verification, \nCompliance and Implementation, Rose Gottemoeller, and her efforts to \npursue a strong agreement as opposed to an immediate agreement.\n  A new START agreement is in our national security interests, \nespecially in terms of maintaining verification and transparency \nmeasures. Once complete, this agreement could help to strengthen the \nU.S.-Russian relationship and potentially increase the possibility of \nRussian cooperation on an array of thorny and grave international \nissues, including North Korea and Iran.\n  The START follow-on treaty is a clear demonstration that the United \nStates is upholding our nonproliferation obligations under the \nNPT. START is a necessary step in reaffirming U.S. leadership on \nnonproliferation issues. Without a clear commitment to our \nnonproliferation responsibilities through a new START agreement, it \nwill be increasingly difficult for the United States to secure \ninternational support in addressing the urgent security threats posed \nby the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n  International agreements to limit nuclear weapons draw upon a deep \nwell of bipartisan support over the years. There is no reason--no \nreason at all--why this START agreement should be different. We may \nhave our differences on elements of the treaty when it is presented \nbefore the Senate for ratification, but I hope--and I believe this will \nhappen--we will be able to come together in common cause in recognition \nthat these agreements are in our national security interests because \nthey ultimately decrease the likelihood--decrease the likelihood--of \naccidental launch and decrease the likelihood of terrorist access to \nnuclear materials. There will be deliberation and there will be debate, \nbut I am confident that at the end of the process, we will have a \nstrong agreement that in the proud tradition of the Senate will garner \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am truly pleased to join with my \nfriends, Senator Casey and Senator Franken, today to underscore the \nimportance of reducing our nuclear arms.\n  I have spoken in the past about the importance of signing a successor \ntreaty to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, in order to \nmaintain verification and other confidence-building measures. I have \nalso spoken in support of the President's fiscal year 2011 spending \npriorities, which include a program to modernize and secure our nuclear \narsenal. Today, I wish to go back to the basics when talking about arms \nreduction because it is easy to get lost in the details and \nmisconceptions and forget the big picture.\n  First, we must remember what is at stake when it comes to our nuclear \narms reduction policy. We cannot afford to lose sight of why it is so \nimportant to get a successor to START, why it must be the right \nsuccessor, and why the Senate should take action on the treaty in the \nvery near future.\n  This treaty was signed by the Soviet Union at a time when we still \nhad fallout shelters to prepare for nuclear war. Almost two decades \nlater, a nuclear attack is more likely to originate from rogue regimes \nor nonstate actors, but it is still critical that we not take our eye \noff the ball when it comes to existing nuclear stockpiles.\n  American and Russian nuclear weapons alone account for almost 96 \npercent of the world's nuclear arsenal, and stockpile reduction remains \na significant challenge in easing residual tensions of the Cold War. \nThe accumulation of nuclear serves as a reminder of the animosity that \nexisted between our countries, much of which has now been relegated, \nthankfully, to the pages of history. Our nuclear stockpiles reflect the \nrealities of the past, not the economic and security considerations of \nthe present and the future.\n  START is also symbolically significant because it serves as a \ncornerstone of the world's nonproliferation efforts and sets tough \ninternational standards. With no arms reduction treaty between the \nUnited States and Russia, we hand cynics an opportunity around the \nglobe a pretext for derailing nonproliferation efforts.\n  Now that START has expired, we need a follow-on treaty because \nsecurity efforts have changed since the Cold War. This is why we must \nensure that we end up with the right treaty, not just one that renews \nnow-outdated provisions of START. It is important that a new treaty \nboth adapts to the needs of the world today and presents a clear vision \nfor a more secure future.\n  It is expected that Americans and Russians have different ideas of \nthis vision and how we can get there. Both countries have domestic and \npolitical considerations which must also complicate matters. Throughout \nthis process, I have been thoroughly impressed with Ambassador Rose \nGottemoeller and her negotiating team, who have consistently maintained \ntheir focus and core principles.\n  The Obama administration wants the right treaty, not just any treaty, \nand future generations will likely benefit from its steadfast \ndedication and resolve.\n  Finally, we must consider the parameters of the treaty we hope to \nachieve. By definition, a lasting treaty cannot be drawn unilaterally, \nso it must be something mutually acceptable to both the United States \nand Russia. At the same time, there are some important red lines which \nmust be reflected in the final treaty from the perspective of the \nUnited States:\n  First, it must have an intrusive verification system in order to \nmaintain confidence and avoid catastrophic misunderstandings between \nthe two sides.\n  Second, it must reduce ready-to-go strategic arsenals in a meaningful \nway, which means addressing upload capability.\n  Third, it must allow modernization of our existing nuclear \ncapabilities to enhance national and international security.\n  Fourth, it must remain a strategic offensive treaty with an \nintentionally narrow scope. We should not include any other weapons \nsystems, including antiballistic missile systems, under its regulatory \numbrella.\n  The Senate should take action on a START follow-on treaty as soon as \npossible in order to keep Americans safe and protect global security. \nFor anyone who has doubts, rest assured that the President and his \nnegotiating team are working hard to finalize a treaty that first and \nforemost must advance U.S. security interests.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue because \nthe responsible reduction of the nuclear stockpile is one of the most \nimportant measures we can take to improve global security for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering George Panichas\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very honored to have the chance \nto join my distinguished senior Senator Jack Reed on the floor of the \nSenate today to pay our respects to a friend of both of ours who has \ndeparted us. I will say a few words about our friend George Panichas \nmyself and then my senior Senator will say a few words in conclusion.\n  It is a great honor for me to be here with Senator Reed. One of the \nbonds we have is our friendship with the Honorable George Panichas.\n  On March 2, in our Ocean State, the day of George Panichas's funeral, \nthe flags across the State were at half mast in his honor. While \nGeorge's family and friends are still in mourning, we wish to take this \nopportunity to share some of our memories in celebration of the life of \na man who was one of Rhode Island's legends.\n  Representative George Panichas was many things: a husband, a father, \na grandfather, a veteran, a public servant, an advocate, a loyal and \nactive member of Rhode Island's Greek community, a successful \nbusinessman and, to so many of us, a trusted friend. Although George \nwas small in physical stature, he will always be remembered as big, \nbig, big in personality, heart, influence, and accomplishments.\n  Born in the city of Pawtucket, Representative Panichas was a lifelong \nresident of the great State of Rhode Island and a member of our \ncountry's ``greatest generation.'' A decorated Air Force veteran of \nWorld War II, George served as a tail gunner in the U.S. Air Force, \ncompleting 50 missions over enemy-occupied Europe at a time when not \nmany men survived 50 missions. He received the Air Medal with four oak \nleaf clusters, three battle stars for service in the European theater, \nthe Presidential Unit Citation with oak leaf cluster, and a personal \ncitation from the commanding general of the 15th Air Force.\n  Representative Panichas was elected to the Rhode Island General \nAssembly representing a district in Pawtucket in 1970. He served until \nhe retired in 1984. He was the first Greek American to hold State \noffice in our State. Throughout Representative Panichas's tenure, he \nwas known for speaking up with his powerful voice and for his influence \nin getting the job done.\n  This Chamber still remembers John O. Pastore, another distinguished\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nRhode Island public servant, small in stature, large in voice and \ninfluence. George Panichas was very much in his mold.\n  Representative Panichas was a tireless advocate for Rhode Island's \nveterans. Thanks to him, today we have a beautiful Rhode Island \nVeterans Memorial Cemetery. Thousands of people visit the cemetery \nevery year and witness firsthand George Panichas's work. He was \nresponsible for its expansion and many of the improvements that \nhappened on its grounds. The brave Rhode Islanders and their families \nwho served our country so honorably will always have a special \nbeautiful place to be remembered, due in large part to the work of this \nman.\n  Perhaps above anything else, Representative Panichas was widely known \nfor his dedication to his beloved Greek heritage. Many years I have \nattended the Pawtucket Greek Festival with him, held at the Greek \nOrthodox Church of the Assumption. I will always remember how he knew \nvirtually everybody in attendance and the affection and respect the \nentire community showed for him.\n  At his funeral, I returned to the Church of the Assumption for his \nwake, and I heard so many stories there from his family, friends, and \ncolleagues of his unique character, his kindness, and his bold \nleadership.\n  It is with heavy hearts that we remember one of Rhode Island's \nlegends today. But Representative Panichas's spirit will live on \nthrough his accomplishments and through his beloved family. I extend my \ndeepest condolences to his loving wife Angela, to his two daughters, of \nwhom he was so proud--Denise and Joan--to his loving and beloved son \nGeorge, Jr., and the apple of his eye, his grandson George III, and, of \ncourse, the rest of the Panichas family. George was truly one of a \nkind, and he will be missed.\n  George Panichas once quoted the great Greek philosopher Aristotle in \nsaying: You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is \nthe greatest quality of the mind next to honor.\n  Today we recall with respect and affection a man whose courage will \nlong live in our hearts.\n  I yield the floor for my distinguished senior colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend Senator \nWhitehouse in paying tribute to an extraordinary American, an \nextraordinary Rhode Islander, George Panichas. Senator Whitehouse, with \neloquence and obviously great feeling that I share with him, recognized \nthis extraordinary individual. He has been a friend and a mentor to \nboth of us. He has been a force throughout his life for not only what \nwe believe is central to America--opportunity for all, a sense of \nfairness and justice and decency--but he also has been intimately \ninvolved in his native land, Greece and Cyprus.\n  He is someone who represents the ideal of what an American should be. \nAs a young man, he was a member of, at that time, the U.S. Army Air \nCorps. He flew 50 missions. He was a gunner on the aircraft. I think \nall of us recognize--although we did not participate in such \nchallenging assignments--the kind of courage and mental toughness it \ntakes to get in that aircraft and risk your life 50 times at least and \nto do so in an atmosphere of tension and danger. And George did it.\n  Like so many of his generation, when he came home, he did not boast \nabout it. He decided, though, that his service was not going to end \nwith his discharge from the U.S. Army Air Corps. He was going to \ncontinue to serve this Nation because he had participated with his \ncolleagues, his contemporaries, in a noble effort. He understood the \ndecency of America. He was part of it, and he understood the great \nchallenges ahead--challenges to build a fair, just, and more equal \nsociety. He took it upon himself to do that in many ways.\n  He was a successful businessman. That was just one aspect of his \ncontribution to the community. He was, as my colleague said, a State \nrepresentative in our house of representatives. He was the first Greek \nAmerican elected to the State house in Rhode Island. He was a staunch \nadvocate for veterans. He was the leader of an effort that started many \nyears ago in the sixties and seventies to build a State veterans \ncemetery in Rhode Island and to continue to maintain the highest \nquality at our State's veterans home. In fact, those two institutions, \nparticularly the cemetery, are monuments to his efforts.\n  He undertook this great effort at a time when there was a lot of \ndiscussion about the service of veterans, but no one was standing up \nand doing what George was doing--cajoling and persuading and convincing \nand using all manner of his charming temperament and his booming voice \nto start to assemble the resources in Rhode Island, and then \nnationally, to build what I feel--and I am sure I am speaking for my \ncolleague--is the finest State veterans cemetery in the country. It is \na place of reverence. It is a place of inspiration. It is a place the \nfamilies of Rhode Island veterans feel is appropriate as a resting \nplace of those who served this Nation.\n  In October of 2008, in recognition of his great dedication and \nservice, the administration building at the cemetery was named after \nGeorge--a fitting tribute.\n  In addition to being an active patriot of his country, our country, \nthe United States of America, he never lost sight of the need to be a \npowerful force in Greek-American relations. His constant efforts to \nassist, both in terms of business enterprises in Greece and in terms of \ncharitable organizations in Greece, and his continued work to pull \ntogether the bonds between Greece and the United States were \nremarkable. He was someone who was keenly interested and very effective \nin advocating a wise American policy toward Greece and Cyprus and to \nthe Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n  He was an extraordinary individual, and he will be missed. In all his \nendeavors, he had the support, the love, and derived strength from his \nwife Angela, who was a wonderful woman. And of course his daughters, \nDenise and Joan, have continued the tradition of service in making the \ncommunity a better place, and his son George, Jr., has a proud name and \nhe carries it proudly. Of course, his grandchildren are remarkable too.\n  I think the only way to end these few words for a great gentleman is \nto recall the words of another Greek--Thucydides--who said:\n\n       The bravest of the brave are those who see both the glory \n     and the danger and go forth to meet it.\n\n  George Panichas did that as an airman, as a citizen, as an American \nwho used his opportunity to help others.\n  Mr. President, we miss this great gentleman, and we are so honored to \nbe able to say a few words about him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude to the majority leader for finally bringing this \nessential legislation to the floor after more than 3 years of \nextensions and delays.\n  This bipartisan bill is the product of years of diligence, patience, \nand an overriding commitment to safety. From the tremendous steps \nforward in implementing the critical Next Generation Air Traffic \nControl System to the thousands of jobs created by the funding for \ninfrastructure improvements and innovation incentives, this legislation \nrevolves, first and foremost, around enhancing the safety of our skies.\n  This bill addresses glaring gaps in safety brought to light by the \nheart-breaking tragedy of what should have been a routine flight for 49 \npeople on February 12, 2009, and instead became, according to the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, the worst aviation accident \nsince 2001.\n  The stunning cockpit voice recordings released by the NTSB during \ntheir investigation of the Continental Connection flight 3407 accident \noutside of Buffalo, NY, chilled Americans across the country. On behalf \nof the families who lost loved ones in that accident, and who \ncourageously testified at a series of hearings called by Senators \nDorgan and DeMint on the safety of regional air carriers, Senator Boxer \nand I introduced the One Level of Safety Act. Incorporated into the \nlarger FAA reauthorization bill before us, our legislation seeks to \nfinally fulfill the decade-old promise of One Level of Safety, which \nthe Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, regrettably viewed as little \nmore than a slogan for the past several years. Working closely with the\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\ndevastated families left behind by the tragic crash of flight 3407, and \nthe NTSB, we have addressed a number of glaring deficiencies in our \naviation system which threatened the safety of passengers across the \ncountry.\n  In response to questions I and others posed before the Commerce \nCommittee, NTSB chairwoman Debbie Hersman vowed to have the flight 3407 \ninvestigation completed within a year. To her credit, she lived up to \nher promise. In fact, with 1 year as chair now under her belt, she has \nperformed admirably. And the work of the Board brought to light \ncritical information necessary to address the gaps in our safety \nregime, gaps that contributed to the flight 3407 accident.\n  For example, one of the primary causes of the Continental Connection \ncrash, according to the NTSB's preliminary report released in January, \nwas the lack of rest for the pilots. One airline claims that more than \na quarter of its pilots commute 1,000 miles just to get to work! And \nthe safety implications of pilot fatigue are not a new concern. In \nfact, as you can see on this chart, fatigue has been at the top of the \nNTSB's Most Wanted list of safety improvements since the list's \ninception in 1990, left unaddressed now for over 20 years! Today it \nlanguishes on that same list, the NTSB noting hat it has received an \n``unacceptable response'' from the FAA. Yet the NTSB has indicated that \nfatigue is the primary cause of over 250 accident deaths over the past \n15 years.\n  Indeed, when the FAA last considered modernizing these fatigue rules \nin 1995, after receiving resistance from the airlines, the agency \nsimply chose to shelve the proposed changes rather than address \nobsolete fatigue rules more than a half-century old. We cannot allow \nthis to continue, which is why we require the FAA to develop \nregulations that would limit the number of hours permitted for pilots \nto fly in a 24 hour period, to assist in alleviating pilot fatigue \nproblems, as well as to provide guidance to air carriers to develop, \nand submit to the FAA, fatigue management plans. The bill mandates the \ncompletion--within a year of enactment--of an ongoing FAA rulemaking \naddressing fatigue, an effort undertaken recently by Administrator \nBabbitt.\n  For too long, the FAA has been a reactionary body, acting only after \na tragedy, rather than analyzing trends and data to enable the agency \nto foresee future accidents. So, to address this issue, Senator Boxer \nand I added a level of accountability to the FAA's safety programs to \nencourage proactive oversight. Specifically, this legislation requires \nunannounced, on-the-ground annual inspections of flight training \nschools and airlines, ensuring all safety standards included in this \nlegislation will be enforced.\n  Another element of our legislation, specifically cited by the NTSB \nand recently added to their ``Most Wanted'' List of aviation safety \nthreats, as you can see on this chart, addresses the ability of air \ncarriers to view a potential pilot's entire flying history. Incredibly, \nthis information is currently unavailable to an airline--unless they \nfile a Freedom of Information Act request! And that is simply \nunacceptable. The pilot operating the Continental Connection flight \n3407 at the time of the accident had previously failed five flight \ntests, or ``checks''. But the air carrier claimed it was unaware of \nthese failures, because the pilot did not disclose them on his \napplication. To reverse this unfathomable rule once and for all, this \nbill gives airlines access to a pilot's complete history to ensure they \nare hiring qualified, well-trained, and talented pilots.\n  Another measure, which I am particularly pleased to have included in \nthe Reauthorization is the landmark Passenger Bill of Rights \nlegislation on which Senator Boxer and I worked so diligently as far \nback as the spring of 2007. The fact is Congress has waited far too \nlong to move on this essential safety measure. New York State, one of \nmany states frustrated by the delays in improving passenger safety here \nin Washington, sought to impose its own passenger rights standard, but \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit struck down their \neffort, placing the onus squarely on Congress. Specifically, the \nCircuit's decision stated that only the Federal Government may \nimplement a national standard for passenger safety, and I commend the \nCommerce Committee for responding by including the Passengers' Bill of \nRights.\n  We all have heard the horror stories, many detailed before the \nseveral hearings held in the Senate Commerce Committee on this topic--\npeople trapped on aircraft for nearly 12 hours, left in the dark by the \nairlines, uncertain when or if they would ever be permitted to deplane; \noverflowing restrooms; diabetics unable to access their insulin and at \nrisk of going into shock. This was the case in Austin, TX, just prior \nto New Year's Eve in 2006, when an aircraft remained on the tarmac for \nnearly 9 hours, with no communication from the airline and passengers \nready to revolt. Such incredible stories were on the verge of becoming \ncommonplace during the explosive growth of air travel during the mid-\n2000s. In fact, just last year there were 904 flights that remained \nunmoving on the tarmac for 3 hours or more.\n\n  More than 10 years since the first attempt to put in place \nprotections for passengers, they can now be assured that they no longer \nwill become prisoners in the event of a lengthy delay, nor will their \nsafety be compromised to meet an airline's bottom line. Guaranteeing \nbasic necessities like food, water, and functioning restrooms for \npassengers left on a grounded aircraft for hours at a time, while \nproviding them a choice to safely deplane after remaining stranded on \nthe tarmac for more than 3 hours, is a tremendous leap forward for the \nmillions of passengers who travel our skies every year. And I say it is \nabout time.\n  Moreover, a key component of this bill ends the often ``cozy'' \nrelationship between airlines and their FAA maintenance inspectors that \nthreatens to undermine aircraft safety. Senator Klobuchar and I \noriginally developed this legislation to prevent FAA inspectors from \nturning a blind eye to safety violations at various airlines. First \nbrought to light by a report issued by Department of Transportation \ninspector general Calvin Scovel in 2008, those failings were confirmed \njust last month, when a follow-up report issued by the IG's office \nrevealed that despite the previous report, the ``. . . FAA had failed \nto take appropriate action . . .'' to address airlines ``. . . \nlongstanding failure to comply with required maintenance inspection \nprocedures . . .''\n  In recent years, the FAA experienced a culture shift away from a \nsafety-first mentality. In fact, the charter of the FAA was amended in \n2003 to include the promotion of air carriers in their mission \nstatement. How is it that a government agency can simultaneously \npromote and regulate an entire industry? This bill struck the dueling \nnature of such a mission statement, reducing the significance of \nadvocating for the airlines and returning safety to its rightfully \npreeminent position at the agency. At the same time, we put into place \na Whistleblower's Office to protect individuals who reveal violations \nwithin the FAA from retribution.\n  Why is this necessary? Too often in recent years, Congress has heard \nfrom courageous whistleblowers like Doug Peters, who had his job and \nfamily threatened in 2008 for reporting numerous safety violations at \nSouthwest, the same violations detailed in the 2008 inspector general's \nreport. Rather than being rewarded for their dedication, these \nindividuals were either summarily removed from their jobs or \nstrategically relocated to place them ``out of the way.'' Thanks to \nthis legislation, they will have advocates and legal recourse within \nthe Department at the Whistleblowers Office.\n  The reauthorization also slams shut the revolving door between \ninspectors and airlines. The inspector general's 2008 and 2010 reports \nconcluded that inspectors responsible for requiring compliance with \nfederal standards by an individual air carrier were transitioning \nbetween the FAA and those particular airlines and back again, \nestablishing relationships that led to the undermining of safety \nrequirements issued by the FAA. Our bill requires an inspector \nmust experience a ``cooling-off'' period of 2 full years before he or \nshe can gain employment with the air carrier they once inspected.\n\n  At the same time, an additional, critical issue for both Maine and \nthe Nation is rural aviation. As a tool for economic development, \naccess to commercial aviation is absolutely essential. To that end, \nSenator Bingaman and I were\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\npleased to see the inclusion of the Rural Aviation Improvement Act, \nwhich overhauls the Essential Air Service, EAS, and small community air \nservice grant programs, to continue the commitment Congress made to \nsmall communities when we deregulated the aviation industry in 1978--\nensuring those communities hurt by deregulation, particularly less \npopulated areas, would continue to receive commercial air service.\n  The fact is, since deregulation, communities across the country have \nexperienced a decline in flights and size of aircraft while seeing an \nincrease in fares. More than 300 have lost air service altogether. Our \nbill raises funding for the program from $127 to $175 million annually, \nconsistent with the President's budget request for the program.\n  A handful of ``bad actors'' have jeopardized commercial aviation for \nentire regions, most of them rural, by submitting low-ball contracts to \nthe Department of Transportation to ensure they receive the EAS \nsubsidy, and once they have, reneging on their commitment to the extent \nand quality of their service. Our bill will not only establish a system \nof minimum requirements for all EAS contracts to protect municipalities \nthat rely on the program for commercial service, but it will also \nextend those contracts to 4 years from the current 2. This gives a \nheightened degree of certainty, so that rather than having communities \nnegotiating new contracts or receiving service from entirely new \ncarriers every 18 months, those municipalities participating in the \nprogram can plan for infrastructure improvements or other means to \nexpand service. Actively encouraging communities to get involved in the \nprocess, and build relationships with the carriers who serve them, can \nonly bolster the quality of the program.\n  The reauthorization provides states and communities the ability to \ntake a more active role in the level of service they receive by \nallowing them a ``buy-in'' option. This would allow states or local \ncommunities to leverage the EAS subsidy to develop incentives that \nwould attract additional flights from an existing carrier, or bring in \nnew carriers who offer a larger array of destinations.\n  In short, I believe this an outstanding, bipartisan bill that has \nrequired long hours--over 3 years--and considerable effort to complete. \nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for adding \nso many of these improvements to the underlying legislation, commend \nthe Commerce and Finance Committees for their relentless work, and urge \nall my colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \namendment that I introduced yesterday that addresses the issue of \ntoxins entering the ventilation systems on commercial aircraft.\n  This amendment is designed to ensure the FAA has the necessary \ninformation to protect the American public from exposure to harmful \ncontaminants while flying.\n  Specifically, here is what the amendment would do:\n  First, it would require FAA to complete a study of cabin air quality \nwithin 1 year; second, the amendment would provide FAA with the \nauthority to mandate that airlines allow air quality monitoring on \ntheir aircraft for the purposes of the study; and third, the amendment \nwould authorize FAA to mandate installation of sensors and air filters \nif the study demonstrates that these steps would provide a public \nhealth benefit.\n  This amendment is necessary because the air in the passenger cabin is \na mixture of recirculated cabin air and fresh air that is compressed in \nthe airplane engines.\n  Sometimes the air you breathe on an airplane gets contaminated with \nengine oils or hydraulic fluids that are heated to very high \ntemperatures, often appearing as a smelly haze or smoke.\n  That haze or smoke that enters the cabin air is a toxic soup and can \ncontain carbon monoxide gas as well as chemicals that can damage your \nnervous system called tricresylphosphates, TCPs.\n  Exposure to TCPs can initially cause stomach ache and muscle \nweakness, followed by delayed memory loss, tremors, confusion, and many \nother symptoms.\n  Exposure to this and other air toxics in cabin air is a serious \nmatter.\n  In 2004, the FAA concluded that the problem was so ``unsafe'' that it \nneeded to do thorough inspections of certain aircraft.\n  In a Federal Register notice, FAA called for ``repetitive detailed \ninspections of the inside of each air conditioning . . . duct,'' which \nFAA stated was ``necessary to prevent impairment of the operational \nskills and abilities of the flight crew caused by the inhalation of \nagents released from oil or oil breakdown products, which could result \nin reduced controllability of the airplane.''\n  Let me take moment to explain how these broad findings impact people \nwho happen to be exposed to toxic air in aircraft cabins.\n  Terry Williams is a mother of two and a former flight attendant, who \nknows firsthand the dangers associated with exposure to toxic fumes \nwhile onboard an airplane.\n  As Terry was working on April 11, 2007, she noticed a ``misty haze \ntype of smoke'' on the plane as it taxied toward its gate. Since then, \nshe has experienced chronic migraines and twitching.\n  Terry made repeated visits to the emergency room before a neurologist \ntold her she had been the victim of toxic exposure.\n  Terry is not alone.\n  Although several flight attendants and passengers have related \nsimilar stories to the FAA of smelling chemicals and then experiencing \nserious illnesses, the FAA has never conducted a large-scale study to \nmeasure the frequency or severity of such toxic fume events in \naircraft.\n  Moreover, there appears to be no FAA standard for identifying or \npreventing the presence of toxic fumes in aircraft cabins.\n  This FAA reauthorization bill pending before the Senate addresses \nthis very important public health and safety issue.\n  Specifically, section 613 of the Commerce Committee's bill would \nrequire that the Federal Aviation Administration implement a research \nprogram to identify appropriate and effective air cleaning technology \nand sensor technology for the engine and auxiliary power unit air \nsupplied to the passenger cabin and flight deck of all pressurized \naircraft.\n  This is a very good and important provision. FAA should absolutely \nstudy what equipment most effectively fixes this air quality problem.\n  But my amendment would go further than the establishment of a \n``research program.''\n  It lays out a clear framework for protecting the public from what \ncould be a serious risk.\n  First, it requires that FAA study the nature of this risk by \nthoroughly and comprehensively monitoring the frequency of exposure on \naircraft, so that we understand whether toxic exposure is a common \noccurrence.\n  Second, the FAA must assemble records of passenger illness complaints \nto determine the specific health risks associated with harmful \ncontaminants in airplane ventilation systems.\n  By gathering this information, I am confident that FAA will develop a \nclear picture of the level of health risk posed by toxins in cabin air, \nand the ways to protect the American traveling public and the \nhardworking men and women who make air travel possible.\n  Finally, this amendment would empower the FAA to require the \ninstallation of toxic air monitors and air filters that the Commerce \nCommittee legislation's study would identify.\n  Such installation would only be required if the FAA's study shows \nthat such a step is necessary to protect public health, but FAA would \nclearly have a mandate to take this step.\n  In March 2009, the president of the American Society of Heating, \nRefrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, which in 2007 \ndeveloped voluntary model standards to protect aircraft cabin air \nquality, called on FAA to ``investigate and determine the requirements \nfor bleed air contaminant monitoring and solutions to prevent bleed air \ncontamination.''\n  I will ask to have a copy of this full letter printed in the Record.\n  But I also want to read ASHRAE's conclusion, which states:\n\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\n\n       Although no systematic fleet-wide or industry-wide audits \n     have been conducted, the UK Committee on Toxicity recently \n     calculated the incidence of oil/hydraulic fluid events as 1 \n     percent of flights based on pilots reports and 0.05 percent \n     of flights based on engineering investigations. . . .\n       Still, no aviation regulator requires either bleed air \n     monitoring or bleed air treatment.\n       To this end, the ASHRAE committee that developed (the model \n     air quality standard) is writing to ask you . . . to \n     investigate the technical implications and flight safety \n     benefits of addressing bleed air contamination, and to \n     determine the requirements for bleed air contaminant \n     detection systems and solutions to prevent bleed air \n     contamination.\n\n  I agree with the ASHRAE recommendation that we need to study this \nproblem and take steps to protect public health and safety.\n  I offered this amendment in order to implement ASHRAE's very sound \nrecommendations, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe March 6, 2009, letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-\n           Conditioning Engineers, Inc.,\n                                       Atlanta, GA, March 6, 2009.\n     Re Request to investigate and determine requirements for \n         bleed air contaminant monitoring and solutions to prevent \n         bleed air contamination.\n\n     Lynne A. Osmus,\n     Acting Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Patrick Goudou, \n     Executive Director, European Aviation Safety Agency, Koeln, \n         Germany.\n       Dear Ms. Osmus and Mr. Goudou: In 2007, ASHRAE published \n     ``Air quality within commercial aircraft'' (ASHRAE, 2007; \n     copy attached), developed by Standard Project Committee 161. \n     The standard addresses a wide range of air quality issues \n     including ventilation, temperature, and contaminants from a \n     variety of sources. In light of the committee's flight safety \n     concerns and the references cited below, the committee \n     requests that, this year, you investigate and determine the \n     requirements for bleed air contaminant monitoring and \n     solutions to prevent bleed air contamination, including \n     maintenance/operating/design control measures and bleed air \n     cleaning equipment.\n       As background, ASHRAE is an engineering association that, \n     among other things, develops and publishes voluntary indoor \n     air quality standards that are often adopted by regulatory \n     authorities. This aircraft air quality standard was developed \n     over a ten-year period. It was a significant undertaking that \n     was ultimately approved for publication unanimously by a \n     committee of members that represent the full spectrum of \n     aviation interests and expertise: namely, aircraft and \n     component manufacturers, airlines, crewmembers, passengers, \n     and a general interest group, appointed according to \n     administrative rules that ASHRAE issued in 2000 to ensure \n     that all interest groups were represented and would be heard. \n     Pre-publication, the standard was also released for two 45-\n     day comment periods during which the general public and other \n     interested parties had the opportunity to weigh in.\n       Section 7.2 of the standard requires the installation of \n     ``one or more sensors intended to identify a substance or \n     substances indicative of air supply system contamination with \n     partly or fully pyrolyzed engine oil or hydraulic fluid'' \n     with flight deck indication when such fumes are present to \n     enable the pilot(s) to respond appropriately and rapidly. \n     Also on the subject of air supply monitoring, Section 8.2 of \n     the standard notes the utility of making portable, reliable, \n     easy-to-use air monitoring devices available in the cabin and \n     flight deck. Finally, Section 8.2 states that air cleaning \n     technologies intended to reduce bleed air contaminants may be \n     considered.\n       Many other publications support this request. For example, \n     the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the UK \n     Department for Transport echoed the call for bleed air \n     monitoring, noting ``adverse physiological effects in one or \n     both pilots, in some cases severe'' (AAIB, 2007). These \n     smoke/fume events had been reported on commercial flights, so \n     the AAIB recommended that the EASA and the FAA ``consider \n     requiring, for all large aeroplanes operating for the \n     purposes of commercial air transport, a system to enable the \n     flight crew to identify rapidly the source of smoke by \n     providing a flight deck warning of smoke or oil mist in the \n     air delivered from each air conditioning unit.'' The \n     installation of sensors which would identify contaminated air \n     events would further help to address the concerns raised by \n     the FAA and others of the underreporting of such events (FAA, \n     2006(a); FAA, 2006(b); Michaelis, 2003). It has been \n     estimated that less than 4% of oil fume incidents are \n     reported as required (Michaelis, 2007). Sensors would help \n     mitigate the reported high failure rate of crews to use \n     emergency oxygen, despite clear industry guidelines to use \n     oxygen when the air is (or is suspected to be) contaminated.\n       Similarly, controlling bleed air contamination is supported \n     by many recent publications that have cited either pilot \n     incapacitation or impairment caused by exposure to oil fumes \n     (AAIB, 2007; ATSB, 2007; SAAIB, 2006; CAA, 2002; CAA, 2000). \n     Oil fume events have been reported fleet-wide across a wide \n     range of aircraft types (Murawski, 2008). For example, on the \n     BAe146 aircraft, the FAA itself requires particular \n     inspections and cleaning to ``prevent impairment of the \n     operational skills and abilities of the flightcrew caused by \n     the inhalation of agents released from oil or oil breakdown \n     products, which could result in reduced controllability of \n     the airplane,'' describing oil contamination as an ``unsafe \n     condition'' and requiring that corrective actions be \n     completed prior to further flight (FAA, 2004).\n       Although no systematic fleet-wide or industry-wide audits \n     have been conducted, the UK Committee on Toxicity recently \n     calculated the incidence of oil/hydraulic fluid events as 1% \n     of flights based on pilots reports and 0.05% of flights based \n     on engineering investigations (with the caveat that the \n     incidence may vary with airframe, engine type, and servicing) \n     (COT, 2007).\n       Still, no aviation regulator requires either bleed air \n     monitoring or bleed, air treatment. To this end, the ASHRAE \n     committee that developed Standard 161-2007 is writing to ask \n     you to establish a joint independent committee (perhaps with \n     other regulatory authorities) this year to investigate the \n     technical implications and flight safety benefits of \n     addressing bleed air contamination, and to determine the \n     requirements for bleed air contaminant detection systems and \n     solutions to prevent bleed air contamination, as described. \n     The committee thanks you for your commitment to aviation \n     safety and encourages you to direct any questions, \n     correspondence, or requests for references to the committee \n     Chairman, Dr. Byron Jones.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William Harrison,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Reid has asked I announce to \nSenators that there will be no further votes this evening and there \nwill be no votes tomorrow. We expect the next vote to be Monday at 5:30 \np.m. We do expect finally that we are near an agreement by which we \nwould be able to finish this FAA reauthorization bill with a final vote \nMonday evening. That is our expectation.\n  I indicated I would describe the circumstances. We are hopeful, as I \nindicated earlier, that we would be able to reach conclusion on this \nbill. We were hopeful in doing it tonight. That was not possible. But \nwe expect to have final passage on the FAA reauthorization bill on \nMonday at 5:30. But let me describe the discussions we have had more \nrecently with Senator Kyl and Senator Warner and many other \ncolleagues--Senator Hutchison.\n  There remains very little to be done on this bill. We have 17 \namendments that have been agreed to on both sides that would be offered \nen bloc. We were not able to offer those until we were able to resolve \nanother issue or at least begin discussion of another issue. And then \nthere was an issue dealing with slots and perimeter rules for Reagan \nNational Airport. It has been controversial in the past--for many, many \nyears--and some colleagues on both sides of the aisle have offered \namendments dealing with slots and the perimeter rule. So it has caused \na lot of discussion for some long while. We have people on both sides \nof these issues, for and against increasing slots and expanding the \nnumber of flights beyond the perimeter at Reagan National.\n  What we have discussed more recently is that an amendment would be \noffered by the minority. They would perhaps modify an amendment that is \nnow filed, and they would offer an amendment on the slots--I guess \nslots and the perimeter rule--and have that debated.\n  One of the things we discussed is that we understand, going into \nconference with the House, that the House has provisions to increase \nslots at Reagan National. So that will be an issue in conference. The \nquestion is, What is the Senate's position going into conference? It \ncan be determined by a vote on the floor of the Senate--yes or no--or \nit can be determined in good faith by discussions with all of us who \nunderstand there will be modifications, some kinds of modifications on \nslots and the perimeter rule. What will they be? Those conversations, \nit seems to me, can also become, between now and Monday, a part of the \ndiscussion and good-faith negotiation on how to approach a conference \nthat reaches the\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\ninterests and needs of the broadest group of Senators.\n  So that is what we have done. We expect to have a new amendment filed \nthat will modify one previously filed and have a debate about that. My \nhope is that we would not have a vote on that and instead reach some \ncommon understanding that we would work together on the slot and the \nperimeter issue in a way that can satisfy the broad interests here in \nthe Senate and take that position into conference in a very assertive \nway and hope the Senate provision would prevail in conference.\n  Mr. President, that is my understanding of where we are, and with \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has stated. I am also working in this group to try to \nfinish this FAA reauthorization bill. There is so much in this bill \nthat will let airports throughout our country have the stability and \nthe airport trust funds to go forward. There are many safety issues \nthat have resulted from the Colgan accident that we are trying to \ncorrect, and other information. This is a very good, very bipartisan \nbill.\n  There are approximately 17 amendments we will be able to clear with \nthe consent of everyone who has been interested in these, after we \ndispose of the perimeter issue. We are going to have the reformed \namendment filed on the perimeter issue, and it will be available for a \nvote on Monday, where we hope we will either be able to vote or get \nsome sort of colloquy that is an understanding. After everyone is \nsatisfied with that, we will then clear the other amendments and hope \nto go to final passage on Monday. I believe that is the goal, and I \nthink it is very reachable.\n  The perimeter rule at National Airport is a rule that was put in \nplace for many reasons. For one thing, there are noise issues, there \nare traffic issues, and there are air traffic issues because National \nis a very close-in airport.\n  Then, of course, there is also the Dulles Airport issue. The way it \nhas evolved is that Dulles Airport is the long-haul airport into our \nNation's Capital and National is used by people who come into our \nCapital because it is convenient. We don't want to jeopardize the \nDulles Airport service in any way, but the people who live farther out \nwest in our country have been discriminated against, clearly, in not \nhaving access to National Airport because there is a perimeter rule, \nwith only 12 flights that go beyond that perimeter.\n  So we have tried for a long time to settle this in an equitable way \nthat does extend the perimeter but not to the detriment of either \nNational or Dulles Airport. Senator Warner of Virginia has been a very \nstrong advocate of the protection of National Airport as well as Dulles \nAirport, as he should be, and I will let him speak for himself. But he \nhas been a very strong advocate, which we all appreciate, and I think \nthe western Senators have also been very strong in their efforts for a \nlong time--for many years.\n  I have been on the aviation subcommittee and am now ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, and I will tell you that we have tried to deal \nwith this perimeter issue to accommodate the needs of western \nconstituents, western citizens who want to be able to come into \nNational Airport and have the choice to come into National Airport. So \nI believe we are working very constructively in this, and I support the \nagreements that have been made for us to go forward as described.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to agree with my \ncolleagues, the ranking member, the Senator from Texas, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and the Senator from Arizona, on the very good work \nthat has been done on this FAA reauthorization bill and the importance \nof this bill, not only in terms of at least starting us down the path \nof NextGen and starting to recognize the safety issues that are \naddressed.\n  As a member of the committee, I wish to compliment the bipartisan \napproach that has been taken on this important piece of legislation. I, \nlike my colleagues and I think most Americans, want to see us move \nforward on this important piece of legislation.\n  I also appreciate the ranking member's comments about the long and \nchallenging journey this has been, about the slots and the perimeter \nrule battles between National and Dulles. I appreciate her comments in \nterms of my role as a Virginia Senator to make sure the unique nature \nof National and Dulles is protected. She made the comment that Senator \nWarner has been a fighter for this. In this case, I am simply filling \nthe shoes of my esteemed predecessor, Senator John Warner, who I know \nfor 20 years probably has had this battle, and my colleagues have gone \nthrough some of the twists and turns.\n  I want to make two or three comments and not take long today because \nI will have more to say on Monday.\n  One is that while National and Dulles serve our Nation's Capital, \nthey also are the local airports for people in Virginia, DC, and \nMaryland, and there have been a number of issues of a unique nature \nwith National Airport in terms of sound concerns and in terms of \ntraffic concerns and safety concerns regarding the inability to extend \nany runway. I would also say with regard to Dulles that those of us who \nhave lived in this area for decades have seen Dulles grow from being \nsomewhat of either a foresight or a white elephant, depending on your \nperspective, over the last 30 years to being an international hub and \nan airport that has enormous potential and opportunity and has, \ncandidly, benefited from the maintenance of the perimeter rule--an \nairport this government has invested in heavily.\n\n  I also have to recognize that technology has changed in terms of the \nnature of jets in and out of National. Technology improvements have \nallowed for much quieter aircraft coming in and out of National, which \nhas mitigated some of the concerns of the neighbors around the airport. \nWe have also seen Dulles make enormous strides not only as a long-haul \nairport but as a gateway airport, in many ways, for international \nflights.\n  Senator Dorgan made mention of the fact that the House has already \nacted in terms of changing the status quo. So the status quo, at least \nfrom the House perspective, is going to change.\n  What I look forward to, hopefully, after our colloquy and \nconversation, is a debate on Monday. I appreciate the fact that my \ncolleagues will offer their amendment, and if we get to a vote, we will \nget to a vote. If we can resolve this through a conversation, I hope we \ncan resolve it through a conversation. But I will have that opportunity \nto lay out some of the challenges that these airports serve to the \ntraveling public, and particularly to my constituents, but also \nrecognizing that the status quo of the last 20-odd years is going to \nchange and we want to work in a way so that change can be dealt with in \na way that accommodates the needs of the local community; that \nmaintains National's incredibly important role; that doesn't \ncannibalize the great progress that has been made at Dulles; and that \nalso recognizes the traveling needs of those Americans who live outside \nthe perimeter, in a way that strikes that appropriate balance.\n  I appreciate the support I have received from Chairman Rockefeller \nand Chairman Dorgan and a number of my colleagues. I also particularly \nappreciate as well the good-faith efforts Senator Hutchison and Senator \nKyl have made in not only raising this discussion but raising it in a \nway that we can perhaps resolve it so that those folks who will be on \nthe conference committee can represent a view of the Senate that \nreaches that kind of accommodation, and most importantly that we can go \nahead and pass this very important piece of FAA reauthorization \nlegislation Monday afternoon.\n  So I look forward to that conversation, I look forward to that \ndebate, and my hope is that we can get to a final vote on passage of \nthe bill on Monday and the good work that so many of our colleagues \nhave done can actually be put into action.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me echo the comments of all my colleagues \nwho have spoken to the issue. I think the comments Senator Warner just \nmade summarize the issue very well and I\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\nwill not repeat all those things. The translation of all this for our \ncolleagues is--although I am not making the announcement--that I \npresume there will be no further formal action in the Senate tonight or \ntomorrow but that we will be laying down a modification of the \namendment that was filed that would include modifications to the \nperimeter rule and perhaps other matters.\n  We will have an opportunity to discuss that tomorrow, and there will \nbe some opportunity to discuss that Monday, for those who perhaps have \nalready left. In particular, I know some of my colleagues will not \nreturn until around 4:30 in the afternoon. I am not going to propound a \nunanimous-consent request, but I hope, in consultation with the two \nleaders, we could work out an arrangement whereby at least some of the \ntime on Monday can be reserved for a debate on the amendment that will \nbe filed by, presumably, Senator Hutchison, myself, Senator Ensign and \nothers and that part of that time will also be in the 4:30 to 5:30 \ntimeframe. That is the time the leader has ordinarily set for the first \nvote, returning on Monday, and presumably there will be a unanimous-\nconsent agreement with the leaders that will reflect the precise \nunderstanding of what vote or votes will occur on Monday night and \nwhen, but presumably it would fall within that timeframe that is \ncustomary.\n  Just to conclude by saying I hope that as a result of the \nconversations we have had and will continue to have Monday and \ntomorrow, that we can lay the foundation for the establishment of a \nSenate position in the conference committee that would reflect a \nconsensus and perhaps some compromise that would satisfy the interests \nof all. We are never going to outdo the fierceness with which both \nSenator Warners--Senator John Warner, who preceded, and now-Senator \nMark Warner--fight for their constituents and for the interests of two \nnational airports--in a sense representing us all. We certainly \nappreciate the single-mindedness with which now-Senator Mark Warner has \npursued those interests but also his recognition that obviously times \nchange, there are some needs for other parts of the country, and that \nthrough comity and conversation perhaps things can be worked out \nwithout having any detriment to anybody. That is obviously the goal we \nwould seek to accomplish.\n  In any event, we will have an amendment on the floor that can discuss \nthis. Perhaps we will vote on it. In any event, the object will be to \nvote on final passage of the bill on Monday evening.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we do not yet have a script with respect \nto an unanimous consent on the Monday 5:30 vote, but all of us are \nunderstanding we want to conclude this legislation Monday, beginning \nwith the 5:30 vote. I think that is a good result.\n  As Senator Hutchison indicated, this is a big bill with many \nimportant parts--safety, modernization, so many issues. I am \nfrustrated, as is everybody, in the pace of the Senate. This is the \nfifth full day on this bill, but Monday at 5:30 we understand we will \nfinally resolve this issue, and it will be good for this country. We \nwill have done some good things passing this bill and getting to a \nconference with the House.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1736-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today President Obama signed into law the \nHiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, H.R. 2847, which will help \nput Americans back to work. More must be done on to help fight the \nunacceptably high unemployment rate, and I hope we can soon address \nother factors holding back our recovery, and particularly that we make \nit easier for businesses to obtain the funds they need to survive and \ngrow.\n  While we work in Congress to get people back to work, I also want to \ntake a moment to focus on another benefit of today's new law.\n  The HIRE Act is a significant victory for law-abiding U.S. taxpayers, \nand a significant blow against those who dodge their responsibilities. \nThe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has spent \nyears investigating offshore tax abuses which together cost the federal \ntreasury an estimated $100 billion in lost tax revenues annually. In \naddition to its provisions designed to help foster economic growth, the \nHIRE Act contains foreign account tax compliance provisions that \nrepresent a major new and positive development in the efforts to stop \noffshore banks from using secrecy laws to help U.S. taxpayers evade \ntheir taxes.\n  These offshore tax compliance provisions are the culmination of over \na year's worth of study, debate, and drafting efforts to protect \nAmerica's honest taxpayers. The drafting effort involved a host of \nMembers of Congress from both the Senate Finance Committee and the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, and the work drew upon multiple bills, \nincluding the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, S. 506, which I introduced with \nSenators McCaskill, Nelson, Whitehouse, Shaheen, and Sanders, and which \nCongressman Lloyd Doggett introduced in the House with 67 cosponsors. I \nwould like to commend Senator Baucus and Congressman Rangel, in \nparticular, for leading this drafting effort, and for involving us in \nproducing a strong bill that President Obama is signing into law today.\n  This is a big bill, and its offshore tax provisions are complex. I \nwant to provide some explanation of how this legislation is intended to \nwork, both to guide the development of implementing regulations and to \ninform the courts of our legislative intent.\n  Section 501, ``Reporting on Certain Foreign Accounts,'' gives foreign \nfinancial institutions a choice. If those financial institutions hold \nU.S. investments of any variety--from U.S. treasuries to U.S. stocks \nand bonds to debt and equity interests in U.S. businesses--they must \neither pay a 30 percent withholding tax on their investment earnings, \nor disclose any and all accounts held by U.S. persons. The legislative \nintent behind this choice is to force foreign financial institutions to \ndisclose their U.S. accountholders or pay a steep penalty for \nnondisclosure. The 30 percent will be withheld by a withholding agent \nin the United States before the funds are permitted to exit the U.S. \nfinancial system.\n  The reason for this strong approach was seen dramatically in hearings \nbefore the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. A July 2008 \nhearing, for example, showed how two foreign banks, UBS AG of \nSwitzerland and LGT Bank of Liechtenstein, used a variety of secrecy \ntricks to help U.S. clients open foreign bank accounts and hide \nmillions of dollars in assets from U.S. tax authorities. One 2004 UBS \ndocument indicated that 52,000 U.S. clients had Swiss accounts that had \nnot been disclosed to the IRS. UBS estimated that those hidden accounts \ncontained a total of about $18 billion in cash, securities, and other \nassets. In order to defer a criminal prosecution against the bank by \nthe U.S. Department of Justice, UBS admitted that it had participated \nin a scheme to defraud the United States of tax revenues, paid a $750 \nmillion fine, and agreed to stop opening accounts that are not \ndisclosed to the IRS. UBS also agreed to reveal the names of a limited \nnumber of U.S. accountholders, although the bulk of the 52,000 still \nmay escape U.S. tax enforcement actions due to Swiss secrecy laws that \ncontinue to conceal their identities.\n  In order to avoid the 30 percent withholding tax, this new law will \nrequire each foreign financial institution to enter into an agreement \nwith the Secretary of the Treasury to obtain and verify information \nwhich will make it possible for them to determine which of their \naccounts belong to U.S. account holders, report key information about \nthose U.S. account holders, and comply with any request by the Treasury \nSecretary related to those U.S. accounts. The bill is written to end \nwide spread abuses. There are several issues that must be addressed in \nimplementing this provision.\n  For instance, it is clearly intended that the definition of foreign \n``financial institution'' be applied broadly, to include banks, \nsecurities firms, money services businesses, money exchange houses, \nhedge funds, private equity funds, commodity traders, derivative \ndealers, and any other type of financial firm that holds, invests, or \ntrades assets on behalf of itself or another person.\n  The definition of ``account'' will cover not only traditional \nsavings, checking, and securities accounts, but also debt and equity \ninterests in hedge funds, private equity funds, and other types of \ninvestment firms.\n  The definition of ``U.S. person'' will apply to U.S. citizens, U.S. \nresidents, and all types of U.S. businesses.\n  The purpose of the provision is to have foreign financial \ninstitutions look past the nominal owners of their accounts to identify \nthe true beneficial owners. That means accounts which are held in the \nname of a foreign legal representative, agent, or trustee on behalf of \na U.S. person, or in the name of a foreign entity, such as an offshore \ncorporation, partnership, or trust, for the benefit of a U.S. person, \nmust be disclosed to U.S. authorities.\n  Foreign financial institutions are to make use of all customer \nidentification information about each account to determine whether the \nbeneficial owners of the account are U.S. persons--including using all \ninformation gathered as a result of antimoney laundering and \nanticorruption requirements or efforts. So no foreign bank will be able \nto automatically determine that all foreign offshore shell corporations \nare foreign accountholders; they will have to look deeper to identify \nthat corporation's beneficial owners and, if any beneficial owner is a \nU.S. person, to report that person's identity to the United States.\n  This approach is intended to remedy past IRS regulations which have \nallowed banks to treat all foreign corporations as foreign \naccountholders, no matter who the beneficial owner is. Our purpose here \nis to impose on foreign financial institutions the duty to identify the \nbeneficial owners of each corporation and report any U.S. beneficial \nowners to the IRS.\n  Treasury, in implementing this statute, should develop a standard \nagreement for foreign financial institutions that lays out these \nrequirements with respect to accounts, U.S. persons, and nominee \naccountholders. That standard agreement must also be constructed in \nsuch a way that foreign financial institutions will provide account \ninformation in a standardized electronic format that will enable \nefficient analysis of the data. Treasury should consult with the IRS \nand the Justice Department's Tax Division to determine how the \ncollected information should be structured to provide timely and usable \ndata in tax enforcement efforts.\n  The Treasury will need to construct a withholding regime that will \nefficiently withhold the 30 percent tax on all U.S. investment earnings \nheld by a noncooperative foreign financial institution. This statute \nwill not be effective unless the 30 percent tax is withheld promptly, \nreliably, and in a comprehensive way. In devising this withholding \nregime, it is our purpose to apply the term ``withholdable payment'' \nbroadly to cover all types of payments from sources in the United \nStates, including interest payments, dividends, rents, wages, stock \ngains, and derivative payments originating in the United States.\n  Finally, we expect that the Treasury, when exercising authority under \nthe bill to grant exceptions or waivers or deem foreign financial \ninstitutions to be in compliance with the law, will exercise that \nauthority narrowly and in a fashion that is consistent with the \npurposes of the statute and will promote disclosure of foreign accounts \nwith U.S. account holders.\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\n  Sections 511 through 521 of the HIRE Act establish stronger \ndisclosure requirements for U.S. taxpayers with foreign financial \nassets. Section 511 will require full disclosure of assets held outside \nof the United States, in order to end years of abuses involving the \nconcealment of offshore assets, including disclosure, for example, of \ninterests in foreign accounts, securities, complex financial \ninstruments, debt or equity interests in foreign hedge funds, private \nequity funds, or other investment vehicles, and derivative contracts \nand trading arrangements. A new requirement in Section 521 for annual \nreports filed by shareholders of passive foreign investment companies \nwill provide additional important disclosures of assets held outside of \nthe United States. Tough penalties and a longer statute of limitations \nwill add to the effectiveness of these new disclosure requirements.\n  Sections 531 through 535 tighten U.S. tax rules for foreign trusts \nand address a variety of abuses identified in my Permanent Subcommittee \nin Investigations 2006 hearings exposing how U.S. taxpayers use foreign \ntrusts to evade their U.S. tax obligations. Section 531 ends \nshenanigans involving U.S. persons who are not officially beneficiaries \nof a foreign trust, but could be named a beneficiary by the trustee, or \nwho write ``Letters of Intent'' instructing the trustee how to use or \ndistribute trust assets. Section 532 creates a ``Presumption that \nForeign Trust Has United States Beneficiary'' if a U.S. person directly \nor indirectly transfers property to that foreign trust. The presumption \nis rebuttable, but the onus is placed on the proper party, the person \nwho has access to the information about the foreign trust, to rebut the \npresumption. Section 533 will stop abuses in which U.S. persons \ninstruct foreign trusts to purchase and lend them property on an \nuncompensated basis, including jewelry, artwork, and even luxury homes. \nSection 534 requires U.S. grantors as well as trustees to ensure that \ntrust transactions are properly reported to the IRS. These provisions \nwill help put an end to foreign trust tax abuses that significantly \nundermine the U.S. Government's ability to collect taxes owed by \nforeign trusts with U.S. beneficiaries.\n  Still another section of the bill makes important changes to curb \noffshore tax abuses involving nonpayment of U.S. taxes on U.S. stock \ndividends. Section 541 is a direct result of a year-long inquiry by my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations into this problem. In \nSeptember 2008, the subcommittee held a hearing and released a report \ndetailing how offshore entities routinely dodge taxes on U.S. stock \ndividends--S. Hrg. 110-778. As discussed at the hearing, over the last \nten years, dividend tax abuse has cost the U.S. treasury and honest \ntaxpayers billions of dollars in lost revenue. The report made four \nrecommendations:\n  First, end offshore dividend tax abuse. Congress should end offshore \ndividend tax abuse by enacting legislation to make it clear that non-\nU.S. persons cannot avoid U.S. dividend taxes by using a swap or stock \nloan to disguise dividend payments. Section 541 is designed to address \nthis problem by eliminating the different tax rules for U.S. stock \ndividends, dividend equivalent payments, and substitute dividend \npayments, and making them all equally taxable as dividends.\n  Second, take enforcement action. The IRS should complete its review \nof dividend-related transactions and take civil enforcement action \nagainst taxpayers and U.S. financial institutions that knowingly \nparticipated in abusive transactions aimed at dodging U.S. taxes on \nstock dividends. The IRS has recently designated ending dividend tax \ndodging as a Tier I enforcement issue, and section 541 will provide the \nIRS with new tools in that enforcement effort. Section 541 requires \nexactly that.\n  Third, strengthen regulation on equity swaps. To stop misuse of \nequity swap transactions to dodge U.S. dividend taxes, the IRS should \nissue a new regulation to make dividend equivalent payments under \nequity swap transactions taxable to the same extent as U.S. stock \ndividends.\n  Fourth, strengthen stock loan regulation. To stop misuse of stock \nloan transactions to dodge U.S. dividend taxes, we recommended that the \nIRS immediately meet its 1997 commitment to issue a new regulation on \nthe tax treatment of substitute dividend payments between foreign \nparties to make clear that inserting an offshore entity into a stock \nloan transaction does not eliminate U.S. tax withholding obligations. \nAfter waiting over 18 months for Treasury and the IRS to act, section \n541 now provides them with a clear legislative mandate to issue \nstronger regulation of swaps and stock loans.\n  Section 541 makes a number of key changes in the law. First, section \n541 calls for ``dividend equivalents'' to be treated as a U.S. sourced \ndividend and therefore subject to withholding tax beginning 180 days \nfrom enactment. ``Dividend equivalent'' is defined to include ``any \nsubstitute dividend made pursuant to a securities lending or a sale-\nrepurchase agreement that (directly or indirectly) is contingent upon, \nor determined by reference to, the payment of a dividend from sources \nwithin the United States.'' Once this becomes effective, all payments \nmade based on, or by reference to, a dividend from a U.S. source under \na securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction will be treated as \na dividend from a U.S. source.\n  Treating dividend equivalents as U.S. sourced income sets an \nimportant precedent. Before this provision was enacted into law, the \nsource of a dividend equivalent payment--often carried out through a \nswap arrangement--was determined according to who received the payment. \nBut it makes no sense and turns the English language on its head to say \nthe recipient of a payment is the ``source'' of that payment. The \nsource of a payment will to be determined according to the person who \ninitiated the payment, not according to its recipient, and section 541 \nmakes that clear.\n  ``Dividend equivalent'' is also defined to include ``any payment made \npursuant to a specified notional principal contract that (directly or \nindirectly) is contingent upon, or determined by reference to, the \npayment of a dividend from sources within the United States.''\n  ``Specified notional principal contract'' is defined differently \ndepending upon whether the payment is made before or after 2 years from \nthe Act's enactment. For the first year-and-a-half after the act's \neffective date, payments made pursuant to notional principal contracts \nthat are made based on, or by reference to, a dividend from a U.S. \nsource are treated as a dividend from a U.S. source if they meet any of \nthe criteria specified in newly enacted 26 U.S.C. 871(l)(3)(A)(i)-(iv) \nor ``such contract identified by the Secretary.'' The four specific \ncriteria define the worst of the abusive notional principal contracts \nthat the subcommittee uncovered.\n  However, as established in the subcommittee report and hearing on \nthis matter, many financial institutions have moved away from the \nblatantly abusive practices that are addressed in subsections \n(3)(A)(i)-(iv) and now use more subtle methods of ensuring a riskless \ntransfer between holding U.S. securities and engaging in notional \nprincipal contracts. It is the legislative intent of the authors of \nthis provision that the Secretary will use the authority granted in \n(3)(A)(v) to identify and extend coverage of this statue to stop the \nmore subtle abusive practices as well, and I encourage Treasury to act \nquickly to do so.\n  Two years from the date of enactment, any payment made pursuant to a \nnotional principal contract that is based on, or by reference to, a \ndividend from a U.S. source is treated as a dividend from a U.S. \nsource, ``unless the Secretary determines that such a contract is of a \ntype which does not have the potential for tax avoidance.'' Again, it \nis the intent of this language that the Secretary uses this exception \nauthority very sparingly, that only narrow types of contracts be \nexcepted, and that such exceptions be fashioned only after conducting a \nthorough analysis to ensure that the contracts under consideration \ncannot be exploited for tax avoidance. As the language states, an \nexception is available only after the Secretary determines that the \ntype of contract is not being used for tax avoidance, and does not have \nthe potential for tax avoidance. That is intentionally a very high \nstandard.\n  In addition to substitute dividends and payments made pursuant to \nnotional principal contracts, ``dividend equivalent'' is also defined \nto include\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n``any other payment determined by the Secretary to be substantially \nsimilar'' to substitute dividends and payments made pursuant to \nnotional principal contracts. Treasury is intended to utilize this \nexplicit legislative directive to aggressively enforce dividend tax \ncollection on substantially similar payments and transactions. For \nexample, as explained in the Joint Committee on Taxation's ``Technical \nExplanation of the Revenue Provisions Contained in Senate Amendment \n3310, the `Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act,' Under \nConsideration by the Senate'' (JCX-4-10), ``the Secretary may conclude \nthat payments under certain forward contracts or other financial \ncontracts that reference stock of U.S. corporations are dividend \nequivalents.'' The point of the ``substantially similar'' language is \nto provide Treasury and the IRS with broad authority and the \nflexibility needed to prevent misuse of other financial instruments or \ntrading activities to evade U.S. dividend taxes.\n  Finally, section 541 contains an important provision on the \n``prevention of over-withholding.'' As the language states, the \nSecretary may reduce the tax on dividends only ``to the extent that the \ntaxpayer can establish that such tax has been paid with respect to \nanother dividend equivalent in such chain, or is not otherwise due, or \nas the Secretary determines is appropriate to address the role of \nfinancial intermediaries in such chain.'' The burden of proof placed on \nthe taxpayer is intentionally high due to the numerous abuses that have \noccurred over the years in which taxpayers have designed elaborate \nchains of transactions to escape all taxation of U.S. stock dividends. \nThis provision provides an equitable way to address the potential \nproblem of over-withholding, while setting an intentionally high burden \nof proof to avoid abusive over-withholding claims.\n  I appreciate the attention that the Senate Finance and House Ways and \nMeans Committees gave to the tax dodging problems identified in the \nSubcommittee's investigation. We also appreciate the technical guidance \nand cooperation provided by the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue \nService, and the Joint Committee on Taxation in this Section.\n  I hope these remarks help shine a light on how this piece of \nlegislation will begin to curb the $100 billion in offshore tax abuses \nnow robbing honest taxpayers of needed government resources each year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1747-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMISSIONING OF THE USS ``DEWEY''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 6, the USS Dewey--DDG 105--was \ncommissioned at the Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach, CA.\n  The Dewey, an Arleigh Burke-class ship, is the Navy's newest and most \ntechnologically advanced guided-missile destroyer. The ship's sponsor, \nDeborah Mullen, the wife of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nAdmiral Mike Mullen, christened the ship in January of 2008 during a \nceremony at Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, MS. Mrs. \nMullen recently visited Vermont with Chairman Mullen as they came to a \ndeployment ceremony for the Vermont Army Guard 86th Brigade which is \nnow serving in Afghanistan.\n  The new destroyer honors Navy Admiral George Dewey and is the third \nU.S. Navy ship to be named after him. Admiral Dewey, who is from my \nhometown, Montpelier, VT, became an American hero in 1898 for leading \nhis squadron of warships against the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay. Under \nhis leadership, the U.S. Navy destroyed the Spanish fleet in only 2 \nhours without the loss of a single American vessel. Dewey was promoted \nto admiral of the Navy in 1903, a rank which was created for him.\n  The new USS Dewey has the ability to conduct a wide range of \noperations. The ship contains a multitude of offensive and defensive \nweapons and will be capable of fighting air, surface, and subsurface \nbattles simultaneously. The USS Dewey is an example of how naval \nwarships have the flexibility to conduct a variety of missions.\n  We Vermonters are proud that another ship has been named after \nAdmiral Dewey. I wish Godspeed to the ship and its crew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1747-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Nowruz, the \ntraditional Iranian New Year, which begins with the arrival of spring \non the Vernal Equinox. More than 1 million Iranian Americans in the \nUnited States as well as millions of Iranians and others around the \nworld celebrate Nowruz, which embodies the ideals of understanding and \nappreciation of others. Universally, the beginning of spring is \nassociated with rebirth.\n  At this festive time, when Mother Nature is beginning a new cycle and \nfamilies around the world are gathering to celebrate a new calendar \nyear, I would like to appeal to the good will of the Iranian government \nby calling for the immediate release of Joshua Fattal, Sarah Shourd, \nand Shane Bauer. These three young American hikers have spent almost 8 \nmonths in confinement in Iran's Evin prison for allegedly crossing a \npoorly marked border. We are heartened that the Iranians recently \nallowed the three young Americans to call their families for the first \ntime since their detention on July 31 last year. Still, we ask at the \nbeginning of Persian New Year that Josh, Sarah, and Shane be released \nto celebrate a spring with their desperately concerned parents and \nother family members. Laura Fattal, mother of Josh, recently appealed \nto the Iranian authorities, asking for them ``to show compassion and \nallow our families to be reunited in joy and happiness as well.''\n  I would like to recognize the Senators from California and Minnesota, \nas well as Senator Specter, who have worked tirelessly to reunite Josh, \nSarah, and Shane with their families. I hope that Supreme Leader \nKhamenei, in the spirit of Nowruz, will make the humanitarian gesture \nof immediately releasing Josh, Sarah, and Shane.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1747-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1747-S1748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRIZZLIES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I recognize the achievements \nof an outstanding college basketball team from my home State of \nMontana. High school and college sports are a way of life across Big \nSky country. On cold winter nights in towns across the state from Libby \nto Lewistown and from Fort Benton to Fairview folks fill up gymnasiums \nto cheer on their favorite teams. The University of Montana Grizzlies \nhave legions of devoted fans around Montana, and pack thousands into \nthe Adams Center on the UM campus in Missoula for home games.\n  This season's edition of the Griz has thrilled fans throughout, and \nthe team is now headed for the NCAA Tournament after a thrilling come \nfrom behind win to capture the Big Sky Conference Championship on March \n10. The Grizzlies showed the heart, determination, and hustle Montana \nathletes are known for, in clawing their way back from a 22-point \ndeficit to defeat Weber State University on the Wildcats' home court. \nAnthony Johnson turned in a performance for the ages and one that will \nbe remembered for decades across Montana. The senior guard poured in a \nschool and Big Sky tournament record 42 points including the winning \nshot. To illustrate how amazing this performance was Johnson by himself \noutscored Weber State 34 to 25 in the second half.\n  In the end it all came down to teamwork as guard Will Cherry made a \nstellar defensive play to stop Weber State on their last possession, \nand big men Derek Selvig and Brian Qvale contributed with big blocks \nand rebounds throughout. This was yet another illustration of how the \nteam has pulled together all year to get big wins no matter the \nadversity they faced.\n  The Griz now move on to face the University of New Mexico Lobos in \nthe NCAA Tournament. The Griz have had tournament success in the past, \nwinning a first round game in 2006 despite being a heavy underdog and \nhaving a memorable run in the 1975 tournament as well. In 1975 another \ntremendous performance was turned in by a Grizzly as guard Eric Hays \nnearly led the team to an upset of defending national champion UCLA in \nthe second round. Hays played the game of his life--he\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nscored 32 points to keep the Griz in the game, although they ultimately \nlost 67-64. Griz fans still remember Hays' amazing performance 35 years \nlater. Eric went on to coach basketball at Hellgate High School in \nMissoula where he won over 350 games.\n  I would like to commend Wayne Tinkle, the coach of the team, athletic \ndirector Jim O'Day, and University of Montana president George Dennison \nfor their leadership and vision in making the Grizzly athletic programs \nsuccessful and teaching many dedicated student athletes life lessons as \nwell as those on the playing fields and courts. These student athletes \ndeserve our recognition for all the hard work they put in throughout \nthe year.\n  I know that the Griz will represent the state of Montana well in the \nNCAA tournament and give it their all. I along with many other Griz \nfans across the country will be watching and cheering a famous line \nfrom the school's fight song--``Up with Montana, boys, down with the \nfoe!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1748-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ANTHONY BROWN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

Anthony's service to the \ncommunity was legendary. He served on many boards, and made \ncontributions in countless other ways. One of those contributions was \nhis mentoring of young people, something he felt there needed to be \nmuch more of in the community. He also pushed for more opportunities \nfor people of color in the news media in Madison, knowing what a \nvaluable perspective they would bring to news coverage in the city.\n  Again and again, Anthony stood up for justice and equality. He \nenriched this community with his work, and I am very grateful for all \nhe did over so many years.\n  Anthony had so many wonderful qualities; he was tireless, he was \npersistent, and above all he was an optimist. He was always positive, \neven in the face of very tough challenges, including the challenges he \nfaced with his own health. That optimism is one of the many wonderful \nthings I will remember him for.\n  Today my thoughts are with Anthony's family, and with everyone lucky \nenough to have known him. He will be deeply missed, but his work will \ncontinue to have a positive impact on Madison and the State of \nWisconsin for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1748-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM DuPONT\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Hailed as a ``postal hero'' by his colleagues, Jim was \non his way home from work when he came upon an accident involving a \nhead-on collision between a truck and a car. Jim rushed to the scene to \nprovide help to the drivers and passengers trapped in their vehicles.\n  Jim first pulled the truck's driver and passenger out of the cab \nthrough the rear window. He then ran back to rescue the driver of the \nsecond vehicle. The victims of the accident suffered serious injuries, \nbut thankfully are on their way to recovery. Jim also was hurt, \nsuffering a dislocated shoulder, burns and smoke inhalation.\n  Mr. President, I salute Jim's bravery and courage. In the face of \ndanger, he put himself in harm's way to save lives. We should all \naspire to achieve this level of selflessness and compassion for \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1748-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE CITIZENS OF DeWITT\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

A bill to grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nauthority to design, construct, and operate facilities for the purpose \nof developing and producing biological products in order to meet \ncritical national needs for such biological products, in response to \npotential bioterrorist attacks or naturally occurring pathogens; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Biosecurity and Vaccine Development Improvement Act, \nwhich will ensure our country has the resources necessary to protect \nthe American people in the event of a disease outbreak or terrorist \nattack.\n  Last year, in preparation for flu season and concern about the H1N1 \nvirus, the Department of Health and Human Services set out to acquire \n120 million doses of vaccines. In August 2009, the department initially \nprojected that these doses would be available by mid-October. However, \nonly 11 million were obtained by that time, and the 120 million doses \nwere not acquired until January 2010.\n  The current system consists of government contracts with private \nvaccine manufacturers to produce vaccines. While this lowers overhead \ncosts to the Government, the Government is not able to dictate when \nvaccines will be produced or which vaccines will be produced. The \nproduction of the H1N1 vaccine is good example of the problems that can \narise without a dedicated Government manufacturing facility for \nvaccines. The delay was due to several problems with the supplying \ncompanies. For example, one company based in Australia had to produce \nvaccines to meet the needs in Australia before exporting doses to the \nU.S. Another company had to produce their regular seasonal flu vaccine \nbefore switching to H1N1 vaccine production. This demonstrates the \ncritical need to examine the current vaccine system.\n  The current system has limitations on the ability to produce vaccines \nrelated to bioterrorism such as smallpox, anthrax, ebola virus and \nbotulism, leaving the U.S. without vaccines and susceptible to \nterrorist attacks. What we want to do is to avoid having the government \ncome up short on something like what happened with Katrina where we are \nunprepared for the eventuality.\n  I have long been concerned with these issues. Since 2004, when I \nchaired the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, with the joinder of Senator Harkin, who is \nnow the chair, we appropriated $14.336 billion for pandemic \npreparedness. So you can see that we are talking about very substantial \nfunds to meet a very substantial problem. Over the past year, I have \nheld a number of meetings about the need for a facility, through a \npublic/private partnership, that would afford the U.S. Government \ngreater control over vaccine and countermeasure production and \ndevelopment. These meetings included Vice President Biden, Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services Sebelius and Secretary of Homeland Security \nJanet Napolitano. On August 21, 2009, I chaired a hearing in \nPittsburgh, PA, to examine the problems our current system faces and \nwhat can be done to remedy them.\n  This legislation would provide funding for a public/private \npartnership vaccine developing and manufacturing facility, determined \nby a competitive bidding process. A public/private facility such as \nthis would allow the government to determine what vaccines would be \nproduced and would use new technology being developed by General \nElectric to allow rapid change in the vaccines produced. This process \ncurrently requires extensive cleaning and\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\ntakes weeks, but this new technology includes disposable manufacturing \nequipment to change production quickly and would improve output and \nmeet demand.\n  This proposed facility would develop and manufacture medical \ncountermeasures critical to this Nation's health and security and could \ngreatly enhance the U.S.'s vaccine-producing abilities. I encourage my \ncolleagues to work with me to move this legislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3141. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nspecial rules for treatment of low-income housing credits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, among the many casualties of our \neconomic downturn is the collapse of the primary form of private \nfinancing to construct affordable housing. I rise today to introduce \nthe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Recovery Act, which would restore \ninvestment in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. In doing so, \nthe bill will create tens of thousands of new affordable housing units \nand, in turn, thousands of construction jobs. I am grateful to my \nFinance Committee colleagues, Senators Kerry, Cantwell, Menendez, \nStabenow, and Schumer for joining me in introducing this bill.\n  Many of us are familiar with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit \nprogram's importance; indeed, I consider it the most successful \naffordable housing production program in our nation's history. Since \nits enactment in 1986, the program has spurred the creation of more \nthan 1.7 million units of affordable housing nationwide, including \nnearly 20,000 units in my home State of New Mexico.\n  But today, the Housing Credit program is facing tremendous challenges \nin attracting private investment. Having incurred significant losses, \nmany traditional investors cannot currently use these tax credits, and \nthus have temporarily exited the market. Moreover, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac--which until recently provided a significant share of \nprivate investment in Housing Credit projects in New Mexico and \nnationwide--have pulled out entirely. Our bill will help attract new \nprivate investment to Housing Credit projects in New Mexico and across \nthe country.\n  First, the bill will permit existing investors to carryback their \nunusable existing housing credits for up to five years. A major \nimpediment to new investment today is that traditional Housing Credit \ninvestors have incurred business losses that prevent them from \nutilizing tax credits on previous investments. Consequently, these \ntraditional investors have become disinclined to make new investments--\nas doing so would generate further credits they could not use for some \ntime. But through a 5-year carryback, many of these traditional \ninvestors will be able to make use of accumulated credits. Only \ninvestors who are committed to creating additional affordable housing \ndeserve this tax treatment. Accordingly, the bill makes the 5-year \ncarryback election available only to the extent that carryback proceeds \nare entirely invested in new affordable housing credit investments.\n  Additionally, the bill provides that Housing Credits generated from \nfuture investments can be carried back 5 years. With its 10-year credit \nstream and 15-year tax compliance period, the Housing Credit program \nfaces hurdles lining up investors, as compared to other tax credit \nprograms with shorter investment horizons. Without shortening the \ncompliance period, a 5-year carryback will make the Housing Credit more \ncompetitive with other tax credits, by providing greater flexibility. \nThis will result in more stable investor demand and thus more resources \nfor affordable housing.\n\n  Our bill is based on consensus proposals developed by a broad \ncoalition of affordable housing organizations--including housing \nadvocates, state housing finance agencies, developers, and investors--\nto restore private investment in affordable housing. That these \nproposals will create tens of thousands of affordable housing units and \nthousands of construction jobs was endorsed in studies by Harvard \nUniversity's Joint Center on Housing and Ernst & Young's Tax Credit \nAdvisory Services Center.\n  I am grateful for the coalition's efforts, as well as input that New \nMexico stakeholders--including the New Mexico Mortgage Finance \nAuthority, Enterprise Community Partners, and the New Mexico Coalition \nto End Homelessness--provided as I developed this bill.\n  We must act swiftly to ensure continued progress in constructing \naffordable housing, to meet our nation's affordable housing needs and \ncreate jobs.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve the health and well-being of school children, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we prepare to reauthorize the Child \nNutrition Act, it is critical that we address the need to invest in \ncommonsense ways to improve the health and well being of our nation's \nmost precious resource--our children.\n  Childhood obesity threatens the healthy future of one-third of \nAmerican children. Every year we spend $150 billion to treat obesity-\nrelated conditions, and that cost is growing. Obesity rates tripled in \nthe past 30 years, a trend that means, for the first time in our \nhistory, American children may face a shorter expected lifespan than \ntheir parents.\n  Right now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, spends more than \n$10 billion a year on school meal programs, but only a small fraction \nof that funding goes to fruits and vegetables.\n  A recent report by the Institute of Medicine entitled School Meals: \nBuilding Blocks for Healthy Children, found that increasing the amount \nand variety of vegetables and fruits in schools is one of the best ways \nto make school meals healthier, and recommends that schools increase \ntheir offering of fruits and vegetables to help keep kids healthy.\n  That is why I am introducing the Healthy Food in Schools Act, which \nwould improve school nutrition by providing more fresh fruits and \nvegetables in school breakfasts and lunches starting in elementary \nschool, when children are developing healthy eating habits.\n  A recent study was conducted by Dr. Wendy Slusser, director of UCLA's \nFit for Health Program, and Harvinder Sareen, Director of Clinical \nPrograms at WellPoint, a health benefits company that found children's \nconsumption of fruit and vegetables increases dramatically when produce \nis made available in school meals. The data also shows that increasing \navailability of fruits and vegetables exposes children to new foods, \nwhich can affect their eating habits for a lifetime.\n  The Healthy Food in Schools Act instructs USDA to put in place a plan \nto promote the use of salad bars in schools and provide $10 million for \nfiscal years 2011 and 2012 to help schools purchase salad bars and \nfruit and vegetable bars for their cafeterias.\n  The Healthy Food in Schools Act also includes $100 million for \noverall cafeteria infrastructure improvements. Many cafeterias around \nthe country are looking to move away from processed food and toward \nkitchens that can cook healthier meals from scratch, but they lack the \nfunds to implement such a plan.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed last year included \n$100 million in grants for cafeteria equipment, but the Department of \nEducation received more than $650 million in requests for \ninfrastructure improvements. This bill will help meet the needs of the \nmany school districts that want to improve the meals they serve their \nstudents.\n  This bill also provides competitive matching grants and technical \nassistance for schools to improve access to local foods. The bill \ndirects $10 million a year for 5 years toward these farm-to-school \nprograms.\n  Farm-to-school programs are a proven, commonsense way to help improve \nthe health of children while supporting local farmers and bolstering \nlocal economies. While many schools would like to incorporate fresh \nlocal food into their meals, schools often lack the startup funding and \ntechnical expertise to overcome barriers to making this change. These \nlimited federal grants will give school districts and small- and \nmedium-sized farms the help they need to develop new farm-to-school \nprograms.\n  With more than 31 million children participating in the National \nSchool Lunch Program and more than 11 million participating in the \nNational School Breakfast Program, good nutrition at school is more \nimportant than ever. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of including this commonsense bill in the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act.\n  The Healthy Food in Schools Act will help ensure that our nation's \nchildren are not just eating, but also learning to eat healthy. The \nrise in the rates of children who are overweight or obese are a result \nof poor diets, a lack of physical activity, and insufficient nutrition \neducation. A healthy school environment can help correct these problems \nand put our Nation's youth and our Nation on the path to a healthier \nand more sustainable future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1753-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1753-S1754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 461--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \n   SHOULD REJECT ANY PROPOSAL FOR THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF GLOBAL \n                        TAXATION AND REGULATION\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 54\n\n       Whereas Orlando Zapata Tamayo (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``Zapata''), a 42-year-old plumber and bricklayer and a \n     member of the Alternative Republican Movement and the \n     National Civic Resistance Committee, died on February 23, \n     2010, in the custody of the Government of Cuba after \n     conducting a hunger strike for more than 80 days;\n       Whereas, on February 24, 2010, the Foreign Ministry of Cuba \n     issued a rare statement on the death of Zapata, stating, \n     ``Raul Castro laments the death of Cuban prisoner Orlando \n     Zapata Tamayo, who died after conducting a hunger strike.'';\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\n       Whereas Reina Luisa Tamayo has asserted that her son \n     Orlando Zapata Tamayo was tortured and denied water during \n     his incarceration and has called ``on the world to demand the \n     freedom of the other prisoners and brothers unfairly \n     sentenced so that what happened to my boy, my second child, \n     who leaves behind no physical legacy, no child or wife, does \n     not happen again'';\n       Whereas Zapata began a hunger strike on December 9, 2009, \n     to demand respect for his personal safety and to protest his \n     inhumane treatment by the prison authorities in Cuba;\n       Whereas according to his supporters, Zapata was denied \n     water during stages of his hunger strike at Kilo 8 Prison in \n     Camaguey, was then transferred to Havana's Combinado del Este \n     prison, and was finally admitted to the Hermanos Ameijeiras \n     Hospital on February 23, 2010, in critical condition, where \n     he was administered fluids intravenously and died hours \n     later;\n       Whereas, on February 25, 2010, Freedom House condemned the \n     Government of Cuba for ``the deplorable prison conditions, \n     torture, and lack of medical attention that led to the death \n     of political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo'';\n       Whereas Zapata was arrested in 2003 on charges of contempt \n     for authority, public disorder, and disobedience, and was \n     initially sentenced to 3 years in prison;\n       Whereas Zapata was later convicted of additional ``acts of \n     defiance'' while in prison and was resentenced to a total of \n     36 years;\n       Whereas in 2003, Zapata and approximately 75 other \n     dissidents and peaceful supporters of the Varela Project were \n     arrested during the ``Black Spring'' and were sentenced to \n     harsh prison terms;\n       Whereas more than 25,000 Cubans have signed on to the \n     Varela Project, which seeks a referendum on civil liberties, \n     including freedom of speech, amnesty for political prisoners, \n     support for private business, a new electoral law, and a \n     general election;\n       Whereas in 2003, Amnesty International designated Zapata as \n     a prisoner of conscience;\n       Whereas the Government of the United States raised the \n     plight of Zapata during migration talks on February 19, 2010, \n     and urged the Government of Cuba to provide all necessary \n     medical care;\n       Whereas, on February 25, 2010, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton said in response to the death of Zapata, ``We send \n     our condolences to his family and we also reiterate our \n     strong objection to the actions of the Cuban government. This \n     is a prisoner of conscience who was imprisoned for years for \n     speaking his mind, for seeking democracy, for standing on the \n     side of values that are universal, who engaged in a hunger \n     strike.'';\n       Whereas following the death of Zapata, the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights reported that at least 50 \n     dissidents were detained or forced to remain in their houses \n     to prevent them from attending the wake and funeral for \n     Zapata;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 Country Report on \n     Human Rights states that Cuba is a totalitarian state with a \n     government that continues to deny its citizens basic human \n     rights and continues to commit numerous serious human rights \n     abuses;\n       Whereas the Department of State reports that the Government \n     of Cuba has not granted prison visits by the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International, or Human \n     Rights Watch since 1988;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch states, ``Cuba remains the one \n     country in Latin America that represses virtually all forms \n     of political dissent. The government continues to enforce \n     political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long- and \n     short-term detention, harassment, denial of employment, and \n     travel restrictions.''; and\n       Whereas in a 2008 annual report, the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights reported that ``restrictions on \n     political rights, on freedom of expression, and on the \n     dissemination of ideas, the failure to hold elections, and \n     the absence of an independent judiciary in Cuba combine to \n     create a permanent panorama of breached basic rights for the \n     Cuban citizenry'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the life of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, whose \n     death on February 23, 2010, highlights the lack of democracy \n     in Cuba and the injustice of the brutal treatment of more \n     than 200 political prisoners by the Government of Cuba;\n       (2) calls for the immediate release of all political \n     prisoners detained in Cuba;\n       (3) pays tribute to the courageous citizens of Cuba who are \n     suffering abuses merely for engaging in peaceful efforts to \n     exercise their basic human rights;\n       (4) supports freedom of speech and the rights of \n     journalists and bloggers in Cuba to express their views \n     without repression by government authorities and denounces \n     the use of intimidation, harassment, or violence by the \n     Government of Cuba to restrict and suppress freedom of \n     speech, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and \n     freedom of the press;\n       (5) desires that the people of Cuba be able to enjoy due \n     process and the right to a fair trial; and\n       (6) calls on the United States to continue policies that \n     focus on respect for the fundamental tenets of freedom, \n     democracy, and human rights in Cuba and encourage peaceful \n     democratic change consistent with the aspirations of the \n     people of Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/18/senate-section/article/S1756-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS TO WORK DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.
