Mr. President, in these past few weeks, we have seen the \ngood that can happen when we look out for Main Street, not just Wall \nStreet. We have accomplished a lot. This work period has been \ntremendously productive, but we have a lot to finish this week before \nwe can adjourn for Memorial Day. We have to finish an important bill \nthat puts fairness and common sense back into credit cards--those \ncredit cards we use every day. It stops companies from taking advantage \nof their customers with hidden charges and misleading terms. We need to \nfinish a bill we passed a couple weeks ago that will crack down on \ncorporate fraud and mortgage scams. We need to finish a bill that will \nhelp millions of families keep their homes. We need to finish a bill \nthat reins in out-of-control Government contractors who waste taxpayer \nmoney, the so-called procurement bill. We need to confirm President \nObama's nominee to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of the \nInterior--a man who is supremely qualified and held the same position \nin President Clinton's Cabinet. Finally, we have to pass a supplemental \nappropriations bill to give our troops the tools they need to succeed \nas they fight in two wars. This funding will strengthen our military, \nrebuild our standing in the world, and reduce our key security threats.\n  So I hope this week we can cap off a productive and successful work \nperiod with another fruitful week, but it will take the cooperation of \nboth Democrats and Republicans to do this. I have had a brief \nconversation with the floor staff, and it is something we should be \nable to do fairly quickly. I hope that, in fact, is the case. I look \nforward to visiting, sometime today, with my counterpart, the \nRepublican leader, to see what we can do to work toward this common \ngoal of finishing our work as quickly as we can. We all have scheduled \na lot of things for the Memorial Day recess. It is one of those rare \ntimes when we can be home during the week. We look forward to that. We \nwant to make that time as lengthy as possible, and we will do what we \ncan on this side to see if we can move through these very important \npieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5544-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 years ago, our Nation was in the \nmidst of a global battle against terrorism, and much of our time and \nenergy in the Senate was devoted to that fight, from updating laws for \nmonitoring terrorists overseas, to fighting an insurgency in Iraq, to \ncombating the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n  Two years later, we are still engaged in the same battle and in many \nof the same debates. On most of these issues, the Senate has had an \nopportunity to express itself very clearly. Yet rarely has it done so \nwith as much unity as on the question of whether to send terrorists at \nGuantanamo to U.S. soil. On that important question, the vote was 94 to \n3 against.\n  But something has changed. Now a number of Democrats who voted \nagainst sending detainees from Guantanamo to the United States are \nexpressing a willingness to do so, in contradiction of their earlier \nvote. What has changed? America is still at war against terror networks \naround the world. The detainees held at Guantanamo are still some \nof the most dangerous terrorists alive. Indeed, over the past 2 years, \nthe inmates there have been winnowed down to an even higher percentage \nof committed killers than were there before. Americans still do not \nwant these men in their neighborhoods. They saw what the residents of \nAlexandria, VA, endured a few years ago when just one terrorist was \nheld there, and they do not want armed agents patrolling their streets, \nID checks, bomb-sniffing dogs, or millions of their tax dollars \ndiverted to secure terrorists.\n\n  When we voted on this question 2 years ago, the prospect of shipping \nterrorists to U.S. soil was not imminent, even though the previous \nadministration had expressed a desire to close the facility at some \npoint. The new administration, on the other hand, set an arbitrary date \nfor closure before it even had a chance to review the intelligence and \nthe evidence of the 240 men who are down at Guantanamo now.\n  So I think it is perfectly appropriate, as we look to ensure the \nsafety of the American people, to have another vote on this issue. \nLater this week, we will have an opportunity to do just that as the \nSenate takes up the supplemental war spending bill. The administration \nhas requested funds within this bill to close Guantanamo, and Senators \nshould take this opportunity to clarify their positions. So we will \nhave a number of amendments this week on the supplemental that will \nallow the Senate to express itself once again on this most important \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5544-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss a \ntroubling situation a world away in Burma. The situation involves Nobel \nPeace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who, this very morning, stood \ntrial--stood trial this very morning--for permitting a misguided soul \nto enter her house.\n  With some regularity, we in the West are reminded of the tyranny that \nexists in this troubled land.\n  In 2007, Buddhist monks and other peaceful Burmese protesters were \nbrutally put down by Government authorities. Scores were slain, \nhundreds more were imprisoned or had to flee the country simply to \nsurvive.\n  In 2008, Burma was lashed by a terrible cyclone. This natural \ndisaster was exacerbated by a manmade disaster: the dismal relief and \nresponse effort of the governing State Peace and Development Council, \nwhich refused outside aid in the immediate aftermath, resulting in \nuntold numbers of Burmese citizens dying. At the same time, the regime \ndevoted its energies to its referendum of its new Constitution, a \ndocument clearly intended to permanently entrench military rule.\n  In 2009, this familiar pattern of governmental malfeasance has \ncontinued. First, the Government refused to permit Suu Kyi's doctor to \nsee her, despite her very poor health. Then the Government took the \nflimsiest of pretexts to drag Suu Kyi into this trial.\n  It was in this context that the Obama administration last week issued \nan Executive order extending for another year sanctions against the \nBurmese regime. I applaud the administration for taking this step, and \nI look forward to working with the administration once it has concluded \nits review of Burma policy, which I have discussed on several occasions \nwith Secretary Clinton.\n  The Government of Burma should be aware that its actions are highly \ntroubling to democracies the world over. This is reflected not only in \nthe administration's new Executive order but also in the strong support \nthe Burmese people enjoy in the Senate. My colleagues and I on both \nsides of the aisle will continue to follow Suu Kyi's trial with great \ninterest and deep concern.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the \nsubject of health care reform. I support President Obama's call for \nhealth care reform legislation this year. It has long been obvious that \nthere is a need for health care reform in the United States. There are \nsome 47 million people, perhaps more--the precise figure is not known--\nwho do not have health insurance or who are underinsured.\n  I have prepared an extensive statement outlining some of the issues \nwhich I think ought to be addressed, and I have sought recognition this \nafternoon to summarize those comments briefly. I ask unanimous consent \nthat, at the conclusion of my statement, the full text of my statement \nbe included in the Record as if read in full.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the question of health care coverage has \nlong been debated in the Congress. There is a general consensus that we \nneed to cover all Americans who, as I say, either have no insurance or \nare underinsured.\n  In my capacity as ranking member or chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education for more \nthan a decade, I have taken the lead, along with Senator Tom Harkin--\nthen on a bipartisan basis, where we, as we have said frequently, have \nshifted the gavel seamlessly--to provide for a great deal of health \ncare coverage. During that time, the issue of funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health has received special attention, where that figure \nhas been raised from some $12 billion to $30 billion; and with the \nrecent stimulus package, an additional $10 billion has been added. In \naddition to extensive coverage and increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, which resulted in very substantial improvements \nin the health of Americans on items such as stroke and cancer and heart \ndisease, that subcommittee has taken the lead on many other health care \nissues, which I will not take time now to enumerate.\n  I have cosponsored the legislation proposed on a bipartisan basis by \nSenator Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Bennett, Republican of \nUtah. I have had a series of discussions with Senator Baucus, chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and discussed the issue with Senator Enzi, \nranking member on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, \nand have directed my staff to work with the staffs of all the other \nSenators. I have noted the comment made by Senator Grassley when he \ncame from a meeting at the White House of the interest in a bipartisan \napproach, and noted Senator\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nEnzi's statement that it was his hope we would have a consensus for \nperhaps as many as 80 Senators, which I think is the objective. But one \nway or another, I do support what the President has said about moving \nforward health care insurance at this time.\n  It is my preference, my position, that we rely principally on the \nprivate sector. I think it is undesirable to put a massive bureaucracy \nbetween the doctor and the patient. I am open to some intervention on a \npublic plan, as I delineate in my formal written statement. \nPennsylvania has a plan where, when the insurance was unavailable on \nmedical liability, the State stepped in with an insurance plan. And \nthen, when the insurance was available, the plan was to have it phased \nout.\n  I have noted with interest the suggestions made by Senator Schumer to \nhave a public sector for a number of dimensions. One is to cover areas \nwhere there are no private plans. Certainly that is something that \nought to be considered so that everyone has the availability of health \ncare coverage. Senator Schumer's proposal further delineates the \nstanding of a public plan to be on a level playing field with the \nprivate sector, and has specified a number of issues where that level \nplaying field would be maintained, and they are specified in some \ndetail in my written statement, although not exhaustively.\n  Here again, it is a matter for discussion and deliberation. Health \ncare reform is an opportunity for the United States Senate to verify \nand confirm its standing as the world's greatest deliberative body. All \nof these ideas are in their formative stages, and plans are being \nworked on. We have the Wyden-Bennett model. I joined that plan, not \nthat I thought it was perfect--and in my floor statement adding my \ncosponsorship I specified the concerns I had--but I thought it was \nhighly desirable. At that time there were some 14 Senators, equally \ndivided between the two parties, which provided a critical mass, and I \nthought that was a good start to give impetus.\n  Of course, with President Obama's emphasis, with his convening a \nforum on health care, where I was invited to attend and did \nparticipate, we are moving forward. I think it is very important to \nfocus on items where we may have savings within the existing health \ncare system. We have had very substantial Federal involvement in the \nTARP program proposed by President Bush last fall, which is very \nexpensive. We have had very substantial Federal expenditures on \nPresident Obama's stimulus package, of which we all know the cost. And \nat a time when there is a substantial deficit and a very substantial \nnational debt, we ought to look for ways for savings, and I think there \nare some very specific and concrete ways where savings can be obtained.\n  I begin that analysis with the National Institutes of Health. What \nbetter way to cut down on health care costs than to prevent illness. \nWhat better way than to have scientific research provide the ways to \nprevent illness. I have introduced specific legislation recently--again \ndelineated in some detail in my written statement--on a Cures \nAcceleration Network, an effort to bring the research from the National \nInstitutes of Health, from the laboratory, to the bedside--as it is \nsummarized, from bench to the bedside. The advances in medical \nresearch, statistics--and again they are delineated in my formal \nwritten statement--specify the tremendous improvements in health, where \nmortality has gone up and prolonged or saved lives in so many fields--\ncancer, heart disease, stroke, et cetera. When you have a program for \nhealth care, then I think there are realistic ways to save money; where \npeople who develop chronic ailments, which are very expensive, can be \nameliorated or perhaps even prevented, but holding down health care \ncosts.\n  A separate item, which has received considerable attention, and which \nI spoke about at the President's health forum, is lifestyle, on \nexercise and on diet. Those are items which I have always been \nconcerned about, being a squash player almost on a daily basis, and \nmore recently taking up weight training as a result of an experience I \nhave had with Hodgkin's and with some of the efforts to bring back \nbalance. I feel that exercise is very important. My wife has always \nbeen very consistent on dietary considerations. There are some programs \nI recently heard a presentation on by the chief executive officer of \nSafeway on exercise and health, and there is a correlation along some \nlines in reducing health care premiums depending on people avoiding \nsmoking, exercising, and care for their diet. I do believe there are \nvery substantial savings that are involved. It would be my hope that \nthe Congressional Budget Office could quantify some of these savings--\nsavings on NIH, savings on lifestyle, savings on advanced directives. \nAnd in presenting a health care reform plan to the American people, I \nbelieve it would be enormously beneficial to be able to point to these \nsavings as offsets to whatever the cost may be.\n  On the subject of advanced directives and living wills, there is a \ngreat deal to be saved. One study showed as much as 27 percent of \nMedicare costs in the last few days, few months, or the last year of a \nperson's life. No one ought to say to anybody else what their directive \nshould specify in terms of what kind of care they want under those \ncircumstances, but I think it is fair to ask people to focus on it, to \nthink about it, and to make a directive in that respect--revocable, \nthey can change it but not leave it to the family in some extremist \nsituation when they are in the hospital and the passion is all in one \ndirection or another.\n\n  On the subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, \nwe took the lead on including information in the ``Medicare and You'' \nhandbook to encourage people to have advanced directives and living \nwills, so that is an item where a savings could be attained.\n  Another line for possible savings would be a toughening up of \ncriminal penalties for people who cheat on Medicare and Medicaid. From \nmy experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, I saw very concrete \nexamples about the effectiveness of jail sentences on deterrence. If we \nare dealing with a domestic dispute or dealing with a barroom drunken \nknife brawl, tough sentences are not going to deter anybody. But if we \ntalk about white collar crime, talk about people who are thoughtful in \nthe way they may engage in Medicare fraud or Medicaid fraud, jail \nsentences would be effective. This is a subject I have taken up with \nthe Attorney General and with the Assistant Attorney General in the \nCriminal Division. It will be the subject of a hearing this Wednesday \nafternoon, the day after tomorrow, when we will bring in experts in the \nfield of Medicare and Medicaid and get into the issue as to what kind \nof savings might be available.\n  That is a brief summary of the longer written statement I have. I \nwill conclude by emphasizing my thought that all Americans need to be \ncovered with adequate health care assurance, and this is a matter of \nthe highest priority. It is President Obama's No. 1 priority, as I \nunderstand it, and I think properly so. I am prepared, as I said \nbefore, to put my shoulder to the wheel to try to get this job done. \nThe experience in the Subcommittee on Appropriations for Health and \nHuman Services provides some insights and some guidance, and it is \nsomething I think we ought to accomplish.\n  I have already asked consent my full statement be printed in the \nRecord. I would ask the stenographer to print it out exactly as if I \nread it. Sometimes it appears in smaller type, so I would like it in \nbig type and, with the explanation I have given, people will understand \nwhy there is some repetition between these extemporaneous comments and \nthe written text.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt America is in need of major health \ncare reform. With a reported 47 million people without health insurance \nthe status quo is not acceptable. Additionally, there are millions more \nAmericans who are underinsured, with health insurance that is \ninadequate to cover their needs. Families are forced to make tough \nsacrifices in order to pay medical expenses or make the agonizing \nchoice to go without health care coverage. There are far too many \nAmericans whose financial and physical health is jeopardized by the \nrising costs of health care.\n  In the coming weeks and months Congress will consider health care \nreform which seeks to address the health care crisis, by addressing \naccess to\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nquality care, wellness programs and payment improvements. We need to \nagree on a balanced, common sense solution that reins in costs, \nprotects the personal doctor-patient relationship and shifts our focus \nto initiatives in preventive medicine and research.\n  I believe that ensuring all Americans have access to quality, \naffordable health care coverage is essential for the health and future \nof our Nation. The creation of an insurance pooling system, such as the \none established in Massachusetts in 2006, could serve as a model to \nprovide health insurance to all individuals. The Massachusetts program \ncreated a connector which allowed individuals to group together to \nimprove purchasing power to achieve affordable, quality coverage for \nthe entire population and to equitably share risk. However, Congress \nmust be mindful of the cost of providing this care and reforms should \nnot affect those who want to maintain their current insurance through \ntheir employer.\n  Health reform legislation should include health benefit standards \nthat promote healthy lifestyles, wellness programs and provide \npreventive services and treatment needed by those with serious and \nchronic diseases. Health care coverage must be affordable with \nassistance to those who do not have the ability to pay for health care. \nWhile I am concerned about a requirement to obtain health insurance, I \nunderstand that without it, health providers are forced to write off \nexpensive, uncompensated care that we all pay in the form of higher \npremiums.\n  In reforming health care we must work to ensure equity in health care \naccess, treatment, and resources to all people and communities \nregardless of geography, race or preexisting conditions. The effort to \nimprove health care should improve care in underserved communities in \nboth urban and rural areas.\n  The effect of these reforms on employers and providers must be kept \nin mind. Affordable and predictable health costs to businesses and \nemployers and effective cost controls that promote quality, lower \nadministrative costs and long-term financial sustainability should be a \npart of these reforms. Payment reforms for physicians and other health \nproviders should reflect the cost of providing health care so that \nthere will be providers in the future.\n  This legislation will present an opportunity to address a number of \nother health related issues, including fraud and abuse in the health \ncare industry, advanced directives, medical research and Medicare \nreforms. These ideas are an outline for health care reform legislation, \nwhich I believe can benefit all Americans. I am eager to discuss these \nideas and look forward to hearing from constituents, colleagues and \ninterested parties on all aspects of health care reform.\n  On March 5, 2009, at the request of President Obama, I participated \nin the White House Forum on Health Reform. During this forum, my \ncolleagues from the Senate and House of Representatives and other \nhealth care interest representatives shared priorities and concerns for \nhealth care reform. This open process helped flush out ideas and \ndevelop a path for reform. Since that time, regional forums have been \nheld throughout the country so more voices can be heard on this \nimportant issue and President Obama has worked closely with those \nrepresenting all health care sectors to find common ground on reform. \nThis effort was highlighted on May 12, 2009, by an agreement with \nexecutives of a number of groups, including the Service Employees \nInternational Union and PhRMA, to provide $2 trillion in health care \nsavings.\n  While the White House Health Forum was a bipartisan event, I am \nconcerned that the passage of health reform legislation could be lost \nto partisanship. The effort to bring about health reform can and should \nbe a bipartisan effort. As a cosponsor of the Healthy Americans Act, \nintroduced by Senators Wyden and Bennett and cosponsored by seven \nDemocrats and four Republicans, I have firsthand experience with \nfinding common ground on health care.\n  From the outset, the goal for passage of this legislation should be \nto have 80 Senators vote in support of it. Recently Senator Grassley, \nafter a lunch with President Obama, noted that ``the White House \nprefers a bipartisan agreement.'' While some people have indicated they \nwould prefer a bill passed by 51 percent, the White House's sentiments \nare encouraging. We have to try to get as broad a base as possible to \nget a bill passed.\n  The most talked about issue to date is that of a public plan or \nGovernment-operated program competing against private plans in the \ninsurance market. A starting point for discussion on this issue could \nbe the proposal made by Senator Schumer on May 4, 2009, which seeks to \nmaintain a level playing field between the private sector and any \npublic plan. The proposal holds that any public program should comply \nwith all the rules and standards by which the private insurers must \nabide. The principles include that the public plan should be self-\nsustaining through premiums and co-pays. Further, the public plan \nshould not be subsidized by Government funds and must maintain a \nreserve fund as private insurers do; not require health care providers \nto participate because they participate in Medicare and payments to \nproviders must be higher than Medicare; be required to offer the same \nminimum benefits as private plans; and be managed by different \nofficials than those regulating the insurance market.\n  I recently spoke with Senator Enzi about this issue and he raised \nsome concerns regarding fair competition between private and public \nplans. Specifically, he was concerned that there wouldn't be a level \nplaying field as the Government doesn't have to make a profit, whereas \nprivate companies do. Further, if the public plan becomes insolvent \nwill the Government intervene? I agree that competition lies at the \nheart of any successful market economy and these concerns and others \nneed to be addressed as we discuss and consider a public plan option.\n  There are many variations in which a public plan could be brought \nforward, including offering it as a fallback if no private insurers are \nwilling to provide coverage in a region. In Pennsylvania, a State \nadministered insurance program for doctors and hospitals was \nestablished to provide access to medical malpractice insurance. This \nprogram could be phased out if the insurance commissioner certifies, \npursuant to annual review, that sufficient private insurance capacity \nexists. These principles could be extended to a public plan offered to \nindividuals. Whereby a public plan could be put into place subject to \nannual certification by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that \na public plan is necessary to provide stable and affordable health \ninsurance; if it isn't needed then the Government plan shall be \nprivatized or eliminated.\n  This issue will be hotly debated as health reform moves forward. As \nwe begin, let me be clear that I am opposed to placing a giant \nbureaucracy between a doctor and patient regarding health decisions. \nAmericans should be able to get treatment when they need it, and I will \nwork to protect this right as we move forward. As I have stated, I am \nopen to discussing the best method in which to cover all Americans, \nincluding considering a public plan option and look forward to \nexamining all of the options with my colleagues as the legislation \nprogresses.\n  Another issue that will be the focus of great debate will be the cost \nof the legislation. Until bill language is produced by the Finance and \nHELP Committees, it will be difficult to determine the cost of health \nreform. A recent estimate of this reform is $120 billion per year, \nwhich is, by all standards, a large sum. However, the cost of inaction \nmay be far greater. The United States spent approximately $2.2 trillion \non health care in 2007, or $7,421 per person. This comes to 16.2 \npercent of gross domestic product, nearly twice the average of other \ndeveloped nations. Every effort to find cost saving proposals that can \nalso bring improvements to health reform should be included in this \nlegislation.\n  The National Institutes of Health--NIH--is the crown jewel of the \nFederal Government and is responsible for enormous strides in combating \nthe major ailments of our society including heart disease, diabetes, \ncancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. I believe continued \nfunding for the NIH and medical research should be another tenet of the \nhealth care debate. The NIH provides funding for biomedical research at \nour Nation's universities, hospitals, and research institutions. I\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\nalong with Senator Harkin led the effort to double funding for the NIH \nfrom 1998 through 2003. When I became chairman of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee in 1996, \nfunding for the NIH was $12 billion; in fiscal year 2009 funding was \nincreased to $30 billion.\n  Regrettably, Federal funding for NIH has steadily declined from the \n$3.8 billion increase provided in 2003, when the 5-year doubling of NIH \nended. To jumpstart the funding in NIH, I worked to include a provision \nin the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to increase NIH funding \nby a total of $10 billion.\n  NIH research has provided tremendous benefits to many individuals \nwith diseases. The following are examples of the cost of and success in \nreducing cancer deaths and cardiovascular disease.\n  Cancer: The NIH estimates overall costs of cancer in 2007 at $219.2 \nbillion: $89 billion for direct medical costs; $18.2 billion for lost \nproductivity due to illness; and $112 billion for loss of productivity \ndue to premature death.\n  Breast Cancer: Breast cancer death rates have steadily decreased in \nwomen since 1990. The 5-year relative survival for localized breast \ncancer has increased from 80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. \nIf the cancer has spread regionally, the current 5-year survival is 84 \npercent.\n  Childhood cancer: For all childhood cancers combined, 5-year relative \nsurvival has improved markedly over the past 30 years, from less than \n50 percent before the 1970s to 80 percent today.\n  Leukemia: Death rates have decreased by about 0.8 percent per year \nsince 1995. For acute lymphocytic leukemia, the survival rate has \nincreased from 42 percent in 1975-1977 to 65 percent in 1996-2003.\n  Lymphoma: The 5-year survival rates for Hodgkin's lymphoma has \nincreased dramatically from 40 percent in 1960-1963 to more than 86 \npercent in 1996-2003. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the survival rates \nhave increased from 31 percent in 1960-1963 to 63.8 percent in 1996-\n2003.\n  Prostate Cancer: Over the past 25 years, the 5-year survival rate has \nincreased from 69 percent to almost 99 percent.\n  Cardiovascular disease: According to the American Heart Association, \nthe estimated direct and indirect cost of cardiovascular disease in the \nUnited States in 2008 was $448.5 billion.\n  Coronary artery disease: Between 1994 and 2004, the number of deaths \nfrom coronary artery disease declined by 18 percent.\n  Stroke: Between 1995 and 2005, the number of stroke deaths declined \n13.5 percent.\n  These are tremendous accomplishments and more must be done to build \non our advancements. We ought to include the $10 billion in stimulus \nmoney in the NIH base funding level to see to it that the funding was \nnot just a one-time shot. The $10 billion that was provided in the \nstimulus package for NIH was for a 2-year period; however, I feel that \nthat $10 billion should be added to the $30 billion already \nappropriated in fiscal year 2009. I support a funding level of $40 \nbillion for fiscal year 2010 which would require raising the \nappropriation by another $5 billion.\n  Scientists have approached me with stories of how NIH grant \napplications have skyrocketed since the NIH funding increase in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act and that the boost has \nencouraged a new generation of scientists to dedicate themselves to \nmedical research. The effort to increase NIH funding should also be \nmatched by an effort to translate scientific discoveries in the \nlaboratory to the patient's bedside. To meet this need, I introduced S. \n914, to establish the cures acceleration network--CAN. This $2 billion \nnetwork would be a separate independent agency and would not take \nresearch dollars away from the NIH. The network would make research \nawards to promising discoveries. The grant projects would also have a \nflexible expedited review process to get funds into the hands of \nscientists as quickly as possible. Drugs or devices that were funded by \nthe CAN--would benefit from a streamlined FDA review to speed up the \napproval process for patient use. Implementing this legislation as part \nof health reform would enhance the important research of NIH by \nbridging the chasm between a basic scientific discovery and new health \ncare treatments.\n  The issue of end of life treatment is such a sensitive subject and no \none should decide for anyone else what decision that person should make \nfor end-of-life medical care. Advanced directives give an individual an \nopportunity to make the very personal decision as to the nature of care \na person wants at the end of their life. That is, to repeat, a highly \npersonalized judgment for the individual.\n  Advanced directives should be examined because of the great expense \nof end of life care. Statistics show that 27 percent of Medicare \nexpenditures occur during a person's last year of life. Beyond the last \nyear of life, a tremendous percentage of medical costs occur in the \nlast month, weeks and days. It has been estimated that the use of \nadvanced directives could save 6 percent of all Medicare spending or \n$24 billion in 2008.\n  Individuals should have access to information about advanced \ndirectives. As part of a public education program, I included an \namendment to the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of \n2003, which directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ninclude in its annual ``Medicare and You'' handbook, a section that \nspecifies information on advanced directives, living wills, and durable \npowers of attorney. As the former ranking member and chairman of the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I worked to ensure that this information continues to be \npublished in the ``Medicare and You'' handbook.\n  There are many ways which have been discussed to improve the use of \nadvanced directives. One approach could be to increase education for \nbeneficiaries. It has also been suggested that filling out an advanced \ndirective could be a requirement for joining Medicare. Another \nsuggestion I received was to provide a discount on Medicare Part B \npremiums for those who fill out an advanced directive. While efforts to \ninform beneficiaries have improved, including a requirement that the \nissue be discussed at the beneficiaries' introductory Medicare exam, \nmore must be done to increase usage of advanced directives. On this \nfront, I am eager to explore and analyze the range of possibilities \nwhile ensuring that individuals and their families' sensitivities \nsurrounding the end of life care receive paramount priority.\n\n  Some of the most prevalent diseases of today can be prevented by \nsmall changes in people's behavior. For example, 30 minutes of moderate \nphysical activity each day, the equivalent of a brisk walk, can reduce \nthe risk of a heart attack by up to 50 percent. Increasing one's fruit \nand vegetable consumption can reduce the risk of colon cancer by up to \n50 percent. Obese and overweight individuals suffering metabolic \nsyndrome and Type 2 diabetes showed health improvements after only 3 \nweeks of diet and moderate exercise. Health care reform should include \npolicies that encourage people to make responsible decisions about \ntheir health and create environments to do so. The health benefits are \nreal, achievable, measurable, and cost effective.\n  One way in which to encourage healthy behavior is through health \neducation in schools, which is proven to reduce the prevalence of \nhealth risk behaviors among young people. For example, health education \nresulted in a 37 percent reduction in the onset of smoking among 7th \ngraders. In addition, obese girls in the 6th and 8th grades lost weight \nthrough a health education program, and students who attended a school-\nbased life-skills training program were less likely than other students \nto smoke or use alcohol or marijuana.\n  Funding community-based health programs could also be a tenet of \nhealth reform. In July 2008, the Trust for America's Health stated that \nan investment of $10 per person per year in proven community-based \nprograms to increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent \nsmoking and other tobacco use could save the country more than $16 \nbillion annually within 5 years. This is a return of $5.60 for every $1 \ninvested. Opportunities to save money on the cost of health care \nthrough education and proactive community based prevention programs \nshould be included in health reform legislation.\n  Surveying recent caselaw reveals that individual criminals convicted \nof\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nhealth care fraud can be sentenced to anywhere from 5 to 13 years in \nprison, substantial penalties and supervised release for a period of \nyears. In any health care reform proposal, I believe we must address \nthe significant potential for people of ill will and profit motives to \ndefraud the Government at the expense of the taxpayers. Therefore, I \nwill push hard for enhanced sentences with real jail time for white \ncollar fraudsters. As the chairman of the Crime and Drug Judiciary \nSubcommittee, I will push for consideration of sentencing enhancements \nas at least one alternative and, where appropriate, lengthy jail \nsentences where the financial losses to the Government are great. It \nwould be intolerable for criminals to defraud the Government of \nmillions of dollars only to have to pay a fine that amounts to the cost \nof doing business.\n  According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau and the National \nHealth Care Anti-Fraud Association, the annual loss from health fraud \nis 10 percent of the $2.2 trillion spent annually on health care, or \n$220 billion. This amount of fraud must be identified and warrants real \njail time, which should be taken up in this reform.\n  Health care reform provides an opportunity to correct a longstanding \nproblem in the Medicare payment system. In determining the payments to \nhospitals for services, Medicare takes into account the location of a \nhospital and how much those employees are paid. It is understandable \nthat some areas of the country, where the cost of living is higher, \nshould be reimbursed at higher levels. However, the current system has \nled to many imbalances that have left some areas of the country \ndisadvantaged. In Pennsylvania, for example, the Scranton--Wilkes-Barre \narea and Allegheny Valley have received decreasing Medicare payments, \nwhich have forced a pay reduction to employees and a reduction in \nservices to patients that rely on them.\n  Last year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission--MedPAC--released \na report calling for the system to be reformed. The commission stated \nthat the current system created ``cliffs'' in payments, which resulted \nin arbitrary changes in payments in neighboring areas. These \ndisparities can affect competition for employees and will harm services \nto Medicare beneficiaries. This legislation must include the reforms \nsupported by MedPAC to correct this serious problem of inequity.\n  The health care crisis in our country endangers the health of our \npeople, our economic viability and our future stability. Now, more so \nthan ever before, it is critical that we pass legislation to ensure all \nAmericans have access to quality and affordable health care. This \nundertaking requires prompt and effective action. I remain open to \nideas on how to accomplish this exceptional task and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to determine the best path to do so.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5548-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5548-S5549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CREDIT CARD REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this week we will once again take up \nlegislation--and, hopefully, finish it--called the credit card reform \nbill. I wanted to speak for a few minutes about what the bill contains \nand why it is important we enact that legislation.\n  I have spoken many times in the last year and a half about the \nsubprime mortgage scandal. It is another adjunct of this. A substantial \namount of debt, debt to purchase a home, is not unusual. Almost no one \ncan purchase a home by using cash because they don't have that kind of \ncash. So they borrow money, which is called a home mortgage. The \nsubprime home mortgage scandal is unbelievable, and I have spoken about \nit at length. I have shown advertisements from Countrywide Mortgage \nwhich was the largest mortgage lender, from Millennium Mortgage and \nZoom Credit, and other mortgage companies that were advertising to \npeople with: If you have been bankrupt, if you have bad credit, if you \ndon't pay your bills on time, come to us. We will give you a mortgage. \nIt was unbelievable what was going on. Bad credit, no credit, slow \ncredit, bankrupt, come to us. We will give you a home mortgage.\n  That sort of thing steered this country's economy right into the \nditch and caused a massive amount of problems. Now we see all of these \nforeclosures and banks in trouble. It is an unbelievable mess. At its \nroot is a substantial amount of greed and a massive amount of mortgage \ndebt. In some cases mortgages were made to people who couldn't pay \nthem, with teaser rates of 2 percent which, when reset, would be 10 and \n12 percent, and prepayment penalties so that someone couldn't get out \nof this mess. It is unbelievable. That is the home mortgage subprime \nscandal. A lot of folks got rich. The guy who ran Countrywide Mortgage \nleft with $200 million. The company collapsed, a substantial amount of \npeople were injured and hurt, but he left with a couple hundred million \ndollars. He was given the Horatio Alger award. He won businessman of \nthe year, a big deal. He steered his company right into the ditch as \nwell.\n  This isn't about subprime mortgages. It is about another form of \nindebtedness, credit card debt. Let me talk for a moment about where we \nfind ourselves with credit cards. It is interesting. In 2008, there \nwere 4.2 billion credit card solicitations sent to consumers. Think of \nthat, 4.2 billion credit card solicitations sent to consumers. We are \ntold it was a bad year--the economy was collapsing--but apparently not \nin the credit card industry. The average credit card debt per household \nthat has a balance is $10,000. That is the average credit card debt of \nhouseholds that have a credit card balance. Total amount of credit made \navailable by issuers in 2007 was about $5 trillion.\n  This legislation will start to help to curb some of the unfair credit \ncard practices. Let me be quick to say that I use credit cards. I am \nsure all of my colleagues do. There is a very significant value to \ncredit cards. I am not suggesting there is not. I am saying, when you \nwallpaper the entire country with credit cards, including especially \ntargeting kids who have no jobs, and then saying, as they did in the \nsubprime mortgage, if you have bad credit, come to us, we will give you \na credit card, there is something wrong with that. Yet that is what has \nbeen happening. Now we are seeing credit card companies who have had \ncustomers for 5, 10, 20 years, who have never been late with a payment, \njack up their interest rates from 7 percent to 27 percent. Credit card \nholders are completely astounded by the penalties and interest rate \nincreases, despite the fact that they have never had a late payment. \nThose are some of the abuses that have existed. This legislation will \nbegin to deal with those abuses.\n  Let me show a couple of charts. This is an advertisement for a \nplatinum card. It says:\n\n       Even if your credit is less than perfect.\n\n  That is just a little offshoot of what they did in the subprime \nmortgage. Hey, if your credit ain't perfect, as they say, come to us. \nYou got bad credit, slow credit, no credit, been bankrupt, come over \nhere; let us give you a hand. That is what this credit card says.\n  Here is a debit card. This is one by the Bank of America. It makes a \npoint but that I think is important. You can see the colors on this \ndebit card. Obviously, this is aimed at kids. This is obviously a \nchildren's approach to Joe Camel for cigarettes. But we have a debit \ncard that is about the same thing.\n  Let me show first this chart. This shows Bruce Guiliano, senior vice \npresident for licensing for Sanrio, Inc., which owns the Hello Kitty \nbrand. That is the next card I will show you. It says:\n\n       We think our target age group will be from 10 to 14, \n     although it certainly could be younger.\n\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\n\n  Can you imagine grown men and women sitting around saying: What is \nour target group for credit cards. We think this is our target group \nfor the new Hello Kitty Platinum Plus Visa credit card. Is this \nunbelievable? If somebody said to you in class at Harvard Business \nSchool: Here is a business proposition. What do you think it will be \nlike if you run a company and you are putting credit cards out there \nand you are aiming credit cards at kids, 12-year-old kids.\n  This is, obviously, the Hello Kitty Platinum Plus card. I would love \nto know the person who thought this up, to ask: Are you nuts?\n  My son happened to get a credit cart solicitation a long while ago. \nHe is in college now. He got a solicitation from a credit card company \nsaying: We have a preapproved credit card for you, and we want you to \ntake a trip to Paris, France. So actually I came to the floor of the \nSenate and explained to this credit card company, my son is only 12 \nyears old. He is not going to Paris. He is not going to take your \ncredit card either.\n  But what are the credit card companies doing soliciting young kids to \nget a credit card?\n  This is not an accident. I just showed you: Our target audience is 10 \nto 14. So what do we do with the targets? We design a credit card, a \nHello Kitty Platinum Plus, pink and white and yellow. Unbelievable.\n  Let me show you a credit card for people who don't have such great \ncredit. They get a gold card. This is First Premier Bank. Here is what \nthey do. You don't have such good credit? We will give you a credit \ncard. Come on. The limit is going to be $250. It is going to be gold. \nBut here is the trick. In order to get this credit card that you can \nuse for up to $250, you have to pay a $48 annual fee. You have to pay a \n$29 account set-up fee, a $95 program fee and $7 a month for servicing. \nDoes that sound like good business to you? Not to me. It sounds like \nthe kind of thing I used to see in the movies. They wore strange suits \nwith big thick stripes, and they carried violin cases. They loaned each \nother money.\n  I understand this. Michigan State University. I could use this for \nany university. A credit card company wanting to wallpaper the dorms \nand fraternity houses of virtually anyone who is going to college. Most \nof them don't have a job; some do. I understand the value of a credit \ncard for a college student. What I don't understand is, the credit \ncards are given to a college student and, in many cases, the parents \nwill cosign because if the student doesn't have a job, you have to have \nthe parents' cosignature. Then all of a sudden the credit card limit is \nincreased without the permission of the cosigner. That is the game.\n  Here are some notes from constituents of mine. This is a couple from \nMinot:\n\n       My wife and I both have credit scores greater than 800 and \n     have never been late on any of our payments. So Capital One \n     just sent us a notice that our interest rate on our credit \n     card will almost triple.\n\n  Never been late, always made payments on time. Their interest rate is \ngoing to triple.\n  Here is one from Fairmount:\n\n       I just wanted to let you know how upset I am with the \n     credit card company (Citibank). They have decided to raise my \n     interest rate to 27 percent. I have always paid my bill on \n     time, have a good credit rating (820). Why would a company \n     that has been bailed out by taxpayers because of bad \n     practices then decide to stick it to us by raising interest \n     rates so high.\n\n  He refers to the local mafia, but the fact is, I know there are no \nlocal mafia there.\n  From Williston:\n\n       Enough is enough. We have shored up these banks with our \n     hard-earned tax dollars just to have them raise the interest \n     rates on their credit cards to 28 percent and 26.3 percent \n     for absolutely no reason. Something has to be done.\n\n  Let me reiterate that I think credit cards are valuable and useful. \nMost of us use credit cards. But what I think has happened is certain \npractices have evolved and developed that are pretty unseemly. A \npractice that says: We need to figure out how to go after kids. It \nreminds me of the tobacco debate. Because if you don't get a kid when \nthey are a kid, you are not going to get them to smoke; right? Anybody \nknow of somebody who has reached the age of 30 and they are sitting \naround their living room thinking to themselves, all right, I need to \ndo something different, what haven't I yet done that I should begin \ndoing, and decides the answer is to start smoking? Does anybody know \nanyone like that? The only way you get somebody to smoke is you find a \nkid and addict the kid to cigarettes. What about this, aiming a Visa \ncard at 10 to 14-year-olds? It is unbelievable to me.\n  We bring a bill to the floor of the Senate that we think we will vote \non tomorrow. We will have a cloture vote first. We will see if we can't \nput a stop to some of the practices that have allowed some of the same \ncompanies that have gotten substantial bailout funds to say to their \ncustomers, who have always paid their bills on time, never been late: \nWe have a treat for you. We have a big, old surprise in your mailbox. \nYou know that 7 percent or 9 percent interest rate you used to pay on \nyour credit card balance? No more. Now it is going to be 27 or 28 \npercent.\n  That is not a business practice I think is justifiable. I think \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby from the Banking Committee have brought \nus legislation that is necessary and one that will be helpful in trying \nto put a stop to unfair business practices.\n  I know there are some who say this is none of government's business. \nI think it is. When consumers are injured, consumers individually and \neven in a significant group are no match for the size of the companies \nthat have decided to engage in this and do this to the American people. \nThis legislation is very simple. It sets up the conditions under which \nwe will try to protect consumers from arbitrary interest rates, fee and \nfinance increases, and we will prohibit interest charges on paid-off \nbalances from previous billing cycles, prohibit interest charges on \ndebt that is paid on time. We will require payments to be applied first \nto the credit card balance with the highest interest rate. We will \nprotect students and other young consumers from aggressive credit card \nsolicitations. We will require greater disclosure of rates and terms \nand billings, details by credit card companies, and establish tougher \npenalties for companies that violate these laws.\n  This is not rocket science. It is very simple. When you engage in \nthese practices and start injuring consumers, often without their \nknowledge, when you are doing something that is fundamentally unfair \nand doing it all across the country, the Banking Committee, led by \nSenators Dodd and Shelby, has a right and the Senate has a right to \nsay: We will try to put a stop to it. There needs to be some semblance \nof fairness and equity for the American people. There are a whole lot \nof folks who go to work every day, work hard, try to do the best they \ncan to care for their family and deal with their daily lives. They pay \ntheir bills. They have credit cards. They pay those credit card bills. \nThey have made a deal with the credit card company over time about the \nconditions of that credit card bill, only to discover one day when they \ncome home from work their mailbox contains a little message from the \ncredit card company: Yes, you are a good customer. We have news for \nyou. You are going to pay higher fees and triple the interest rates, \nand there is not a thing you can do about it.\n\n  Well, do you know what? The American people can do something about it \nthrough the actions of the Senate. I think that is going to happen--\nbeginning tomorrow--and I think it will be good news for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am here to speak out in support of \nthe Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, which \nwill help to end the abusive practices of the\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\ncredit card industry that are hurting so many hard-working middle-class \nfamilies. I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for their efforts to \ncome together on a bill that protects consumers and brings so much \nneeded relief to Main Street families. It has been a long time in \ncoming. I wish we had been able to pass this a few weeks ago, but I am \nhopeful we will be able to get it done this week.\n  As families are sitting around the kitchen table looking at their \nbudgets, they have a lot of expenses to deal with--the basics such as \nfood, electricity, the rising cost of college and health care, and \ngrowing credit card bills.\n  Seventy-eight percent of households in this country have at least one \ncredit card. At the end of last year, Americans' credit card debt was \nmore than $972 billion. The average household debt is more than $8,300. \nThis does basically track--when you look back over the last 8 to 10 \nyears--where wages have gone down and expenses have gone up. I know \nthat before we entered this economic crisis, it was about $6,000 that \nthe average middle-class family was behind. Now you see $8,300--their \ncredit cards. But it is not just debt that families are paying off. In \n2006, two-thirds of the credit card companies' profits came from \ninterest payments.\n  So millions of families are dealing with huge amounts of credit card \ndebt at the same time they are dealing with the many other challenges \nthat are a result of this economic downturn. Their hours have been \nreduced or one of them may have lost a job or they may have difficulty \nsending their kids to college.\n  This isn't just an economic issue, it is also an issue of fairness \nand common sense. I believe Americans have the obligation and duty to \npay the debts they owe. But too many credit card companies are using \ndeceptive practices and fine print to take advantage of hard-working \nAmerican families. The credit card companies are using tiny words on \nthe back of the bills, and they are doing this to pad their own \nprofits.\n  Many companies hide the terms of the agreement behind fine print and \nconfusing language. They apply payments to the low-rate balances before \nhigh-rate balances and, worst of all, they raise interest rates without \nproper notice.\n  According to the Consumers Union, a study of the 12 largest credit \ncard issuers found that 93 percent of credit cards allowed the issuer \nto raise the interest rate ``at any time'' by changing the agreement; \n93 percent of credit cards allow the issuer--the credit card company--\nto raise the interest rate at any time by simply changing the \nagreement.\n  This isn't right. Credit card companies should not be making a profit \nby pulling the rug out from under American consumers.\n  When I think about this issue, I don't just think about that 93 \npercent figure, I think about people in my State who have played by the \nrules and used credit cards responsibly and made timely payments and \nhave good credit ratings--only to turn around and have the rules \nchanged.\n  I heard from one man in Mahtomedi, MN, who had a credit rating of \n800. He had never made a late payment, had never been delinquent on his \naccount in any way. He got word in April that his fixed rate of 5.9 \npercent was going up to 10.9 percent in May and would thereafter be a \nvariable rate; that is, what used to be a fixed rate at 5.9 percent \nwill be changing constantly. He will have no control.\n  He called the credit card company to complain and, do you know what. \nThe credit card company told him he ought to be happy because his was \none of the lower rate increases. They told him he should not take it \npersonally.\n  It is awfully hard not to take these rate increases personally when \nyou have not done anything to justify having your rate increased, when \nyou are going to have a tough time making ends meet anyway because of \nthe tough economy, and because you have to pay so much more to keep a \ncard you have had for years and years.\n  I also heard from a woman in St. Joseph, MN. She had her credit card \nfor 12 years. She had never been late on a payment and has her credit \ncard bill automatically paid from her checking account every month. She \nrecently contacted her credit card company because she noticed her \ninterest rate had suddenly gone up a lot in 1 month. She had received \nno advance notice from her bank about the interest rate increase.\n  But her problems didn't stop there. The problem was that the credit \ncard company applied the new interest rate to her existing balance, and \nwith the new interest rate factored in, her balance suddenly exceeded \nher available credit.\n  Do you know what? She got hit with another interest rate increase. \nThis woman, who had been a great customer for 12 years, saw her \ninterest rate go up from 8 percent, to 19.3 percent, to 27 percent--all \nin a matter of 16 days--and through absolutely no fault of her own. She \nstarted at 8 percent and she had the money deducted from her checking \naccount every month and she had not had any problems with late \npayments. She starts at 8 percent, goes up to 19.3 percent, and she \nends up at 27 percent--all in a matter of 16 days, through no fault of \nher own. They raised the interest rate without telling her, applied it \nto her existing account balance and, suddenly, she was stuck with a \nproblem she didn't even create.\n  In the letter she wrote to me, she asked some valid and heartbreaking \nquestions:\n\n       How is something like this legal? How can the credit card \n     companies make it even harder in such hard times?\n\n  These are questions a lot of hard-working Minnesotans and other \nAmericans are asking today, and they deserve answers.\n  We want Americans to pay their debt, and we want our businesses to \nsucceed, but consumers deserve a level playing field, they deserve some \nrules of the road, and they deserve an end to the abuses and deceptive \npractices by the credit card industry.\n  The credit card bill that is on the floor is going to do that. The \nbill will put commonsense rules into place to ensure fairness for \nconsumers.\n  First, the bill protects people from arbitrary interest rate \nincreases, such as we saw with the man from Mahtomedi, MN, and the \nwoman from St. Joseph, MN. It establishes fair rules and makes sense \nfor how and when companies can raise interest rates. Additionally, the \nbill prohibits credit card companies from increasing rates on a \ncardholder for the first year when that account is open.\n  Second, the bill requires credit card companies to give people 45 \ndays' notice of interest rate, fee, and finance charge increases. This \nwill ensure that people such as the woman from St. Joseph, MN, who \nwrote me, would not see any surprises on their credit card statements \nanymore. They will get a notice.\n  Third, the bill prevents credit card companies from charging abusive \nfees. For example, credit card companies would not be able to charge \nyou a fee for the ``privilege'' of paying down your credit card.\n  Fourth, the bill requires more transparency from credit card \ncompanies. Credit card bills will be mailed 3 weeks before they are due \nto give consumers plenty of advance warning. Credit card companies will \nhave to disclose any changes to the terms of a credit card agreement \nwhen people renew their cards. They will have to be upfront about the \nlength of time and the total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if people only make minimum monthly payments. I think that \nwould be helpful for many people I know, if they knew exactly how long \nit would take--if they just pay the minimum amount--and how much extra \nthey would be paying. They will have to post their credit card \nagreements on the Internet so people can look at them anytime and \ncompare them.\n  Fifth, the bill strengthens oversight of the credit card industry so \nwe can hold companies accountable for their behavior.\n  This legislation will give consumers much-needed protections from bad \npractices that have been going on for too long. It is the beginning of \nleveling the playing field.\n  If we are going to get our economy moving, we need to restore trust \nin our financial systems, and when it comes to the credit card \nindustry, that means protecting consumers from unfair practices and \nputting into place commonsense rules that will bring much-needed \ntransparency and accountability.\n  We will be voting on this bill shortly. When I cast my vote, I will \nbe voting\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\nfor all the people in my State who are working hard and playing by the \nrules and just want the credit card companies to do the same.\n  We cannot forget that the ultimate goal of reviving our economy is to \nmake it possible for people in this country--who have worked hard, done \neverything right, paid their bills, and gotten these credit card \nbills--to get ahead. This bipartisan legislation, which I cosponsored, \nwill end the unfair practices that have been going on too long for Main \nStreet families, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just left a ceremony in the Hart Office \nBuilding, not far from where we are meeting, which is an annual event \nwhere the University of Illinois presents the Senator Paul H. Douglas \nEthics in Government Award. The 2008 recipient is former Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. She is the first woman to be so honored.\n  There has been a long list of public servants who have distinguished \nthemselves with their integrity and their show of ethics in government \nwho have been acknowledged for this award, and Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor certainly follows in that tradition.\n  It was my good fortune as a young college student to work as an \nintern in the office of Senator Paul Douglas. It truly shaped my life \nand convinced me that public service was a good calling, and I was \nlucky, as I have said many times, to be inspired by the gospels of St. \nPaul--that would be former Senator Paul Douglas and former Senator Paul \nSimon--who showed me what I thought was the very best in public service \nin their honesty--not only dollar honesty but honesty on the issues. It \nis a great honor for me to continue and serve in the same Senate seat \nthat both of these men occupied.\n  But today the University of Illinois honored Sandra Day O'Connor, and \nshe is well deserving--the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. By the time her career was coming to a close, she became one of \nthe most decisive forces on that High Court. During her last decade on \nthe Court, 193 decisions were made by the Court by a vote of 5 to 4. \nOne Justice's vote made the difference, and in 148 of those 193 cases, \nthat one vote was cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  There were so many issues--issues regarding privacy, the rights of \npeople with disabilities, affirming the voting rights of Americans, \npreserving the rights of universities to use affirmative action, \nprotecting the rights established under McCain-Feingold to have cleaner \nelections in America, upholding State laws giving individuals their \nrights under health insurance contracts, preserving the authority of \nthe Federal Government to protect the environment, banning the \nexecution of children, reaffirming America's time-honored tradition of \nseparation of church and state.\n  One New York Times reporter wrote in 2001 that Justice O'Connor's \nvote tipped the scale so often that ``we are all living now in Sandra \nDay O'Connor's America.''\n  As I said a few moments ago in introducing her at this gathering, one \nof her most significant and oft-quoted opinions was a recent one--her \nlandmark decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in which she famously wrote:\n\n       A state of war is not a blank check for the President when \n     it comes to the rights of a Nation's citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor briefly today to add my \nvoice to so many Americans in gratitude to Sandra Day O'Connor for her \ngreat service to Arizona and to the United States of America and to the \nSupreme Court. I am glad her voice is still strong and part of the \npublic chorus, calling on us to be better as a people and better in \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe speech I gave during the awards ceremony.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Remarks by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Richard J. Durbin \n   Congratulating Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Receiving the 2008 \n           Senator Paul H. Douglas Ethics in Government Award\n\n       I would like to acknowledge University of Illinois \n     President Joseph White, Chairman Shah and members of the \n     University of Illinois Board of Trustees; Robert Rich and the \n     staff of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs; and \n     members of the Douglas family.\n       I also want to acknowledge the members of the Douglas \n     Senate family--those of us who had the good fortune to have \n     worked for Paul Douglas in the Senate and whose hearts and \n     minds and lives were enlarged by his example.\n       Sadly, there is one important member of the Douglas Senate \n     family who is missing this year. Paul Douglas lost the use of \n     his left arm when it was smashed to pieces in Okinawa in \n     World War II. But he gained another strong right arm when he \n     and Howard Shuman joined forces in the United States Senate. \n     On the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and so many \n     important battles, Howard Shuman truly was Paul Douglas' \n     ``right hand man.'' We are all free-er because of their \n     partnership. It's good to see Howard's daughter Ellen and \n     other members of the Shuman family here today.\n       We are here today to celebrate a woman whose courage, \n     character and wisdom helped preserve many of the same \n     principles that Paul Douglas spent his life fighting to \n     protect and enlarge. It is an honor to join you in \n     recognizing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n       Before I say a few words about Justice O'Connor, I want to \n     acknowledge another person whose wisdom and integrity has \n     served our nation so well--Supreme Court Justice David \n     Souter.\n       Thank you, Justice Souter, for your many years of service \n     to our nation and our Constitution. Your voice on the Court \n     has made a difference.\n       Someone asked me once where I found my political \n     inspiration.\n       I said, ``Most of it comes from the gospel of St. Paul.'' \n     Paul Douglas. And another brilliant and compassionate \n     statesmen, Paul Simon. Much of what I know that is good and \n     important about politics, I learned from them.\n       Paul Simon once said that the test for a Supreme Court \n     nominee is not where he or she stands on a given issue. The \n     real test is: Will this Justice use his or her power on the \n     Court to restrict freedom, or expand it?\n       Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter, you have both scored \n     high grades on the Paul Simon test. Our nation is better for \n     your service. And we are grateful to you.\n       If the man or woman President Obama nominates to serve as \n     America's next Supreme Court Justice is as independent, open-\n     minded and fair as the two of you--and I feel confident they \n     will be--our country and our Constitution will be in good \n     hands.\n       And now, regarding our guest of honor. What can you give a \n     woman who has already been inducted into the National Cowgirl \n     Hall of Fame?\n       It took 190 years and 101 male Justices before Sandra Day \n     O'Connor broke the gender barrier on the United States \n     Supreme Court. It took only 14 years and 16 male recipients \n     for Justice O'Connor to become the first women recipient of \n     the Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award. That is \n     progress.\n       Paul Douglas is most closely associated with the civil \n     rights movement. But he was a true egalitarian. He believed \n     in equality of opportunity for all people. And he greatly \n     admired strong, intelligent women.\n       He kept a series of photographs in his office. One was a \n     photo of one of his political heroes, Jane Addams, the great \n     social reformer from Chicago whom he first met in 1921.\n       My first introduction to Jane Addams was that 1966 \n     campaign. We started off by making a visit to Freeport to lay \n     flowers on the grave of Jane Addams.\n       I think it would make Senator Douglas quite proud to see an \n     award bearing his name presented to a woman who has done so \n     much to advance the causes of equal justice and equal \n     opportunity, which were so dear to him.\n       There are some strong similarities between Senator Douglas \n     and Justice O'Connor.\n       He grew up in the Maine woods. She grew up on a ranch in \n     the high desert on the Arizona-New Mexico border. It was in \n     those isolated environments of their childhoods that they \n     both developed a lifelong love of reading and learning.\n       (Of course, life on the Lazy B Ranch wasn't all books and \n     reading. By the time she was 8 years old, Justice O'Connor \n     could drive a truck ... mend a fence ... brand cattle ... and \n     shoot her own .22 caliber rifle. She had cowboys for friends \n     and a bobcat for a playmate--good preparation for all those \n     Supreme Court conferences.)\n       Another, more important similarity between Senator Douglas \n     and Justice O'Connor is their shared distrust of ideology.\n       Here is a fact about Paul Douglas that many people do now \n     know. His first foray into elected politics was running for \n     mayor of Chicago as a Republican. He was elected to the Board \n     of Alderman as an Independent. It wasn't until he first ran \n     for the Senate\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n     that he aligned himself with the Democratic Party.\n       Justice O'Connor's ability to see beyond partisan divides \n     was reflected early when every member of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee--from Strom Thurmond to Ted Kennedy--voted to \n     support her nomination. And it grew over her 24 years on the \n     Court.\n       Their mutual commitment to principle rather than political \n     ideologies enabled both Paul Douglas and Sandra Day O'Connor \n     to build coalitions to advance our nation's common good. And \n     for that, we are very grateful.\n       Here is another similarity: As a member of the Arizona \n     state Senate, Sandra Day O'Connor once introduced an \n     amendment to remove a misplaced comma from a bill.\n       As a college intern, I sat next to Senator Douglas many \n     nights as he read, and edited, and signed every single letter \n     that went out under his name. Because he couldn't use his \n     left arm, it was my job to pull the letters off the top of \n     the pile as he finished them. Believe me, no misplaced comma \n     ever escaped his editing pen, either.\n       But the most important similarity--the reason we are all \n     here today--is because, like Paul Douglas, Justice O'Connor \n     used the power she was given to defend and expand our \n     freedom. With her voice and her vote, she said--time and time \n     again--that government has an obligation to defend the \n     powerless from the powerful.\n       Justice O'Connor was always open to those who could make a \n     strong case. She listened to the arguments and weighed the \n     evidence.\n       During her last decade on the Court, 193 decisions were \n     decided by a vote of 5-to-4. One Justice's vote made the \n     difference. And in 148 of those 193 cases, that one vote was \n     cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n       She cast the fifth and deciding vote safeguarding \n     Americans' right to privacy; requiring that courtrooms be \n     accessible to people with disabilities; affirming the \n     obligation of states to protect the voting rights of \n     minorities; and preserving the rights of universities to use \n     affirmative action programs.\n       Justice O'Connor cast the deciding vote preserving the \n     right of the federal government under the McCain-Feingold law \n     to place reasonable restrictions on campaign contributions so \n     that special interest money can't gain overwhelm our \n     democracy--a vote, I think, that Senator Douglas would have \n     applauded.\n       She cast the deciding vote upholding state laws giving \n     individuals the right to a second doctor's opinion if their \n     HMO denies them treatment; preserving the authority of the \n     federal government to protect the environment; banning the \n     execution of children in America; and reaffirming America's \n     time-honored tradition of separation of church and state.\n       Indeed, as a New York Times reporter wrote in 2001, Justice \n     O'Connor's vote tipped the scales so often that--quote, ``we \n     are all living now in Sandra Day O'Connor's America.''\n       And that was before what is perhaps her most significant \n     opinion: the landmark decision of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in which \n     Justice O'Connor famously wrote: ``A state of war is not a \n     blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of \n     the Nation's citizens.''\n       It strikes me as ironic that Sandra Day O'Connor could have \n     grown up in a place called the Lazy B Ranch because lazy is \n     about the last word you could ever use to describe her. Since \n     leaving the Court nearly four years ago, she has written and \n     spoken extensively. She has been especially eloquent and \n     courageous in speaking out in defense of an independent \n     judiciary.\n       In 2005, she wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal \n     about those who seek to score political points by railing \n     against and trying to intimidate what they call ``activist \n     federal judges.''\n       She warned that ``using judges as punching bags presents a \n     grave threat to the independent judiciary.'' She added: ``We \n     must be more vigilant in making sure that criticism does not \n     cross over into intimidation ... that the current mood of \n     cynicism does not end up compromising the rule of law.\n       For all she has done to advance the cause of equal justice \n     and equal opportunity in America, and for her continued \n     defense of our courts and our Constitution, Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor is a true American she-ro and a worthy recipient \n     of the Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award. Thank you \n     again, Justice O'Connor, for your selfless service to our \n     nation.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating Tunisian American Day on May 27. This annual celebration is \nin recognition of the many contributions that Tunisian Americans have \nmade to enrich our culture and society.\n  The United States has maintained diplomatic relations with Tunisia \nfor more than two centuries. On March 26, 1799, the first agreement of \nfriendship and trade was concluded between the United States and \nTunisia. The first American consulate was established in Tunis, the \nTunisian capital, on January 20, 1800. On May 17, 1956, the United \nStates was the first major power to recognize the sovereign state of \nTunisia. Throughout the years, the United States and Tunisia have \nforged an amicable and enduring relationship that is based on a common \ncommitment to the ideals of democracy and liberty.\n  Currently, there are more than 13,500 Americans of Tunisian descent \nresiding in the United States. The Tunisian American community has made \ninvaluable contributions to improving our cultural diversity by sharing \ntheir proud heritage and rich cultural traditions.\n  As Tunisian Americans gather to celebrate Tunisian American Day, I \nwish them a joyous and inspiring day and thank them for their \ncontributions to cultural diversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5552-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5552-S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING DOM DeLUISE\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize Dom DeLuise's many accomplishments and the tremendous impact \nhe made on our lives.\n  Born in New York City, DeLuise entered acting at an early age. \nAlthough discouraged at first, he persisted in finding his way in the \nfield of entertainment and into the hearts of his fans. His hard work \nand dedication earned him many entertaining and prestigious acting \nroles in film, television, and theater. Many films which feature Dom \nDeLuise, such as ``The Cannonball Run,'' ``Blazing Saddles,'' ``History \nof the World Part 1,'' and ``Spaceballs'' have become classics in their \nown right and will ensure that future generations will enjoy and \nappreciate his talent.\n  Later in life, DeLuise worked toward furthering his love for the \nculinary arts and establishing himself as a chef. His efforts resulted \nin the publishing of two successful cookbooks: ``Eat This It Will Make \nYou Feel Better!'' and ``Eat This Too! It'll Also Make You Feel Good.''\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring \nDominick ``Dom'' DeLuise for his work, which touched the lives of \ngenerations of Americans. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Carol \nArthur, and his three sons, Peter, David and Michael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5553-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADRIAN DOMINICAN SISTERS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, service to your community and to \nthose most in need is one of the most important legacies we can leave \nas individuals or as institutions. It is with this in mind that I am \nhonored to congratulate the Adrian Dominican Sisters, the Congregation \nof the Most Holy Rosary as they celebrate their 125th anniversary \ntoday. Guided by the humble yet inspiring mission to seek truth, make \npeace, and reverence life, this congregation has made a profound and \nenduring impact on many lives.\n  The Adrian Dominicans trace their history back to the establishment \nof the Holy Cross convent in 1233. A presence in the United States was \nestablished in 1853 with the arrival in New York of three sisters from \nthis convent. Since the establishment of a hospital for injured \nrailroad workers in 1884 to meet a pressing need in the Adrian \ncommunity, the sisters of this congregation have devoted their energy, \ntalent, and efforts in pursuit of meeting the spiritual, educational, \nand practical needs of those within the Adrian community and those far \nbeyond its borders. Mother Camilla Madden was the first mother \nprovincial, and she became the first mother general when the province \nbecame an independent congregation in 1923.\n  Adrian has grown steadily since its founding and has not only \nmaintained a presence in Adrian, but has branched out into communities \nfar beyond through ministries in 31 States, the District Of Columbia, \nPuerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Italy, and Swaziland. The \nAdrian Dominican Sisters currently number more than 900 and are \ninvolved in ministries primarily in areas of education, health care, \nand social work. The congregation currently sponsors two universities, \nincluding Siena Heights University; two hospital systems; a long-term \nhealth care facility; three congregation-owned schools; and two retreat \ncenters.\n  The Adrian Dominican Sisters have impacted many throughout its rich \nhistory, and I am truly delighted to recognize this impressive \nmilestone, as well as their many important contributions over the \nyears. Their influence and service to the community are apparent and \nappreciated by the many who have benefitted from their many spiritual \nand outreach efforts. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating \nAdrian Dominican Sisters on 125 years of dedicated service, and I wish \nthem continued success as they build upon their legacy of \naccomplishment and excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5553-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5553-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/18/senate-section/article/S5553-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \n RESPECT TO BURMA, AS RECEIVED DURING AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON \n                          MAY 15, 2009--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

    \n\n[Pages S5556-S5561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1060. A bill to comprehensively prevent, treat, and decrease \noverweight and obesity in our Nation's populations; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Obesity \nPrevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2009. This legislation would \ndevelop a national strategy to organize our efforts to combat childhood \nand adult obesity. It would help foster unprecedented collaborations \nand collective actions across agencies, and among private entities, \nindividuals, and communities.\n  The prevalence of obesity in the U.S. has grown to staggering \nproportions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention National Center for Health Statistics, 66 percent of adults \nand 32 percent of children are considered either overweight or obese. \nOver the past 30 years, the obesity rate has more than doubled across \nall age groups. The U.S. now has the highest prevalence of obesity \namong the developed nations. In fact, the prevalence of obesity in the \nU.S. in 2006, 34 percent, is more than twice the average for other \ndeveloped nations.\n  The Obesity Prevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2009 \ncomprehensively addresses the obesity and overweight epidemic by \nfocusing on coordinating and augmenting existing prevention and \ntreatment activities. This legislation is based on recommendations of \nthe Institutes of Medicine, IOM, to confront the obesity epidemic. It \nfocuses on developing dynamic new collaborations and will improve \naccess for beneficiaries in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal \nprograms to nutritional counseling, prevention services, and physical \neducation programs.\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\n  Obesity is a costly problem for the U.S. both in terms of health care \nexpenditures and the loss of life. The incidence of type 2 diabetes, \nhigh blood pressure, and progressive liver disease--ailments once \nassociated only with adults--is rising among overweight children. These \nhealth risks compound with age, since overweight children and \nadolescents are more likely to become obese adults. For the first time \nin our history, the lifespan of a child born today may be less than \nthat of his or her parents. Interventions aimed at significantly \ndecreasing the prevalence of these illnesses are extremely cost \neffective and are critical to overall disease prevention and health \npromotion efforts. The Trust for America's Health recently reported \nthat an investment of just $10 per person per year in proven community-\nbased disease prevention programs would yield a $2.8 billion annual \nhealth expenditure reduction. Put another way, our nation would recoup \nnearly $1 over and above the cost of a comprehensive disease prevention \nand health promotion program for every $1 invested in the first 1 to 2 \nyears of the program. To that end, my legislation creates grant \nprograms to provide funding to schools, community health centers, \nacademic institutions, State medical societies, State health \ndepartments, and communities to reduce the prevalence of obesity and \nimprove the prevention and treatment of individuals who are obese or \noverweight.\n  The Obesity Prevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2009 \nestablishes the U.S. Council on Overweight & Obesity Prevention, USCO-\nOP, which is charged with creating a comprehensive strategy to prevent, \ntreat and reduce the prevalence of overweight individuals and obesity. \nThis advisory council will update Federal guidelines; identify best \npractices; conduct ongoing surveillance and monitoring of existing \nFederal programs; and make recommendations to coordinate budgets, \npolicies, and programs across Federal agencies in collaboration with \nprivate and public partners. In addition, the Council will help develop \nand update the daily physical activity requirements in our schools, and \nidentify activities that families can do together.\n  It is also critical to recognize that certain populations are more \nvulnerable than others to the obesity epidemic. Minorities, especially \nfrom Hispanic and Native American communities, are disproportionately \naffected by this disease. For example, in my home State of New Mexico, \napproximately 26 percent of Hispanic and 32 percent of Native American \nadolescents, grades 9-12, are overweight or obese; the rate of \nprevalence is less than 20 percent among white, non-Hispanic \nadolescents. I have, therefore, prioritized grants in this legislation \nto these populations and required Federal reporting on research and \ndata related to obesity in disproportionately affected groups. This \nincludes grants aimed at behavioral risk factors such as sedentary \nlifestyles and poor nutrition.\n  This bill will help further develop and then increase funding to the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. This \nwill help ensure that low-income children will have access to healthier \nfoods within their schools. In addition, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and the Secretary of Agriculture will be tasked to \nconsult with the USCO-OP to update and reform Federal oversight of food \nand beverage labeling. Such reforms include improving the transparency \nof labeling with regard to nutritional and caloric value of food and \nbeverages.\n  I think it is imperative that we provide treatment to those \nindividuals who are likely to develop obesity-related ailments before \nthe full onset of disease. The Obesity Prevention, Treatment and \nResearch Act of 2009 does this by expanding coverage of Medicare to \ninclude medical nutritional counseling for beneficiaries who are \noverweight or obese and are considered pre-diabetics. In addition, my \nlegislation gives States the option to include medical nutrition \ntherapy services in Medicaid and SCHIP.\n  There is no doubt that the obesity epidemic has grown immensely. I am \nconfident, however, that it can be stopped but it requires a nationwide \ncommitment for resolution. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto enact this legislation this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Obesity Prevention, \n     Treatment, and Research Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2001, the United States Surgeon General released the \n     Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity \n     to bring attention to the public health problems related to \n     obesity.\n       (2) Since the Surgeon General's call to action, the \n     problems of obesity and overweight have become epidemic, \n     occurring in all ages, ethnicities and races, and individuals \n     in every State.\n       (3) The United States now has the highest prevalence of \n     obesity among the developed nations, according to 2006 data \n     by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development. The prevalence of obesity in the United States \n     (34 percent) is more than twice the average for other \n     developed nations (13 percent). The closest nation in \n     prevalence of obesity is the United Kingdom (24 percent) \n     which is over 25 percent less than the United States.\n       (4) The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in \n     2006 estimated that 32 percent of children and adolescents \n     aged 2 to 19 and an alarming 66 percent of adults are \n     overweight or obese.\n       (5) More than 30 percent of young people in grades 9 \n     through 12 do not regularly engage in vigorous intensity \n     physical activity, while almost 40 percent of adults are \n     sedentary and 70 percent report getting less than 20 minutes \n     of regular physical activity per day.\n       (6) The Institute of Medicine, in their 2005 publication \n     ``Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance'', \n     reported that over the last 3 decades, the rate of childhood \n     obesity has tripled for children aged 6 to 11 years, and \n     doubled for children aged 2 to 5 years old and in adolescents \n     aged 12 to 19 years old. In 2004, approximately 9,000,000 \n     children over 6 years of age were obese. Only 2 percent of \n     children eat a healthy diet consistent with Federal nutrition \n     guidelines.\n       (7) For children born in 2000, it is estimated the lifetime \n     risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is 40 percent \n     for females and 30 percent for males.\n       (8) Overweight and obesity disproportionately affect \n     minority populations and women. According to the 2006 \n     Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the Centers for \n     the Disease Control and Prevention, 61 percent of adults in \n     the United States are overweight or obese.\n       (9) The Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates the annual expenditures related to overweight and \n     obesity in the United States to be $117,000,000,000 in 2001 \n     and rising rapidly.\n       (10) The Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that the increase in the number of overweight and \n     obese Americans between 1987 and 2001 resulted in a 27 \n     percent increase in per capita health costs, and that as many \n     as 112,000 deaths per year are associated with obesity.\n       (11) Being overweight or obese increases the risk of \n     chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, \n     certain cancers, arthritis, and other health problems.\n       (12) According to the National Institute of Diabetes and \n     Digestive and Kidney Diseases, individuals who are obese have \n     a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of premature death.\n       (13) Healthy People 2010 goals identify overweight and \n     obesity as 1 of the Nation's leading health problems and \n     include objectives for increasing the proportion of adults \n     who are at a healthy weight, reducing the proportion of \n     adults who are obese, and reducing the proportion of children \n     and adolescents who are overweight or obese.\n       (14) Another Healthy People 2010 goal is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       (15) Food and beverage advertisers are estimated to spend \n     $10,000,000 to $12,000,000,000 per year to target children \n     and youth.\n       (16) The United States spends less than 2 percent of its \n     annual health expenditures on prevention.\n       (17) Employer health promotion investments net a return of \n     $3 for every $1 invested.\n       (18) High-energy dense and low-nutrient dense foods \n     represent 30 percent of American's total calorie intake. Fast \n     food company menus are twice the energy density of \n     recommended healthful diets.\n       (19) Research suggests that individuals eat too much high-\n     energy dense foods without feeling full because the brain's \n     pathways that regulate hunger and influence normal food \n     intake are not triggered by these foods.\n       (20) Packaging, product placement, and high-energy dense \n     food content manipulation contribute to the overweight and \n     obesity epidemic in the United States.\n       (21) Such marketing and content manipulation techniques \n     have been used by other industries to encourage consumption \n     at the expense of health. To help individuals make\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n     healthy choices, education and information must be available \n     with clear, consistent, and accurate labeling.\n\n         TITLE I--OBESITY TREATMENT, PREVENTION, AND REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 101.
