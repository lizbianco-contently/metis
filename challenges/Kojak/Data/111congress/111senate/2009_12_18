The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n1 a.m. be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees, that Senators be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach, that the mandatory quorum be waived, and that the majority leader \nbe recognized for the last 10 minutes and the 10 minutes prior to that \nthe Republican leader be recognized, if he chooses to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who are following the business of \nthe Senate may be surprised to find us in session a little after \nmidnight. This is a decision made by the Senate just a few hours ago, \nto postpone the continuation of our session into a new day. The purpose \nis parliamentary, so that a motion which we have filed can be voted on. \nIt is an important motion. It is a cloture motion. We often have them. \nIt is a motion that closes debate on the floor and moves us forward to \nthe consideration of a measure.\n  There are very few measures the Senate would consider any more \nimportant than the one on which we are about to vote. In about an hour \nor less, we will be voting on the Defense appropriations bill.\n  This is a bill which is critically important to our Nation's defense \nand security, as Secretary Gates reminded us today in a letter to the \nSenate. It is also a bill that is important to the men and women in \nuniform, those who are in harm's way overseas literally risking their \nlives while we meet in the safety of this Senate Chamber.\n  The bill contains a 3.4-percent pay raise for our military, richly \ndeserved, for the men and women who serve us. It also will be a pay \nraise appreciated by their families, many of whom wait patiently for \nthe return of their loved one. There is money in this, as well, for \nmilitary families, to make sure that not only the servicemembers but \ntheir spouses and children have health care. It is a very basic \nrequirement of life and one we want to provide for all of our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families.\n  There is certainly an allotment and allocation here for equipment, \nwhich our men and women in uniform will need to perform their missions \nand come home safely. Readiness and training--it covers a wide range of \nimportant expenditures for our national security.\n  There is no more important bill when it comes to the safety of our \ntroops and for our endorsement and support of what they are giving for \nour country.\n  In addition to that, there are provisions added by the House which \nare critically important at this moment in our history. We extend for \nseveral months the unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans \nwho have lost their jobs during this recession. Although we see things \ngetting a little better in the economy, there are still a lot of people \nsuffering because of unemployment. They have not only lost their jobs, \nmany have expended their savings. They have lost their health \ninsurance. They may lose their homes. They are struggling. This bill \nextends for a short period of time those unemployment benefits and some \nhelp to pay for health insurance.\n  It is also a bill that provides for food stamps. I wish this Nation \ndid not need food stamps, but we need them desperately. One out of six \npeople in the State of Michigan is on food stamps because of the state \nof their economy, and many States with high unemployment rates are near \nthat. The food stamps provide literally the basics and necessities of \nlife for these families.\n  You would think, as I describe this bill, that it would pass in the \nSenate by the same overwhelming margin it just passed in the House 2 \ndays ago. In the House, the vote was, if I recall correctly, in the \nrange of 393 to 35 or something close to that. It was an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. Mr. President, 164 Republican Congressmen voted for \nit, and it is understandable why. It was a vote of confidence in our \nmen and women in uniform. It was a vote of support for them. And it was \na vote of compassion and caring for all the people suffering in this \ngreat recession.\n  Yet we may find--I hope it is not true--we may find that in just a \nfew moments this will become a strictly partisan vote. I hope that does \nnot happen. It should not. It was not a partisan issue in the House of \nRepresentatives. But many have said on the other side of the aisle that \nthey will not vote to support our troops with this appropriation, nor \nprovide money for the unemployed. I do not question their patriotism or \ntheir commitment to our men and women in uniform. They are doing it \nbecause of a political or procedural approach they want to use to try \nto stop or slow down health care reform. I think they picked the wrong \nbill for it. I think we have had a healthy debate, a vigorous debate, \nand we are likely to have that debate continue for the next several \ndays. But why are we putting the men and women in uniform in the middle \nof this debate? They did not ask for that. They asked to serve our \ncountry, to be respected for that service, and to have some help so \nthey come home safely. That is what this bill does.\n\n  I hope at 1 a.m., in just a few minutes from now, those on the other \nside of the aisle will reconsider their opposition to the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. If there was ever a time when we should \nstand together in solidarity for those who defend our country, it is \nnow. And I hope many on the Republican side of the aisle will join us \nin that effort, in a bipartisan effort, in a show of support for these \nmen and women in uniform.\n  There is plenty of time for debate, but there is also a time for \ndebate to end. There comes a moment, after we have tried our best and \nengaged in debate and amendments, when a vote should be taken and the \nSenate should decide.\n  We are dragging this series of votes out on health care reform I \nthink to a degree which is unnecessary. At some point, and some point \nsoon, we should take the vote and see if there are literally 60 votes \nin the Senate for health care reform. Having done our best on our side \nof the aisle to argue the case, those on the other side have argued \nagainst it, and now the people of America should have the last word \nthrough their elected Senators.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who tried \nyesterday to stop the proceedings or at least slow them down by \nrequiring the reading of an amendment and are trying now\n\n[[Page S13403]]\n\nthrough the attempt to postpone this vote on the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, to accept the verdict of the Senate. There should \nreach a point when we should do that. And we should do it in a timely \nfashion. Denying Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle an \nopportunity to be home with their families--not to mention our poor \nstaff, people around here who work night and day to support our \nefforts--denying them a chance to be home with their families in one \nlast, perhaps, vain effort to stop a vote on health care reform really \ndoes not speak as well of this institution as it should.\n  I hope those on the other side of the aisle will have reached a \nconclusion, after 2 days in trying to stop this process, that it is \nbetter for us to have a record vote. If they believe this bill is so \nbad, they have a chance to vote against it. Those of us who support it \nwill be on record for it. Then let the American people decide. Let them \ndecide in the next election or let them decide in response to us.\n  But I hope that come 1 o'clock this morning, when we vote on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, we will have a solid \nbipartisan vote in support of our men and women in uniform. They \ndeserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know we are going to eventually vote \non the DOD--the Department of Defense--appropriations bill. And it may \npass tonight and cloture may be invoked. If it is not, it will be in 30 \nhours. So I think the bill that is before us is not what is driving, \nactually, the timing of the vote, at 12:15 in the morning on Friday \nmorning. I think what is driving it is health care, and I believe all \nof us are going to support--or most of us are going to support--the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill when the time is right.\n  But I think it is very important that we have the opportunity to talk \nabout the health care bill that is the underlying bill that will be the \nnext piece of legislation that is considered. I hope people are looking \nat the underlying bill we have before us, because it is so important \nfor the quality of every family, every person in this country, that we \nhave a health care system that is affordable, available, and is the \nquality health care we have known in our country for all of these \nyears.\n\n  I think what concerns so many of us is that we are concerned that if \nwe have health care reform, instead of providing more access to more \npeople to have the quality health care we all want every American to \nhave, we are going to lose the choices and the patient-doctor \nrelationships if we have a health care takeover that increases costs. \nThe underlying bill is actually going to start taxing every drug people \ntake, every piece of medical equipment they buy, and insurance \ncompanies are going to have to raise their prices to accommodate the \ntaxes that are in the bill.\n  The bill starts the taxes 2 weeks from today. Two weeks from today, \nthe taxes on this health care bill start. The health care bill itself \ndoesn't start for 4 years. So I think the people of America are saying: \nWhat am I hearing? What am I hearing? That taxes start next year, but \nthere is no health program that will give me some kind of new option \nfor 4 years.\n  It doesn't seem like the way we have had policy made in our country \nbefore, where you would be taxed for 4 years before there would ever be \na program that you could sign up for. So I think that is what we are \ngoing to be dealing with in the next few days.\n  I think the people of America are very concerned about the bill and \nthe explanations of the bill that we hear. It could be that this bill \nhas changed. We don't know because we haven't seen a new bill come \nforward, but we have heard that a new bill is being written. So we \ndon't know for sure what it says. But the bill that was introduced and \nthat we have been debating for 3 weeks now has tax increases of about \n$\\1/2\\ trillion over a 10-year period, tax increases, mandates, \nemployer business expenses, individual mandates for every person to \nhave to have health care coverage or pay a fine. It could be $750 per \nperson, the fine; it could go up from there. Every employer is going to \nhave to offer a specified type of health care coverage or they are \ngoing to have a mandate that will require fines as well.\n  I think the American people have been watching this debate and are \ntrying to listen to what is in this bill, and what I am getting in my \noffice is more questions. I have had teletown meetings and people are \ncalling in with questions. They are legitimate questions. When they \nhear that there are so many taxes and mandates and then the government \nis going to start saying what would be covered in any kind of plan, \npeople are becoming very concerned.\n  I think that what happened a few weeks ago--the task force that came \nout and changed the guidelines for mammograms in this country for \nwomen--we have all been told for so many years that early detection is \nwhat has saved lives. In fact, that is true; we know early detection \nhas saved lives. So women have been encouraged to get mammograms \nstarting at the age of 40 and, at the age of 40, they start having \nmammograms on an annual basis. But a few weeks ago a task force, a task \nforce that is a part of the bill that would have the government single-\npayer system, that task force began to change the guidelines. The \nguidelines were then that you don't need to have a mammogram under the \nage of 50. So you don't need mammograms at the age of 40, you start at \n50, and then it is every other year. Well, that concerned women all \nover our country. This task force that made this recommendation is the \nsame task force that is going to be making the recommendations about \nwhat kind of health care coverage there will be in the underlying bill \nthat is before us. So it begins to look as though there is going to be \na government task force saying what will be covered in a government \nplan and that it is no longer women who are 40 and above, it is now \nwomen who are 50 and above. So those women between 40 and 50 are not \ngoing to have that same kind of access.\n  I think it is a concern that people are saying: Well, if it is going \nto happen on mammograms, what else is it going to happen on? What else \nis going to be taken away from me by a government task force instead of \nmy doctor and me making that decision?\n  There are many questions about what is in this bill, many questions \nabout what this means to my doctor-patient relationship. I think people \naround the country wish for us to say: Let's stop here. Let's do this \nin a way that people know how it is going to affect them, how it is \ngoing to affect their families. People want to know more about this \nbill before, all of a sudden, just before Christmas, we have a health \ncare reform bill and it has taxes, it has more mandates on business in \na very tough economic climate, and it has taxes that start actually \nnext year, and it has $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of cuts in Medicare over a \n10-year period--$\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts in Medicare. That is $500 \nbillion in Medicare cuts.\n  People from Texas were asking me: What does that mean? It means you \nare going to have severe cuts in Medicare Advantage, and there are \nhundreds of thousands of Texans who have Medicare Advantage and like \nMedicare Advantage. But that is going to be severely curtailed in this \nbill.\n  The payments to hospitals, the underpayments to hospitals for \nMedicare patients, has always been brought back up so that hospitals \ncould break even, but that is not the case in this bill because those \npayments are going to be cut. So the underpayment to hospitals is going \nto be a part of this bill.\n  That is going to hurt our rural hospitals. We are very concerned \nabout the rural hospitals that are already having a hard time. Their \ncosts are higher and they have a harder time making ends meet, so we \nare worried about the quality of care people are going to get, \nparticularly in our rural areas with these cuts to Medicare. There will \nbe cuts to home health care. There will be cuts to hospice, nursing \nhomes, long-term care. These are the cuts in Medicare that are not \ngoing to shore up Medicare; they are going to a new program at the \nexpense of Medicare coverage, Medicare treatment for Medicare patients.\n  So here we are. It is 12:25. We are going to be voting in about 30 \nminutes, at 1 o'clock in the morning. It seems as though it is time for \nus to say that the\n\n[[Page S13404]]\n\nAmerican people are very concerned about this bill, and wouldn't it be \nbetter to start all over and have a bipartisan effort where Republicans \nand Democrats can sit down together and lay out the principles we want \nin health care reform: principles such as lower costs; principles such \nas making sure more people have access to coverage with bigger pools to \nlower the cost of premiums.\n  I think my time is up, and I will certainly yield the floor to those \nwho are wishing to speak. I hope we can start over. It is more \nimportant to do this right than to do it fast.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, many who are filibustering this Defense \nappropriations bill tonight are filibustering because they want to \ndelay health care. They want to delay the health care reform \nlegislation from being voted on so the bill that provides the funding \nto support our men and women in uniform who are serving on the front \nlines, often under arduous and dangerous circumstances to protect our \nNation, is being filibustered to keep the Senate from acting on another \nunrelated piece of legislation. This is not only unbelievable, it is \nunconscionable.\n  A 3.4-percent pay raise for the troops is being filibustered. \nAdditional funding for needed medical research in traumatic brain \ninjuries and posttraumatic stress syndrome, and to improve the care, \nthe medical care for our wounded warriors is being filibustered \ntonight. Funding to provide over 6,000 MRAP vehicles--those are the \nMine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles that are so desperately needed \nby our troops in Afghanistan--is being filibustered tonight.\n  There is $1.8 billion for what is called the joint IED organization, \nwhich has one purpose, one mission, and that is to develop and deploy \ntechnologies to protect our troops from the deadly Improvised Explosive \nDevices that have maimed and killed so many, is being filibustered here \ntonight.\n  There is $470 million for family advocacy programs and full funding \nfor family support and yellow ribbon programs to provide support to \nmilitary families, including quality childcare, job training for \nspouses, expanded counseling and outreach to families experiencing the \nseparation and the strain and the stress of war is being filibustered \nhere tonight.\n  What in the world kind of message does a filibuster such as this send \nto our troops? Our troops deserve the full support--and they should \nknow they have the full support--of the Congress when they are in the \nfield carrying out the democratically arrived at policies and decisions \nof our government.\n  Instead, what they are getting tonight is a Republican filibuster. \nThose who are filibustering this Defense bill because they think they \nare aiming at health care reform are tragically off target. They are \nhitting our troops and their families. How in the name of heaven should \nthe well-being of our troops be sacrificed for 1 hour when they are \nsacrificing so much for us day after day?\n  There are those who are going to argue that the end they seek--the \ndelay of the health care reform bill--justifies the means they are \nusing: holding hostage the critical funding to support our troops and \ntheir families. I couldn't disagree more. The lesson our troops are \ngoing to take from the filibusters tonight is that those who are \nfilibustering this bill think a short-term political objective is more \nimportant than a prompt vote of support and confidence for our military \nmembers and their families.\n  Just yesterday, the ranking member, the ranking Republican member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, said the following about this \nappropriations bill:\n\n       This Defense appropriations bill ought to be passed and it \n     ought to be passed as soon as possible in recognition of our \n     respect for servicemembers and their families.\n\n  Our respect for our troops and the sacrifice they and their families \nmake for our country every day is exactly why this filibuster should be \ndefeated tonight.\n  Those who are filibustering this bill because they want to delay a \nvote on health care legislation should end that filibuster out of \nrespect for our troops and their families--out of respect for our \ntroops and their families--and for the sacrifices they make for this \ncountry every day. The Senate should defeat this filibuster tonight.\n  The stakes are huge, Mr. President. They were set forth in a letter \nwe received from the Secretary of Defense. This is what the Secretary \nof Defense is telling us:\n\n       I am writing to advise you of my serious concern over the \n     prospect that fiscal year 2010 appropriations authority for \n     the Department of Defense could expire by Friday, December \n     18, 2009.\n\n  That is today. He goes on:\n\n       Should we face this unfortunate situation, it would result \n     in a serious disruption in the worldwide activities of the \n     Department of Defense and limit our ability to pay our \n     workforce, including military forces.\n\n  I am going to repeat this. This is what our Secretary of Defense is \nsaying. He is not someone who shoots from the hip. Our Secretary of \nDefense is one of the most serious-minded, careful Secretaries of any \nagency that I have ever known. The Secretary of Defense said the \nfollowing. I will repeat it because I want everybody to know what the \nstakes are tonight if we don't defeat this filibuster:\n\n       Should we face this unfortunate situation, it would result \n     in a serious disruption in the worldwide activities of the \n     Department of Defense and limit our ability to pay our \n     workforce, including military forces.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       It is inconceivable to me that such a situation would be \n     permitted to occur with U.S. forces actively deployed in \n     combat. Accordingly, I strongly urge the Congress to do what \n     is necessary to ensure the Department has the needed \n     resources to fully and appropriately continue its vital \n     national mission.\n\n  It is signed by Robert Gates. I hope everybody, before they decide \nwhether to continue this filibuster, will read this letter from \nSecretary Gates and think about what the message is to our troops and \ntheir families if an unrelated issue as important as that issue is \nallowed to interfere with us appropriating the necessary funds for the \nmen and women who put on the uniform of this Nation, who take that risk \nfor us.\n  Let's remember that as we vote tonight and understand what the stakes \nare if this filibuster succeeds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I find it rather curious that our colleague, \nmy friend from Michigan, is accusing Republicans of filibustering this \nDefense appropriations bill. Republicans don't control the Senate or \nthe House. The House just passed this bill Wednesday. Now, it could \nhave been passed in October or September or July or perhaps it could \nhave been passed in November.\n  Republicans didn't control the timing of this legislation. We have \nnot been holding up the Defense appropriations bill. We always vote for \nthe Defense appropriations bill. Everyone supports that. No, the \nmajority controls the timing. The House finally got around--a week \nbefore Christmas or 10 days--to passing the bill, and they sent it \nhere. The Senate took it up Thursday--yesterday.\n  Republicans are filibustering the bill? The majority leader brought \nit up yesterday. We are having the vote on it tonight. There is only \none reason there are 60 votes required, and that is that the majority \nleader scheduled the vote at 1 a.m. in the morning for purposes that we \nall understand have to do with the health care legislation, and \nRepublicans figured it was probably a good idea that we all be here and \nvote and, therefore, the majority could produce the 60 votes, which it \nhas, there being 60 members of the majority. I suspect when we vote on \nthis piece of legislation, virtually all of us in this body will \nsupport it. There is no question about that.\n  I find it odd that we are accused of filibustering. Have you heard \nany Republicans giving speeches about this? I think of Jimmy Stewart, \nin that great movie talking for 24 hours straight, or whatever it was, \nand Senator Hutchison from Texas just gave about a 5-minute speech \nprimarily talking about health care. Republicans haven't been speaking \nthis bill to death, talking the bill to death. As I said, it was just \noffered yesterday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S13405]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me complete my thought. We are voting on Friday morning, \nand so I think if anybody is staying up late enough to watch this, they \nmight think it is rather odd. They haven't heard anybody talking this \nbill to death, filibustering.\n  Why haven't the Democrats been able to bring this most important bill \nto the Senate for a vote until a week before Christmas, when the fiscal \nyear began October 1? Don't blame Republicans for the fact that this \nbill comes before us a week before Christmas and, therefore, we have to \nact on it at this point in time. Republicans had nothing to do with \nthat timing. I will now yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Arizona, the whip, what a great \nrelief it is for him to say that. I will make a unanimous consent that \nwe pass this, and we won't have to wait for the rollcall at 1 a.m., and \nMembers can go home to their families. Will the Senator from Arizona \njoin me in the unanimous consent request that we immediately take up, \nconsider, and pass this important Department of Defense bill?\n  Mr. KYL. With all due respect, I will decline that kind invitation, \ngiven the fact that the majority leader saw fit to call us here to vote \nat 1 a.m. Everybody is probably on their way in, and they would \nappreciate the chance to do that and not be denied that opportunity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I wonder \nif my good friend is aware of the statement of the ranking Republican \non the Appropriations Committee, when he said that--the Senator from \nArizona says we have not been talking, referring to Republicans, about \nthe Defense appropriations bill at all. Is he aware of the statement of \nthe ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, who said \nyesterday that this bill ``ought to be passed as soon as possible, in \nrecognition of our respect for the servicemembers and their families?''\n  I wonder if the Senator is aware of that statement, and ``as soon as \npossible'' is tonight, not tomorrow or the next day.\n  Mr. KYL. I am aware of it because the Senator from Michigan read it a \nmoment ago. I talked to the Senator from Mississippi earlier today. \nThere is nobody more committed to the troops than the Senator from \nMississippi, who is concerned that we get this done. I talked to \nSecretary Gates about it today. There is no question the Defense \nDepartment needs to be funded, and there is a point in time in which \nthe funding runs out, and it needs to be funded. That is not the \nRepublicans' fault. The majority leader could have brought this up. And \nthe House is controlled by Democrats. Republicans didn't delay this \nbill until a week before Christmas. If there is a concern about \ntonight, all you have to do is pass a continuing resolution for 24 \nhours or 48 hours. There is no question that the troops will be funded \nor the Defense Department will be funded. Nobody believes that is an \nissue.\n  The point is, don't blame Republicans for being here at almost 1 a.m. \nin the morning a week before Christmas. We don't control the timing of \nthe legislation. We are not the reason the bill isn't ready until right \nnow or it wasn't brought up until now. We certainly haven't been \ntalking it to death.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The remainder of the Republicans' \ntime is reserved for the minority leader.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I want to speak about the troops because \nI spent Thanksgiving with the troops, the troops from Wyoming, our \nNational Guard----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a parliamentary inquiry \nfrom the leader.\n  Mr. REID. Under whose time is the Senator from Wyoming speaking?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the Republican leader \nto close the argument is all the time remaining for the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, listening to the debate and discussion \ntonight, I spent Thanksgiving with the troops from Wyoming who are \nserving our Nation overseas in Kuwait and in Iraq. These 700 men and \nwomen, driving in and out of Iraq on dangerous missions, have driven \nover 1 million miles. I went to three different bases in Kuwait to \nspend Thanksgiving with the troops, to pray with them, and tell them \nhow the people of Wyoming are supportive of their efforts, tell them \nall of us at home are trying to do all we can to make sure their \nfamilies know how much we care and that we want to do anything we can \nin our communities to help the families.\n  I held three townhall meetings on Thanksgiving day at different \nmilitary bases in Kuwait. In those meetings, listening to the troops, \nthey said they had what they needed in terms of the military supplies. \nBut they said their biggest concern was jobs; what was going to happen \nto them when they got home. Would there be jobs in the energy field? \nWould they still be available? Do the people in Washington and in the \nSenate realize we have 10 percent unemployment in this country? They \nwant to go back to their jobs. Do those people realize they are \ndebating health care and that we have an economic crisis that the \nSenate ought to be focused on now? Do they realize all the discussions \non health care are going to drive up the cost of care and cut Medicare \nand increase premiums for people and raise taxes? Do we care what is \ngoing to happen to our families? And we want to know about jobs.\n  They know, as many of them are small business people, that the \nNational Federation of Independent Business estimates that if we pass \nthis health care bill, it will cost our Nation 1.6 million jobs by \n2013. That is what the men and women in the field, on Thanksgiving Day, \nfrom Wyoming, who are part of our communities, our brothers, sisters, \nand the firefighters, policemen in our communities and the teachers in \nour schools--that is their concern. That was the No. 1 concern in the \nmilitary that I heard about in three different townhall meetings that \nday.\n  They want us to focus on the economy. They said: I want to make sure \na job is there when I get back. I want to make sure health care is not \ngoing to be made worse by what will happen in this Senate between now \nand the end of the year. And don't cut Medicare for my parents or raise \nmy taxes, and don't make things worse for me.\n  I heard from the men and women in the field that they have the same \nconcerns the other American people have, which is the rating on the \nhealth care bill which is at an all-time low. Only 32 percent, one in \nthree Americans support what the Senate is trying to jam through before \nthe holidays with the health care bill. They have great concerns \nbecause they believe their own costs are going to go up and quality \nwill go down and the cost of care for the Nation will increase if we \nproceed with the health care bill.\n  The other question they asked, of course, is, What is in the bill? \nHave you seen the bill? Have you read the bill? I had with me at these \ntownhall meetings the first 400 pages of the bill so they could look at \nthat, and we went through some of it. As I was working my way through--\nand this was at the Thanksgiving recess--they were astonished. Even as \nof today, when I had a townhall meeting by phone two nights ago, the \npeople of Wyoming said: Do you know what is in the bill right now? I \nhad to say no.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Isn't the Senator from Wyoming saying that the troops he \nspoke to, and the troops we are going to fund in the next day or so \nwith this legislation, want a strong country to come back to, and they \nwould be happy if we were standing firm today, this weekend, to prevent \nthe ever-increasing deficits, to prevent this country from being \nburdened with larger and larger debt, to protect the programs that they \nwill come back to, and to make sure Medicare is not cut even further?\n  Isn't the Senator saying these troops expect us to be standing for \nthe financial strength of this country so they can have the same \nAmerica to come back to that they volunteered to fight for?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, that is exactly what I am saying. My \ncolleague from Mississippi is so right.\n\n[[Page S13406]]\n\nThat is what the men and women from Wyoming who are serving right now \nin Iraq and Kuwait want. They want to come home to the same country \nthey left, the place where they have jobs, where they have \nopportunities for their children, where they are focused on growth, \neconomic development, opportunities for the children, for the next \ngeneration.\n  They are very concerned about the debt. They are very concerned about \nthe amount of spending going on by this Congress. They are very \nconcerned. As one said, the debt is the threat. It is astonishing to be \nwith our men and women in the field, with their guns and with their \nammunition, and what they want to talk about is the national debt in \nthe United States right now as a result of the extensive amounts of \nspending that are going on in this country. They are saying do not make \nthings worse. What is going to happen to our kids? Senator, aren't we \nstill borrowing more and more money from China? Why are we doing that? \nHow much money do we owe to the Chinese people? That is what I heard \nfrom Kuwait on Thanksgiving.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used the time \nyielded to him.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes 8 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regretfully, due to the schedule that \nthe majority has set, we are going to be unable to finish the Defense \nbill before the current funding authority expires midnight on Friday. \nAs we all know, the President will be out of the country. The House of \nRepresentatives, anticipating this problem, sent over a continuing \nresolution that would take care of the operations of this remaining \nportion of government unfunded through December 31.\n  With the President out of the country, of course, this would have to \nbe flown over to him to be signed. With the country at war and troops \nin the field, it would be the height of irresponsibility to let funding \nfor the Defense Department lapse. That is why, of course, the House of \nRepresentatives sent us this continuing resolution.\n  I have indicated to the majority that I would propound a consent \nagreement that we take up and pass this continuing resolution, and I \nwill do that at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 64, that the motion to proceed be agreed to, \nthe joint resolution be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I hope the American people \nhave the opportunity to see this, even though it is in the middle of \nthe night. On the west coast it is 3 hours earlier, so there will be a \nlot of people watching.\n  They are doing everything they can to stall, divert, and distract. \nAnd now they are using the troops. It is difficult to comprehend the \nillogic of my friends, the Republicans. We have a simple issue here.\n  There was a unanimous consent request by my friend, the assistant \nleader, a few minutes ago that said if you support the troops, let's \npass this bill, and that was objected to. So I object to the unanimous \nconsent request of my friend. I will say this: Don't worry about the \nPresident being gone. The President will be back tonight. OK?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 42 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the reason we are in this snarl is \nbecause my good friend, the majority leader, has this issue all tangled \nup with the debt ceiling extension and a health care bill that there is \nthis rush to pass before Christmas, a 2,100-page bill and no one has \nseen the final version yet. All of these things are all tangled up \ntogether.\n  Our advice would be to quit trying to pass this health care bill \nbefore Christmas that has an artificial deadline to pass something that \nmost of us have not seen. Let's do the necessary business of the \ngovernment and do what Senator Snowe has recommended continuously, \nwhich is that we pass the bill on a bipartisan basis with a broad \ncoalition of support.\n  I believe my time may have expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 minutes to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is difficult to reconcile the \nstatements made by the Republican whip and the Republican leader. The \nRepublican whip says we are not stopping the Defense bill. The \nRepublican leader says because of actions that have been taken here, \nthis bill cannot pass.\n  I made a unanimous consent request to end this debate immediately and \npass this appropriations bill and fund our troops, which I think both \nRepublican leaders have said they want to do. But, unfortunately, the \nRepublican whip objected to it.\n  We know why we are here. We are here because, as Senator Levin of \nMichigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said, there is \na Republican filibuster against the funding bill for our troops. There \nwill be an opportunity in a few moments for Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to vote, and I hope all of the Senators of both parties will \nvote--a vote of confidence in support for our men and women in uniform \nby voting for this cloture motion, and then I will renew my unanimous \nconsent request that we pass that bill immediately.\n  So there will be no questions, we will have had a rollcall vote, the \nSenate expressed its sentiment, and we move forward. I do not think \nthere is any reason for us to delay this another minute. The fact we \nare here early in the morning may be part of a strategy I hope the \nRepublicans have abandoned.\n  It is time to stand behind our troops and not abandon them during the \ncourse of war.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, ``We should not cause uncertainty or \nhardship for our Armed Forces.'' The senior Senator from Mississippi, a \nRepublican, said that.\n  ``Playing politics with the critical funding that our troops need now \nis political theater of the worst kind.'' The junior Senator from \nTexas, a Republican, said that.\n  ``Our obligation to those troops must transcend politics.'' The \njunior Senator from Arizona, the Republican whip, said that.\n  ``Every day we don't fund our troops is a day their ability to fight \nthis war is weakened.'' The senior Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader, said that.\n  And yet not a single one of these Republican Senators, not a single \none of the 40 Republicans in this body, has committed to renewing our \ncommitment to our troops before the funding expires later today.\n  We are voting at this rare late hour, but not even the darkness \noutside can conceal the game being played inside this Senate Chamber. \nWe are here in the middle of the night, but the reason is as clear as \nday. Senate Republicans so desperately want to turn their backs on \nAmericans who are suffering and dying for want of decent health care--\n45,000 a year, 750,000 bankruptcies, 14,000 losing their insurance \nevery day--that they are turning their backs on America's troops at \nwartime.\n  Rarely has the Senate seen such a sad statement. Rarely have I seen \nsuch brazen irresponsibility, and rarely have our Nation's citizens \nreceived such little regard from their leaders.\n  Our sons and daughters are fighting tonight and every night in the \ndeserts of Iraq and in the bitter cold mountains and valleys in \nAfghanistan on our behalf. The least we can do is make sure they have \nthe training and equipment they need to succeed--the least we can do.\n\n  Our Nation's bravest spend month after month half a world away from \ntheir families and children. The least we can do is make sure those \nmilitary families and children who have already sacrificed so much can \nget the health care they need.\n  Our Nation's most selfless men and women volunteer for duty. We have \nan\n\n[[Page S13407]]\n\nall-volunteer Army. Every single one stepped forward to serve. They \nvolunteered. The least we can do is to give them the well-deserved pay \nraise they need.\n  I received a letter, as has been announced here a few hours ago. The \nletter that Senator Durbin and the senior Senator from Michigan talked \nabout is a letter addressed to me. He let me know he has no patience \nfor the partisan games being played and no time for the precious hours \nthat are being wasted. He expressed, in his words, serious concern that \nthis Senate might cause ``a serious disruption in our military efforts \naround the world.'' But Secretary Gates added this:\n\n       It is inconceivable to me that such a situation would be \n     permitted to occur with United States forces actively \n     deployed in combat.\n\n  I agree. I couldn't agree more. I am going to vote for this bill in \nsupport of every single one of those servicemembers, including the \nhundreds of Nevadans who at this very moment fight for our Nation in \nother nations around the world.\n  I will vote yes because I support the 432 men and women from the \n221st Armored Cavalry from Las Vegas and the 102 men and women from the \n152nd Air Guard in Reno, both of which serve in Afghanistan. There are \nother Nevadans serving around the world.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle have stubbornly said they will \nnot. The Senate Republican leadership has shamelessly turned the \nfunding of our military into a purely partisan exercise. They can make \nall the excuses they want. We are here at 1 o'clock in the morning \nbecause of the Republicans. We could have voted for this bill 2 days \nago. I even had some Republican Senators tell me, regretfully and \nregrettably--they have admitted this to me personally, they have told \nme plainly that while they want to support our troops, they fear \nretribution from their own leaders. Retribution from their own leaders.\n  We know Senators on this side of the aisle have made commitments to \nvote for this. That is not exactly what John Kennedy, who was not only \nPresident of the United States but a war hero who served in this very \nbody, would call a profile in courage.\n  I am confident not a single one of our troops could care less whether \nthe leaders who give them what they need to succeed are progressives or \nconservatives. I am certain these men and women on deployment after \ndeployment spend more time counting the days until they see their loved \nones again than they do counting the political points scored on either \nside.\n  My vote in support of these soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nhas nothing to do with the party with which I am affiliated and \neverything to do with the country for which I took an oath to support \nand defend.\n  Although it is shortly after midnight here in Washington, DC, our \nNation's Capital, it is late morning on the battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. When the Sun rises over this city, this great city of \nWashington, a few hours from now, you will be able to see out those \nwindows on the west side of this Capitol and see past the great \nmonuments of Washington and Lincoln, and you will be able to see the \nPotomac River and see the skyline break for the great lawn of \nArlington. Within that consecrated ground, in neat rows that rise and \nfall with the rolling hills, lie the remains of men and women, boys and \ngirls who fought and fell for our flag.\n  Their headstones are simple, and from a distance they are identical. \nNo matter how closely you look at the words and symbols etched in those \nsolemn marble gravestones, you will never be able to discern whether \nthat warrior beneath was a Democrat, an Independent, or a Republican. \nWe cannot tell for whom he voted in the last election of his life or \nwhat she thought of this policy or that policy. That is not by \naccident. That is not an oversight.\n  While the demarcations of left and right, of red and blue seem so \nimportant to the daily lives as air and water to some of us, those \nstones are eternal reminders of such triviality. Dedication to this \nNation above all else--``All For Our Country,'' which is Nevada's \nmotto, should guide us now. On this hill, on this side of the river, in \nthis early morning hour, we can stand a little more of selflessness we \ntoo often keep at a distance on the sacred ground we call Arlington.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote begin.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture \nmotion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2010.\n         Daniel K.

Kaufman, Al Franken, Tom Harkin, Jim Webb, \n           Paul G. Kirk, Jr., Michael F. Bennet.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the \nSenate to H.R. 3326, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), and the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCornyn).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay,'' and the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCornyn) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The motion to refer falls.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in light of the vote and the fact that \ncloture has been invoked on the motion to concur, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment with an amendment be withdrawn, all postcloture time be \nyielded back, and the motion to concur in the House amendment to the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 3326 be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The majority \nleader is recognized\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, unless we can work \nsomething out with the minority, the next\n\n[[Page S13408]]\n\nvote will occur very early on Saturday morning, around 7:30 or so that \nmorning. There could be several votes. We will work with the minority \nto find out, in fact, if they want these other votes. I hope we can \nmake that determination tomorrow. We have some people for whom that \nwould be very convenient, if they knew it would be a simple majority \nvote or whether we need 60 votes on some of the issues that might be \nraised. We have one Member, of course, who has to walk very early, a \nlong ways, and others who will be terribly inconvenienced.\n  But unless we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nthe vote will occur at 7:30 or so Saturday morning.

I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we debate the Defense appropriations \nbill, I want to take the opportunity to update my colleagues on the \nactivities of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that \nis funded in this bill. I am very pleased that the Defense \nappropriations bill contains $424.1 million for the Nunn-Lugar program \nthis year. This amount of funding will ensure the continuation of \ncurrent Nunn-Lugar projects and will permit Nunn-Lugar to take on new \ntasks in new countries, principally in the area of biological threat \nreduction.\n  Eighteen years ago, Senator Sam Nunn and I, along with a bipartisan \ngroup of legislators, in the last hours of that 1991 session, \ndetermined that our government had to address the proliferation threats \nposed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the waning days of the \n1991 congressional year, we passed legislation establishing the Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which devotes American \ntechnical expertise and money for joint efforts to safeguard and \ndestroy materials and weapons of mass destruction. Since that time, the \nprogram has amassed an impressive list of accomplishments in the former \nSoviet Union, and it has been expanded to address weapons of mass \ndestruction contingencies around the globe.\n  I have devoted much time and effort to overseeing and accelerating \nthe Nunn-Lugar program. Uncounted individuals of great dedication \nserving on the ground in the former Soviet Union and in our government \nhave made this program work. We have shared many productive adventures \nin locations and circumstances that few Americans have ever \nexperienced. From snowy runaways at former Soviet bomber bases to \nbiological weapons labs in Georgia; from the chemical weapon \ndestruction facility in Siberia to submarine bases on the Kola \nPeninsula; from former nuclear weapons test sites in Kazakhstan to the \nmountains of Albania, it has been my privilege to support the talented \nprofessionals of the Defense Department and other agencies in reducing \nthreats facing our country. I continue to be impressed by their \ncommitment to the mission and their ingenuity in finding creative \nsolutions to seemingly impossible tasks.\n  Much of this work has been done outside the public eye. This is not \nto say that nonproliferation activities have lacked public support. \nCongressional votes have consistently backed funding for Nunn-Lugar and \nother nonproliferation projects. But few Members of Congress or \nAmerican citizens fully understand the contributions that threat \nreduction programs have made to the United States and global security.\n  During my conversations with Hoosiers and others around the country, \nI do my best to explain what is happening on the ground in Russia and \nmany other locations. I put out monthly press releases describing \nexactly how many weapons were destroyed in the previous month. My \noffice displays a large representation of the Nunn-Lugar scorecard and \nnumerous photos and artifacts from my visits to weapon elimination \nsites. But, understandably, threat reduction programs rarely make \nheadlines. We are engaged in an endeavor in which notoriety is likely \nto come if something goes wrong--if materials or weapons of mass \ndestruction are not contained in some instance. This makes for an \nexceptionally painstaking standard that must be met day in and day out.\n  As of this month, the Nunn-Lugar program has dismantled 7,514 nuclear \nwarheads, destroyed 768 intercontinental ballistic missiles, eliminated \n498 ICBM sites, eliminated 155 bombers, destroyed 651 submarine \nlaunched ballistic missiles, dismantled 32 nuclear submarines, and \ndestroyed 960 metric tons of chemical weapons.\n  Together, the United States and Russia have eliminated more nuclear \nweapons than the combined arsenals of the United Kingdom, France, and \nChina. In addition, American and Russian experts have worked together \nto remove nuclear material from vulnerable locations around the world \nand to secure it in Russia. In 2008, the last of the nuclear warhead \nstorage facilities identified under the Bratislava Agreement received \nsafety and security upgrades. In May 2009, the chemical weapons \ndestruction facility at Shchuchye began its important work of \ndestroying 2 million chemical munitions.\n  I would point out, Mr. President, that in the case of each one of \nthese shells, a hole is drilled in the bottom of the shell. The nerve \ngas is carefully extracted, bituminized, and placed in the ground, we \nhope, forever.\n  Despite these successes, some question why we should continue our \nwork in Russia given recent strains in the United States-Russian \nrelationship. I believe that both the United States and Russia must \naccept the fact that we need each other. Kremlin rhetoric will swing \nfrom one end of the strategic spectrum to the other. Projects will be \non and then off. Our frustration level sometimes will be high. But we \nmust not lose patience or miss the possibilities of cooperative threat \nreduction. We should recall that the Nunn-Lugar program was created to \nsafeguard U.S. national security interests, and those interests exist \nregardless of the state of our relationship with Russia. It is also \nvital that we understand the\n\n[[Page S13411]]\n\nverification utility of the Nunn-Lugar program, which provides for \nAmerican technicians on the ground in Russia, systematically destroying \nRussian weaponry. The cooperative links established by such activity \nand the confidence-building value inherent in our on-site presence are \nassets of incalculable value.\n  Beyond Russia, it is vital that we break new ground in safeguarding \nand destroying weapons of mass destruction. I have never considered the \nNunn-Lugar Act to be merely a program, or a funding source, or a set of \nagreements. Rather, it is an engine of nonproliferation cooperation and \nexpertise that can be applied around the world. And it is a concept \nthrough which we, as leaders, are responsible for the welfare of our \nchildren and grandchildren, as we attempt to take control of the global \nthreat.\n  The United States must send the clear message that we are willing to \ngo anywhere to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. New opportunities for partnership must be pursued \ncreatively and relentlessly. Some may say that we cannot forge \ncooperative nonproliferation programs with the most troublesome \nnations. But the Nunn-Lugar program has demonstrated that the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction can lead to extraordinary outcomes based on \nmutual interest. No one would have predicted in the 1980s that \nAmericans and Russians would be working together to destroy weapons in \nthe former Soviet Union. Taking the long view, a satisfactory level of \naccountability, transparency, and safety must be established in every \nnation with a weapons of mass destruction program.\n  This year, Congress enhanced our government's ability to pursue this \ngoal by including language from the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction Improvement Act of 2009 in the 2010 Defense authorization \nbill. These provisions give the Nunn-Lugar program additional \nflexibility to meet unexpected threats in locations around the world in \nwhich certain laws would bar the use of such funds. They provide the \nDefense Department with the authority to spend up to 10 percent of \nannual Nunn-Lugar program funds notwithstanding any other law to meet \nurgent proliferation threats. The Defense authorization bill also \nincluded important authority that allows the Secretary of Defense to \naccept contributions from foreign governments, international \norganizations, multinational entities, and other entities for \nactivities carried out under the Nunn-Lugar program.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program has made tremendous progress on the \ndestruction and dismantlement of massive Soviet weapons systems and the \nfacilities that developed them. But in the future, the program will be \nasked to address much more complex and diverse security threats in a \nlarge number of countries.\n  I believe the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains \nthe No. 1 national security threat facing the United States and the \ninternational community. Over the years, I have described international \ncooperation in addressing threats posed by weapons of mass destruction \nas a ``window of opportunity.'' We never know how long that window will \nremain open. We must eliminate those conditions that restrict us or \ndelay our ability to act. The United States has the technical expertise \nand the diplomatic standing to dramatically benefit international \nsecurity. American leaders must ensure that we have the political will \nand the resources to implement programs devoted to these ends. The \nfunds in this bill are vital to these efforts, and I thank the \nAppropriations Committee for its thoughtful attention to this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader has signaled that \nhe will finally unveil the most significant piece of domestic \nlegislation in modern history sometime on Saturday--and force a vote in \nthe middle of the night about 36 hours later. This is truly outrageous.\n  This will be a bill that none of my constituents have seen, that none \nof the majority leader's constituents have seen, that none of you have \nseen, and that nobody outside the Capitol has seen.\n  You can fit into a phone booth the number of people who have seen \nthis bill that will affect the lives of every single American in the \nmost profound ways.\n  Every American should have an opportunity to know what their Senators \nare being asked to vote on before anyone can see it. I doubt if anyone \nin this Chamber could come down here and defend the secrecy surrounding \nthis bill.\n  Earlier this week, the President said:\n\n       I think it is important for every single Member of the \n     Senate to take a careful look at what is in this bill.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is no bill to read. Let me repeat: There is \nliterally no bill to inspect. Even Senator Durbin, my good friend from \nIllinois who is here on the floor, the second in command on the \nDemocratic side, admits he hasn't seen the details of the bill.\n  The only thing we know for sure about this bill is that it will raise \ntaxes, raise premiums, and slash Medicare. That much we know for sure. \nThe Medicare cuts will be nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion to pay for a vast \nexpansion of government into health care that an overwhelming majority \nof Americans we now know oppose.\n  That is what is at the heart of this bill no one has seen yet. So we \nmay not know all the details, but we already know this bill can't be \nfixed, and we know Americans are outraged by what has happened in this \ndebate. A bill that was supposed to lower costs and lower taxes and \nlower premiums will actually raise all three, making existing problems \nnot better but worse. It is not too late to start over and deliver the \nreform Americans want--the step-by-step reforms we know would actually \nlower health care costs.\n  The majority knows this bill is a colossal legislative blunder. That \nis why they are rushing it through. That is why the only argument they \nare left with is a call to history. Well, history will be made either \nway, and this much is clear: Passing this bill in this way would be an \nhistoric mistake that those who support it will come to regret.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the bill that is before the \nSenate. It is 2,074 pages. It has been on the Internet now for 3 weeks \nin its entirety. You cannot only read it on the Democratic Senate Web \nsite, you can read it on the Republican Senate Web site. So one might \nask: Well, where is the Republican comprehensive health care reform \nbill? It is not to be found--not on the floor of the Senate, not on the \nWeb site--because it doesn't exist.\n  After 1 year of debate about America's health care system, the \nRepublicans in the Senate have failed to produce any legislation that \nhas gone through the scrutiny this legislation has faced in terms of \nits impact on America, its impact on our budget. They are emptyhanded. \nWhat they bring to us on the floor of the Senate are speeches, press \nreleases, charts, and graphs, and an occasional criticism. I say \n``occasional'' because for 19 days on the Senate floor we have debated \nthis measure--comprehensive health care reform--and let's take a look \nat the Record after 19 days of debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Republicans in the Senate--there are 40 of them--have offered \nfour amendments to the bill in 19 days. Four amendments. Oh, and they \nhave offered six motions to take the bill off the floor and send it \nback to committee. They have looked at this--and you heard the minority \nleader and his criticism of this measure--and found four things they \nare willing to bring before the Senate to change. It doesn't strike me \nthat this is a good-faith effort to try to bring us to closure in a \nbipartisan way. Instead, what we hear from the Republican side of the \naisle in addition to only four specific amendments over 19 days is: We \nhaven't had enough time to offer amendments. Nineteen days, four \namendments.\n  I guess some of us are reaching advanced stages in life and in age \nand maybe we don't have the energy we once did, but I honestly believe \nthat even the Senate could come up with one amendment a day on health \ncare reform, but the Republicans have come\n\n[[Page S13412]]\n\nup with four over 19 days. It tells us one of two things: Either this \nis hard work and they are not up to it or they like the current system \nof health care; and if they do, I would like them to defend the current \nsystem of health care. I would like for them to try to explain in their \nStates what I have found in my State. Instead of soaring rhetoric and \nabstractions, let's get down to specifics.\n  This is a gentleman who lives in Evanston, IL, named David Buckley. \nEvanston is a great town just north of Chicago. I enjoy going up there \nand I have a lot of friends there. David had insurance when he needed \nit, but it ended up costing him his financial health. He is a freelance \nvideographer. He was paying $4,500 a year for health insurance when he \nwas diagnosed with cancer at the age of 48. David Buckley had a prompt \nsurgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation. He managed to rid his \nbody of cancer. But that battle ended and another battle began.\n  David's insurance company agreed to cover his cancer treatment but \nonly after 3 solid months of investigations of his application for \nhealth insurance to determine whether they could find in that \napplication a preexisting condition which would eliminate any \nresponsibility to pay for David's bills. They couldn't. After covering \nhis cancer treatment costs, they did the next thing that insurance \ncompanies do: They raised his premiums, and they didn't just raise them \na little bit. In the year following his cancer diagnosis, David's \ninsurance rates went up 80 percent, and that was just the beginning. \nWithin 7 years, David was paying $28,000 a year in premiums. He had \ngone from roughly $400 a month to more than $2,000 a month in 7 years. \nHe had a $2,500 deductible, not to mention out-of-pocket expenses. He \nis self-employed, makes a decent living--about $70,000 a year--but \nimagine taking $2,000 out of your paycheck every month just for health \ninsurance. He tried.\n  Incidentally, 12 days after his surgery, David, who is not lazy by \nany measure, flew into a war zone to shoot video. He was still wearing \na chemo pump when he arrived for work. He pushes himself to pay his \nbills, but it has been a losing battle. What started as a $5,000 debt \nin the year 2000 grew to a $70,000 debt by 2003 and a large portion of \nit came from medical bills. David said:\n\n       I thought the point of having insurance was to keep you out \n     of bankruptcy, not put you in it.\n\n  It is a valid point. Insurance is meant to be a promise of \nprotection, but for too many people it isn't enough. For David, the \nhigh costs and ballooning debt led him to drop his health insurance \nlast year. Think about that. He battled cancer and won, and you know \nonce you have been through that life experience, you are always \nvigilant. You need the best care to make certain that anything that \nrecurs is caught early, but David had to walk away from health \ninsurance coverage because he couldn't afford it. He decided it was \nhealth care or saving for retirement or meeting the costs of living. He \nis in his late 50s and he is worried about the years when he won't be \nable to work.\n  Health reform is going to help people like David--people who have \ninsurance but still find themselves vulnerable to financial ruin. It \nwill stop insurance companies from running the rates up sky high when \nyou get sick. For those with employer-sponsored, large-group coverage, \nit will provide access to a broader insurance pool where costs will be \npooled and spread.\n  Health reform will hold insurance companies to annual caps on how \nmuch they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.\n  Think about the battle this man went through and won over cancer and \nthen went to battle with his health insurance company. It is not \nunusual. It happens every day. This bill, which has been criticized by \nthose on the other side of the aisle, will give David and others like \nhim a fighting chance.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about another person. This is an \ninteresting story. Valerie, this beautiful young woman, is from \nArlington Heights, IL. She is a student, a doctoral student studying \nbiochemistry at Cambridge University in England. When she was 4 years \nold, Valerie was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. She decided early in \nlife that she wasn't going to let her diabetes stop her career \nambition. She couldn't become an artist or an entrepreneur; she knew \nshe needed a stable job because she always needed to have health care. \nShe had diabetes. Now, at 24, this brilliant young scientist, this \ndoctoral candidate, worries that her diabetes and what she calls the \n``broken, insecure U.S. health system'' will keep her from returning to \nthe United States from England and using her skills to help her home \ncountry.\n  To control her disease, Valerie needs a lot of medical service, \nincluding regular doctor visits and insulin shots. For most of her \nlife, her medical care was paid for by her parents, but those of us who \nraise children know what happens next. Most health care plans we have \nfor our families cut off our kids at age 24, and that is Valerie's age. \nHowever, Valerie is going to school in England. If you listen to some \nof the criticisms on the floor here about England and Canada and other \nnations that approach health care differently, you might have an \nimpression in your mind about what that means to be living in a country \nsuch as that.\n\n  Valerie, because she is a student at Cambridge in England, receives \nfree health care through England's national health service that she \nsays is as good or better than anything she had in the United States. \nIn addition to free doctor visits, insulin, and syringes, her care \nincludes regular contact with a dietician and an endocrinologist, also \nfree of charge.\n  These medical professionals have encouraged Valerie to take a more \nactive role in managing her own disease and she is in better health now \nthan she has been for years. Eventually she hopes to open her own \nlaboratory where she can use her great education and skills to continue \nresearch in mitochondrial biology and develop treatments and cures for \ndisease. Valerie worries about whether she will be able to do that if \nshe came back to the United States, and here is what she said:\n\n       As long as the same broken, insecure health system remains \n     in place, I see little incentive to come home to the United \n     States with my talents and experience.\n\n  We can't afford to lose talented scientists such as Valerie who one \nday might find a cure for a disease such as Parkinson's. We are the \nonly industrialized Nation in the world where people can die for lack \nof health insurance, and that is a fact: 45,000 a year. They can't get \nthe care they need to stay healthy and they lose their lives. If we \ndon't change this system, if we don't reform it, we stand to lose \ntalented people and we also stand to lose valuable lives.\n  The last person I want my colleagues to see is a friend of mine, Dale \nMizeur. Dale lives in Blue Mound, IL. The Mizeur family is well-known \nin my part of the world. I think I have met them all, and they are a \nbig family. Over the years, I have visited with them in their homes and \nin their home towns. Blue Mound is a little town south of Decatur, IL, \n1,100 people. Everybody knows one another. They are all neighbors and \nfriends. Most of them go to church together and have their community \npicnics; a great small town in Midwestern America. There are a lot of \nfarmers there. There are retired factory workers from the Caterpillar \nplants up in Decatur and a lot of folks who like living in a small \ntown. This used to be a thriving area. It has struggled with changes in \nmanufacturing and changes in our economy, but it is a close-knit \ncommunity.\n  Dale Mizeur lives there. He was born in Owaneco 61 years ago. He was \na hard worker at a Cat plant up in Decatur for 32 years. He decided to \nretire 11 years ago. Based on a simple calculation, he was told he \nwould have a modest pension and his health care costs would be covered \nin his union contract.\n  In the time since he retired, his expectations haven't been met. A \ndifficult economy and new contract negotiations up in Decatur have \nresulted in the erosion of Dale's union health care coverage. As a \nresult, he now has to spend more of his pension on filling the gaps in \nhis reduced health care coverage. His monthly premiums have skyrocketed \nfrom nothing when he first retired to almost $400 a month, and that is \n20 percent of his pension check. In addition to these premiums, the \nquality of his coverage has gone down. What was once a generous health \ncare plan has such high out-of-pocket\n\n[[Page S13413]]\n\ncosts that Dale questions whether he can afford to stay with it.\n  He is like most Americans; he doesn't worry about his health until he \nneeds to do something about it. During the early years of his \nretirement when his insurance coverage was rock solid, he considered \nhimself healthy and never saw the need to use it. But we all get a \nlittle older, our bodies aren't what they used to be, and things have \nchanged for Dale. A few weeks ago he noticed some pain in his chest, \nsome dizziness that was too noticeable to ignore. He saw his doctor who \ntold him to go to the emergency room. He fretted about what this was \ngoing to cost him, but he went anyway. Thankfully, Dale is physically \nOK, but economically and emotionally is another story.\n  Last week, Dale received his bill from the ER. His own personal out-\nof-pocket expense: $600. He now has to figure out how he is going to \npay that bill out of his pension. What other expenses will he have to \ndelay? What about the mortgage and utility bills? He has to worry about \nthe costs he will endure next time.\n  Dale and his wife live on a fixed income. As I said, he is 61 years \nold. The money that comes in each month is accounted for and there \nisn't a lot of wiggle room.\n  He is contemplating coming out of retirement after 11 years, \nprimarily because he can't make ends meet and because of medical \nexpenses. This isn't a very good economy for a 61-year-old retired \nfactory worker to look for a job. He is one of the many early retirees \nwho have found that health care costs threaten their financial \nstability. The unlucky ones lost their health care coverage completely, \nperhaps because their employer has gone bankrupt. Even those such as \nDale, who still has coverage, are finding themselves in a much more \nprecarious situation than they expected.\n  I tell these stories because they are real-life stories of people I \nhave either met or come to know because they have contacted our office. \nI listened to the minority leader come and say: Stop the presses, stop \nthe debate, stop moving forward in this effort to have real health care \nreform in America. The minority leader, from Kentucky, said we need to \nstart over.\n  We have been starting over on health care for decades. We have never \nreached the finish line because there are always obstacles in our path. \nRight now, the obstacle is bringing this matter to a vote. Why were we \nin session at 1 a.m. this morning casting a vote? Because the \nRepublican side of the aisle is determined that, regardless of the \nissue, they are going to stop us from bringing this matter to a debate \nand vote. They don't want us to have a vote on this. They don't want us \nto make a decision. They don't want to be on the record.\n  That is unfortunate. The bill they have chosen to filibuster--the one \nbefore us in the Senate--is a bill that should have no controversy \nwhatsoever. It is a bill to fund our troops. It is the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. Can you imagine, in the midst of a war, \nwhen the bravest men and women in our Nation are risking their lives at \nwar, the Republicans are filibustering the bill to pay their salaries, \nthe bill to pay for the equipment they need to stay safe, the bill to \npay for the medical care of these soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, \nand their families. It is unthinkable.\n  This is a bill that passed over in the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly. I think the number was 394 to 35, and 164 Republicans \nvoted for it because we want to stand behind our troops.\n  Last night, only 3 Republican Senators out of 40 would step up and \nsay we should go forward on this bill--only 3. The rest of them, led by \nthe minority leader and the minority whip, said we will stop this bill \nif this is the only way we can stop the health care debate. Why did \nthey pick this bill of all bills--a bill where we should be standing in \nsolidarity behind our troops, and we now have split into partisan \ncamps.\n  There is nothing partisan about standing behind our troops. That vote \nearly in the morning, unfortunately, was very partisan. There is also a \nprovision in the bill that deals with the unemployed in America.\n  We want to go home. I want to go home. I called my wife this morning. \nI have been here 3 straight weeks now, and it looks like there is \nanother week to follow before the holidays and Christmas. I don't like \nthis. You give up a lot in this job. There are certain pieces of my \nfamily life I hold dear, and this is one of them--to be back home for \nChristmas, not just at the last minute but to be there, and it doesn't \nlook like we will be able to do that. The Republicans decided they will \nuse every political and parliamentary device possible to delay this \nvote. So we will do nothing today because we are running the clock out \nunder the procedures of the Senate, and then we will meet at 7:30 \ntomorrow morning and have several votes on this Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, which should have been passed instantly when we \nreceived it from the House of Representatives. Then we will start the \nclock running again to move toward a vote on health care reform.\n  Why? Let's be honest. We ought to bring this matter up for a vote and \nsee if we, in fact, have 60 votes on this side of the aisle. I hope we \ndo. We are working on it. The reason I am here and the majority leader \nis not is because he is working, at this very moment, to bring those 60 \nvotes together. Instead, the Republicans have said they are going to do \neverything possible, including asking Members to stay here Christmas \nEve and Christmas Day, in order to stop this vote on health care \nreform. That is unfortunate.\n  Let me tell you the bottom line of what this bill does for America. \nThis bill is not perfect, and no bill we ever consider is. This bill, \nfirst, is the biggest deficit reduction ever introduced on the Senate \nfloor. If we bring down health care costs, it not only will help \nfamilies and businesses but even our Federal Government. As we bring \ndown the increase in the cost in health care, Medicare for seniors will \ncost less to the government. The same thing is true of Medicaid, the \nhealth insurance program for the poor and disabled.\n  First and foremost, CBO tells us this bill, at a time when we have \ngreat national debt, will actually bring down America's debt $130 \nbillion in the first 10 years and $650 billion more in the next 10 \nyears. So it is a fiscally responsible bill. That is what President \nObama challenged us to do: If you are going to pass health care reform, \ndon't do it at the expense of the next generation. Pay for it.\n  We do. We more than pay for it. We also reduce the cost of government \nin the process. The second thing the bill does is start to bring down \nhealth care costs. It does it in a variety of different ways. I wish it \nwere bringing it down faster. I commend the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, who joined with a group of freshman \nDemocrats, and they introduced cost-containment amendments to the \nbill--to be part of the managers' amendment--which have been heralded \nby the major business and manufacturing groups in America--a thoughtful \namendment that addresses the core issue of how to bring down health \ncare costs. They rolled up their sleeves and went to work and made an \namendment.\n  You cannot say the same, I am afraid, for the other side of the \naisle. Their amendments have not been as constructive as the one I just \ndescribed. They have tried to stop this bill rather than improve it. \nSenator Warner of Virginia and his freshman colleagues have taken a \nmore constructive and positive approach.\n  Bringing down costs of health insurance and making it more affordable \nis job one for this health care reform. But it does something else. \nThis bill extends the coverage of health insurance in America. \nCurrently, there are 50 million Americans who don't have health \ninsurance. They are people who have lost their jobs. They are folks who \nwork for small businesses and cannot afford health insurance. They are \npeople who have tried their best, but they can't get health insurance. \nThere are 50 million of them. Imagine, if you will, going to sleep \ntonight, if you are a father or mother with a sick child, and you have \nno health insurance. Imagine, for one frightening moment, waking \ntomorrow morning to face a diagnosis from a doctor of a serious illness \nor to be involved in an accident that requires medical care and having \nno health insurance. One out of every six Americans--50 million--have \nno health insurance.\n  This bill will change that. Thirty million Americans will be covered \nwith\n\n[[Page S13414]]\n\nhealth insurance who currently don't have coverage, and 15 million in \nthe lower income categories--the working poor and lower income folks--\nwill go into Medicaid at the State level; 15 million will go into \nprivate health insurance. At the end of the day, with this bill, 94 \npercent of Americans will have health insurance. That has never \nhappened in our history--ever; 94 percent will have the piece of mind \nof having health insurance.\n  There is something else this bill does. It goes back to my \nillustration. It says to the health insurance companies it is over; the \nway you have been mistreating the people who pay your premiums is going \nto come to an end. We are not going to allow you to ``fly-speck'' \napplications for health insurance to find a preexisting condition. We \nare going to make sure those with preexisting conditions have a real \nopportunity for health insurance coverage and will not be denied when \nthey need coverage. We are going to also make sure that when you get \nsick, the health insurance company cannot cut and run, as so many do. \nWe are going to extend that coverage for young people through ages 24 \nand 25. This is all good and positive. It will mean the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, which former and late Senator Kennedy and even Senator \nMcCain worked for, will be part of the law of America.\n\n  There are critics of this health insurance plan, for sure. We saw \nthem come out at townhall meetings and protests and so forth. Some \ndon't want to change the system; they like the system. They fear \ngovernment or whatever it may be. Their motive is to stop this. There \nare also critics who say this bill doesn't go far enough. It doesn't go \nas far as I would like to go. I think there ought to be a public \noption. We ought to have a not-for-profit plan that competes with \nprivate plans. The realities of the Senate don't make it possible to do \nthat in this bill at this time.\n  When the Republican leader comes to the floor and says so many people \noppose it--some oppose it because they may want to do nothing; others \ndon't think it does enough--that is the nature of this process. I have \nbeen around long enough to know you can't satisfy everybody. Is it \nbetter if this bill passes or not? I think the answer is overwhelmingly \nit is.\n  Howard Dean is my friend and a former Governor. He said he would vote \nagainst this. I say to Dr. Howard Dean: Don't you believe 30 million \nAmericans with health insurance are worth the effort? I think you do. I \nthink most people do. We can do better, and we will work to improve the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 16 minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side and 3\\1/2\\ minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the bill before us contains more than $128 \nbillion for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the President's \nannouncement 2 weeks ago that he would be ordering tens of thousands of \nadditional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the Congress has held numerous \nhearings examining the military strategy to be employed, political \nissues in the region, and the dispensation of funding for the war.\n  As we consider our course in Afghanistan, we should evaluate options \naccording to how well they contribute to U.S. national security. The \nultimate purpose of committing tens of thousands of new troops and tens \nof billions of additional dollars to the war effort in Afghanistan must \nbe to enhance U.S. security and our vital national interests in the \nregion.\n  Sometimes during long wars, specific tactical objectives can become \nends in themselves, disconnected from the broader strategic context or \nan accounting of finite resources. Congressional oversight of the funds \nin this bill is part of that accounting. We need to get the most value \nfor our defense dollar in Afghanistan, as well as Iraq. This is \nespecially true at a time when our Armed Forces have been strained by \nmany years of high deployment rates, our capacity for new government \ndebt is limited, and our Nation has not fully emerged from a severe \nrecession. As we think through the implications of the defense spending \nbill before us, we need to be cognizant that even if the President's \nAfghanistan plan achieves the very best stabilization scenario, \nallowing for U.S. withdrawals on the schedule he contemplates, we may \nbe responsible for most of the Afghanistan defense and police budgets \nindefinitely.\n  Much of the debate in Congress has focused on the President's stated \nintention to begin withdrawing some U.S. troops by July 2011. Some \nMembers have voiced the concern that such a date undercuts impressions \nof U.S. resolve and gives the Taliban and al-Qaida a target beyond \nwhich they can wait us out. Other Members, with a very different view \nof the war, worry that the July 2011 date is so flexible that it offers \nno assurance at all that troops will be withdrawn. This is a legitimate \nitem for debate, but I am doubtful that success or failure hinges on \nthis point nearly as much as it does on the counterinsurgency strategy \nemployed by allied troops, the viability of the Afghan security forces, \nand most importantly, how the United States engages with Pakistan.\n  I have confidence that the addition of tens of thousands of U.S. and \nallied troops, under the direction of Generals Petraeus and McChrystal \nwill improve the security situation on the ground in Afghanistan. More \nuncertain is whether the training mission will succeed sufficiently to \nallow U.S. forces to disengage from combat duties in a reasonable time \nperiod. The most salient question, however, is whether improvements on \nthe ground in Afghanistan will mean much if Taliban and al-Qaida \nsanctuaries in Pakistan remain or if instability within Pakistan \nintensifies.\n  As hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee have underscored, the \npotential global impact of instability in a nuclear armed Pakistan \ndwarfs anything that is likely to happen in Afghanistan. The future \ndirection of governance in Pakistan will have consequences for \nnonproliferation efforts, global economic stability, our relationships \nwith India and China, and security in both the Middle East and South \nAsia regions, among other major issues. The President and his team must \njustify their plan not only on the basis of how it will affect \nAfghanistan, but also on how it will impact our efforts to promote a \nmuch stronger alliance with Pakistan that embraces vital common \nobjectives.\n  Secretaries Clinton and Gates and Admiral Mullen acknowledged the \nimportance of Pakistan in the President's calculation. They underscored \nthat the administration is executing a regional strategy. I am \nencouraged by press reports that have described the intense diplomatic \nefforts with the Pakistani government aimed at securing much greater \ncooperation.\n  But we should remain cognizant that the focus of policy tends to \nfollow resources. By that measure, Afghanistan will still be at the \ncore of our regional effort.\n  The President has said that the United States did not choose this \nwar, and he is correct. But with these troop deployments to \nAfghanistan, we are choosing the battlefield where we will concentrate \nmost of our available military resources. The Afghanistan battlefield \nhas the inherent disadvantage of sitting astride a border with Pakistan \nthat is a porous line for the militants, but a strategic obstacle for \ncoalition forces. As long as this border provides the enemy with an \navenue of retreat for resupply and sanctuary, our prospects for \ndestroying or incapacitating the insurgency are negligible.\n  The risk is that we will expend tens of billions of dollars fighting \nin Afghanistan, while Taliban and al-Qaida leaders become increasingly \nsecure in Pakistan, where the long-term strategic stakes are even \nhigher. If they are able to sit safely across the border directing a \nhit-and-run war against us in Afghanistan, plotting catastrophic \nterrorist attacks abroad, and working to destabilize Pakistan from \nwithin, our strategic goals in the region will be threatened despite \nprogress on the ground in Afghanistan.\n  Some reports indicate that Taliban leaders, aware of the threat from \nU.S. operated Predator drones, are moving out of remote areas into \ncrowded Pakistani cities, including Karachi. If such reports are true, \nthe United States will have even fewer options in pursuing Taliban and \nal-Qaida leaders in Pakistan, absent the active help of Pakistani \nauthorities. Specifically, will\n\n[[Page S13415]]\n\nPakistan work with us to eliminate the leadership of Osama bin Laden \nand other major al-Qaida officials?\n  In addition to improving the cooperation of the Pakistani \nauthorities, the United States and our allies will have to become more \ncreative in how we engage with the Afghan and Pakistani people. We \nshould understand that as a matter of survival, people in dangerous \nareas on both sides of the border will tend to side with whoever is \nseen as having the best chance of winning. We should also recognize \nthat tribal loyalties, most notably Pashtun loyalties, are at odds with \na strong central government and with acquiescence to external military \npower. As Seth Jones of the Rand Corporation has observed: ``The \nobjective should be to do what Afghanistan's most effective historical \ngovernments have done: help Pashtun tribes, sub-tribes, and clans \nprovide security and justice in their areas and manage the process.'' \nMeaningful progress in Afghanistan is likely to require tolerance, or \neven encouragement, of tribal administration in many areas, as well as \nconvincing tribal leaders that opposing the Taliban is in their \ninterest.\n\n  In these circumstances, we should explore how cell phones and other \ncommunication technologies can be used more effectively, both as an \navenue for public diplomacy to the Afghan people and as a means for \ngathering intelligence from them. Already, seven million cell phones \nare in Afghanistan--one for every four inhabitants. The Taliban's \nreported priority on destroying communications towers underscores their \nunderstanding of the threat posed by these technologies. For example, \ncell phones could be used by sympathetic Afghans to produce real-time \nintelligence, including photographs of IEDs being prepared or calls \nalerting coalition troops to movements of the Taliban. Phones eliminate \nthe need for informants to take the risks of visiting a police station \nin person or of conversing openly with U.S. troops. Similarly, \nexpanding the use of credit card transactions could prove revolutionary \nin addressing some vexing problems in a country that lacks an effective \nbanking system. They can provide a way to reduce corruption, improve \naccounting within the Afghan government and security forces, and \nrelieve soldiers from the need to go AWOL to deliver pay safely to \ntheir families.\n  I want to recognize that the President has been confronted with \nextremely difficult choices in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He and his \nteam have worked through the problem carefully and deliberately to \nreach their conclusions. There are no options available that are \nguaranteed to succeed. Every conceivable course, from complete \nwithdrawal to maintaining the status quo to the plan outlined by the \nPresident, to an unrestrained and unlimited counterinsurgency campaign \nhas its own set of risks and costs for the United States. The President \ndeserves credit for accepting ownership of this difficult problem as we \ngo forward. In this situation, the advocacy of the President and his \nnational security team must continue to be as broad-minded and thorough \nas his policy review appeared to be.\n  Within months, the President is likely to ask Congress for additional \nfunds for Afghanistan, beyond what is contained in this bill. In the \nmeantime, the administration must be prepared to answer many questions \nabout its strategy as the American people study the potential \nconsequences of the President's decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my friend, the Senator from Illinois, whom \nI see back on the floor--for the record, the Senator from Illinois and \nI entered the House together longer ago than we would like to mention, \nparticularly for those who favor term limits. We have had our \nphilosophical disagreements, but I have appreciated his leadership. I \nhave appreciated his honest approach to the issues. We obviously have \nsignificant disagreements. Those disagreements have been respectful, \nand I look forward, during the next whatever period of time until we \ndispense with the issue of health care reform and the issue of DOD \nappropriations, to discussing this issue with him.\n  The Senator from Illinois has been saying that the Republicans are \nholding up funding for our troops by not conceding to an immediate vote \non the Defense appropriations bill after the House sent it to the \nSenate. I understand that, and I understand his zeal to get onto other \nissues, which is the job of the majority, to get legislation passed, \nbut I would like to point out the real facts.\n  The real facts about the Defense appropriations bill are that the \nHouse passed its version on July 30, last July 30. The Senate passed \nits version on October 6. By my calculation, that is well over 2 months \nago. All they had to do then, of course, was go to conference and \nreport it out to the floor of the Senate--something that could have \nbeen done in 24, 48 hours. Instead, over 2 months has gone by and the \nDemocratic leadership in both the House and Senate held captive this \nbill for the troops. Why would they do that? Because they knew that at \nthe end of the year, they would stuff in unrelated must-pass \nlegislation which has nothing to do with the Department of Defense or \nthe men and women in the military, they would have to put that in so \nthey could get it passed. We have a number of additional pieces of \nlegislation stuffed into the bill which the Democratic leadership knew \nhad to be passed.\n  I say in all due respect to my friend and colleague from Illinois--he \nand I, as I mentioned, have been around here the same amount of time--\nthe fact is, after the House and Senate both passed their bills over 2 \nmonths ago, they could have brought it to the floor and we could have \ndebated it and, of course, passed it into law.\n  So now we have the Secretary of Defense calling around to people \nsaying: We have to pass this immediately. Where was the Secretary of \nDefense, whom I admire and respect, on October 7, 2009, after the \nSenate passed its bill? Where was he then urging Members to not harm \nthe men and women who are serving in the military?\n  I will get from my staff the bills that are stuffed into this bill \nwhich have nothing to do with our Nation's defense and have everything \nto do with the agenda of the Democratic majority. I want to say again \nto my friend from Illinois, I understand that. I understand why they \nare doing what they are doing. But I don't understand why they are \nblaming us when after 2 months the bill has not been passed.\n  Let me just add, there is a portion of the bill called division B, \n``Other Matters.'' Only in the Senate could we call it ``Other \nMatters.'' Let me tell you what they have larded onto the Defense bill.\n  Food stamps. Food stamps are very necessary. Is anybody going to be \nagainst food stamps? Of course not. It extends appropriations for the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the USDA. Food stamps \nadministration, $400 million in emergency funds through September 30, \n2011.\n  Satellite Home Viewer Act extension. Perhaps the Senator from \nIllinois, my friend, can tell me what the Satellite Home Viewer Act \nextension has to do with defending our Nation. I know it has a lot to \ndo with the ability of millions of Americans to watch NFL football, but \nI do not think it has a lot to do with defense spending.\n  PATRIOT Act extension. Section 1004 provides a clean 2-month \nextension until February 28, 2010, of the three PATRIOT Act provisions \nexpiring at the end of this calendar year. That has to do with \ninvestigation of business records and also roving wiretaps. Is there \nanyone who did not know the PATRIOT Act was going to expire? Was the \nSenator from Illinois unaware that we needed to extend the PATRIOT Act? \nMost people believe we do. We still have extremist organizations that \nwant to attack the United States of America.\n  Flood insurance extension. It extends the Flood Insurance Program \nthrough February 28, 2010.\n  Small business extension. There is $125 million for the Small \nBusiness Administration to continue offering reduced-fee and higher cap \nloan guarantees under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It \nextends the higher limits through February 28, 2010. It further \ndesignates such amounts as emergency spending; i.e., it is not included \nin the budget. But that is an argument for another day.\n  The point is, again, small businesses are vital. Small businesses are \nwhat\n\n[[Page S13416]]\n\nhave been ignored. Small business is the reason the stimulus package \nhas failed. It has done a great job for Wall Street--boy, these \nbonuses, $16 billion, $18 billion, are going to be distributed. They \nare going to have a Merry Christmas up on Wall Street at Goldman and \nMorgan and all those places. It is going to be great, thanks to the \nTARP and the stimulus package. But what is it on Main Street where we \nhave 10-percent unemployment?\n  Of course we need to help small businesses. They have not done much \nso far, I tell you that. I will take you to my State and take you all \nover this country outside of Manhattan, and they will tell you small \nbusinesses are hurting very badly. We could not do that before. We had \nto put it on the Defense appropriations bill.\n  We also have payment for a North Carolina construction project. Here \nis something that really has a lot to do with defending the Nation. It \nprovides a $12.8 million appropriation for a construction project in \nNorth Carolina, of which--note designation of the State--of which $4 \nmillion will be obligated immediately and the rest will be available \n120 days after the signing of an agreement between the Federal \nGovernment and several local authorities. This is paid for through \nrescission funds previously appropriated for this project. I don't know \nwhat the project is, I say to my colleagues, but I am not sure we are \nin dire need.\n  In addition, highways extension. Section 1008 extends the authority \nfor the highway trust fund to make and receive payments through \nFebruary 28. It also provides $33.4 million for administrative \nexpenses, paid for out of the earlier rescission from the highway trust \nfund. I am one who believes we need to make sure the highway trust fund \nis funded and we move forward with the highways. Again, what does that \nhave to do with defending this Nation? Not a lot.\n  Unemployment insurance extension. Here we are again. It extends the \nauthority of expiring Federal unemployment insurance programs and \nbenefits through February 28, 2010, continuing the current availability \nof up to 99 weeks of total unemployment. Of course, we have to extend \nunemployment. Unemployment, except up on Wall Street, is at 10 percent. \nIn my home State of Arizona, real unemployment is 17 percent.\n  In addition to that, I guess the conferees were beavering away by \nadding earmarks, and plenty of them--in fact, 1,720 earmarks, totaling \n$4.3 billion; $2.5 billion in unauthorized and unrequested C-17s. No \none outside of those who are contractors believes we need to spend $2.5 \nbillion on unauthorized C-17s which cost $2.5 billion; $500 million in \nunrequested and unwanted funding for the Joint Strike Fighter \nalternative engine and Presidential helicopter. That is $7.3 billion. \nThere is $18 billion in new non-offset funding for food stamps, \nunemployment assistance, COBRA benefits, physician payments, the so-\ncalled doc fix, and small business lending. By designating the funding \nas an ``emergency,'' none of it is paid for. It is just another $18 \nbillion of debt that will be laid on our children and grandchildren and \nour national debt in 2010.\n  I guess some Americans wonder why we are going to have a debt for \nthis year of $1.5 trillion--trillion, ``t,'' trillion. Someone said to \nme--several times it has been said to me--we hope the President never \nlearns what comes after a trillion.\n  Here we are with another $18 billion of funny money. Here we are with \na bill passed by the Senate 2 months 10 days ago and passed by the \nHouse months before that. Clearly, one can only assume--let me put it \nthis way: One would question, if the Senate passed its version on \nOctober 6 and the House passed its version on July 30, then why would \nwe wait until December 16 to bring it to the floor of the Senate? One \nmight conjecture that they did not bring it to the floor of the Senate \nbecause they knew it was going to have to be passed by the Congress of \nthe United States. Of course, we are going to pass it. So this is the \nbest opportunity to add these programs and projects that would never \notherwise be passed. So here we are with legislation to take care of \nthe men and women in the military and our national security needs and \nwe have loaded it up with $7.3 billion in pork and $18 billion in new \noffset funding, which is not paid for. So then my friend and colleague \nfrom Illinois comes to the floor and says: Republicans are holding up \nthe passage of this bill, even though--even though--the Senate passed \nthis bill on October 6.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be more than happy to engage in a colloquy with \nmy friend from Illinois, if he requests to do so or just has a \nquestion--either way.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have a question. When we were here at 1 a.m., bleary-\neyed and voting, there were two unanimous consent requests made to pass \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill immediately. Does the \nSenator from Arizona remember the objections to passing the bill \nimmediately so we could get the money to the troops came from his side \nof the aisle when we tried to pass this bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do recall that, I say to my friend, and I also recall I \nwas only allowed 10 minutes--10 minutes--to talk about this bill and \nthe 1,720 earmarks such as the telescope in Hawaii and--I have a list \nhere somewhere. But I was allowed 10 minutes, and I need a long time to \ntalk about this.\n  If the Democratic majority, which is their right, wants to wait until \nDecember 17 and then jam it through in the middle of the night, that is \ntheir right to try it. But we need to talk more about why the American \npeople are angry. Here we have a bill to defend the Nation--to defend \nthe Nation--and $18.9 million for a center at the University of \nMassachusetts ``dedicated to educating the general public, students, \nteachers, new Senators, and Senate staff about the role and importance \nof the Senate.''\n  I hope this organization, this center at the University of \nMassachusetts, will somehow come into being, perhaps, but not by taking \nit out of money for Defense. If there is ever a time the American \npeople need to understand the role and importance of the Senate--given \nour approval rating is about 4 percent, and I haven't met any of them--\nI understand why someone would want to have a center to teach new \nSenators and Senate staff about the role and importance of the Senate. \nBut $18.9 million, when people are not being able to stay in their \nhomes, when they are unemployed, when they can't feed their families, \nwhen unemployment is 17 percent? Sure, let's add it on to the Defense \nappropriations bill. That is the way to do it.\n  Here are some more: $500,000 for my old favorite--the old Brown Tree \nSnake Program. I totaled up the millions that have been spent on the \nold Brown Tree Snake Program. Of course, Historical Fort Hamilton \nCommunity Club, that needs $1.8 million. The old Historical Fort \nHamilton Community Club, I am sure it is a nice place to visit.\n  I am sure it is great to have $1.6 million to study human genetics at \nthe Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health in Brewer, ME; $3.5 \nmillion for a microalgae biofuel project in Hawaii; $5 million for the \nPresidio Heritage Center, a museum, in San Francisco; $1.6 million for \nthe Center for Space Entrepreneurship. I think that would match with \nthe $2.9 million we appropriated on the previous bill to study surgery \nin outer space.\n  I am telling you, the Trekkies are happy about these appropriations \nbills. Here are more: the $1.6 million for a Virtual Business \nAccelerator for the Silicon Prairie; $7.8 million to develop key \ntechnologies needed for the long-term operations in near-space \nconditions. So we have surgery in outer space and key technologies \nneeded for near-space conditions for the Orion High Altitude Long \nEndurance Risk Reduction Effort, the Aurora Flight Sciences in \nColumbus, MI; $2.4 million for Fusion Goggle System; $800,000 for \nAdvanced Tactical Laser Flashlight in Wyandotte, MI; $10 million for \nthe Hawaii Technology Development Venture.\n  My friends, this is kind of a classic example. I see my friend and \ncolleague on the floor, Senator Coburn, a man of courage and integrity \nand one who I think has led, in many ways, this fight. But here is an \nearmark in this bill--it has never been authorized, never had a \nhearing--$10 million for the Hawaii Technology Development Venture. \nWhat could that be? What could that be? Did we ever have a hearing? Did \nwe ever have a depiction of this? Did we ever have it? No. It is \nincluded by the appropriators.\n\n[[Page S13417]]\n\n  A few more: $3.9 million for Intelligent Decision Exploration. If \nthere is ever a place that needed that, it must be, in my view, the \nCongress. So $3.9 million for Intelligent Decision Exploration. I \nthink, frankly, the results of that exploration would be rather bleak. \nHow about $2.3 million for marine species; $2.4 million for NAVAIR High \nFidelity Oceanographic Library.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Oh, here is Hawaii again--strange how \nHawaii pops up--$2 million for Advanced Laboratory for Information \nIntegration, naturally, in Hawaii; $1.2 million for the Model for Green \nLaboratories and Clean Rooms Project.\n  Now, again, I wish to point out, as my colleague from Oklahoma has, \nthese may be very worthwhile projects. They may be projects that maybe \nwill help America. Maybe spending our Defense appropriations--$5.8 \nmillion of it--for the Rock Island Arsenal Roof Replacement in Rock \nIsland, IL, is something that is badly needed. Maybe the $800,000 for \nthe Natural Gas Firetube Boiler Demonstration at the Rock Island \nArsenal is also very necessary. But how are we to know? How are we to \nknow?\n  So the Senator from Illinois and the Democratic leader have come to \nthe floor and are saying: The Republicans are blocking passage of \nvitally needed funding for the men and women in the military who are \ndefending our Nation as we speak. My response is: Where were you for \nthe last 2 months after the Senate passed this bill? The Senate and the \nHouse could have had a conference and we could have had this bill long \nago.\n  The fact is, it has been loaded up with food stamps, the Satellite \nHome Viewer Act extension, the PATRIOT Act extension, flood insurance \nextension, small business extension, payment for construction projects, \nhighways extension, unemployment insurance, COBRA extension, the old \ndoc fix--the old doc fix that we do year to year, which is another \nchapter in profiles of courage on the part of the Congress--poverty \nadjustment freeze, rescission of DTV funds, and it goes on and on. What \ndoes all that have to do with Defense? What does that have to do with \ndefending this Nation? What does that have to do with giving the men \nand women, who are serving in our armed services today in harm's way, \nthe best equipment, the best training, and the best support we can \nprovide to them?\n  I see my colleague from Oklahoma on the floor and so I yield the \nfloor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank Senator McCain. I think America looks at us and \nsays: Here it is, a week before Christmas, and we are debating the \nDefense appropriations bill, but it is interesting to note that the \nfirst appropriations bill that passed out of the Congress was the bill \nto fund us.\n  We put us first. We didn't put our troops first. We didn't put the \nDepartment of Defense first. We have had no inflation this year, and \nwhat did we do? We gave ourselves a 5.8-percent increase. The first \nappropriations bill to be passed and signed by the President. We put us \nfirst.\n  So here we find ourselves a week before Christmas debating the \nDefense bill, while we are in the midst of two wars, and there is an \nincrease of only 4 percent. Yet we have all these people who say they \nare for Defense. We pass a bill that increases our own expenses by 5.8 \npercent and then we tell the Defense Department: You can't do that. You \ncan't have what we have.\n  The fact is, it is easy to return 15 percent of everything you take \nin up here, in what you are allotted. I have done it, on average, every \nyear I have been here. My employees are well paid. They work hard, but \nthey are well paid. So we gave ourselves a 5.8-percent increase, but \nthis Defense Department bill, in the middle of two wars, has a 4-\npercent increase.\n  That is not the worst of it because the average of all the increases \nright now is almost 11 percent on all the rest of the bills and here \nthey are. That doesn't include any of the spending for each of these \nagencies--which averaged around 30 percent of their budget--that they \ngot in the stimulus bill. Here we go: We give ourselves a 5.8-percent \nincrease; Homeland Security, 7.2 percent; T-HUD, 23 percent; Interior, \n16 percent; State and Foreign Ops, 33 percent. We did ours first to \nmake sure we got us covered.\n\n  All of this is very ironic to me, based on the fact that out of every \ndollar we spend this year, 43 cents of it is borrowed. Of every dollar \nthe Federal Government spends, 43 cents out of that dollar is borrowed. \nWe are borrowing $4.2 billion a day. That is not every business day, \nthat is every day of the week. There is $350 billion to $380 billion \nworth of waste in the Federal Government. Yet not one place in any of \nthese bills do we eliminate duplicative services; not one place in any \nof these bills did we eliminate fraud; not one place in any of these \nbills did we cut the value of earmarks--though the number is down, only \nslightly, but the total dollar is up.\n  We made no attempt to do what every family in America is doing today; \nthat is, to prioritize. Next year, it is going to be 45 cents of every \ndollar the Federal Government spends we are going to borrow. Why is \nthat important? It is important because the people making the decisions \nto borrow the money are not the ones who will have to pay it back. We \nare going to transfer that. We are going to violate the tradition and \nheritage of our country because we are going to transfer a markedly \nlower standard of living to our children.\n  I met this little girl. She is from Maryland. Her name is Madelyn. If \nyou divide the total debt by the total population--just the debt we owe \nnow--and that is truly Enron accounting because it doesn't count the \ninternal debt we owe or money we borrowed from Medicare, money we \nborrowed from Social Security, and other transfer funds--it equals \n$38,375. That is what it was when this picture was taken. It is well \nover $39,000 for every man, woman, and child, and that is just on \nexternal debt. The only thing she owns is a dollhouse.\n  The real tragedy is, when Madelyn is 45, everybody her age and \nyounger will be responsible for $1.19 million worth of debt and over \n$70,000 worth of interest per year before they pay any other taxes, \nbefore they buy themselves a home or an automobile or before they send \ntheir kids to school. They will be $1.19 million in debt, plus combined \nunfunded liabilities.\n  This is the U.S. debt clock. It sits in the doorway of my office in \nthe Russell Building. I had it out in the hall, but the Rules Committee \nwould not allow people to look at that. I don't know whether they \ndidn't want them to see it or it truly doesn't fit with protocol. Now I \nhave a door open in my office and I have this on the live computer \nscreen and it changes every day.\n  It is pretty interesting. This was as of November 21. So, November 21 \nto December 18, that is 27 days, we have borrowed another $100 billion \nsince we took this picture off the Internet. We are at $12.118 \ntrillion. Calendar year to date, the Federal Government had spent \n$3.285 trillion. The debt per citizen on the 21st was $39,000 and, per \ntaxpayer, it was $110,000. Our deficit as of November 1, for the \ncalendar year, was $1.409 trillion--all of it borrowed.\n  The private debt in the country is $16 trillion. That is our private \ndebt. That is what all of us owe on our own stuff. The mortgage debt is \n$14 trillion.\n  If you look at the second screen that is outside my office, what you \nsee is the total cost of the bailout so far--$11 trillion. We only have \npersonal savings of $643 billion. Our savings per adult is less than \n$3,000. How do you take that $3,000 against the $39,000 and make any \nsense out of it?\n  The final screen shows the personal individual debt, the credit card \ndebt, and the payment debt. It also shows our GDP. We are good as a \nnation. Our workers are good. We produce $91,000 worth of product per \nperson every year. That is going to decline because of what the Federal \nGovernment is doing.\n  There was a guy once named Cicero and he warned of some things that \nwere happening in one of the best known and most successful republics \nin the world. It happened to be Rome. Here is what he said. ``The \nbudget should be balanced.'' I think 90 percent of America would agree \nwith that:\n\n       The Treasury should be refilled, the public debt should be \n     reduced, the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and \n     controlled, and the assistance to foreign lands should be \n     curtailed lest Rome become bankrupt. People must again learn \n     to work, instead of living on public assistance.\n\n  They didn't listen to Cicero, much like the Senate is not listening \nto the\n\n[[Page S13418]]\n\ncitizens of this country and we are growing a Federal Government we \ncannot afford, outside the bounds of what this document, the U.S. \nConstitution, says is our legitimate role. If you go to it and look at \narticle I, section 8, you see the enumerated powers and you go look at \nthe 10th amendment and ask: How in the world is the Federal Government \ninvolved in all these things?\n  We have before us a bill to fund our troops and fighting two wars. \nOther than one other appropriations bill, we gave it the smallest \nincrease.\n  By the way, in this bill is $18 billion of what we call emergency so \nwe do not have to play inside the budget. We automatically transferred \nanother $18 billion to Madelyn and her generation.\n  How do we get out of this? What do we do? We actually, in Congress, \nshould be following the lead of the families in this country. What are \nfamilies doing? Families are sitting down and making priorities. They \nare saying what are the things we must do? What are the things we want \nto do? What are the things we would like to do? Most of the ``What are \nthe things we would like to do?'' are going out of the window for \nAmerican families today. A large portion of the things families want to \ndo is going out the window so they can maintain the things they must \ndo. It is called making hard choices.\n  When you see that the Congress took care of itself before it took \ncare of anybody else, it describes the problem in Washington. We are \nabsolutely clueless as to what the average American is going through. \nWe could have all the words on this Senate floor said that we want to \nsay, but our actions speak far louder than any words we could ever say. \nWhat are our actions? Our actions are to steal the future and \nprosperity of our children. It is not a very noble cause.\n  We are here this week not because of the Defense Department bill. We \nare not here the week before Christmas because of this bill. We are \nhere the week before Christmas because somebody has set an artificial \ndeadline that we must pass a health care bill, any health care bill, so \nwe can say we passed a health care bill. That is why we are here. When \nwe look at health care in our country, we recognize that we have \nsignificant problems in making sure everybody has access to care. We \nknow what the problem is on access to care because we know per capita \nwe spend almost twice as much as anybody else in the world on health \ncare. The problem plaguing access to care--and as a practicing \nphysician for over 25 years--is cost.\n  We have some bill coming sometime that will not be available for 72 \nhours for everybody in the country to read, that by the time you add \nthe 2,074 pages to the couple of hundred pages we are going to add on, \nnobody is going to understand exactly what they are voting on. But we \nare going to vote on it because we said we would. We are going to \nimpact one-sixth of our economy and we are going to destroy the best of \nour health care system in the name of fixing some of the problems in \nour system.\n  We are totally disconnected with America, the America I know. There \nwas a guy who said--I will paraphrase the statement:\n\n       Freedom is a precious thing. It is not ours by inheritance \n     alone. It must be fought for and defended by each and every \n     successive generation.\n\n  What is that freedom he is talking about and who was he talking to? \nHe was talking to the American people. He wasn't talking to our troops. \nThe freedom he was talking about was the liberty that comes when free \npeople come together under a democratic Republic with a limited Federal \nGovernment to make the best choices they can make for themselves and \ntheir families, and the freedom to do just that. That person was Ronald \nReagan.\n  I got an e-mail from a constituent of mine. I can't use the exact \nwords because they are not appropriate for the Senate floor. But he \nkind of paraphrased that statement and then he said: Every now and then \nsomebody comes along and pees it all away. He said: Son, don't let it \nbe you.\n  Our freedom is being taken away in this country--not intentionally \nbut unintentionally. Because as the Federal Government grows and \nexpands, your opportunity to make choices for yourself and your family \nbecome limited. We have a health care bill that is going to spend $2.5 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. It is going to cause premiums to rise, \nit is going to cause quality of care to go down, it is going to cause \nus to lose 1.6 million more jobs, and it is going to involve the \nGovernment between the patient and the caregiver. That bill will create \n70 new government programs, 15,000 to 20,000 new Federal employees. It \nwill create three panels that will ration care in this country \ndirectly. And it will in fact take Americans'--not just Americans on \nMedicare or Medicaid--Americans' freedom to make the best decision for \nthem and their family as regard to their health care and stuff it in a \nbox.\n  That is because we are going to tell you what you can have, what you \ncan buy. We are going to totally disregard the art of medicine and we \nare going to practice cookbook medicine in this country.\n  A week ago we reversed the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nrecommendation on breast cancer screening. We are going to have to do \nthat hundreds of times every year under the bill that is being proposed \nright now because all of that is based on cost estimates. It was based \non 1 out of every 1,970 women they find a breast cancer in between 40 \nand 50; but what people didn't say is in 1 out of 1,400 women between \n50 and 60 they find a cancer. So on a cost basis they are right; on a \nclinical basis they are not.\n  The majority whip earlier today said the Republicans didn't have any \nideas on health care. The fact is we do have ideas on health care. What \nwe know from a Thomson Reuters study that came out in April of this \nyear is that there is $700 billion in our system today that is not \nhelping anybody get well and isn't preventing anybody from getting \nsick. If we want to truly cut the cost of health care, what ought to be \nrequired reading for every Senator in this body is the Thomson Reuters \nreport. Because they can go through the fraud and abuse--19 percent of \neverything we spend. Unwarranted use--that includes me as a doctor \ndoing tests I should not be doing. That includes defensive medicine, \nadministrative inefficiencies, provider inefficiency and errors, \navoidable care and lack of care coordination--duplication.\n  We have not attacked the disease of runaway health care costs in this \ncountry. What we have attacked is the symptoms. You do not cure people \nby treating their symptoms. You cure people by finding out what their \ndisease is and curing the disease and treating the disease.\n  We are accused of being the party of ``no.'' I want to tell my \ncolleagues and the American public, ``no'' is a wonderful word. When \nyour child is misbehaving, you say ``no.'' When your adolescent child \nis making bad judgments, you say ``no.'' When somebody is stealing \nsomething from somebody else, i.e. liberty, you say ``no.'' When you \nare stealing the future, in terms of opportunity, we should say ``no.'' \nWhen you are creating a government-centric health care system rather \nthan a patient-centric health care system, ``no'' is a great word.\n  We have heard all about why we do not have any ideas. We had two \nmarkups. The ideas we offered were rejected.\n  I see Senator Wyden on the floor. He has a wonderful health care \nbill. It is somewhat different than the one I introduced but it is a \ngreat bill. It does not fall into any of the traps the bill that is on \nthe floor today falls into. It also addresses many of the problems that \nare outlined in the Thomson Reuters study on health care in America.\n  Saying ``no'' at the right time saves lives. Saying ``no'' at the \nright time saves money. Saying ``no'' at the proper time preserves our \nfuture. Saying ``no'' when no is the best answer is the correct, right \nthing to do.\n  We have a government we cannot afford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. We have a government we cannot afford. We are borrowing \nmoney to buy things we do not need. We earmarked $18 billion worth of \nprojects this year. Some were good and some were terrible.\n  We eliminated no duplication in any agencies. We got rid of none of \nthe fraud. We did nothing about efficiency,\n\n[[Page S13419]]\n\nand we did nothing about creating priorities. I agree with my \nDemocratic colleagues that health care should be a priority. When we \nhad the leadership, we didn't do anything with it, and we should have. \nBut mark my words, this is a turning point in America if we pass this \nhealth care bill. It is a turning point from which we will not recover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Democratic side \nhas 30 minutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see the Senator from Oregon is here. If I could have a \nfew minutes to respond and then turn the floor over to him for as much \ntime as he would need--I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  First, a history lesson. Sometimes facts are tenuous, difficult, \nsticky things you can't get rid of. Let's look at the facts. When \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton left the Presidency, America's budget was in \nsurplus. For the first time in 30 years, we were generating more \nrevenue than we were spending. We were adding life and longevity to the \nSocial Security system, to Medicare, and many others. We did this with \na prosperous, booming economy, one of the most prosperous we had seen \nin modern history. We created new jobs, new businesses, new home \nopportunities. When William Jefferson Clinton left office, we had a \nnational debt of $5 trillion.\n  In came the Republicans, billing themselves as fiscal conservatives. \nThey were going to do it better, get government off our backs, reduce \nspending, and show us how they could manage. They took a $5 trillion \nnational debt, and over the next 8 years more than doubled it. In other \nwords, when George W. Bush left office, America had more debt, twice as \nmuch, as was the case when he took office.\n  How did we reach a point where our debt mushroomed and more than \ndoubled in 8 years? Because these fiscally conservative, flinty-eyed, \nstyptic-hard Republicans engaged in a war they wouldn't pay for. Some \nof the Senators who just spoke this morning voted for us to go to war \nand not pay for it and just add it to the debt.\n  Secondly, President Bush did something no President had ever done in \nhistory. It was counterintuitive. It made no sense, but he did it. What \nwas it? He cut taxes in the midst of a war. It has never been done \nbecause you can't explain it. You have the ordinary expenses of \ngovernment that still continue, and now you have a new expensive war. \nAnd instead of doing what Franklin Roosevelt did in World War II, \nsaying we are going to sell bonds, we will do our best to pay for this \nwar, they said just the opposite: We will go into debt even deeper to \nnot pay for the war. That is what they did. They went into debt by \ncutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n  Unpaid for wars, tax cuts in the midst of wars for the wealthiest \npeople, and then to add insult to injury, they passed the Medicare \nprescription Part D Program--a needed program, for sure--and didn't pay \nfor it, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the debt too. So at \nthe end of 8 years, George W. Bush, who inherited a surplus from Bill \nClinton, gave us twice the national debt, gave us the largest annual \ndeficit we had ever seen, and left the economy in shambles.\n  Witness the recession we are currently in just starting to inch away \nfrom. That was the record of the fiscally conservative, let's-get-\ntough-on-debt Republicans for 8 years, and many of those years they \ncontrolled Congress. All of those years the President had a veto pen.\n  When I come to the Senate floor and hear my Republican colleagues \nrelate how they have a better vision of America--and their vision is in \nmany respects a good one, to reduce debt for future generations--the \nrecord speaks for itself. They failed.\n  Now comes President Obama, and he says to Congress: We have to get \nthe economy moving again. Some Republicans are criticizing him saying \nit is a mistake for us to put money into our economy. The President \nsaid we have to put people back to work, give working families a tax \ncut, create jobs building highways and infrastructure, do the things \nthat help small businesses expand their payrolls. It costs money for \nsure, and I know we are in debt, but if we don't get that engine of the \neconomy churning and moving forward, then we will never get out of this \nhole and more suffering will be the lot of the American people.\n  Not a single Republican would support that, not one. We didn't get \none Republican vote for that in the House of Representatives. Over \nhere, we had three--the two Senators from Maine and the Senator from \nPennsylvania who has since crossed the aisle and joined the Democratic \nparty. That was the reality. As a party, the Republicans opposed \nstimulating the economy in the midst of the deepest recession.\n  Now comes health care. President Obama says to us: Before you pass \nthis health care bill, there is one basic rule--do not add to the \ndeficit. Find a way to reduce health care costs for individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses. Do not add to the deficit. The Congressional \nBudget Office took a look at this bill--it took a year to prepare it--\nand said it is the biggest deficit cutter in the history of the United \nStates because over 10 years, this bill alone will save the Federal \nGovernment $130 billion and over the next 10 years, $650 billion. If we \ncontinue without changing the current health care system, it will mean \nmore debt for everyone, higher premiums, higher costs, and more \ndeficit. That is the fiscal choice we face.\n  I hear Senator McCain, who is my friend--I respect him. We served the \nsame period of time together in the House and Senate, and we disagree \non a whole lot of things. But I like him. I think he likes me a little \nbit some days--come to the floor and say: Do you know what is wrong \nwith this Department of Defense appropriations bill? In his words, the \nDemocrats have ``larded it up.'' They have larded on things.\n  What is the lard in this bill? The extension of unemployment benefits \nfor millions of Americans out of work. Last time I came to the floor of \nthe Senate it passed 97 to nothing--not exactly a hotly controversial \nissue. Sadly, it took us 1 whole month to get to a vote. Then it passed \n97 to nothing.\n  We larded it up with food stamps. In the State of Michigan, one out \nof six people is on food stamps. Food stamps in this economy are a \nlifeline for people to feed their children when they are out of work \nand don't know where the next meal is coming from. Is that the kind of \nsquandering of taxpayers' dollars that we often hear from Senator \nMcCain. I don't think so. He is not a hardhearted man. He wants to feed \nchildren. He wants food stamps.\n  How about COBRA? COBRA is an acronym for a program that allows people \nto pay for health insurance. One of the first casualties when you lose \nyour job is your health insurance. We want people to keep that health \ninsurance. We help them pay the premiums. That is in here. I don't \nthink we are larding it up when we include that.\n  The extension of the PATRIOT Act for a few months. Of course, if we \nare going to be vigilant against enemies, we want to extend it. We can \ndebate what should be in it, but an extension of the PATRIOT Act is \ngoing to mean that America will be safer. The alternative is \nunacceptable.\n  Money for the Small Business Administration--that is where jobs are \ncreated. If we don't give money in loans to small businesses, we will \nsee people losing their businesses and cutting back on employment. This \nis just fundamental. There is no credible, respectable, mainline \neconomist who argues that the way to get out of a recession is to cut \nspending at the Federal level. Exactly the opposite is true. You have \nto help people with the safety net. You have to try to create a \ncatalyst for more job creation. That means spending money.\n  I don't think this is lard and earmarks and porkbarrel. We are \ntalking about the basic necessities of life. The Department of Defense \nappropriations should not be filibustered as the Republicans are \ncurrently doing.\n  Before I hand the floor over to the Senator from Oregon, I salute \nhim. He has given more hard thought as an individual Senator than \nalmost anyone in this Chamber about what to do with the system. The \nSenator's premise in health care is the right premise--more \ncompetition, more choice. We may disagree on some concepts. That is \nwhat we are here for. But I want to salute\n\n[[Page S13420]]\n\nthe Senator from Oregon and tell him this underlying health care bill \nis going to do things for America that need to be done. It is going to \nstart--not as much as we would like--to bring down the increase in \ncosts and provide affordability for families and businesses. It will \nextend the reach of health insurance to 94 percent of the American \npeople. It is amazing. It is historic. It is going to create a \nPatients' Bill of Rights which gives every family in America the legal \ntools to fight back when the health insurance company says no to their \ndoctor and no to what they or their families need. It has a lot of \npositive things in it.\n  I want to salute Senator Wyden, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders of \nVermont, for one particular provision in the bill. We don't have the \ndetails yet, but we believe this will result in the most dramatic \nexpansion of health care clinics across America. Those of us who \nrepresent communities such as Chicago and even downstate Illinois know \nthese clinics are the first line of defense for medicine. Men and women \ncan walk through the front door and find primary care and have their \nneeds taken care of even if they are poor. Some of the most dedicated, \nhardworking professionals in medicine are in those clinics.\n  I have walked into many in Chicago, such as the Alivo Clinic where my \nfriend Carmen Velasquez is the director. I have said: Carmen, if I were \nsick or my wife were sick, I would feel confident walking in the front \ndoor of your clinic. You have the best people on Earth who are doing \ndramatic things.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be printed in the Record an article \nfrom the Chicago Sun Times that talks about the terrible health care \ndisparities in the United States, particularly between African \nAmericans and White Americans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Suntimes, Dec. 18, 2009]\n\n           Health Gap Kills 3,200 Black Chicagoans Every Year\n\n                           (By Monifa Thomas)\n\n       The wide racial gap in health is growing in Chicago, a \n     major new study has found.\n       Already lagging far behind whites on most key measures of \n     health, blacks in Chicago have fallen even further behind in \n     11 of 15 areas reviewed by Chicago's Sinai Urban Health \n     Institute between 1990 and 2005--including infant mortality, \n     heart-disease deaths and diabetes.\n       There's a stark, human cost in that: In all, the \n     researchers estimated that the toll of the black-white health \n     disparity is an additional 3,200 deaths of African Americans \n     in Chicago every year.\n       It isn't that blacks' health is declining. In fact, \n     overall, the health of both African Americans and whites in \n     Chicago and across the United States has improved on most of \n     the measures studied between 1990 and 2005. But whites showed \n     gains at a sharply higher rate, resulting in a wider gap, \n     according to the Sinai institute, which is part of Chicago's \n     Sinai Health System and which works to find ``approaches that \n     improve the health of urban communities.''\n       Nationally, the racial gap in health between blacks and \n     whites in the United States has remained fairly constant over \n     the same 15-year period, according to the new analysis, which \n     was abased largely on communicable disease reports and birth \n     and death records and was published online Thursday in the \n     American Journal of Public Health.\n       In Chicago, areas where the divide between blacks and \n     whites in Chicago worsened significantly included: the death \n     rates from heart disease and breast cancer, rates of prenatal \n     care during the first trimester of pregnancy and the number \n     of cases of tuberculosis.\n       The death rate from all causes for black Chicagoans was 36 \n     percent higher than whites in 1990. By 2005, the difference \n     had grown to 42 percent. In contrast, at the national level \n     the racial gap in death rates shrank, going from 35 percent \n     to 29 percent.\n       The researchers attributed the growing racial gap largely \n     to whites' greater ability to benefit from health care \n     advances because of ``racism and poverty.''\n       ``What's happening is that, as advances become available \n     for these different diseases, white people are able to gain \n     access to advances, and black people are not,'' said Steven \n     Whitman, director of the Sinai Urban Health Institute. ``It's \n     absolutely essential to understand the underlying structural \n     issues that are causing these disparities: those are racism \n     and poverty.''\n       Whitman said the segregated nature of Chicago puts \n     minorities at a disadvantage for accessing high-quality \n     health care. He also noted that blacks in Chicago often live \n     in poorer neighborhoods with underperforming schools, fewer \n     parks and recreation areas and more ``food deserts''--areas \n     that don't have supermarkets and the array of healthy foods \n     they carry.\n       What isn't clear and needs to be studied, according to \n     Whitman, is whether the disparities seen in Chicago are worse \n     than in other cities.\n       Romana Hasnain-Wynia, director of the Center for Healthcare \n     Equity at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of \n     Medicine, said the racial health gulf isn't helped by ``one \n     size fits all'' public health messages aimed at lowering \n     death rates from heart disease, cancer and other illnesses.\n       ``We have to be targeted in our interventions,'' said \n     Hasnain-Wynia, who was not involved in the study.\n       James Randell recently was diagnosed with heart disease at \n     Mount Sinai Hospital after coming in with chest pain. The \n     Chicago man said he was troubled--but not surprised--to learn \n     that African Americans aren't seeing the same level of \n     improvement in their health as whites. His layman's take? \n     It's the result of a lack of health literacy among \n     minorities.\n       ``A lot of us, we don't know what we should be doing to be \n     healthy,'' said Randell, 47. ``If I had taken better care of \n     myself, I wouldn't be here.''\n       The gap between blacks and whites in Chicago on a number of \n     health indicators has increased between 1990 and 2005. Here \n     are a few areas where the divide has grown significantly:\n       Heart-disease deaths: 1990: 8 percent difference (meaning \n     deaths for blacks were 8 percent higher than whites). 2005: \n     24 percent.\n       Female breast-cancer deaths: 1990: 20 percent difference. \n     2005: 99 percent.\n       No prenatal care during the first trimester: 1990: 119 \n     percent difference. 2005: 199 percent.\n       Tuberculosis cases: 1990: 310 percent difference. 2005: 497 \n     percent difference.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In heart disease deaths in 1990, there was an 8-percent \ndifference between African Americans and White Americans. Today it is \n24 percent. Female breast cancer deaths, there was a 20-percent \ndifference between African Americans and White Americans in 1990. Today \nthere is a 99-percent difference. Prenatal care during the first \ntrimester, there was a 119-percent difference in 1990. Today it is 199 \npercent; tuberculosis, 310 percent difference in 1990, 497 percent \ntoday.\n  These gross health care disparities are the result of the lack of \nprimary care in the neighborhoods and towns of America. Senator Wyden \nand Senator Sanders, thank you for leading the fight to expand that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois for his statement and want to make \nsure the body recognizes that it has been Senator Sanders who has \nchampioned this cause relentlessly, making the case that, dollar for \ndollar, there is no better investment in American health care than \nthese community health centers. I was going to spend my time talking \nabout the opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to continue to \nteam up on this health reform issue. I think it is worth noting that \nSenator Sanders, who has championed this effort in this bill, is \nactually picking up on work that a number of the most influential \nRepublicans in this country have been interested in for years.\n  President George W. Bush was a great champion of community health \ncenters. Bernie Sanders, now in this bill, is making sure we get a very \nsignificant increase so that there will be many new clinics across the \ncountry.\n  There are opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to work \ntogether. I will talk about a way we can create a new marketplace in \nAmerican health care through health care exchanges and get more value \nfor the health care dollar. This is an opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans to team up, much like with community health centers. I \nthank my colleague.\n  I know because of our work together on health legislation the Senator \nshares my view that we can continue this effort to bring the Senate \ntogether on both sides around key principles of health reform. I want \nto do that again this morning by focusing on one of the most \ntransformational and least understood parts of the health care debate; \nthat is, the question of health insurance exchanges. My guess is across \nthe country people are still trying to figure out what in the world \nthese are and whether this is yet some other kind of health care lingo. \nIt is fair to say, in basic English, these exchanges will be like \nfarmers markets. This will be an opportunity for people to go to one \nplace and to do what they can't do in the dysfunctional American health \ncare system today; that is, actually shop and be in a position to \ncompare\n\n[[Page S13421]]\n\nvarious kinds of products and services. When you invest wisely, you can \nput the savings in your pocket. The reality is, that has not been \npossible in our country ever since the middle of the 1940s. During the \n1940s, when there were wage and price controls, judgments were made \nabout the delivery of American health care. The decision to tie \ninsurance to someone's job made sense back then, when people went to \nwork somewhere and stayed put for 30 years until their employer gave \nthem a big retirement party and a gold watch.\n  But today's economy is very different. On average, people change \ntheir jobs 11 times by the time they are 40. We need to make sure that \nno longer is the consumer insulated from the health care system, no \nlonger are most consumers incapable of being rewarded when they shop \nwisely. People understand that they lose out in terms of their wages if \nhealth care costs continue to rise as a result of inefficiency. So \nthese health insurance exchanges are the key to making health care \nmarkets work, in effect, for the first time since the middle of the \nlast century.\n  In the merged bill, Senator Reid, in my view, has laid an important \nfoundation. There are three fundamental principles in Senator Reid's \nmerged bill. Of course, we are going to continue to work on this. When \nthe managers' package and this bill get out of the Senate, we are going \nto be working on this for quite some time. We are going to work on this \nlong after 24/7 cable TV has moved on to other topics.\n  But in Senator Reid's merged bill, there are three important features \nof the exchange. The first is, it is going to be possible for consumers \nto make apples-to-apples comparisons of various health care plans. \nConsumers will be able to see that one plan will cost them $20 in \ncopays for a physician visit, but perhaps another plan will cost them \n$30. It will be much like you can do in a store, a Costco, a grocery \nstore, where consumers look at products on a shelf, look at the price, \nlook at the various offerings, and choose the best product for \nthemselves.\n  The second feature in the merged bill that Democrats and Republicans \nalike should appreciate is that it will be possible to keep low-quality \nplans out of the new marketplaces. This is especially important at the \noutset. I learned this back in the days when I was codirector of the \nOregon Gray Panthers, the senior citizens group. One of the things the \ncountry learned in the early days of Medicare is a lot of the policies \nthat were sold to supplement Medicare were just junk. They were not \nworth the paper they were written on, and people would buy 10, 12, 15 \npolicies, literally wasting money they could have used for food and \nfuel and paying the rent. It took us until the mid-1990s to drain the \nswamp, and finally we were able to do it, standardize those packages, \nstop the ripoff of older people with products that literally were not \nworth the paper they were written on.\n  The consumer protection provisions Senator Reid has put in the merged \nbill, as it relates to exchanges, are going to keep low-quality plans \nout. This is going to offer customers the peace of mind of knowing that \nwhen they look at the plans, they can be certain they will have to meet \nminimum consumer protection standards. This is an important message to \nsend in a new marketplace, and it will be an opportunity to have a very \ndifferent start than we saw with Medicare, during those early days, \nwhen seniors were sold these policies to supplement their Medicare, \nprivate insurance policies that were a lot of junk.\n  Finally, under the merged bill, you are going to be able to see the \nvalue you are getting for your health care dollar, in an important \nrespect, through what are called loss ratios that insurance companies \nwill have to make public. What this means, of course, is consumers want \nto know that when they put out a dollar for premiums, they will get a \nsignificant portion of that dollar back in actual benefits and \nservices. With the exchange, it is going to be possible to finally get \nthis kind of loss information in one place and make it public.\n  So what I would like to do is talk about the steps from here and \nparticularly build on principles the President talked to us about \nearlier this year in terms of ideas that bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together; that is, more choice and more competition in the \nhealth care marketplace. What we are pointing to is the day when every \nconsumer in America can say to their insurance company: I am giving you \nan ultimatum. You treat me right or I am taking my business elsewhere. \nThat is what we are pointing to.\n  Here are some of the steps it is going to take in the days ahead to \nbuild to that future.\n  First, you have to have a big enough pool of people as soon as you \ncan so as to maximize their clout in the marketplace. You have to make \nsure the exchanges are open to more than just folks who have been \nuninsured. If you open it just to folks who are uninsured, who have not \nseen a doctor, who have had chronic illnesses, who have not been able \nto get the preventive care they need, you have coming to the exchanges \nfolks who are sicker and, of course, they are more expensive in terms \nof getting them good health care, and it is harder to hold down costs.\n  Once you have a big enough pool, where the risk is spread across a \nlarge group of people who have a wide range of health risks, you will \nbe in a better position to force the insurance companies to compete and \ndrive down costs for everybody.\n  In effect, in the days ahead, we will be in a position to put in \nplace a cycle in the health care marketplace that will get more value \nfor the American consumer. More and more people will come to the \nexchanges because the premiums are lower. More insurers will come into \nthe exchange because they see that is the place you have to go in order \nto get business. Then you have what amounts to the beginnings of a \nrevolution in the health care marketplace: get as many healthy people \ninto the exchange; make it impossible for insurance companies to find \nloopholes and use slick marketing campaigns to cherry-pick just the \nyoungest and healthiest; force them to compete on the basis of price, \nbenefit, and quality and then you are on your way to taking a \ndysfunctional American health care system and getting the choice and \ncompetition that will finally pay off for the American consumer.\n  There are some additional interim steps I wish to mention briefly. \nThe majority leader, Senator Reid, and Chairman Baucus and I have come \nto an agreement that will also provide the opportunity to get more \nchoice and more competition into the health care marketplace. What we \nhave agreed to is, folks who spend more than 8 percent of their income \non health care but are not eligible for subsidies--in effect, folks \nwith what is called the hardship waiver--they would be able to get a \nvoucher from their employer and go into the marketplace. With that kind \nof approach, which would be tax free to them, our estimate is that it \nwill be less than one-third as expensive, in terms of getting health \ncare for those folks, as the alternative--the system of subsidies. \nAgain, we get more people covered in a more affordable way, building on \nthese time-honored principles of choice and competition.\n  Finally, Senator Collins, Senator Bayh, and I have a proposal, a \nproposal that has been endorsed by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, that would say that employers that are in the \nexchange can voluntarily say they want to give their workers more \nchoices. In effect, it would say to those small employers in the \nexchange: You and your workers will have a choice to have a choice. No \nemployer is required to do anything. But should they want to \nconcentrate on making their widgets rather than being in the health \ninsurance business, they would have the opportunity to do it.\n  What they would give their worker would be tax free to the employer, \ntax free to the worker. Once again, you bring the principles of choice \nand competition into the health care marketplace and move us closer to \nthat day when the consumer can give the insurance company the ultimatum \nI have envisioned; which is: Treat me right or I go elsewhere.\n  I close by saying, in my view, the majority leader has laid the \nfoundation for a new health care marketplace. I certainly would like to \ndo more. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, as cosponsor of \nour bipartisan Healthy Americans Act, I would like to do more, and I \nwould like to do it faster. But make no mistake about it, this is \nlaying a foundation to create a new\n\n[[Page S13422]]\n\nmarketplace in American health care, where that concept has been \nforeign.\n  To let people make apples-to-apples comparisons, keep crummy products \nout of the exchange, make sure people can get information about loss \nratios, that is a real foundation. Then we seek to go further. We have \nhad the counsel of some of the country's leading thinkers about \nAmerican health care.\n  Let's get more healthy people into the exchanges. Let's make sure we \nhave these big pools. Let's make sure the insurers cannot try to steer \nthe marketplace because we know they are going to try, in ingenious \nways through advertising and market promotion strategies, to still find \nthe best risks. Let's build on what Senator Reid has laid out with \nrespect to the exchanges in the days ahead.\n  We are going to be at this a long time. You are not going to fix a \ndysfunctional health care marketplace in a matter of weeks. We are \ngoing to be at this the rest of this week, next week, well into 2010. I \nhave been part of this debate since I was codirector of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers, going back 30 years now.\n  I continue to believe there is an opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together. Our party has been right on the issue of \ncoverage. You cannot fix this unless all Americans have good, quality, \naffordable coverage because otherwise there will be too much cost \nshifting. But as I have said to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--I see Senator Bunning, and he and I have worked together on the \nFinance Committee--our colleagues on the other side of the aisle make \nimportant points with respect to choice, with respect to markets, with \nrespect to competition. This is an area we can work on together.\n  There is nothing partisan, in my view, about creating a new health \ncare marketplace through these exchanges. This bill lays a foundation, \nand there will be opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to build \non that foundation in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the current order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control 29 minutes at this \npoint.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Twenty-nine minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The order of the day would be the Defense appropriations \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to talk about the 2010 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. There are several parts of this legislation I \nwould like to discuss. But first of all, I would like to talk about the \nprocess the majority has used for this bill.\n  This past weekend, we passed an omnibus bill that jammed together six \ndifferent appropriations bills. I had high hopes that this year we \nwould not have to resort to an Omnibus appropriations bill. We have \ndone it in the past. I was hoping this year we would not. I hoped we \ncould go through regular order and give each bill the time and \nattention it deserves. In fact, I think we could have done that if we \nwere not spending so much time on the floor with this monstrous health \ncare bill. We have had a lot of floor time but not much action on \nhealth care. However, earlier this week, we passed a bill containing \nall the remaining appropriations bills, except the one for funding the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Why was this done? Why was this bill left for last? It was done \nbecause this bill was used as a political football. The majority felt \nthat because this bill contains important funding for our troops, they \ncould attach unrelated provisions to it and then insinuate that anyone \nwho has concerns about these provisions and tries to slow down the bill \nto look at them is jeopardizing our fighting men and women. In fact, \nsome Members of the majority have made those claims this week.\n\n  My question to them is, why didn't the majority include the \nappropriations for the Department of Defense in the omnibus we just \npassed? The funding for our troops could have been signed by the \nPresident and made into law by now. However, the majority wanted to use \nthis funding as a political hammer. This is not right, and the American \npeople should know what is really going on here. Our troops deserve \nbetter.\n  I wish to talk about some of the provisions contained in this bill, \nbeginning with the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\n  The bill before us does provide that no detainees from Guantanamo may \nbe released into the United States. It also does not provide funding \nfor the closure of the Guantanamo detainee facility. These are good \nprovisions, but they are not good enough. This bill does not prevent \nsending these prisoners to the United States for trial and housing them \nin our own backyards. It would be much improved if it contained a \ncomplete ban on moving them to the United States.\n  On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an Executive order \nto close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. I am against the \nshutting down of that facility. It is absolutely irresponsible to order \nthis closure and not have a plan in place to address what the United \nStates will do with all the detainees held there. Under no \ncircumstances should they be brought to the United States. The \nterrorists housed at Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst. I have \npersonally visited these facilities and met with the brave men and \nwomen who guard these detainees. As long as the terrorists remain \nhoused at Guantanamo, they cannot harm us or any of our allies. \nHowever, the administration has seen fit to push ahead on sending \nGuantanamo detainees to the United States. In fact, we learned they now \nplan to send some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world to \nIllinois. President Obama could not bring the Olympics to Illinois, but \nit looks as though he will bring terrorists there instead. The plan \nappears to be to use a currently empty supermax facility in \nnorthwestern Illinois to hold Guantanamo detainees.\n  I think bringing these terrorists to the United States is a terrible \nidea. First of all, there are serious legal problems associated with \nbringing these terrorists to our soil. The Supreme Court has noted that \nit is ``well established that certain constitutional protections \navailable to persons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens \noutside of our geographic borders.''\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that \n``noncitizens held in the United States may be entitled to more \nprotection under the Constitution than those detained abroad.'' This \nmeans they could be afforded extra rights which are available to \nAmerican citizens. They could include protection under the fifth \namendment due process clause, which would cover how they are confined, \nor they also may raise claims regarding religious practices.\n  Furthermore, while the Obama administration may not have the \nintention to release any detainees, their wishes could be overruled by \na civilian judge. Guantanamo detainees who are cleared for release \nhave, in fact, petitioned the court to be released into the United \nStates. Last year, a Federal judge even approved such a request before \nbeing overruled by an appellate judge. The reason the higher court \ncited for overturning the ruling was that the government could not be \nforced to accept someone into the United States from outside the \ncountry. If we start bringing detainees to the United States, this \nlegal safeguard will be removed.\n  Throughout the debate on whether closing Guantanamo is good policy, \nsupporters of the idea have consistently maintained that the facilities \nserve as a lightning rod for anti-U.S. sentiment and that it is used as \na recruiting tool for terrorists. I don't buy that argument. I would \nargue that the greatest recruiting tool for these terrorists is the \nUnited States itself and our way of life with democracy and freedom of \nreligion. What if it was found that the Statue of Liberty was being \nused as a symbol to incite attacks on our country? Would we tear it \ndown? Of course not. The United States has suffered many terrorist \nattacks prior to the opening of the Guantanamo Bay facility, including \nthe horrific events of September 11, 2001. If we close this facility, \nthen those who hate us will simply find another tool of motivation for \ntheir followers.\n\n[[Page S13423]]\n\n  The bottom line is that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility works \nand we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage by not using it. I wish \nthis bill had taken a stronger position on making sure this facility is \nnot abandoned.\n  As everyone here knows, this bill also provides further funding for \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was glad to see that the President \nfinally announced a plan for Afghanistan earlier this month. We waited \nfar too long for this decision. I was very concerned that this wait was \nunnecessary and was putting the lives of our servicemembers at risk. I \nam glad he finally heeded the call of our commanders on the ground for \nmore troops. In fact, I agree with the bulk of his strategy for waging \nthe war in Afghanistan.\n  However, I strongly disagree with him on one particular issue. I have \nserious concerns about the administration's decision to set a timetable \nfor troop withdrawal. I could not disagree more with the announcement \nthat U.S. troops will begin leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011.\n  What makes this situation even more confusing is that the \nannouncement also claimed that any withdrawal will take conditions on \nthe ground into account. This is puzzling and it is a contradiction. \nWhat will the administration do if conditions on the ground dictate \nthat no troops be removed from Afghanistan? Will it proceed with a \nwithdrawal anyway? I don't want to keep any of our brave men and women \nin Afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary, but we have work \nto do. Leaving before it is done is unacceptable.\n  By announcing an arbitrary deadline for our forces to come home, \npossibly before the job is done, the President is telling our enemies \nhow long they will have to hold out and wait until we leave. They will \nbunker down and emerge after we are gone. It is unimaginable what the \nhorrible consequence of this would be. I was glad to see this strategy \nrejected in Iraq, and it is no less foolish to apply it to the war in \nAfghanistan. I fear we could be setting our efforts up for defeat and \nputting our fighting men and women in further danger, and I am deeply \ntroubled by this.\n  While I strongly oppose President Obama's notion for a timeline for \nwithdrawing from Afghanistan, I do support his call for a surge of \ntroops to stabilize the country. We learned a great deal from our \ncounterinsurgency strategy implemented by GEN David Petraeus and \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker in Iraq. He knew that if the U.S. forces spent \nmost of their time only in a small protected area such as the Green \nZone in Baghdad, then little would be accomplished.\n\n  The surge in Iraq was successful not only because there were simply \nmore troops in Iraq; it was what they did that mattered. By simply \ngoing out into insurgent areas and being more visible, this gave \nreassurance to the local populations that Americans were still around, \nbut it did not stop there. Previously, coalition forces would clear an \narea but then retreat. This time, they were there to stay.\n  Our soldiers became involved with the local communities, assisting \nwith infrastructure and even doing things such as helping to set up \nfarm co-operatives. The strategy evolved from only clear, to clear, \nhold, and build. Soon, our forces had the trust of the locals. The \ncitizens of Iraq began to help with the stabilization and rebuilding of \ntheir country. They began to cooperate with our military efforts and \nhelp us fight insurgents. Before, they were scared and powerless. Now \nthey were safe and had the ability to make their lives better. These \nconditions have made it very difficult for our enemies to operate. It \nis now time to apply these lessons to Afghanistan. It is time to clear, \nhold, and build there.\n  It is unfortunate but true that the Afghan Government suffers from a \ndeplorable level of corruption. However, it will not do us any good to \nrefuse to help until things get better. This is because they won't get \nbetter without our help. The citizens in Afghanistan by and large do \nnot trust their government, and this creates an atmosphere that is very \nhelpful to our enemies. When our forces move into communities, they \ncreate stability and undermine insurgent forces and corruption.\n  Use of the proper strategy can help improve the government, as we \nhave seen in Iraq. However, if it is not improved, then the people will \nnever trust it and it will not protect them. They will have no choice \nbut to comply with the wishes of the insurgents. Eventually, the \ngovernment will slide into chaos and the Taliban and al-Qaida will \nreturn to power. We cannot let this happen. A return to Afghanistan's \nprevious status as an unhindered launching pad for global terrorist \nplots is totally unacceptable. We know all too well what the \nconsequences of this are. However, it could possibly get even worse \nthan that.\n  We have seen the difficulties Pakistan has had in fighting the \nTaliban on its own soil. Currently, U.S. and NATO forces are fighting \nand hopefully soon beating the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. If \nwe were to leave before finishing the job, the result could be \ndisastrous for Pakistan. A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan would be a \nsanctuary and staging point for the radical Islamist terrorists to \nattack from. Pakistan is a nuclear power, and its fall to these groups \nwould be utterly catastrophic.\n  Victory in Afghanistan is essential.\n  We learned a lot from the Bush administration's revised strategy for \nIraq that put that war on a path to success. It would be a shame if we \ndid not apply those hard-learned lessons to the current conflict in \nAfghanistan.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this is a large bill--\nlarger than it had to be. The use of this Defense appropriations \nmeasure as a political football is why it is so big. I think it is a \nshame that the majority chose to legislate in this manner.\n  We did not need to do it this way. It is probably too late in this \nprocess for us to fix this mash-up of different bills and give all of \nthese issues the individual attention that they deserve. However, \nhopefully, next year will be different. Hopefully, the majority will \nnot try to once again politicize the bill that is supposed to be about \nfunding our military. Hopefully, they will not hold this bill back and \nwait until the last minute like they did this year. It is the \nresponsibility of the majority to set the schedule of the Senate.\n  We will see this time next year if they are still devoted to playing \npolitics with the funding of our troops. I sincerely hope they are not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on H.R. 3326, the \nDefense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. I appreciate all of \nthe hard work that goes into the formulation of this bill and commend \nthe leaders of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye and \nMr. Cochran, on an outstanding product.\n  It is a product that does justice to the men and women who wear the \nuniform of the United States in defense of peace and liberty. It is a \nproduct that does right by our military families who we must never \nforget also serve.\n  I would like to take a few moments to share some comments about what \nthis bill means for the fighting men and women in my State of Alaska. \nAlaska is home to about 21,000 men and women who serve on active duty. \nAdd to that number approximately 4,700 members of the National Guard \nand Reserves.\n  The bill that is before us supports the soldiers of Fort Richardson, \nFort Wainwright and Fort Greely; the airmen of Elmendorf Air Force \nBase, Eielson Air Force Base, Clear Air Force Station, and 18 radar \nsites in remote, rural areas of the State; the Marine detachment hosted \nby Elmendorf Air Force Base; and Naval Special Warfare Center \nDetachment in Kodiak.\n  It supports units big and small. Units like the 4th Airborne Brigade \nCombat Team, of the 25th Infantry Division based at Fort Richardson \nnear Anchorage which number in the thousands of troops.\n  The 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team is known as ``the Spartans.'' \nThis Spartan Brigade will be spending Christmas in Afghanistan.\n  Also in Afghanistan this Christmas are 11 members of the Alaska Air \nNational Guard 176th Wing who left Anchorage on November 5 after \nserving an early Christmas.\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\n  We wish you well this Christmas. We are thinking about your families \nand we collectively pray for your safe return.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned Christmas. We know that we are upon the \nholiday season, although in this Chamber it certainly doesn't feel that \nway. There is no sense of giving and sharing and the general \ncooperation and cheeriness that comes--at least in my family--with the \nholiday season.\n  I think we have to also, as we approach the holidays, think about \nwhat is going on throughout the country as we face an economic \nrecession. Families are choosing to do differently this year. They are \nsqueezing back on their family budgets, and they are making some \ndifferent choices--some hard choices. I think it is fair to say that \nfolks are probably looking at us in Congress and saying: We wish they \nwould be doing more of the same, making some of these hard choices when \nit comes to spending.\n  To put it into context in terms of what we have seen in Congress this \npast week or so, last Sunday--less than a week ago--we passed a $1 \ntrillion-plus spending bill. These were six different appropriations \nbills, and three of those six bills were not subject to Senate \namendment and debate. We went above and beyond the regular order and \nproduced an omnibus package. Again, it was a package in excess of $1 \ntrillion in spending or about a 12-percent increase over the previous \nyear.\n  Shortly before that, about a week prior to the action on the omnibus, \nthe EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, issued an endangerment \nfinding. This endangerment finding--for those who are following this \nissue, I think many recognize that the potential cost to this country, \nthe financial burden that could be placed on this country if we advance \nthrough the regulatory process, as opposed to the legislative process, \nthese regulatory burdens, I think it is clear the costs and impact to \nthis country and our Nation's economy are truly dangerous.\n  When we talk about an endangerment finding coming out of EPA, it is \njust that--it endangers our economy, it endangers jobs, and it \nendangers the competitiveness of those of us in this country.\n  Again, people are looking at this and saying: What is going on in \nWashington, DC? Don't they realize we need to be working to save and \ncreate jobs? We need to do positive things that will help us as a \nnation and our economy, not those things that legislatively, or through \nregulation, would hurt us.\n  Now we are in the midst of trying to move through a health care bill \nin the final days before Christmas--a $2.5 trillion reform package \nthat, at this point in time, we are not quite sure what is in it. But \nwhen it is revealed, it is possible we will have about 36 hours to \nreview it, to understand it, and to appreciate the implications for us \nin our States and the impact to our economy.\n  Again, one of the aspects we do know about this is that the framework \nwe are operating off of is one that will increase taxes on small \nbusinesses and individuals in this country. It will cause cuts to \nMedicare at a level that is incomprehensible, almost $\\1/2\\ trillion. \nFor all that we can tell, it is going to increase premiums.\n  Alaskans are looking at this package and saying: This isn't the \nreform we thought the Congress was going to be giving us.\n  Following on the track of the spending, we are going to be discussing \nincreasing the debt limit. Again, people in the rest of the country are \nwondering: What is going on in Washington, DC. What is in the water \nthat is causing them to spend at levels that are almost uncontrollable?\n  Our reality is that you and I are not going to be facing the \nfinancial consequences in the outyears so much as our children. During \nthe holiday season--I have kids, and I still try to keep their presents \nsecret. So I have a tendency to rat-hole them away, hide them.\n  The one thing we cannot hide from our children this Christmas is the \nfact that what they will be receiving is an incredible debt. That is \nnot a ``gift'' that we can afford to give our children. When it comes \nto the discussion about the health care bill and the consequences of \nit, there have been a great number of journalists who have been opining \nand commenting. We certainly have kept the press busy with this.\n  There was an article on the opinion page in the Washington Post a \ncouple days ago by Michael Gerson. He made a statement that I would \nlike to read. He states:\n\n       The entire Democratic health reform effort is foundering, \n     as its deep bow enters the shallow channel of fiscal reality. \n     And that splash you hear is the sound of various groups being \n     thrown from the ship to lighten the load. Instead of \n     beginning with affordable, realistic objectives, President \n     Obama and the Democratic Congress set the goal of guaranteed, \n     comprehensive coverage for everyone. This requires a lot more \n     money in the system, which must come from someone.\n\n  Then I go to an article in this morning's Hill magazine. For this \none, the headline is ``Senate Plan to Tax Health Plan is Bad Policy.'' \nIt starts off:\n\n       Millions of working Americans will pay thousands of dollars \n     more in taxes under the Senate proposal that taxes healthcare \n     benefits to finance reform.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, this excise \n     tax will affect one in five Americans.\n       Millions more will have their health benefits cut and see \n     their costs go up. This is the opposite of healthcare reform.\n\n  You might think that was an article that I might have written or that \nsome of my Republican colleagues wrote. Actually, this article was \npenned by Jim Hoffa, who is the Teamsters' general president, and Mr. \nLarry Cohen, the president of Communication Workers of America.\n  Mr. President, my point in saying this is that as people understand \nmore and more about what is contained within this health care \nlegislation, they are coming to understand the impact to them and to \ntheir families. They are quite anxious because they know that as the \nyears go out, the costs don't go down, the costs only go up.\n  We are concerned in Alaska about access to care. I have stood on this \nfloor many times and talked about how, in Alaska, we simply do not have \nthe Medicare providers that we need to see the people in my State, \nparticularly in our largest communities. We just learned that one of \nthe medical clinics in Anchorage has made an announcement. They issued \na letter to their patients saying that Northwest Medical had four \npracticing physicians who were seeing Medicare patients earlier this \nmonth, and three of the four physicians opted out of Medicare, \nresulting in 550 Medicare beneficiaries being without a physician.\n  What is happening is that they are calling us for a doctor's \nappointment. The problem is that we can't get them in anywhere either. \nWe have one facility in Anchorage where they are taking new Medicare-\neligible individuals. When we did a count--the institute of economic \nresearch did a count as to how many providers in Anchorage, AK, were \ntaking new Medicare individuals. It was 13. We heard from a provider \njust last week that she is opting out. These three make a total of \nfour. This is simply not sustainable.\n  For us as a Senate and as a Congress to be moving forward in the name \nof health care reform, any provision that will further jeopardize \naccess for the people of Alaska or the people of rural America or all \nover this country, that we would do anything that would jeopardize \ntheir access is foolish. It makes no sense.\n  We must stop this reform effort. We must do our job in Congress to \nprovide the people of my State, and all of our States, real health care \nreform that reduces the cost, provides for access, and does right by \nthe American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as we near Christmas, our troops are \noverseas, away from their families during this holiday season, facing \ndangers most of us cannot even contemplate. Many in this Chamber have \nlong supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the loudest \nsupporters of war today are leading the charge in trying to block the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  It is irresponsible, plain and simple, to play politics with the \nfunding of our troops. It is a disservice to them. It is a disservice \nto their families. It is a disservice to our great country.\n  We do not agree on health care reform. I understand that. I get that. \nBut to hold up the funding for our troops, I do not get that. This bill \nfunds our overseas military operations and provides our troops with a \nhard-earned\n\n[[Page S13425]]\n\npay raise. It includes funds for joint IED Defeat Fund, Mine Resistant \nAmbush Protected Vehicles, so-called MRAPs. It provides equipment for \nour National Guard and Reserve.\n  The tired politics of delay and distraction offered by my Republican \nfriends does a disservice to our troops, to their families, and to the \nNation.\n  It does a disservice to the millions of Americans also who would \nbenefit from the provisions of the Defense appropriations bill that \nwould extend the COBRA Premium Assistance Program.\n  This month, thousands of Americans--hundreds in the Miami Valley were \nhit so hard, where in the Dayton area they were hit so hard from DHL to \nGeneral Motors to NCR to the suppliers for those companies, hundreds \nand hundreds in the Mahoning Valley, where people in the Washington \nPost read about Warren, OH, what happened to people there with this \nterrible recession.\n  It is a disservice to hundreds all over my State who saw a 65-percent \nspike in their monthly health insurance premium. That is because the 9-\nmonth COBRA subsidy--one of the things we did right earlier this year. \nThe government has never stepped in to do that to help people in tough \ntimes with their health insurance. The 9-month COBRA subsidy started \nphasing out in December.\n  COBRA provides a much needed health insurance option to those \nAmericans out of work. It allows workers to stay on their previous \nemployer's health plan for 18 months, but it could be prohibitively \nexpensive. That is why I introduced a bill 11 months ago--the Coverage \nContinuity Act--to provide a health insurance subsidy to laid-off \nworkers. They simply cannot afford COBRA without it.\n  Remember, COBRA is the health insurance program where if you lose \nyour job, you can keep your same health insurance. You continue to pay \nyour own premium, but you have to pay the employer contribution. If you \nhave lost your job, it is pretty hard to do that, putting it mildly.\n  This, for the first time, gives a very generous subsidy so people can \nkeep their insurance. A version of that proposal I introduced in \nJanuary was included in the stimulus. It provided a 65-percent subsidy \ntoward the price of a COBRA premium for recently laid-off workers.\n  Now that subsidy has expired for some. It is about to expire for many \nmore. Nearly 16 million Americans are out of work still and 14,000 lose \ntheir health insurance every day.\n  When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle say: You have \nto slow down on health reform, we don't want to do this too fast, they \nneed to go back to their States. I hope they get some time off at \nChristmas. I hope, after they spend time with their family, they go out \nand start talking to people getting hurt by this recession. They are \nnot hard to find. They are in every neighborhood in every community in \nevery State--people who lost jobs and are losing their health \ninsurance.\n  In Ohio--from Toledo to Millard to Mansfield to Ravenna, Gallipolis--\n350 Ohioans every day lose their insurance. Across this country, 1,000 \npeople a week die because they do not have health insurance. Mr. \nPresident, 1,000 people a week die because they do not have health \ninsurance. Yet too many people in this institution, too many people \nthink we have to wait.\n  They need to know, when you think about 1,000 people dying every week \nwithout health insurance in this country, they need to understand a \nwoman with breast cancer is 40 percent more likely to die if she does \nnot have insurance than a woman who has breast cancer with insurance. \nIf that is not reason enough for them to get on board and stop their \ndelay tactics and quit saying: Let's slow down; let's slow down, it \nclearly has not worked. That is why the COBRA extension is so \nimportant. The extension is similar to one included in S. 2730, the \nCOBRA Subsidy Extension and Enhancement Act, which I introduced with \nSenator Bob Casey in November.\n  The bill before us will ensure Americans receive the COBRA subsidy \nfor 15 months, not 9. It means that most workers who first started \nreceiving the subsidy last March when it started will continue to \nreceive it until May of next year.\n  It extends the day on which you can be laid off and still be eligible \nfor the subsidy. Under current law, only those who lose their job in \nthe next 2 weeks will be eligible. We need to extend that eligibility \nwindow at least to February of next year. This will help Americans, \nsuch as Don Hall from Castalia, OH. Castalia is a community west of \nwhere I live near Sandusky, OH, in the northwest part of the State.\n  Don was laid off from an auto supplier in October of last year. As \nseverance, the company gave him 6 months of paid COBRA coverage and \nthen he became eligible for the premium assistance program we included \nin the stimulus.\n  However, his ninth and final subsidy payment came through in \nNovember. He is still out of work. Earlier this month, on December 1, \nhe and his wife were charged $763 for their coverage, up $500 from the \nmonth before. He was paying about $250. Now he is paying $763. Don is \nalso fighting to save his house from foreclosure. He has cut back as \nmuch as he can, but he doesn't want to stop paying for a cell phone \nbecause that is his only way for potential employers to contact him. He \nhas had six job interviews in the last 13 months. None have panned out \nbecause there are not enough jobs in Castalia, Sandusky, Toledo, and \nLorain.\n  Don worked hard and played by the rules. Similar to so many American \nmen and women, he is experiencing hard times and needs some help. They \non the other side of the aisle say: Let's slow down; we have to slow \ndown.\n  For Don, slowing down means the loss of his house. It means he is \nmore likely to get sick and ruined financially because they want to \nslow down.\n  Don's story is not unique. Take Tim Wolffrum from Milford, OH. His \nCOBRA subsidy is scheduled to expire at the end of December, at which \npoint he will owe $417 a month. That is nearly as much as he receives \nin unemployment benefits.\n  When Tim started shopping around in the individual market knowing he \nwould be forced out of COBRA, everything he found either had exorbitant \npremiums or bare-bones coverage. That is because Tim suffered a heart \nattack 2 years ago and suffers from a digestive disease. These \npreexisting conditions made him a liability for private insurance \ncompanies.\n  Tim is confident he can find a job once the economy picks up. But in \nthe meantime, he needs the COBRA subsidy.\n  Carol Williams from Dayton, OH, is in a similar bind. She is 63 years \nold and was employed at R.J. Reynolds for 18 years before being laid \noff in October of last year. She started receiving the COBRA subsidy in \nMarch but was responsible for the entire premium this month.\n  Remember, COBRA is what you were paying when you were employed. If \nyou lose your job, you continue to pay COBRA to keep your insurance and \nyou also have to pay your employer's contribution. Almost nobody can do \nthat after they have lost their job for very long. That is why the \nsubsidy we put in the stimulus package back in February and that is why \nthe subsidy we want to put in this Defense appropriations bill is so \ndarn important to so many Americans.\n\n  Because Carol remains unemployed and suffers from minor thyroid \nproblems and high blood pressure, her insurance options are limited.\n  She decided to pay the full COBRA premium in December, with the hope \nthat Congress will act to extend the subsidy. Here is her calculation: \nWhile they delay, while they say: Let's slow down, on the other side of \nthe aisle, Carol says: My premium went up several hundred dollars. If I \ncancel, I will never have insurance. If I dig deep and do not heat my \nhouse as warm, do not eat as well for the next few weeks, I will pay \nmore and hope Congress passes this so she can get that better rate \nagain.\n  That is what delay says; delay for their little political reasons and \nthe little political games and tricks the other side of the aisle is \nplaying, such as they did at 1 o'clock this morning, puts Carol \nWilliams in a position where she has to make those hard decisions. I \nwish some of my friends on the other side of the aisle would meet the \nCarol Williams of the world. I wish for 1 day we could walk in the \nshoes of the Carol Williams of the world and see the kind\n\n[[Page S13426]]\n\nof horrible decisions they have to make because they want to play their \npolitical games.\n  Let's not let Carol down and Don and Tim down. Let us in this Chamber \nhear their cries. I hope they hear the cries of thousands of people in \nHelena, Kalispell, Wilmington, Dover, and all over this country. It is \ntoo important for us to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio for his \nstatement, for two reasons. It is very much on target and, second, a \ncouple towns in my state of Montana have the same problems that some of \nthe towns in his State of Ohio have. We are all in this together. So \nmany people and so many towns all across the country need health care \ncoverage or are denied coverage because some insurance company has said \nthey have some preexisting condition.\n  I thank my friend for his statement.\n  The Defense appropriations bill before us provides essential support \nfor American troops fighting for our freedom abroad. The bill before us \nalso continues crucial safety net programs for American families, for \nthose families struggling with tough economic times here at home.\n  What our colleague and former majority leader, Robert C. Byrd, said \nin 1988 remains true:\n\n       Without economic security, we cannot have national \n     security.\n\n  Millions of jobless Americans struggle for economic security every \nday. Even people with jobs are seeing their paychecks stretched.\n  For every six unemployed workers, there is only one job opening--only \none for every six unemployed. We need to continue to work to help \ncreate jobs. We also need to address the challenges that unemployed \nAmericans are facing right now. This bill takes action to help \nAmericans who are seeking jobs.\n  Without this bill, the three unemployment insurance provisions \nestablished or continued by the Recovery Act that we passed at the \nbeginning of the year will expire in 2 weeks. If we don't pass this \nlegislation, unemployed Americans will not be able to apply for new \nunemployment insurance benefits after December 31, and those who are \ncurrently receiving benefits will lose this vital help.\n  The loss of these benefits will be devastating to many Americans, \nincluding a young father in my home State of Montana from whom I heard \nrecently. He was working hard to support his family at a carwash in \nnorthwestern Montana. Then he was laid off. Since then, he has simply \nbeen unable to find work.\n  His work situation only adds to his concerns because he recently lost \na child to sudden infant death syndrome, and his wife is now pregnant \nwith another child. They are living in a house 20 miles out of town. \nThey heat their house entirely by burning wood because that is all they \ncan afford on his unemployment benefits.\n  Without this bill, his benefits would run out in 2 weeks, and his \nfamily would be left in the cold while he struggles to try to find \nwork.\n  This bill would extend emergency unemployment compensation for 2 \nmonths. That program provides additional weeks of unemployment benefits \nfor out-of-work Americans, such as my western Montana constituent, \nduring this period of high unemployment.\n  The bill would also provide 2 additional months of extended \nunemployment benefits. Those benefits provide targeted assistance to \nareas of our country that have been affected by particularly high \nunemployment rates.\n  The bill includes a 2-month extension of the Federal Additional \nCompensation Program. That program increases all unemployment benefits \nby $25 a week. Together, these provisions will protect unemployment \nbenefits for roughly 2 million Americans. Those are people who would \nlose unemployment benefits if we do not pass this bill.\n  These extensions would provide much needed economic security for \nAmericans who are struggling to find work in these uncertain times.\n  I do not think enough of us realize the depths of angst people \nsuffered when they are out of work and trying to find work and when \npotentially their unemployment benefits, which help a little bit, might \nnot be extended.\n  In addition to the critical unemployment insurance extensions in this \nbill, this package also includes an extension of what people call \nCOBRA. What is that? That is assistance that helps unemployed Americans \nand their families to maintain their health care coverage.\n  When workers lose their jobs, they lose more than just their \npaychecks. Unfortunately, they also lose their ability to afford health \ninsurance coverage as well.\n  To address this problem, the Recovery Act we passed earlier this year \nprovided assistance to help their families to pay for health insurance \nwhile looking for a new job.\n  Fortunately, in most cases, workers who lose their jobs have the \nright to keep their employer health care coverage for up to 18 months \nunder the COBRA program. It is called that after the name of the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that set up the program. \nThat is why it is called COBRA. To be eligible for COBRA health \nbenefits, workers typically had to pay all the premium costs, plus an \nadditional 2 percent for administrative costs.\n  Can you believe that? People laid off have to pay all the costs, plus \nan additional 2 percent. That is a penalty. It is not a gift. It is not \nassistance. It is a penalty.\n  Paying the full premium, plus administrative costs, is simply more \nthan most families can afford when out of work. It is just plain wrong \nthat we even had that in the law in the first place.\n  Fortunately, this provision, the COBRA provision in the Recovery Act, \nprovides relief to struggling workers. And what did it do? It made a \nchange. That provision covered up to 65 percent of health premium costs \nfor up to 9 months for unemployed Americans. Previously, it was zero \npercent, and now it is 65 percent of health premium costs for up to 9 \nmonths for those who are unemployed.\n  This premium subsidy has made a real difference in helping unemployed \nworkers and their families maintain health insurance. Roughly 7 million \nAmericans have benefited from this assistance. The bill before us today \nwould extend that for another 6 months for those who remain unemployed. \nIn addition, the legislation would offer similar assistance to people \nwho lose their jobs between now and the end of February.\n  This assistance is the right prescription for families in these tough \neconomic times. For many Americans who have lost their health coverage \nbecause they have lost their jobs, this benefit provides critical help \nto ensure they can get their health care when they are in need.\n  This bill also protects access to health care for seniors and \nmilitary families. The legislation would ensure that doctors will not \nsuffer a reduction in payments for their services. The bill would \nreverse planned cuts to physician payments under what is called the \nsustainable growth rate, otherwise known as the SGR. Blocking cuts to \ndoctors' payments would keep health care available to seniors in \nMedicare, and it would help keep health care available to military \nfamilies insured by the TRICARE program. Without this provision, \nMedicare and TRICARE providers would see a 21-percent cut in their \npayments. That could make it difficult, obviously, to continue to \nparticipate in the program. Doctors say they can't do it. They are not \ngoing to participate.\n  I am committed to finding a permanent solution to the flawed payment \nformula that has caused this cut. In the meantime, this bill would make \nsure our physicians in Medicare and TRICARE will not face deep, unfair \ncuts. This bill would help ensure they can continue to care for our \nseniors and military families--another reason this legislation is so \nimportant. Not only does it help fund our troops, but all these other \nbenefits are here, those I am outlining, which make a big difference \nand mean so much to so many people, basically people who are out of \nwork in these tough economic times.\n  The bill also includes a provision to protect access to critical \nsafety-net programs for low-income families who would otherwise lose \nthose benefits in already tough economic times.\n  This legislation would hold the poverty level constant at the 2009 \nlevel. That would prevent a decrease in the year 2010, because prices \nwent down\n\n[[Page S13427]]\n\nthis last year. This legislation would thus keep struggling families, \nwho are right at the poverty line, from dropping off of critical \nsafety-net programs. To keep up with the rising cost of living, the \nFederal poverty level is adjusted for inflation each year. Because of \nthe great recession this year, prices actually went down. There was \nwhat is commonly called deflation instead of inflation. As a result of \nthis deflation, the Federal poverty level could actually be lower in \n2010 than it was in 2009. That means American families right at the \npoverty line, who rely on programs such as Medicaid, home heating \nassistance, and food stamps, could actually lose their access to these \nvital services even though they did not have any additional income. \nThis legislation would allow families who qualify for safety-net \nprovisions today to stay on those critical programs if their \ncircumstances don't change. These families cannot afford to bear any \nadditional hardship in this recession, and this provision would ensure \nthey do not lose the vital services they need to keep them afloat.\n  This bill also extends vital funding for the repair and maintenance \nof our roads and our bridges. This would save hundreds of thousands of \nhighway jobs. These are jobs that pay well and jobs that cannot be \nshipped overseas. This provision provides a 2-month extension of \nFederal highway funding--not very much but 2 months is better than no \nextension, and that will allow important repairs to America's roads and \nbridges to continue so we can, next year, pass a meaningful highway \nprogram, a multiyear program, hopefully 4 or 5 or 6 years.\n  Without this provision, this 2-month extension, the Federal Highway \nAdministration and construction projects across the Nation will be \nforced to shut down, taking thousands of jobs along with them. The \nsafety of our Nation's roads and bridges is vital. And at a time when \nunemployment is already more than Americans can bear, we cannot afford \nto lose hundreds of thousands of good highway jobs. These provisions \nmake sure we don't.\n  Economists have seen some signs that the economy is starting to \nrecover, but many American families, unfortunately, continue to \nstruggle. This legislation will provide vital support and services that \nthe economy and American families need to get through these tough \ntimes. Working together, we are going to get this economy back on \ntrack. Passing this bill is part of the answer. Passing this bill is \nimportant for both our national safety and our economic security. I \nurge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, earlier this month President Obama renewed \nhis commitment to the counterinsurgency on a ``clear, hold, and build'' \nstrategy for Afghanistan. As I have said several times before on this \nfloor, I believe this strategy will allow our troops to return with \nsuccess and put Afghanistan on the road to stability. But, as I have \nalso said, when you go into a war, when you launch a major effort such \nas this involving tens of thousands of Americans who will be putting \ntheir lives on the line, we must go in with an attitude of success. We \nare going in to succeed. Let's be clear about that. We must succeed in \nAfghanistan unless we are to face the kinds of risks we faced on 9/11.\n  Harkin back to the early 2000s when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. \nTheir friends from al-Qaida came into Afghanistan and used it as a \nground for recruiting, training, issuing command and control, and \npreparing for attacks. From that part of Afghanistan came the \ndirections and the leadership for the tragic attacks on 9/11.\n  As President Obama has said many times over, fighting in Afghanistan \nis the war of necessity. It is one we cannot fail to win because we \nhave seen what happens when Afghanistan falls into Taliban hands.\n  I happen to disagree with him because Iraq was the next featured spot \nfor al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, and Ayman al-Zawahiri to go. We had that \nfrom the Clinton administration. Their intelligence chief, Security \nChief Clark, said that when we drive Osama bin Laden out of \nAfghanistan, he will boogie to Baghdad. That is what all of the \ninformation we saw in the intelligence committee indicated. They wanted \nto make Iraq--Baghdad--at the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris \nRivers, headquarters for their operations. They call it the Caliphate.\n  We went in and cleaned out Saddam Hussein, who was a vicious, \nmurderous tyrant. We didn't find any weapons of mass destruction. \nPeople said we didn't need to go in. However, in the intelligence \ncommunity, we found out that, No. 1, the intelligence was off base. \nThey made assumptions they should not have.\n  But we also sent in the Iraq Survey Group, headed by David Kay, who \nwent in to look at the conditions in Iraq and found out what those \nconditions were prior to our going into Iraq to clean out Saddam \nHussein. The conclusion Mr. Kay and his very skilled team came to was \nthat Iraq was a far more dangerous place even than we knew. There were \nterrorist groups running around in there.\n  Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, who later became famous for beheading \nWesterners he captured, on television, for the edification of his \ntwisted viewers, had a group called Ansar al-Islam. That group later \nmorphed into al-Qaida and became al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  Fortunately, very good intelligence work and the administration of a \nshot from a litening pod on an Air National Guard F-16--and I am proud \nto have been a sponsor of earmarks to put litening pods on Air National \nGuard aircraft--wiped out Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi.\n  At the same time he was running around, he was looking for weapons of \nmass destruction. There is no question that Iraq had used weapons of \nmass destruction before. He had used them against the Kurds, his own \npeople. He had the facilities to produce them. He had the scientists to \nproduce them. He had the recipes to produce them and what we call a \njust-in-time inventory system. He could have started up chemical or \nbiological weapons of mass destruction, had he not been taken out, and \nturned them over to terrorist groups.\n  In Iraq, we successfully took out Saddam Hussein. Then we tried to \nprevail with a counterterrorism strategy. That is where you send in \nsome of our elite forces and you take out the leaders of al-Qaida. Then \nyou go back to your base. The problem we found was that once we left, \nal-Qaida would come back.\n  Insurgency is different from a regular war. They would come back in. \nIf anybody cooperated with the American forces, they would kill them or \ntorture them first and kill them or even torture their families in \nfront of them and then kill them. So we knew things were not going \nright.\n  President Bush chose, with Secretary Gates--he and Secretary Gates \nchose GEN David Petraeus, who was a real scholar. He happened to have \ngone to the same college I went to, but he was a real scholar. He had \ndeveloped a counterinsurgency strategy that he believed was the only \nway to deal with insurgency, so they instituted the ``clear, hold, and \nbuild'' approach in Iraq. They would send in the troops and clear out \nal-Qaida. Then they would embed or lock down with the Iraqi forces \nthere. That way, they could maintain the security of the area. People \nwould not dare come back in with American and Iraqi troops there.\n  My son happened to see both sides of that. He was there in 2005, in \nthe ground intel operation in Fallujah. They found that the locals were \nnot interested in working with the Americans. We now know why. They \nwere very fearful for their lives if they did.\n  The second time he went, he went in with the 2/6 Marines, who drove \nal-Qaida out of Al Anbar Province. His scout snipers were assigned to \ncapture his old stomping ground in Fallujah. They did it, and the \ndifference was dramatic.\n  By that time, General Petraeus had set up the Sunni citizens watch, \nworking with the Iraqi Government. They had the Sunni police. When they \nwent\n\n[[Page S13428]]\n\nin, they immediately started recruiting young Sunni men to serve in the \npolice force in Fallujah. They offered people who had injuries medical \nhelp. They offered assistance for those who needed reparations, who had \ndamage. They got that done.\n  Within a month, my son said, the marines were not all needed, they \nwere not active, because when somebody brought in an IED, an improvised \nexplosive device, or an AQI--al-Qaida in Iraq--person came in, the \nSunni citizens watch would turn it over to the Sunni police and they \nwould take care of it.\n  That is why we have made the progress, despite what some on this \nfloor said--that the war is lost; we cannot win it; we ought to \nwithdraw. The counterinsurgency strategy worked.\n  When we moved into Afghanistan, we found that in the years since we \nhad driven the Taliban out, we turned the task of keeping Afghanistan \nstable and secure over to NATO. NATO forces, regrettably, were not \nadequate. They employed a counterterrorism ``fire and fall back'' \nstrategy, or even less. Some rode around in armored vehicles during the \ndaytime and went back and had tea in the late evening. The Taliban \nowned the evening.\n  So when GEN Stan McChrystal went there, he was assigned by President \nObama to carry out his strategy. The President outlined a very clear \nstrategy, which was, we need a counterinsurgency strategy, clear, hold, \nand build--what I refer to as ``smart power.'' You need military force, \nbut you need economic development assistance, whether it be medical or \ngovernance assistance. You need to help people develop a better life. \nHe tasked General Petraeus to do that.\n  General Petraeus outlined a strategy--he outlined it in August; we \nfirst saw it then--and he outlined a good strategy. He said he needed \n40,000 troops. Since the President has said he is going to send 30,000, \nhe has cut back on the objectives. He believes that will work.\n  We are now getting the troops there. It is going to take time to get \nthe troops there. I wish we had started 3 months earlier because we had \nbeen losing ground until we got the additional troops in. But he \nstarted getting the troops there.\n  I believe we can provide stability and security in Afghanistan. Are \nwe building a nation? No. But we are building stability and security. \nBefore you can have a nation, before you can even have a working \neconomy, you have to have security. You have to make sure the \ninsurgents, the Taliban or occasionally their friends from al-Qaida, do \nnot come back in and take over the area and destroy your crops.\n  Previously, the Taliban had cut down all the pomegranates. \nAfghanistan was the breadbasket for that part of the world. They had \ndestroyed agriculture so that only their colleagues in the drug trade \ncould control the land. That is where a significant amount of the money \nfor funding the Taliban has been coming from, poppy production and the \ndrugs it produces.\n\n  That process is ongoing. But we have found some test markets where \nthat has worked. I was told by then-General Eikenberry in January 2006, \nand echoed by President Karzai, that they needed extensive agents from \nAmerica to help them rebuild their agriculture. I tried for 2 years. \nWith the help of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, we \ntwice appropriated $5 million to the Department of State to get the \nUSAID to send in extension agents. With $10 million, absolutely zero \npeople went, as far as we know. So in 2007, I worked with the Missouri \nNational Guard, good friends of mine. They sent a survey team over and \nsaid: We can help. In early 2008, they sent a 50-member agricultural \ndevelopment team to Nangarhar Province, Jalalabad. It was the No. 2 \npoppy producing province in the nation, but they had an excellent \nGovernor. They wanted to work. So the Guard team went in. These were \ntrained soldiers and armed airmen and women who knew how to fight in a \nbattle. But they also had agricultural backgrounds in their day jobs, \nin civilian employment. They were farmers, agronomists, soil \nspecialists, foresters, food processors, veterinarians. They went in \nand helped the farmers of that province rebuild their agriculture.\n  By the end of the growing season in 2008, President Karzai said they \nhad made a tremendous difference. He said it was one of the great \nsuccesses. Ten more National Guard teams are going. In December of last \nyear, when I was there, before I went out to Nangarhar, President \nKarzai served us a wonderful dinner including broccoli from Nangarhar. \nI found that not only did they have security but poppy production in \nNangarhar went from being second highest in the Nation to almost zero. \nWe now have our third Missouri National Guard team over there. They are \nplanning on going 7 more years, because they want to continue that \npartnership. Guard units across the Nation are lining up to partner \nwith other provinces.\n  This is a great model. Unfortunately, it is not enough to have Guard \nforces there. We have to have a national security budget that includes \nthe civilian side, the economic and development side, the agricultural \nside, the educational side along with the military force. That is one \nof the things I am worried about. We have to make sure that we get the \n``build'' side of clear, hold and build, of smart power working in \nAfghanistan. We cannot expect them to maintain their security if they \ndon't have a way of earning a good livelihood. Make no mistake, they \nare earning a better livelihood with legitimate crops than they were \nwith poppies. They are not bowing down to the drug lords or to the \nTaliban. Most of all, producing flowers for drugs was against their \nreligion so they are happier. But we need to do a lot more of that.\n  I think the first and most significant part in doing that was sending \nthe 30,000 more of our trained military volunteers deploying to \nAfghanistan. The bill before the Senate today is critical to ensuring \nthese troops have the equipment, training, and resources needed to \nexecute their mission. You can't send that many more troops there \nwithout giving them resources. This bill is essential for giving the \nresources.\n  I especially thank the majority of the House and Senate for not \nloading this critical troop bill up with poison pills. I know there was \nsome discussion--it must have been tempting--to use legislation to pass \nunrelated and controversial proposals. I have always voted for and \ncontinue to support funds our troops need. If we had seen on this bill \nthings to add, for example, another expensive, doomed-to-fail stimulus \nbill, I would have had to vote no. We have seen that the majority's $1 \ntrillion stimulus bill, passed late last winter, has failed to produce \nthe jobs promised and the budget which doubles the debt in 5 years and \ntriples it in 10. It puts our children and grandchildren's financial \nfuture at hock. I didn't want to see that on legislation to appropriate \nthe funds that our troops needed. I am delighted they didn't.\n  I offer a very special thank you to my good friend Chairman Dan \nInouye who heads our Appropriations Committee. He is a true American \nhero, and I have the utmost admiration for him and greatly commend him \nfor the manner in which he is leading the Appropriations Committee. He \ntirelessly works to ensure that America's priorities in defense are put \nin the right place. I issue my strongest thanks to him and our \ndistinguished Republican leader Thad Cochran. One of the things I think \nthey did, which was absolutely necessary, was to add the most reliable, \nheavily used workhorses in the Air Force inventory, the C-17 cargo \naircraft, to the bill. This is the modern transport plane used to move \nour warfighters into battle. It gives them the equipment and supplies \nto execute their mission. With the President's recent announcement of \nan additional 30,000 troops, there is going to be more need for them. \nIt is only growing. Secretary Gates has said we must prepare for the \nfights we are in today. It is no secret that the C-17 is in the middle \nof the fights, getting equipment and troops to and from Iraq to \nAfghanistan today. It is a combat-tested aircraft, essential to the \nfight we are in.\n  The CRS said it was designed to fly 1,000 hours per year over 30 \nyears. But overseas we have seen it flying 2,400 hours a year. The \nlogistics are particularly responsive to the kind of delivery the C-17 \ncan make. Some people say: We have enough C-17s and C-5s. I agree with \nGeneral Schwartz who stated ``too much iron is not enough.'' The C-5As, \nwhich must be retired and now can be retired, only have a 50-percent \nreadiness level, a per-hour operating cost of\n\n[[Page S13429]]\n\n$29,000, and 40 maintenance man-hours per 1 hour of flight. It is time \nto retire them and replace them with the C-17.\n  Dr. Ashton Carter hit the nail on the head. I commend him for his \nvision. He said:\n\n       I feel industrial base issues are completely legitimate \n     because having the best defense industrial technology base in \n     the world is not a birthright. It's something we have to earn \n     again and again.\n\n  As America's only large airlift production line, if we were to end C-\n17 production, it would risk our Nation's long-term opportunity to \nproduce the aircraft we need. It will also keep the scientists, \nengineers, designers, and dedicated workers who can turn out the future \naircraft we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was listening to the remarks of the \nSenator from Missouri about his football team. I couldn't possibly \nfollow that without mentioning my beloved Texas Longhorns who are going \nto play for the national BCS championship.\n  Mr. BOND. I am on the Senator's side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate the Senator from Missouri saying that he \nsupports fully the Longhorns as the Big 12 champions. It is always good \nfor the conference, of which the University of Missouri is a great \nmember, that we win the national championship which I have all \nconfidence that my beloved Longhorns will do.\n  Moving right along to the other important issues of today, I \ncertainly am serious when I start talking about the issue that is \nbefore us today. I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee sitting on the floor. The winner of the Congressional Medal \nof Honor, the only Member of our body who has that great distinction, \nand well deserved, Senator Dan Inouye is one of the great leaders who \nfought in World War II, was a hero, was given the Congressional Medal \nof Honor, our Nation's highest military honor that can be bestowed. He \nhas led our committee in such a commendable way.\n  Senator Inouye has always assured that we have the support for our \ntroops. I have served with Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran, our \nranking member, and Senator Ted Stevens before him. I can tell you that \nall of these Senators have led our Defense Appropriations Committee. \nThey have led it by assuring that our troops always have what they \nneed, whether they are in the field of battle, which has been the case \nfor part of our terms here, or whether they are not in the field of \nbattle which has also been the case for much of our terms here. But it \nhappens that our troops are on the field of battle today. That is why I \nhave supported this appropriations bill, supported it as a member of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and certainly am assured that \nwe have the appropriations that give our troops who are in harm's way \ntoday the support they need.\n  I was in Iraq this year. I was in Afghanistan and Iraq last year \nvisiting with those who are doing the work that keeps us free, that \nallows us to speak on this floor, that allow us to have Christmas \nholidays with our families. There is not a better experience in my \nentire time in public life than to get to visit with our troops on the \nfield when they are in harm's way. I have been to Bosnia when we were \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, then Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, where we have so \nmany troops who are supporting our troops in Iraq, and also now \nsupporting our troops with the equipment transfers into Afghanistan.\n  Those troops are not going to be with their families this Christmas. \nWe will pass this bill. We will support our troops. We will follow in \nthe great tradition of the Senate. This will be a very bipartisan vote.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  I also wish to mention that the major issue we must face before we \nfinish in the Christmas holidays and then hopefully go on into next \nyear is the health care reform bill that is before us. This is of great \nconcern to me because I don't think we ought to rush the health care \nreform bill. Health care affects every family, every person in our \ncountry. It is a quality-of-life issue. America has had the great \ntradition and now expectation that we will have the best health care in \nthe world, that we will have a doctor-patient relationship that \ndetermines what treatment is best and what is needed, and the patient \nthen makes the final decision.\n\n  I very much fear this government takeover of health care is going to \nput government in between the doctor and the patient. This is a bill \nthat, for the next 10 years, is going to transform our health care \nsystem with $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes, new mandates, which can only \nrun up the cost of health care. For those who have coverage, it will be \nmore expensive. For those who do not have coverage, I fear the \nalternatives are not going to be much better.\n  I think we have alternatives that can work; I just do not think this \none is it. What would work? What will Republicans support? Republicans \nhave a plan with three basic principles. No. 1, we want to bring the \ncost of health care down so there could be more affordable access for \nmore people in our country. That means we have medical malpractice \nreform to curb frivolous lawsuits. It means we have the ability to have \nrisk pools that are bigger so premiums are lower.\n  That means small business health plans. It means that we allow small \nbusinesses, without a bunch of bureaucratic nonsense, to come together, \nform bigger risk pools, and give lower cost options to employers to \ngive to their employees. That is what every employer in this country \nwants. They do not want mandates. They do not want taxes. They do not \nwant sticks. They want carrots; and that is, alternatives that are \naffordable for them.\n  Last, but not least, why not give every individual who buys their own \nhealth care a tax credit that helps them buy their own health care at \nan affordable cost? I am supporting a bill. It is the DeMint-Hutchison \nbill that would have a $5,000 tax credit available for people who have \nto buy their own health care coverage because they do not have employer \noptions. That would take away the burden that is so heavy on families \ntoday.\n  So we have alternatives. We can do this right. We can do it right if \nwe will take the time to do it right.\n  The bill that is going to be voted on, surely within the next 3 or 4 \ndays, is actually a bill we have not seen. We have a bill before us. We \nhave been debating it for 3 weeks. But there is another bill that \nsupposedly is the consensus bill that is being written behind closed \ndoors that we have not even seen, and we are going to be asked to vote \non it in a 2- or 3-day period. We do not know how long it is, so we do \nnot know how much time we are going to have to read it. But we know we \ncannot mess around with health care in this country and pass something \nthat may not be right, that may not cover all the bases, that may have \nhidden things in it we cannot prepare for.\n  We need the time to do it right. The Republicans are offering a hand \nto the other side and saying: Let's do this in a bipartisan way. I \nstated the Republican principles. We can do health care reform with \nthose principles. Maybe the Democrats have certain principles they \ncould lay out, where we could come together and have something that \nwould not be a government health care takeover, that would not be $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, that would not add $2.5 trillion to the \ndebt of our country, which is about to sink in debt, and that would not \nhave taxes and mandates and burdens on small business at a time when we \nwant small business to hire people. We want small business to grow and \nhelp our economy thrive. But it cannot with more taxes and burdens.\n  We know we can do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The time for the Republicans has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I hope we will go back to \nthe drawing boards and create a bill that America will be proud of and \nthat we will see the American people support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nTexas for her very generous remarks.\n  The measure before us represents the culmination of the work of the \nAppropriations Committee for the year. But in many respects, it is our \ncommittee's most important responsibility.\n  What could be more important today, 1 week before Christmas, than \ndemonstrating support for our men and\n\n[[Page S13430]]\n\nwomen in uniform, whose sacrifices and dedication to the people of this \ncountry are unmatched.\n  If I may be a bit personal at this point, I have spent several \nChristmases away from home in my youth when I was serving in Italy and \nFrance during World War II. I have seen the anguish of wives without \ntheir husbands on Christmas Eve. I have seen the tears of mothers when \nthey received the news of the death of their son. I have seen the \nblood. I have seen the misery.\n  As has been noted by others, this measure before us provides the \nessentials for the Department of Defense. That is the least we can do \nfor our men and women. Yes, the amount involved is tremendous, $636 \nbillion. The amounts in this measure will go to pay the troops, support \ntheir families, provide care for the wounded, and equip our forces. \nFunding of $128 billion is included in this total to give our men and \nwomen in harm's way the resources they need--the guns, the bullets, the \nbulletproof vests, helmets, and such.\n  I know there are some who oppose the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I \nshould like to remind my colleagues that I too voted against sending \nforces to Iraq. Yes, I did--1 of 23 of us here. Nonetheless, when the \nmajority of both Houses voted to engage in that conflict, regardless of \nmy personal view on the wars in which our Nation is involved, I have \nalways supported the funding required to ensure that those who have \nresponded to our Nation's call are provided all the equipment and \nresources they require to carry out their missions. That is the least \nwe can do. While others may disagree, I will flatly state that it is \nunconscionable not to support them.\n  This is a good bill. It is a good measure. Some will criticize the \nrelatively small amounts which are allocated to items requested by \nMembers of Congress. Some will question the overall level of resources \nfor defense and, as noted earlier, there are some who oppose funding \nthe war.\n  But, despite the few loud voices who raise objections to this bill, I \nam certain the majority of my colleagues support this measure because \nthis is a good bill which provides essential funding to provide for the \ncommon defense.\n  I think we should remind ourselves that at midnight tonight the \ncontinuing resolution providing stopgap funding will expire. Tomorrow \nmorning, if it is not clear that the Congress will pass this measure, \nthe Department of Defense will begin to take steps to shut down some of \ntheir functions worldwide. And I can assure you, it will be costly, it \nwill be inefficient, and totally unnecessary.\n  The Senate has already voted overwhelmingly to cut off further debate \non this measure. It is clear there is broad-based support. There is no \nreason to wait any longer.\n  As we sit here 1 week from Christmas, we are engaged in an extremely \npartisan debate in a highly charged atmosphere over our Nation's health \ncare system. Both sides of the aisle feel passionately about this \nissue. I do not fault my colleagues who oppose that measure. But this \ndefense bill is too important to be caught up in partisan politics. \nThis bill was drafted in a bipartisan agreement, and I think we should \nrecall that it was reported out of the Appropriations Committee by a \nvote of 30 to 0, unanimously. In both bodies of this Congress, the \nrespective versions of the bill were supported overwhelmingly.\n  The compromise measure we are working on at this moment passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a 398-to-24 vote. That is almost unanimous, \nunheard of. So I plead with my colleagues, let's not force a wasteful \nshutdown of the Defense Department. Let's not continue the delay which \nhas stalled action on this bill. And, above all, let's not raise doubts \nin the minds of our military men and women worldwide, who would follow \nour actions, and make them question us: Do we support them? Instead, \nlet's come together in the bipartisan spirit in which this bill was \ncreated and crafted and vote to pass it today.\n  As in ancient times, it was said: Peace on Earth, good will to all \nmen.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit a short list of technical \ncorrections to the Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending \nItems report that is attached to the explanatory statement for H.R. \n3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2010. The following corrections are necessary to provide the most \naccurate description of congressionally directed spending items in this \nbill.\n  Senators Bingaman and Udall of New Mexico should be removed from the \nlist of sponsors for the Advance Propulsion Non-Tactical Vehicle in \nResearch, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force.\n  Senator Reed should be added in support of the Standoff Sensors, \nDetection of Explosives and Explosive Devices--IEDs--in Research, \nDevelopment, Test and Evaluation, Army.\n  Senator Schumer should be added in support of the WMD Civil Support \nTeam for New York in National Guard Personnel, Army.\n  Senators Crapo and Risch should be added in support of the Radiation \nHardened Cryogenic Read Out Integrated Circuits in the Defense \nProduction Act account.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank you for your help in this, as \nalways. I say to the Presiding Officer, you are a great colleague, and \nI appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Broadcast Stations\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nspeak about television and to alert my colleagues to a troubling \nsituation.\n  Recently, the only VHF television station licensed in Delaware \ncanceled the one nightly public affairs program which covered Delaware \nissues, closed its local studio, and moved almost all of its employees \nout of Delaware.\n  That station--WHYY-TV--did this even though the community it is \nsupposed to serve first, that should be its primary focus, is \nWilmington, DE. This is offensive and it is wrong. These and other \nactions led the city of Wilmington, last week, to challenge the license \nrenewal of WHYY. I understand and commend the city's complaint, and I \nhope it will bring about better service to Delawareans.\n  Frankly, I think WHYY was emboldened to make these changes by the \nweakened oversight of the regulatory agency charged with making sure \nbroadcast stations serve the public interest: the Federal \nCommunications Commission. If this sort of snub to the community of \nlicense proceeds with no repercussions, we could be seeing less and \nless local service from stations all across the country.\n  If the requirement to serve the public interest has no meaning, if \nthe broadcast station provides its community of license with nothing \nmore than what we can get from a national cable, satellite, or Internet \nchannel, then the public is getting a bad deal for giving away spectrum \nat no charge.\n  At the core of the FCC's licensing policies--right from the \nbeginning--is a principle that every community of appreciable size \nneeds and deserves its own station. As a nation, we have licensed \nbroadcast stations to cities all across America. In America, we do not \nhave nationwide broadcast channels. You get that on cable channels such \nas HBO or Discovery, either through cable or through DISH. TV channels \nare local. These stations that are granted free use of public airwaves \nare required to be responsive to local needs. Each has a duty to \ndetermine the programming appropriate for its viewing community and \nthen make its programming decisions based on those needs. That is the \ndeal. You get the spectrum, you take care of the local needs. \nBroadcasters are, for all intents and purposes, temporary trustees of \nthe public airwaves. For that privilege, they must serve their own \ncommunities.\n\n  It is exactly because broadcasters must address local issues and \nneeds that the FCC required cable companies to carry local broadcast \nchannels. For the same reason, satellite carriers have been restricted \nin their ability to bring distant network signals into homes that \nshould be receiving their local stations. That all makes sense. Yet \nunless the FCC steps up and makes it clear to broadcasters that their \nduty to serve the public interest is real and includes making program \ndecisions that are responsive to their communities of license, I fear \nthe public is going to lose out and local needs will go unmet.\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\n  As long as stations think they can get away with doing less, they \nwill be tempted to do less. If there are no consequences to ignoring \ntheir obligations, they will take shortcuts and our communities will be \nthe worse off for it. If that happens, our historic allocation of \nchannels all across the country designed to ensure community-oriented \nservice will become a sham.\n  I call these concerns to the attention of my colleagues today because \nthis is what is happening in my own hometown of Wilmington, DE. We have \none VHF station in Delaware. It is Channel 12, WHYY-TV. Its city of \nlicense is Wilmington, DE, and it is a public television station.\n  WHYY-TV is not always on Channel 12. In fact, it started out on a UHF \nchannel in Philadelphia. But in the 1960s, when a commercial station \noperating on Channel 12 ran into problems, WHYY beat out the \ncompetition for the VHF license. It was no secret that WHYY made this \nmove not because it wanted to relocate from Philadelphia to Wilmington \nbut because it wanted to move from a UHF channel to a stronger VHF \nchannel with greater viewership. However, this move nonetheless was \ntied to a promise that the station's primary duty was to serve the \ninterests and needs of the people of Wilmington, DE, its new city of \nlicense. Unfortunately, it has been a near constant struggle for our \ncommunity to get the attention it was promised.\n  When its license was first granted, WHYY agreed to present 16.5 hours \nper week of Delaware-oriented programming. Let me repeat that. They \npromised and agreed to present 16\\1/2\\ hours per week of Delaware-\noriented programming. By the time its license came up for renewal in \n1978, it was providing less than 3\\1/2\\ hours per week. As renewal of \nits license was challenged, WHYY added some additional Wilmington-\noriented programming. Nonetheless, the FCC conditioned the grant of its \nlicense on demonstrating a commitment to local programs broadcast from \nWilmington rather than Philadelphia.\n  WHYY was again chastised for failing to serve Wilmington during its \n1983 license renewal proceeding. The criticism touched on such issues \nas the location of its main studio; its station log, staff, and \nmanagement; the production of nonnetwork programming; and the amount of \nlocally produced programming focused on Delaware. The FCC ordered WHYY \nto base personnel in Wilmington capable of addressing the many \nfailures.\n  With the diminishing of FCC oversight of broadcasters' responsiveness \nto local needs, WHYY service to Wilmington diminished as well. Its main \nstudio has long been in Philadelphia, and the Web site for both the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting and the Public Broadcasting Service \nlist it as a Philadelphia station. This is even though its license was \nbased on being in Wilmington, DE. In June of this year, WHYY announced \nit was closing and putting up for sale its studio in Wilmington, \nclosing its news bureau in Dover, and eliminating most of the 16 \nemployment positions in Delaware. In short, it is virtually leaving our \nState and its city of license.\n  WHYY's programming decisions also mock its community of license. Gone \nis the daily afternoon report that focused on issues of interest to \nthose living in and around Wilmington. Today, Delaware's only VHF \nstation has committed to producing merely a single, 30-minute weekly--\nweekly--program focused on our State. The program is scheduled to air \nat 10 p.m. on Fridays and to be rebroadcast over the weekend.\n  If you look at the listings of locally produced programs that are \ntouted on WHYY's Web page, you would be hard-pressed to find programs \nfocused on Wilmington.\n  WHYY has the audacity to rationalize its cut in local programs by \nsaying it will provide more Delaware-focused stories in its \nPhiladelphia licensed FM radio station and online. So they get a \nbroadcasting license and the programming is going to be on their radio \nstation in Philadelphia and online. You don't have to be a genius to \nsee this is not an acceptable substitute. This plan leaves entirely \nunserved those who look at television for information about the local \ncommunity. Reporting through other media is not the same as reporting \non television, and to do so WHYY does not need a TV license.\n  The people of my State feel shortchanged and they should, and they \nare, especially because WHYY operates a noncommercial educational \ntelevision station that receives support from tax revenues as well as \nindividual and corporate donations. The public expects the licensee \nwill be responsible and attentive to the obligations it holds to its \ncommunity of license. There is no doubt WHYY has failed in this regard.\n  Those of us who live in Delaware understand we are situated in one of \nthose areas of the country where airwaves are crowded. Also, television \nchannel assignments to major cities in adjacent States have left little \nroom in the spectrum for allocations to communities in our State. I \nknow other States face the same problem.\n  The television stations to which Delawareans tune their sets \npredominantly broadcast out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and \nSalisbury, MD. These out-of-State stations, however, owe only a \nsecondary obligation to address the needs of their Delaware viewers.\n  Broadcasting in this country is coming to a significant transition, \nbut the promise that comes with digital transmission should mean States \nsuch as Delaware and communities such as Wilmington will receive more \nattention to the local needs and interests, not less. That was the \npromise of digitalization. That was the promise of high-def TV. That \nwas the promise of broadband. The allocation of a channel to a \nparticular community must bring with it some special duty or else it \nhas no meaning at all.\n  The FCC needs to reassert its role to insist that the licensees--\ncompanies that get free use--that is free use--of the public's airwaves \ntake their responsibilities to serve the public interests seriously. If \nthey do not, we will see more stations such as WHYY take advantage of \nlax policies. We will have more citizens in more communities left with \nlittle or no local programming. The complaint filed by the city of \nWilmington last week against WHYY's license provides the FCC with a \nperfect opportunity to give real meaning to a broadcaster's obligation \nto its community of license.\n  I strongly encourage the FCC to use this chance and act decisively to \nprotect the public interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the DOD appropriations bill \nbefore us and to take a few minutes to talk about a couple of the \nprovisions in the bill that are important to Georgia but, in \nparticular, I think, also point out something important for us to \nrecognize as Members of the Senate.\n  In this appropriation is an appropriation to the Office of Economic \nAssistance for $40 million. That money is appropriated to be \ncompetitively granted back to communities for various economic \ndifficulties they have suffered. One of those communities is \nHinesville, GA, in Liberty County, the home of Fort Stewart. Fort \nStewart is the base through which most of our troops who serve today in \nAfghanistan and Iraq pass and many are trained. It is an outstanding \nfacility in a town with a population of about 29,000. It is a rural \ncounty near the coast and near the great Port of Savannah where almost \nall of the materiel and equipment is shipped from the United States to \nthe theater in the Middle East.\n  A few years ago, it was announced by the DOD that we would add three \nnew brigade combat teams in the United States of America, and Fort \nStewart would be the host of one of those new brigade combat teams. \nImmediately, the community has done what it has always done. It \ninvested tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure, road \nimprovements, community improvements, and it incentivized the private \nsector through the banks and the developing community to build the \nhousing necessary to house the dependents\n\n[[Page S13432]]\n\nand families of those new troops who would come and be a part of that \nbrigade combat team. So the construction work began over 2 years ago. \nMoneys were borrowed, developments were begun.\n  A little earlier this year, it was announced quickly and summarily \nthat the Department of Defense was dropping back those three brigade \ncombat teams and that none of the three would be created or deployed. \nUnfortunately for the community of Liberty County and for the private \ndevelopers and the banking system there, they cannot get a do-over. \nThey have already borrowed the money. They have already deployed the \ncapital. They already made the investment.\n  Worst of all, the announcement came at a time when we are in great \neconomic turmoil anyway, where our banking centers are under great \nstress. As I know everybody is aware, of all the States in the United \nStates, the State of Georgia has had the most banks closed by the FDIC \nduring the last 18 months. To have these assets become nonaccruing \nassets because the military changed its mind and the decision puts all \nof the banks that participated in that in a difficult situation.\n  I rise to thank the committee and Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member \nCochran and all the members of the House committee, especially \nCongressman Jack Kingston from Savannah, for adding this $40 million to \nthe Office of Economic Assistance. It will be a help, but it also \nshould be a warning. Whenever we announce to communities in our States \nan expansion of our military in that State, and we call upon them to \nprovide the money, the infrastructure, and manpower as their cost to \nsupport those troops, if we pull the plug, we change our mind, \nunfortunately, they don't get a do-over. It is important for us to live \nup to the responsibilities we have to see to it that, to the maximum \nextent possible, those communities are made whole.\n  In the months ahead, I will continue to work on behalf of Liberty \nCounty and the people of Hinesville, GA, who have made this investment \nto see to it we do everything we can to have the deployments necessary \nto make up the difference, and where that is not possible, to see to it \nthat funds are available to hopefully mitigate some of the damage.\n  The beginning of that starts with passage of this bill today or \ntomorrow morning. It will pass this $40 million program for the Office \nof Economic Assistance, so that Hinesville in Liberty County, and other \ncommunities damaged by the decision made to withdraw the brigade combat \nteams, will have a chance to be made whole.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Bill Bolling\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is Christmas. We are all here in \nWashington working. Our troops are working for us around the world, in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq. There are a lot of other soldiers who have \nbeen working very hard this past year, the soldiers who support the \nFeed the Hungry programs and the community food banks all over the \nUnited States of America.\n  In Atlanta, GA, our State, there has been an award sponsored by \nAtlanta Gas Light for many years, called the ``Shining Light award.'' \nThe award is that a gas light is installed somewhere in Atlanta to pay \ntribute to an individual who has made a historic contribution to the \ncommunity and for the betterment of mankind--people such as former \nPresident Jimmy Carter, such as Ambassador Andrew Young, such as the \nfounder and the gem of our State, S. Truett Cathy, the founder of \nChick-Fil-A.\n  This year, the award has been named and will be given to Bill \nBolling. Bill Bolling runs the Atlanta Community Food Bank. Bill \nBolling, this year, will oversee the distribution of 20 million pounds \nof food to 800 nonprofit agencies to feed citizens of our State. It is \nhis 29th year in building the Atlanta Community Food Bank into one of \nthe finest facilities in our country.\n  Bill Bolling is an unselfish, untiring, honorable man of our \ncommunity, who unselfishly gives of his time to see to it that others \nin pain and in hunger have food, support, and nourishment.\n  In this Christmas season of 2009, on the floor of the Senate, I pay \ntribute to Bill Bolling for his unselfish contribution to our State and \nto those less fortunate. But, equally, I do the same for those around \nthe country who, in this difficult time of recession and this wonderful \ntime of holiday, see to it that those who have little have food and \nthose who have hunger have some nourishment, and see to it that America \nis what it always has been: a giving and compassionate country on \nbehalf of its people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the bill pending is, of course, \nappropriations for our national security, our defense. But within this \nbill is legislation containing a doctor fix--meaning to prevent any \nfurther cuts in reimbursements to our Nation's doctors. They now only \nget reimbursed up to about 80 percent. I think it is very important to \ndo that--to do something for doctors. But it is equally important to \nprevent something that would be very disastrous to doctors and the \nentire health care delivery system of our country.\n  In that vein, there are a lot of things in the bill that I object to: \nthe $2.5 trillion cost, the 24 million people still left uninsured, the \n$\\1/2\\ trillion cut to Medicare, with another $\\1/2\\ trillion in job-\nkilling tax increases, the stunning assault on liberty, and the \nOrwellian policies making health insurance even more expensive--any one \nof these things would make me vote no on this ill-conceived and \ndangerous legislation. We don't even know what the last iteration, the \nmanager's amendment, of the effort will look like. We don't even know \nwhat the cost of that will be.\n  There is another issue that has troubled me the most, and that is the \nissue of rationing. I don't think this issue has sunk in with the \nAmerican people, and especially within the media.\n  I want everyone to understand this bill aims to control the \ngovernment's spending by rationing your access to health care. That is \nnot ``scare-mongering'' or a scare tactic. Facts are stubborn things.\n  In this bill, there are at least four government entities, and we are \ngoing to call them the ``rationers'' over here to my right on the chart \nwho will stand between you and your doctor. These four entities are \nrepresented by the four walls on this chart behind me standing between \nyou and perhaps your wife and the doctor. These folks are obviously \nsomewhat elderly, and that is the big issue in regard to rationing, \nwhich I will talk about in just a minute.\n  Let's talk about the first one, the Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute. The acronym is PCORI. You haven't heard of that \nbefore, but it is the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. \nThis one here, that is the first wall between this couple, or you, and \nyour doctor. The Obama-Reid bill establishes the Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Institute to conduct something called comparative \neffectiveness research, or CER. Rest assured, every health care \nprovider in the country knows what CER is. I am not sure the public \nunderstands it. I am not sure those in the media yet fully understand \nit. It is research that compares two or more options for the same \ncondition to see which one works best.\n\n  That sounds like a great idea, and it is a pretty good idea. But \nunfortunately, when CER is conducted by a government under pressure to \nmeet a budget, it can be manipulated in some very sinister ways. That \nhas been demonstrated by the United Kingdom's CER institute. Let's look \nat that as an example. It is the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence, the acronym being NICE--but it hasn't been very \nnice.\n  NICE is notorious for delaying or outright denying access to health \ncare treatments based on comparative effectiveness research that takes \ninto account the cost of the treatment and the Government's appraisal \nof the worth of the patient's life or comfort.\n  Some of the more shocking CER decisions handed down by NICE include \nrestricting drugs to save seniors' vision from macular degeneration \nuntil the patient is blind in one eye; denying access to breakthrough \ntreatments for aggressive brain tumors; and refusing to allow \nAlzheimer's therapy until the patient deteriorates. That is \nunbelievable, but that happens.\n  This Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute will be the \nAmerican version of NICE, using CER to save the\n\n[[Page S13433]]\n\ngovernment money by rationing health care. We tried very hard in the \nHELP Committee to insert one word, ``prohibit,'' that CER could not be \nused in any way for cost containment. It should be used for patient \ncare, and we tried to put in the word ``prohibit.'' It was talked about \nfor 2 or 3 days, and then in a very partisan decision, ``prohibit'' \nbecame a thing of the past.\n  I have offered several amendments, along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kyl, a real leader on trying to alert the Senate all \nabout CER and the dangerous path it might be taking. Senator Coburn \nalso talked about this, and he had an excellent article in the Wall \nStreet Journal 2 days ago. Senator Enzi, the ranking member, also \nserves on the Finance Committee and has been involved with this effort. \nThese amendments were to protect American patients from NICE-style \nrationing. Unfortunately, they have all been voted down on party-line \nvotes. It is not that we haven't tried.\n  Let's get to rationer No. 2, the independent Medicare advisory board, \nright here, the second wall between you and your doctor.\n  The Obama-Reid bill establishes a new independent Medicare advisory \nboard. It is to be an unelected body of 15 so-called experts who will \ndecide Medicare payment policy behind closed doors with no \ncongressional input. When they make this decision on reimbursement to \nall of the health care providers, and then all of the health care \nproviders, some of which their national organizations have chosen to go \nalong with this bill, when they wake up to the fact that they are not \nprotected, they will come to the Congress, and some will say we cannot \ndo anything about it because, obviously, the Medicare advisory board \nwill make that kind of decision.\n  That is a complete abrogation of our responsibilities, one way or the \nother, in terms of cutting reimbursements in the appropriate way to \nsave money, or to make sure the reimbursements don't close down a \nparticular vital part of our health care delivery system.\n  Although this bill says this anonymous board ``shall not include any \nrecommendation to ration health care,'' what else would you call \ndenying coverage for Medicare patients based on cost? That is what it \nwill do--deny payment for knee replacements or heart surgery or \nbreakthrough drugs--all to achieve an arbitrary government spending \ntarget. I don't know what you call that, but I call that rationing.\n\n  Also, notice that this board will necessarily ration access to health \ncare based on age and disability, of all things, since its payment \npolicies will only affect the elderly and disabled who receive \nMedicare. What will be a patient's recourse if Medicare refuses to pay \nfor an innovative new therapy that could save or prolong their life?\n  These are the reasons the Wall Street Journal dubbed this board the \n``Rationing Commission.''\n  Let's go to No. 3. This is another rationer, the CMS Innovation \nCenter. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, \ncurrently administers the Medicare Program on which 43 million \nAmericans rely. That is almost 15 percent of the population.\n  Listen up: CMS already rations care. It is not authorized to do so, \nbut it does. It does so indirectly through payment policies that \ncurtail the use of virtual colonoscopies, certain wound-healing \ndevices, and asthma drugs.\n  Medicare already has a higher claims denial rate than most private \ninsurance companies. Let me repeat that. Medicare already has a higher \nclaims denial rate than most private insurance companies--something you \nare not going to hear my friends on the other side admitting, not when \nit is so convenient to simply demonize the big bad insurance companies. \nIn fact, the courts recently had to intervene to prevent CMS from \nrationing a relatively expensive asthma drug in Medicare because \nrationing is now against the law. However, the Reid bill establishes a \nnew CMS Innovation Center which will be, for the first time, granting \nCMS broad authority to decide which treatments to ration.\n  Last one, the last rationer--it is like the four horsemen--the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force. They got a lot of headlines recently, \nand I will go into that in just a moment. It is yet another panel of \nappointed experts--we have four panels here, none of them elected or \naccountable. This particular task force will make recommendations on \nwhat preventive services patients should receive. Currently, the task \nforce recommendations are optional. But the Reid bill bestows this \nunelected, unaccountable body with substantial new powers to determine \ninsurance benefit requirements in Medicare, Medicaid, and even the \nprivate market.\n  The task force has already revealed the types of recommendations it \nwill be making. Just recently, it decided to reverse its longstanding \nrecommendation that women get regular routine mammograms to detect \nbreast cancers starting at age 40. One really has to wonder if the task \nforce's abrupt about-face--and it was abrupt--has anything to do with \nthe fact that the Federal Government's financial responsibility for \nthese screenings and for the health care needs they would potentially \nreveal would be greatly expanded if this health care reform bill \npasses.\n  In the words of one prominent Harvard professor:\n\n       Tens of thousands of lives are being saved by this \n     screening, and these idiots want to do away with it. It's \n     crazy--- unethical really.\n\n  The outcry from oncologists, the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican College of Radiology, and breast cancer survivors and families \nall across the country has forced Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Kathleen Sebelius to backpedal, to do a backstroke real quick \nfrom the task force's recommendations, saying that they do not affect \ngovernment payment policy. But this bill relies on the task force's \nrecommendations some 14 times throughout the legislation to set \nbenefits, to determine copayments, to make grant awards, et cetera--all \npolicy decisions. So contrary to Secretary Sebelius's assertion, if \nthis bill passes, the recommendations of the task force will become \ngovernment policy. Not only that, they would be forced onto private \ninsurers as well.\n  I know some may ask: Senator, why so cynical? Why not trust that \nthese tools will be used only for good, to advance medical science and \npatient care? To those folks, I answer by showing this chart. This is \nmy favorite chart, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's ``Complete Lives System.'' It \nsounds like something you would be hearing somebody selling over a Del \nRio radio station. It is Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's ``Complete Lives \nSystem.''\n  As many of you know, Dr. Emanuel is the brother of White House Chief \nof Staff Rahm Emanuel. He is a bioethicist and one of those special \nadvisers to the President. I am sure he is very intelligent, very \nsmart. Maybe he should be the rationing czar.\n  Dr. Emanuel has published some very disturbing ideas on how to ration \ncare which can be summed up by this ``brave new world, humpback whale'' \ngraph behind me. Dr. Emanuel's ``Complete Lives System'' basically \nworks off the premise that the older you are--listen to this--the older \nyou are, the more you have lived, and therefore the less you deserve \nhealth care. Let me repeat that. The older you are, the more you have \nlived, and therefore the less you deserve health care.\n  You know something, the average age of my colleagues in this body is \n62 years old--just something to think about.\n  President Obama has clearly been listening to Dr. Emanuel's counsel. \nRemember his observation in an interview this summer that, as patients \nget closer to the end of their life--from the President no less--\n``maybe you're better off not having the surgery, but taking the shots \nand the painkiller'' instead.\n  Telling someone they cannot have a knee replacement because they are \ntoo old--how old is too old? Who should be making that decision? The \ndoctor and the patient or any one of these four task forces, more \nespecially this ``Complete Lives System'' as a blueprint?\n  The Wall Street Journal reported on the age rationing that occurs in \nCanada's government-run health care system. Apparently in that country, \n57 is too old for hip surgery. Luckily, many of those so-called old \ngeezers can drive south and find care right here in the United States. \nI am not sure where they will go after this bill passes, however.\n  The White House may complain that I am taking Dr. Emanuel's musings \nout of context. My response to that is this:\n\n[[Page S13434]]\n\nThis is the context. This is how the government will contain costs. \nThis is the blueprint right here, the ``Complete Lives System.'' This \nis what we are going to be basing decisions on in terms of \nreimbursement, not between a doctor and patient.\n  All of the rationing policies in this bill must be viewed through the \nprism of Dr. Emanuel's ideas, of this chart, and consequently this is \nthe goal--to save the government money by rationing care. That is what \nthe President means all the time when he says we are going to squeeze \nmoney out of the health care delivery system by basing that rationing \non something like a pseudoscientific graph such as this. At least in \nthe United Kingdom they are honest about it. These are the tools of \nrationing. These tools will restrict your ability and your family \nmember's ability to get a knee replacement or a breakthrough cancer \ndrug or treatment for Alzheimer's or a mammogram.\n  The four rationers--if we are not able to stop this, you are going to \nsee the destruction of the American health care system, the best health \ncare system in the world.\n  They are among the main reasons I will vote no on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague from Kansas. \nHe and I have been working on this problem of delay and denial of care, \nthe problem of rationing of care specifically as it comes about through \nthe comparative effectiveness research that is in this legislation, for \na long time. I appreciate what he has said today.\n  Given the amount of time, if I am not able to get a little bit more \ntime over there, I am going to speak off the cuff, commenting on a \ncouple of things he said.\n  I am concerned about the cost of this legislation. I am concerned \nabout the cuts in Medicare. I am concerned about the taxes. I am \nconcerned about the fact that premiums go up, not down, under the \nlegislation. I am concerned about all sorts of things that are in this \ngovernment takeover of health care in our country. But nothing concerns \nme more than the problem raised by my colleague from Kansas because, in \nmy view, nothing is more important to all of us all over the country \nthan the health of our families and ourselves, except, perhaps, our \nfreedom.\n  In many respects, this legislation takes that away by denying us the \nability to work with a physician, a family physician who can help \ndecide what is best for us and then provide that kind of treatment to \nus. When that is taken away from us in the name of cost cutting for the \nFederal Government, yes, we are bending the cost curve down all right \nand we are also hurting the quality of health care for all Americans \nfrom now on. That is what bothers me most about this legislation.\n  I wonder why, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so \ncertain rationing is not going to occur, they have defeated over and \nover again the amendments my colleague from Kansas and I have proposed \nthat very simply say: You will not use cost-effectiveness research to \ndeny coverage. It is very simple. They say: The language already covers \nit. I don't think so. But if it is your view that we should not ration \ncare, then let's just say it. No, they don't want to do it. I think the \nreason they don't want to do it is very clear--because throughout this \nlegislation there are numerous ways in which rationing will occur, and \nit has to occur under their scheme of things because it is the only way \nto accommodate the promises that have been made relative to the amount \nof money they have to pay for it.\n  In some countries, they basically set a budget and say--I will pick a \nnumber out of the air--$50 billion this year to spend on health care. \nIt is kind of like we deal with Indian health care in our country. It \nis said on Indian reservations that you better get sick early in the \nyear because when they run out of money, that is it. Your appointment \nwill be next January. Get in line.\n  We don't want the kind of care Great Britain, Canada, and some other \ncountries have where the quality of your care depends upon how much \nmoney they have available to treat you. At first, it is done subtly. \nThey simply don't inform you of things that might otherwise be \navailable, so you don't even know the treatments are available. Then \nthey begin delay. It takes long and longer to get an appointment with \nthe doctor. Then, finally, it is actual denial of care. They simply \ndon't make various treatments available, various pharmaceutical \nproducts available to you, and so on.\n  I was going to mention one of the experiences in Great Britain where \nthey finally figured out how to get the delay down to 4\\1/2\\ months and \nare really proud of that.\n  The National Health Service in Great Britain launched what they \ncalled an End Waiting, Change Lives campaign. The campaign's goal was \nto reduce patients' waiting time from 18 weeks from referral to \ntreatment--18 weeks. And that is supposed to be a good thing? That is \nnot what Americans want. They know what starts with delay in getting an \nappointment eventually results in denial of care.\n  But probably the most pernicious thing is what my colleague was \ntalking about with comparative effectiveness research where panels of \nexperts decide what kind of treatments work best and which ones are \nmost cost-effective for most people most of the time. The difference \nbetween that and a physician treating a patient is the physician knows \neach one of his or her patients.\n  He knows their needs, and they are not all average. They are not all \nthe general rule. Some require special circumstances.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by reading from what one of our \ncolleagues, Senator Tom Coburn, wrote in the Wall Street Journal. As \neveryone knows, he is a physician. He wrote:\n\n       The most fundamental flaw of the Reid bill is best captured \n     by the story of one of my patients I'll call Sheila. When \n     Sheila came to me at the age of 33 with a lump in her breast, \n     traditional tests like a mammogram under the standard of care \n     indicated she had a cyst and nothing more. Because I knew her \n     medical history, I wasn't convinced. I aspirated the cyst and \n     discovered she had a highly malignant form of breast cancer. \n     Sheila fought a heroic battle against breast cancer and \n     enjoyed 12 good years with her family before succumbing to \n     the disease. If I had been practicing under the Reid bill, \n     the government would have likely told me I couldn't have done \n     the test that discovered Sheila's cancer because it wasn't \n     approved under CER [comparative effectiveness research]. \n     Under the Reid bill, Sheila may have lived another year \n     instead of 12, and her daughters would have missed a decade \n     with their mom. The bottom line is that under the Reid bill \n     the majority of America's patients might be fine. But some \n     will be like Sheila--patients whose lives hang in the balance \n     and require the care of a doctor who understands the science \n     and the art of medicine and can make decisions without \n     government interference.\n\n  Mr. President, I rue the day that government stands in between a \npatient and a physician, when the physician says: I don't care what the \nresearch says the average patient needs or generally what is indicated \nor what costs too much. I know what this patient needs, and unless she \ngets it, she is going to die. At that point, if our government has \ninserted itself between the patient and physician and says: We are \nsorry, it can't be done, then our freedom will have been taken away, \nthe quality of our health care will have been taken away, and we will \nhave succumbed to a government so powerful that it literally has life-\nand-death control over us and our families.\n  That is fundamentally wrong, and we cannot allow that to happen by \nadopting the legislation that is before us now.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would my friend and colleague yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield, but I think I only have about 30 \nseconds left.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I promise to be brief. I thought about saying this, but \nI think the example Senator Coburn wrote about in the Wall Street \nJournal about Sheila made me decide to speak of it.\n  I had a very close friend, a member of the British Parliament, who \nthought he had broken his wrist. He had a lot of pain. It took quite a \nwhile to get in to see a doctor for a broken wrist. He finally did, and \nit was put in a cast. Then he kept feeling bad and thought maybe it was \nset wrong. Finally, he got back in and never left the hospital. He died \nwithin about 2 or 3 days. He had bone cancer.\n  That, to me, was incredible that in Great Britain, this could happen. \nIt\n\n[[Page S13435]]\n\nwas just inconceivable to me. You have to sort of equate it to what \nthis bill would do and what other people would experience, very similar \nto that and the situation Sheila found herself in as well.\n  So I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are keeping score and \nfollowing the Senate, you may wonder what we are doing. We are in the \nmiddle of a filibuster, which is an attempt to stop legislation from \nmoving forward. It is a filibuster inspired by the Republican side of \nthe aisle. The bill they are filibustering and trying to delay is the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. This is the bill that funds \nour military. It is the bill that funds our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines who are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This is a bill that, almost without fail, passes overwhelmingly with \na bipartisan majority in the Senate and the House each year. It has \npassed the House of Representatives with a substantial vote of about \n394 to 35, with 164 Republicans voting for it over there. There was no \ncontroversy associated with it. Yet when it came to the Senate, the \nSenate Republicans announced they were going to filibuster the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Why? Do they disagree with any of the contents? I have yet to hear--\naside from Senator McCain and Senator Coburn, who went through two or \nthree provisions in the bill they disagreed with--anyone say we \nshouldn't fund our military. We certainly should. Now some have come to \nthe Senate floor and argued the reason we are in this predicament is \nbecause the Democrats, who are in control, have waited too long to \nbring this bill to the floor. But that statement fails to acknowledge \nthe reality of what this calendar year has meant because day after day \nand week after week, month after month, with very few exceptions, the \nrole and strategy of the minority--the Republicans--in the Senate has \nbeen to slow down and stop the consideration of important legislation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, would my friend and colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would my friend and colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Only for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Only for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I just want to assure him--in the form of a question--if \nhe were asking me, am I filibustering, that is not the case. The \nproblem was, as I see it--and I am asking the distinguished Senator \nwhom I have known for a long time and whom I respect--what would he \nthink about the response--this is the question--where we have only had \nseven amendments that have been allowed on this bill? I have one on the \nMedicare advisory board. We have the one on CER here--rationing--and I \nhad another one in regard to a tax matter--about four amendments--all \nof which have been considered in the Finance Committee.\n  All were defeated by a party-line vote, so I knew where it was \nheaded, but I thought it certainly deserved some debate and some \nconsideration on the Senate floor. To all of a sudden limit a bill of \nthis size--the health care bill, not the Defense bill--to seven \namendments seems to be very untoward and showing a lack of comity in \nregard to a bill of this size.\n  The defense bill has the doc fix in it, and so, as such, I think you \ncan pivot into the problems doctors face and at least have an \nopportunity to talk about it. But this is the first time I have had 10 \nor 15 minutes to talk about anything about health care. It is not that \nI would choose to do it when we are considering a Defense \nappropriations bill. I have served on the Armed Services Committee, the \nIntel Committee, as the Senator knows. There is no person stronger for \nour warriors and our men and women in uniform, and they will get their \nmoney.\n  This bill is going to pass. That is not the issue. The issue is we \nhaven't had enough time, and I would ask the Senator to comment on my \ncomments and tell me if I am wrong.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response to the Senator from Kansas, he \nhas a grievance with the consideration of this bill--the health care \nreform bill--a 2,000-page bill, which I will address in a moment. But I \nwould say to the Senator from Kansas that we are considering this \nbill--the Department of Defense appropriations bill. And because of a \ngrievance over the consideration of this bill, the Republicans are \nfilibustering the Department of Defense appropriations bill. They are \ntrying to slow down as much as possible the passage of the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill.\n  Many of us think that is unfair, particularly when we have our best \nand bravest young men and women at war, that we would somehow make the \nbill funding their effort and funding the things they need to protect \nthemselves the center of a political debate over another bill. And it \nis a filibuster. Twice last night on this floor, early this morning--I \nshould say in the early hours of the morning--I made a unanimous \nconsent request that on a bipartisan basis we fund our troops. I \noffered it on the floor and twice it was objected to--the last time by \nthe Republican leader and the Republican whip in the well of the \nSenate. They had a chance to pass this bill.\n  Now, the funding for our troops runs out at midnight tonight. We are \ngoing to come in at 7:30 tomorrow morning because the Republicans \ninsist on this delay, and we are actually going to fund the troops. I \nreally believe when push comes to shove, we will. I hope we do. I will \nbe voting for it, and I hope the Republicans will join me. So I don't \nunderstand why the Republicans are holding the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill for our troops hostage to their anger or \nfrustration over health care reform.\n  Then let me address health care reform. I would say to the Senator \nfrom Kansas, we have been on this bill for 19 days. Do you know how \nmany substantive amendments have been offered by the Republican side to \nthis bill in 19 days? Four--not even one a day. And six amendments--or \nI should say motions--were made to this bill to send it back to \ncommittee and start over. So if the Senator has substantive \namendments--and others do--the obvious question is, Where have they \nbeen? Nineteen days, four amendments.\n  It appears to me that when a decision was made several days ago on \nthe Republican side to order the reading of an 800-page amendment, it \nwas very clear that this had nothing to do with debate and voting on \namendments. It was all about slowing things down and stopping them, and \nthey tried and couldn't on the reading of this bill. Now they are \ntrying, as best they can, when it comes to an unrelated bill.\n  You know, there comes a point when, I would say to the Senator from \nKansas, there has to be a vote. I mean, we are here to vote. Let's get \non with it. We either win or lose. You either win or lose, and we have \nto go forward. I know you don't support this from what you have said. I \ndo. I may prevail; you may prevail. But at some point, don't we owe it \nto the American people to take a vote? Unfortunately, this delaying \ntactic that has been going on is just postponing what I think we are \nhere to do, and it is doing it at a time of year when I have to tell \nyou--and I always say, at least they told me when I ran for the House, \nif you don't like this job, you know, don't run for it. And if you get \nthis job, don't complain about it.\n  Well, I am not going to complain, but I do have to tell you, most of \nthe Members of this Senate would like to be home with their families \nfor Christmas, and we may not be.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield to allow me to answer the \nSenator's question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question, otherwise I would be \nyielding the floor. But I will certainly yield to the Senator from \nKansas for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. You could go for it, yield the floor, and see what \nhappens.\n  I think the question the Senator asked of me--and I will defer it \nback to him in the form of a question was, Was I taking part in the \nfilibuster? The only reason I am here to talk about rationing--and I \nhad that rationing amendment ready, along with the Medicare advisory \nboard, along with several others, is because we have not had the time \nor opportunity to offer them. Why are we rushing and not allowing time \nto consider amendments?\n\n[[Page S13436]]\n\n  Consequently, I have four amendments sitting on my desk waiting to at \nleast talk about them, as opposed to bringing them up. I don't think \nthat is filibustering. I think I am taking advantage of whatever time \nwe have to at least talk about these amendments, certainly on the \nhealth care bill.\n  On the Defense appropriations bill, it is very unfortunate this \nsituation has developed, but I want to assure the Senator, and my good \nfriend, that I am not here trying to hold up anything. One other \nthing--is it not true there is a bill out there but nobody has seen it? \nMore especially, the managers' amendment, which will be combined with \nwhat came over from the House, and we do not have a score. So whatever \nyou have there, if that is the bill, I would sure like to get it up on \nthe Web or something so we can take a look at it and also have the \nscore.\n  We keep talking about the bill. I would ask the Senator: Is that the \nbill? Is that the final bill with the score?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Kansas that it is not the \nfinal bill. There will be a managers' amendment offered tomorrow, and \nit will be considerably smaller than this. It will have specifics in it \nthat have been reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office. That is \nunderway. It will be introduced, I hope, tomorrow morning, and it will \nbe up for consideration for a procedural vote early Monday morning, and \nthen the remainder of the week, as long as the Republicans want us to \nstay.\n  It is your decision whether we will be here for Christmas, and we are \nprepared to stay, if necessary, to get it done, if that is what it \ntakes.\n  But it is true there is a managers' amendment coming. It is also true \nthe Congressional Budget Office--maybe one of the most powerful \nagencies of the Federal Government--can literally stop the Congress in \nits tracks while the people who work there pour through these bills and \ntry to make some estimate as to whether they are going to add to the \ndeficit; whether they will, in fact, reduce health care costs.\n  The good news for all of us is they took a look at our bill--the \nDemocratic health care reform bill--and concluded it would, in fact, \nreduce the deficit $130 billion over the next 10 years and $650 billion \nbeyond that.\n  It is also true this is the only bill that has been brought before \nus--the Democratic bill--which would expand the coverage of health \ninsurance to 94 percent of Americans.\n  There has been a lot of talk about rationing in other countries. \nSenator Kyl of Arizona speaks about England and Canada and rationing \nand waiting in line and how unfair it is--and there is a fundamental \nunfairness to waiting in line when a doctor says you need some medical \ntreatment. But keep in mind there is rationing in America. Fifty \nmillion Americans have no health insurance. That is rationing. Many \nAmericans have health insurance policies that are not worth anything. \nThat is rationing.\n  We know more and more people are filing for bankruptcy in America \nbecause of medical bills because they do not have the out-of-pocket \nmoney for medical care they need in America, and that is rationing. In \nthe developed world, which America certainly leads, we are the only \nNation on Earth where a person can die for lack of health insurance, \nand that is rationing and that is our current system.\n  Some say these reforms are too complex--2,000 pages. I defy anyone to \ntake 2,000 pages and write down and describe the current health care \nsystem in America. They cannot. It is much more arcane, complex, and \nbewildering than this bill itself.\n  Also, I think this bill, it is critically important to note, is going \nto give people an opportunity to fight the health insurance companies \nwho consistently turn down the requests of doctors and patients for \ncare, saying they are not covered by the policy or the person failed to \ndisclose everything they should in their application for health \ninsurance.\n  We take them on. It is about time we did. These health insurance \ncompanies make a fortune. Their CEOs are paid a fortune, and they have \ncreated a situation which rations care to Americans today. I have seen \nit firsthand. I know friends who are going through it, people right in \nmy office. And anyone who is listening to their constituents back home \nknows this is true.\n  There is also one other element I will mention before yielding the \nfloor to the Senator from Minnesota. We will dramatically expand the \nCommunity Health Care Clinics in America with this bill. If you are \naware--and you should be--of these clinics in your community, you know \nthese are the clinics with the medical professionals, doctors, nurses, \ndentists, radiologists, who provide basic primary care to people who \nare not wealthy. They provide care at a fraction of the cost to people \ngoing into a hospital or emergency room for a fever or a child with an \nearache, and they do it well. They do it in Chicago, do it in \nSpringfield, and do it all over my State--and we will expand it. You \nwill see after this bill passes a dramatic change in primary care in \nAmerica, more and more primary care physicians' costs being brought \ndown with quality care at a local level.\n  We need more of it. This bill does it, and there is nothing coming \nfrom the other side that even matches it. I am prepared at this point \nto yield the floor to the Senator from Minnesota for the remainder of \nthe time until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have one other question to ask of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I will yield to the Senator from Kansas for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. OK. ``You again?'' Just a personal aside.\n  When we get through with the Defense appropriations bill, which will \nbe soon, and that issue will be settled--and I am not going to talk \nabout it anymore with the exception that this is the only time I have \nhad to speak to several amendments I feel very strongly about. But as I \nsay, I don't know whether four is the accurate number being \nsubstantive. I think the three amendments I have on my desk are \nsubstantive.\n  I would say to the Senator, when we take up health care again, would \nthe Senator give me some assurances that I can offer these three \namendments? One would be the Medicare advisory board; one would be to \ncut out the cuts in regard to the hospitals, $1.5 billion to Kansas \nalone; and then what we are talking about are the four rationing task \nforces and boards that we had when I was making my speech.\n  If I could have some assurance I could offer those----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor. If \nhe has yielded for a question, the Senator from Kansas will propound a \nquestion.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is the question, if he could give me some assurance \nthat those would be considered? That would be fine. But that has not \nhappened, which is why we are in the situation we are. I am done.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Minnesota will yield for a kind of \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Minnesota if he is \naware of the fact that we have been debating health care reform for 19 \ndays on the floor of the Senate, and in that period of time there have \nbeen four amendments offered by the Republican side of the aisle to \nchange the bill and six motions to commit the bill back to committee, \nstop the debate on the floor, and that is the sum total of all of the \neffort on the Republican side to date? We do not choose the amendments, \nthe leadership chooses it on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is he aware of that?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I am now. I was aware of the general shape of things, \nwhich is the sort of dearth of substantive amendments offered and the \ndelay--yes. That I am aware of. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object to \nmy good friend, but I can't let this stand when the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois says there are only four amendments, and I have \non my desk amendments I have tried to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kansas have an \nobjection?\n\n[[Page S13437]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am reserving my right to object. Under my reservation, \nI point out to my distinguished friend, I would like to invite him to \nmy office so he could see these amendments that this leadership has not \nallowed us the time to consider. I do not think that is right. I had to \nset the record straight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n           the school principal recruitment and training act\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the American dream, and its promise of \nprosperity, has long been predicated on the simple idea that \nopportunity is a right, and not a privilege, and that every individual \nshould be afforded a level playing field on which to set out into the \nworld.\n  To fulfill this promise to our children, we must close the school \nachievement gap that is leaving so many of our low-income and minority \nchildren behind.\n  Closing the school achievement gap is one of the defining civil \nrights issues of our time. It is a cause that challenges our society to \nuphold its time-honored commitment to equal access and opportunity for \nall.\n  Yet reversing decades of educational inequality is no easy task. We \ncannot expect our schools to go it alone. We also need to improve \nsocial services in low-income communities to help students address the \nnumerous challenges they face outside the classroom that make it \ndifficult for them to learn. At the same time, we cannot absolve \nschools of their responsibility to improve considerably. There are \nexemplary schools scattered across the country that are proving every \nday that while they cannot solve all of their students' problems, they \ncan push them to increasingly higher levels of achievement under the \nmost trying of circumstances.\n  Our task now is to learn from these schools. While No Child Left \nBehind shined a light on the inequality of our educational system, it \nhas done little thus far to address the problem. As we approach the \nreauthorization of No Child Left Behind, it's critical that we look to \nthe schools that are beating the odds, and determine how to replicate \ntheir success.\n  One of the most common features of successful schools in low-income \nand high-minority communities is the presence of an effective school \nprincipal. This should come as no surprise; it is a matter of common \nsense to expect a successful school, or any successful organization, to \nhave a strong leader. Moreover, research underscores the importance of \nschool leadership. In fact, research shows that school leadership is \nsecond only to teacher quality in its impact on student learning.\n  Yet despite the importance of school leadership, the Federal \nGovernment has not devoted adequate attention and resources to \nimproving the quality of principals in high-need schools, which serve \nhigh proportions of low-income and minority students.\n  Senator Hatch and I intend to change this. Having seen the \nextraordinary impact of effective school principals in Minnesota and \nUtah, we believe that improving principal quality is essential to \nturning around high-need schools.\n  That is why we have introduced the School Principal Recruitment and \nTraining Act. The bill will create a pipeline of effective principals \nfor high-need schools by providing high-quality programs with funding \nto recruit and train principals to take on the challenge of leading \nthose schools.\n  One principal who has made a particular impression on me is Principal \nAndrew Collins at Dayton's Bluff Elementary School in Saint Paul, MN. \nThe Dayton's Bluff School is diverse and poor. Nearly all its students \nare eligible for free and reduced price lunch. One-third of its \nstudents are English language learners.\n  Dayton's Bluff used to be one of the worst performing schools in \nMinnesota. Only 6 percent of its third graders and only 4 percent of \nits fifth graders were proficient in reading and math.\n  But that was Dayton's Bluff 10 years ago. In 2001, the school was \nrestructured. Today, Principal Collins is in his fifth year of leading \nthe school, and under his leadership, student achievement is increasing \nat a truly amazing pace. Proficiency on State math tests at Dayton's \nBluff has increased from 49 percent 3 years ago--10 points below the \nState average--to 71 percent, or 8 points above the State average. \nAfrican-American students at the school have performed more than 20 \npercentage points above African-American students statewide on both \nmath and reading tests.\n  It is the same school, the same neighborhood, and the same kids. Yet \nthe school is achieving vastly different results. The success of the \nschool is a testament to the hard work of Principal Collins and his \nstaff. Principal Collins has led the school's transformation by working \nclosely with teachers to help them improve their instruction and their \nuse of formative assessments and student data. He has also supported \nthe growth of his teachers by giving them time to collaborate with each \nother on improving their instructional practices.\n  Principal Collins is, unfortunately, the exception to the rule. Many \ndistricts report shortages of qualified principals willing to lead \nschools that are particularly in need of a strong guiding hand. We need \nto recruit and prepare more principals like Principal Collins in order \nto improve student achievement, and close the achievement gap. We can't \nafford not to make this a priority.\n  When schools are not performing adequately, we hold principals \naccountable. But it doesn't make sense to place underprepared \nprincipals in schools facing great challenges--and then be surprised \nwhen these schools experience high principal turnover rates and \ncontinue to struggle with student achievement.\n  We need to provide principals with more intensive and hands-on \ntraining than most of them currently receive so they will be ready to \ntackle the challenges of leading high-need schools. They need to be \nready to lead and inspire staff, create a positive atmosphere for \nstudents, engage families, and use data to drive a continuous process \nof improvement. The School Principal Recruitment and Training Act would \nprovide principals with the high-quality and intensive training they \nneed to address these challenges.\n  We are fortunate to have principals in some schools who have put in \nlong hours as school leaders, constantly striving to improve their \nschools for the sake of their students. We owe it to our children to \nprovide the resources necessary to recruit, train, and support more \nprincipals of this caliber so every school, and particularly those in \ngreatest need, can benefit from effective leadership.\n  Senator Hatch and I will continue to work in the coming months to \nensure that we invest in principal recruitment, training, and retention \nso that our schools have the leadership they need to do right by our \nstudents. We view this investment as key to closing the achievement \ngap, and, in the process, delivering on America's promise of \nopportunity for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I inquire as to what the status of \nthe time allotment is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to discuss the Defense appropriations bill. We think of that \nin terms of funding the troops and taking care of challenges overseas, \nbut there is an aspect to this bill I wish to focus on. In this bill, \nin addition to appropriations for the Defense Department, there is what \nhas come to be known around here as the doc fix. That is, every year we \nface a situation with respect to physician reimbursements for Medicare. \nEvery year the law that is before us cuts the level of reimbursements \nfor Medicare to the doctors. Every year the doctors come back to the \nCongress and say: We can't survive this. We can't live with this. We \nhave to have some more reimbursement. The cuts that are in the law \ncan't be allowed to continue.\n  Every year we come along and say: All right, we will fix that but \njust for this year. Every year we say: All right, we will give you the \nfull amount of reimbursement that you feel you are entitled to and, \nthereby, postpone the amount of cuts in your reimbursement that are in \nthe law. This has happened so often that it now has a generic name. \nEvery time it happens it is called the doc fix. This year the doc fix \nis included in the appropriations bill for the Defense Department.\n\n[[Page S13438]]\n\n  The reason it is appropriate for us to be talking about the impact of \nthe doc fix at this particular time is because of the impact of the doc \nfix on the health care bill which is what we will return to when we are \nthrough with the Defense appropriations bill. Given the fact that the \ndoc fix is in the Defense appropriations bill, I think it appropriate \nthat I talk about the underlying problem for a moment. When you get to \nthe health care bill and try to figure out how it is going to be paid \nfor, this multitrillion dollar bill, you find that one of the main ways \nit is going to be paid for is by cutting the reimbursement to doctors \nand hospitals under Medicare. Indeed, I believe the amount that will be \ncut is up to $\\1/2\\ trillion. The reason I say I believe that is the \namount is because we have not seen the actual language of the bill we \nwill be asked to vote on probably on Christmas Eve. The bill has been \ndrafted. The managers package has been drafted. It has been referred to \nCBO for a score. But it has not been shared with any of the Members of \nthe Senate. We are guessing as to what it will be.\n  But there has been enough said and enough written about it that I \nthink the guess of a $\\1/2\\ trillion cut in appropriations to \nphysicians and hospitals is a legitimate number.\n  All right. We have never seen a cut of this magnitude before. We have \nhad much smaller cuts that have come along, and every time we have \ndealt with those cuts by passing a doc fix.\n  Now what we are seeing here is the passage in the Defense \nappropriations bill of yet another doc fix. What that means is, we \nknow, based on precedent, that the Congress will never allow the $500 \nbillion cut that is in the underlying health care bill to actually take \nplace. If it is not going to take place, why is it in the bill? The \nanswer to that is something I have a hard time explaining to my \nconstituents, because they don't understand the ins and outs of the \nscoring situation by the CBO. But I will do my best to help make it \nclear.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is called upon to score each bill \nseparately. So if you have a bill with respect to defense, they score \nthat bill, and they do not talk about the impact of that on the overall \nbudget. They say: These are the numbers. If you have a bill that deals \nwith Interior, they score that bill. If you have a bill that deals with \nTransportation, they score that bill. Each bill is scored separately as \na single entity.\n  Let's talk about the health care bill. The health care bill is going \nto increase costs dramatically. When it increases cost dramatically, in \norder to keep President Obama's pledge that it will not add one dime to \nthe Federal deficit, there has to be something in that bill that cuts \nthe cost. So we assume, based on previous versions, what will be put in \nthe managers' amendment is a $500 billion cut in Medicare \nreimbursements. Now you begin to balance the dollars within that bill. \nBecause if we have $500 billion more in spending but we are going to \ntake $500 billion out of Medicare, then the two balance each other, and \nyou can say, as the computers at CBO do say: This bill is in balance \nand will not increase the deficit.\n  All right. But if you take the $500 billion that has been cut from \nMedicare reimbursement and pass a fix, if you will, for that $500 \nbillion in another bill, it doesn't get scored against this bill. That \nis what we are doing with respect to the Defense appropriations bill. \nWe are taking the Defense appropriations bill and passing a bill that \nwould pay doctors under Medicare, would take care of the shortfall \nunder Medicare, but would not be scored against the health care bill.\n  I don't know of any business that dares to keep its books that way. I \ndon't know of any business that could possibly survive that would say: \nAll right, we are going to calculate only in this one area the cost of \nthe product against the sales of the product and say the two balance \neach other in such a fashion that this is a logical thing to do. But at \nthe same time in a separate situation, we are going to say we are going \nto borrow X amount of money to pay for the shortfall in this product, \nand we are going to pretend that the borrowing of the money separately \nsomehow doesn't affect the accounting with respect to the product. \nNobody keeps books that way. Indeed, if a private entity were to try to \nkeep its books that way, it would not only go out of business but \npossibly its owners or managers would end up going to jail. You cannot \ndo that kind of sleight of hand in a private enterprise, but we do it \nall the time with respect to the government.\n  The attempt was made, if you will recall, for us to do the doc fix \nprior to the time when we got to health care. The Senate turned it \ndown. The Senate said: No, we are not going to engage in those kinds of \nsmoke and mirrors with respect to the budget. We turned that down. As I \nwas driving home that night and I had the radio on and listened to \npeople talk about today in Congress, this is what I heard. They said \ntwo items with respect to today's activity. No. 1, it talked about the \nprogress of the health care bill in the Senate. And then, No. 2, it \nsaid the House just passed a $200 billion doc fix to take care of the \nshortfall in reimbursements to doctors with respect to Medicare. Again, \nthe computers at the Congressional Budget Office can't link these two \nevents. But they were clearly linked in the comments and the report \nmade on the radio, and they are clearly linked in the deficit.\n  So the House is saying: We understand that we are not going to keep \nthe pledges we are making in the health care bill, and we are going to \nappropriate $200 billion for the sole purpose of breaking the pledge \nthat will be made in the health care bill. But because they are done in \ntwo separate pieces of legislation, we hope no one will notice. We hope \nthe American people won't find out that this is the kind of bait and \nswitch we are going through with respect to this bill. We are finding \nan example of this in the bill before us, the Defense appropriations \nbill. It has a doc fix in it to take care of the situation as far as \nthe computers are concerned, but it will not take care of the situation \nas far as the deficit is concerned.\n  This is not the only piece of smoke and mirrors that we have in the \nunderlying legislation. Going along with it is another item that I find \nabsolutely incredible. I have run a business. I have kept books. I have \npaid taxes. I have dealt with the government as they have come in to \naudit. I know that no one in a business could ever get by with the \nthing that is proposed in the managers' amendment, we think--we haven't \nseen the amendment--along with the doc fix that I have been describing.\n  Let me try to put it in this form. Let's assume that you are the \nmanager of a company and the sales manager comes to you and says: We \nhave a new product. It is going to be a hot new product. It is going to \nbe fabulous in terms of its return for the company.\n\n  You say: Great, love that. Good news. How does it work?\n  Well, we are going to manufacture this new widget and it will cost us \nX. But the revenue from it is going to be Y and that is much more than \nX so we will make all that money.\n  You say: All right. How much does each widget cost?\n  Well, each widget costs more than we are going to sell it for.\n  OK, how in the world are you going to make so much money when you \nhave a widget that costs more to make than you can sell it for?\n  He says: Easy. This is the way we are going to do it. We are going to \nlay out a 10-year program of sales, and we are going to sell this \nwidget for that entire 10 years. But we are only going to deliver the \nwidgets for 6 years. So we have 10 years of revenue and only 6 years of \ncost. So we have 4 years of pure revenue and no cost whatsoever.\n  At that point, I am sure you would say: Let's get ourselves a new \nsales manager. Let's get ourselves somebody who understands that the \nworld doesn't work that way. You cannot balance your books by charging \nfor 10 years and then only delivering for 6. But that is what the \nunderlying health care bill does. It says the taxes to pay for this \nhealth care plan will start in 2010. Indeed, it will start within a \nweek or two after the passage of the bill, if we pass the bill on \nChristmas Eve. But the expenditures under this plan to make things \navailable for all of these people who have been telling us we need \nhealth care reform now, that we cannot wait, we have to have it today. \nI have seen the placards raised. I have seen the protests. We have to \nhave it now.\n\n[[Page S13439]]\n\n  We say: All right. One thing you will get now are the taxes and the \nincreases in premiums on people who already have health care. But you \nwon't get any of the other benefits out of the bill for 4 years. We \nhave to do it that way in order to make the books balance.\n  You have the doc fix, which the underlying bill we are debating, the \nDefense appropriations bill, makes clear is not going to happen as part \nof the way you pay for the health care. And then you have the 10-year \nrevenue, 6-year expense kind of scheme to pay for a good portion of the \nrest of it.\n  So what is going to happen between now and 2014 when the bill finally \nkicks in? You are going to have three open seasons--for those who \nunderstand the language of the health insurance business--three open \nseasons in which people will look at their level of premiums and say: \nWait a minute, how come my premiums are going up when nothing \nadditional is being done with respect to health care reform? The answer \nwill be: Your premiums are going up so the money can be charged by the \ncomputers as compensation for the new benefits that will kick in, in \n2014.\n  If you are so impudent as to ask: Well, is the money that is going to \ncome from the increased taxes and the increased premiums being put in a \ntrust fund somewhere to be held solely for the purpose of paying for \nthe increased health insurance benefits? The answer, of course, will be \nno. The money that is coming from the increased taxes and from the \nincreased premiums will all go against the current deficit. It will all \ngo to deal with the money we are talking about with the stimulus \npackage. It will all go for other governmental purposes. There will not \nbe a time of it saved to deal with health care. That is not the way the \ngovernment keeps its books. The money comes in. It goes into general \nfunds. It gets spent, and it gets spent immediately.\n  Oh, so that means in 2014, when the expenses of this bill kick in, \nthere will not be a dime that will have been accumulated to help pay \nfor that? That is true, as far as cash flow is concerned. But it is not \ntrue as far as the CBO score is concerned, and that is all we care \nabout. All we care about is what the CBO computers tell us about \nscoring this bill.\n  One of the frustrations I have had coming to the Senate from a \nbusiness background--having run a business, having understood the \nchallenges of running a business--is the way the government keeps its \nbooks. I cannot think of a more devastating demonstration of how \nmisleading the government accounting system is than the bill we will \nget to when we are through with the bill we are debating today. As I \nsaid at the beginning, one of the primary examples of that dishonesty \nis contained in the Defense appropriations bill, as it has this year's \nversion of the doc fix.\n  Let me move to a related subject because, as I say, this bill talks \nabout the doc fix. The doc fix is connected to the way we try to deal \nwith entitlements. Let me step a step beyond the specifics of this bill \nfor just a moment and describe what we are dealing with, with the \nentitlements.\n  First, I need to explain what an entitlement is. I have had \nconstituents come to me and say: I hear all this conversation about \nFederal entitlements, and I don't understand. What is an entitlement?\n  Simply put, an entitlement is a payment to which the individual is \nentitled, whether the government has the money or not. It is not the \nsame thing as the government appropriating money and saying: Now we are \ngoing to give it to you or now we are going to buy this or now we are \ngoing to pay that bill.\n  An entitlement means you are entitled to this money ahead of \neverything else. You are entitled to this money whether we have it or \nnot. If we do not have the tax revenue that would give us the cash to \npay you this entitlement, we have the legal obligation to go out and \nborrow the money and pay you the entitlement.\n  Entitlements--or as they are known in the appropriations world: \nMandatory spending--now comprise more than two-thirds of all Federal \nexpenditures. Let me repeat that because I get gasps of disbelief when \nI say this to my constituents back home. Entitlement spending--money \nthe government is required by law to pay whether it has it or not--now \ncomprises more than two-thirds of the entire Federal expenditures. The \nlargest portion of the entitlement spending we deal with is in--you \nguessed it--health care.\n  If we allow the health care costs to continue to go up, as they have \nbeen going up, this is what we are looking at. We will be unable, by \nvirtue of our tax base, to pay this entitlement spending. It will all \nbe borrowed. The consequences to the national debt will be as follows. \nThis is from the Congressional Budget Office. This is not an outside \nanalysis. This is from within the own group we turn to in the Congress \nto tell us what is going to happen financially.\n  At the end of 2008, the publicly held debt of the United States was \n$5.8 trillion. There were many who were very critical of the Congress \nand President Bush for allowing the debt to get to $5.8 trillion.\n  If there is no diminution of the rate of increase of entitlement \nspending, if it goes as it has been going, if we take no steps to turn \nthe cost curve down, what will it be in 10 years--not a long period of \ntime in the Nation's history. It was $5.8 trillion at the end of 2008. \nWhat will it be in 2019? The Congressional Budget Office says it will \nhave grown from $5.8 trillion to $17.1 trillion. It will triple in a \n10-year period if we do not do something about entitlements.\n  So what are we talking about with respect to the health care \nproposal? We are talking about creating a new entitlement. We are \ntalking about not turning the cost curve down in the entitlements we \nhave already; we are talking about creating a new one and adding it on \ntop.\n  The best way to dramatize this, is to look at the 2010 budget, where \nwe are right now, the 2010 budget on which we are drawing up \nappropriations bills. We passed that budget. I did not vote for it, but \nit was passed. Here are the details of the budget that was passed for \n2010. It projected Federal revenues in 2010 at $2.2 trillion. It seems \nlike a lot of money. It should be enough to cover all our bills. Then \nyou go to the next line, and it says: Mandatory spending--those are the \nentitlements--$2.2 trillion.\n  That meant that in 2010, every single dime that came into the Federal \nTreasury was already committed to go out to an entitlement and not \nsubject to the appropriations process in the Congress.\n  That meant that everything we appropriated money for in the \nCongress--the Embassies overseas, the military, the war in Afghanistan, \nAID activities, transportation, the national parks, education--\neverything else you can think of that the government does was paid for \nby borrowed money. Mr. President, $2.2 trillion in and $2.2 trillion \nout for entitlements meant that the additional $1.4 trillion, that \nactually grew to $1.7 trillion, that we spent had to be borrowed, added \nto the national debt.\n  That is why the Congressional Budget Office says we are currently on \ntrack to go from a national debt, when President Bush stepped down, of \n$5.8 trillion to--10 years from now--a national debt of $17.1 trillion.\n  I see my colleague from Texas has come to the floor, and I will be \nhappy to allow him to take the rest of the time. It is up to him as to \nwhether he wishes to enter into this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to pose, through the Chair, a \nquestion to my colleague from Utah.\n  Is the Senator aware that on October 6, eight of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle wrote a letter to the majority leader \nasking that when a bill is introduced, the so-called substitute--that \npresumably is going to be revealed tomorrow morning--that eight of our \nDemocratic colleagues asked that that legislation be posted for a full \n72 hours, along with a score or cost estimate of the Congressional \nBudget Office, before they would be required to vote on it?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator from Texas, I was aware of the \nletter. I was not aware there were that many Democratic signers to it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to my colleague from Utah, Senator Lincoln, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator McCaskill, Senator Pryor, Senator Bayh, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S13440]]\n\nLieberman, Senator Nelson, and Senator Webb were all signatories on \nthat letter.\n  I know at different points of the debate we have had some discussion. \nI think Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, who sponsored the amendment \nthat would deal with drug prices, had expressed some concerns--I know, \ncertainly, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has expressed some \nconcerns about drug price issues and what kind of deals had been \nbasically cut on the side that Members of the Senate are not \nnecessarily privy to.\n\n  I would ask my colleague, is he aware the Obama administration has \nnow been sued for the visitor list at the White House--which they have \nclaimed privilege to--has been sued because they have withheld the \nnames of the individuals who have come to the White House, some of whom \nmay have been involved in negotiating these side deals we are not privy \nto? Was the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator from Texas, I was not aware of the \nlawsuit, and I appreciate his calling it to my attention.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, I would, finally, ask the Senator from Utah, you \nhave heard, along with me and others, Senators say they are for the \nbill. But it is amazing how few people have actually seen it. \nPresumably, it will be revealed to us and the rest of the world \ntomorrow morning. Presumably, amendments will not be allowed on that \nbill. The majority leader can take procedures to block any amendments \nto the bill but we will then be put on a fast track, presumably, for \npassage--at least that is the intention of the majority leader--by \nChristmas Eve. Is that the Senator's understanding of the process we \nare looking forward to starting tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that is the process, but I am not \nlooking forward to it. I had hoped to spend Christmas Eve with my \nfamily. In my family, the tradition is, we have the extended family get \ntogether on Christmas Eve. My house in Utah is being decorated on the \nassumption there will be anywhere from 60 to 70 people there to \ncelebrate Christmas Eve. Regrettably, I will not be one of them.\n  But I say to the Senator from Texas, I will be here doing whatever I \ncan to see to it that this bill does, in fact, not pass on Christmas \nEve, for all the reasons we have been talking about. I think the best \nChristmas present we can give to the people of America, and \nparticularly to their children and grandchildren, would be to defeat \nthis bill and see to it there is not another new entitlement created \nthat will cause the national debt to go up even more extravagantly than \nit is currently projected to do.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \ndocuments I referred to earlier be printed in the Record at the end of \nthis colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would finally ask my distinguished colleague from \nUtah--he was alluding to this earlier--is he aware of any reason why \nthis bill--much of the benefits of which will not kick in until 2014--\nwhy there is such an urgency to pass this bill before Christmas?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That has been the greatest logical disconnect of this \nentire debate. Because, as I said, I have seen the protest signs that \nare raised: We want health care reform now. I have seen the people come \nto the offices and pound on the doors and say: We have to get reform \nnow. I have heard our friends on the other side of the aisle give \nexamples of people who do not have health care coverage and say: They \nmust get this coverage now. By the way, we have crafted a bill that \nwill not do anything for them for 4 years.\n  If the thing is 4 years away, we can certainly wait until January to \nallow people to read the bill and offer some amendments.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. I said that was my last question; \nthis one really will be: Is the Senator aware of late-breaking news to \nthe effect that not only Howard Dean, the former chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, but several liberal pundits, including \nKeith Olbermann, and that now even moveon.org and the AFL-CIO have all \ncome out in opposition to this bill? Is the Senator aware of the \nopposition not only on the right but apparently now on the left? We \nknow the mainstream opposition of the American people as a result of \nthe polling we have seen. Was the Senator aware of those developments?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have been aware of that opposition. My own sense is \nthat in the end, that opposition will melt in the face of those who are \ntrying to rush this bill through in the hope that by next November, the \nAmerican people will have forgotten the details. I do not believe the \nAmerican people will have forgotten the details of the bill by next \nNovember because even though the bill will not be in force in terms of \nbenefits, it will be in force in terms of increased premiums and \nincreased taxes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I believe the time for the minority has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is correct.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: As you know, Americans across our country \n     have been actively engaged in the debate on health care \n     reform. Whether or not our constituents agree with the \n     direction of the debate, many are frustrated and lacking \n     accurate information on the emerging proposals in Congress. \n     Without a doubt, reforming health care in America is one of \n     the most monumental and far-reaching undertakings considered \n     by this body in decades. We believe the American public's \n     participation in this process is critical to our overall \n     success of creating a bill that lowers health care costs and \n     offers access to quality and affordable health care for all \n     Americans.\n       Every step of the process needs to be transparent, and \n     information regarding the bill needs to be readily available \n     to our constituents before the Senate starts to vote on \n     legislation that will affect the lives of every American. The \n     legislative text and complete budget scores from the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of the health care \n     legislation considered on the Senate floor should be made \n     available on a website the public can access for at least 72 \n     hours prior to the first vote to proceed to the legislation. \n     Likewise, the legislative text and complete CBO scores of the \n     health care legislation as amended should be made available \n     to the public for 72 hours prior to the vote on final passage \n     of the bill in the Senate. Further, the legislative text of \n     all amendments filed and offered for debate on the Senate \n     floor should be posted on a public website prior to beginning \n     debate on the amendment on the Senate floor. Lastly, upon a \n     final agreement between the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, a formal conference report detailing the agreement \n     and complete CBO scores of the agreement should be made \n     available to the public for 72 hours prior to the vote on \n     final passage of the conference report in the Senate.\n       By publicly posting the legislation and its CBO scores 72 \n     hours before it is brought to a vote in the Senate and by \n     publishing the text of amendments before they are debated, \n     our constituents will have the opportunity to evaluate these \n     policies and communicate their concerns or their message of \n     support to their Members of Congress. As their \n     democratically-elected representatives in Washington, DC, it \n     is our duty to listen to their concerns and to provide them \n     with the chance to respond to proposals that will impact \n     their lives. At a time when trust in Congress and the U.S. \n     government is unprecedentedly low, we can begin to rebuild \n     the American people's faith in their federal government \n     through transparency and by actively inviting Americans to \n     participate in the legislative process.\n       We respectfully request that you agree to these principles \n     before moving forward with floor debate of this legislation. \n     We appreciate your serious consideration and look forward to \n     working with you on health care reform legislation in the \n     weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Blanche L. Lincoln.\n     Mary L. Landrieu.\n     Claire McCaskill.\n     Mark L. Pryor.\n     Evan Bayh.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman.\n     Ben Nelson.\n     Jim Webb.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Obama is Sued for White House Visitor List\n\n                            (By Bill Dedman)\n\n       The nonprofit conservative group Judicial Watch has sued \n     the U.S. Secret Service after the Obama administration again \n     denied a request for copies of the list of visitors to the \n     White House.\n       The records are being sought by journalists and public \n     interest groups to help determine who is influencing White \n     House policy on health care, the economy and a host of other \n     issues.\n       Under the Obama policy, most of the names of visitors from \n     Inauguration Day in\n\n[[Page S13441]]\n\n     January through the end of September will never be released. \n     After the Secret Service and the White House denied a request \n     for those records, Judicial Watch filed suit on Monday in \n     federal court in Washington.\n       Like the Bush administration before it, the Obama White \n     House argues that the visitor records belong to the White \n     House, not the Secret Service. White House records are not \n     subject to the Freedom of Information Act, as agency records \n     would be. Federal Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled twice during \n     the Bush administration that White House visitor logs belong \n     to the Secret Service, which creates and maintains them, and \n     must be released.\n       To settle lawsuits against the Bush and Obama \n     administrations, filed by the liberal group Citizens for \n     Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, the Obama \n     administration has released the names of hundreds of \n     visitors, out of the hundreds of thousands who have been to \n     the White House for meetings, events or tours. The \n     administration has promised to release more of the names of \n     visitors for the period from October onward. The first wave \n     of records is due near the end of this year.\n       Even for the names it has released, the White House has not \n     provided a city or affiliation, such as a company name or \n     organization represented, making it difficult or impossible \n     to tell whether a person named on the list is a well-known \n     person with that name. And some names are not being released \n     at all, including potential Supreme Court nominees, personal \n     guests of the first family and certain security officials.\n       The White House has set up a Web page where members of the \n     public can request the release of names of visitors, but that \n     system gives results only for the names of visitors that the \n     public can guess. If the public can't guess who may have \n     visited the White House between January and September, it \n     can't find out the names.\n       In addition, although the White House system requires \n     requesters to submit their e-mail address, requests are not \n     acknowledged by the White House, and no reply is sent to the \n     requesters. The names sought, if they correspond to actual \n     visitors, just show up in the next batch of names released by \n     the White House. So far, each release of names by the White \n     House has happened on the evening before a holiday, the \n     classic Washington tactic for burying uncomfortable news.\n\n\n                     Negotiations with White House\n\n       Judicial Watch, in a press release, described being invited \n     to the White House to discuss its request. It met on Oct. 27 \n     with Norman L. Eisen, special counsel to the president, who \n     happens to be a founder of CREW, which had dropped its own \n     lawsuits on this issue.\n       ``During the meeting, the Obama White House officials asked \n     Judicial Watch to scale back its request and expressed hope \n     that Judicial Watch would publicly praise the Obama \n     administration's commitment to transparency,'' Judicial Watch \n     said. ``However, the White House refused to abandon its \n     legally indefensible line of reasoning that White House \n     visitor logs are not subject to FOIA law.\n       ``If the Obama administration is serious about \n     transparency, they will agree to the release of these records \n     under the Freedom of Information Act,'' said Judicial Watch \n     President Tom Fitton.\n       White House officials did not reply Wednesday to a request \n     for comment on the Judicial Watch lawsuit.\n\n\n                    Request by msnbc.com also denied\n\n       A similar request by msnbc.com was rejected by the Secret \n     Service, which referred us to the White House, which also \n     denied the request. The Secret Service denied an \n     administrative appeal of msnbc.com's request on Monday.\n       The White House now says that national security is a reason \n     not to release the records for January through September, an \n     issue not raised by the Bush or Obama administrations in \n     their previous legal filings on this issue.\n       ``The inherited visitor entrance system was not structured \n     to identify sensitive records,'' Eisen wrote to msnbc.com. \n     ``As a result, we cannot make a broad retroactive release of \n     White House visitor records without raising profound national \n     security concerns. For example, the release of certain \n     sensitive national security records encompassed in your \n     request could assist foreign intelligence agencies to \n     identify and target U.S. government officials working on \n     sensitive national security issues.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we continue \nwith alternating blocks of time until 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise at this late afternoon hour to talk \nabout what has transpired over the last 24 hours. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, we had a vote at 1 a.m. this morning. To say that is \nunusual is an understatement; to have the Senate voting at that hour is \nmost unusual. What that vote symbolized--what happened here pursuant to \nthat vote was I think an exercise in Washington game playing.\n  We have now a health care bill that the American people have been \ndebating for months--the bill in front of the Senate right now, a bill \nwe have been debating intensively over the last couple of weeks, and we \nwant to get to a vote on it. In order to prevent a vote on health care, \nthe Republican side of the aisle decided they would use any tactic \nnecessary to stop the bill, so they came out in full force at 1 a.m. \nand voted against the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for \n2010.\n  It is hard to understand why. I can understand opposition to a health \ncare bill, and we can debate that, but it is hard to understand why any \npolitical party--even one that is intent on killing a health care \nbill--would use the Department of Defense Appropriations Act to do \nthat, but that is what they did. It is another example of what makes \npeople angry about what happens or doesn't happen in Washington.\n  We have seen over the last couple of months a real debate about what \nour policy will be in Afghanistan. We have had a debate for years about \nwhat has been happening in Iraq, in those two conflicts, and what our \nfighting men and women are doing around the world serving their \ncountry. We know now that there are more than 34,000--almost 35,000--\nAmericans deployed in Afghanistan.\n  When I consider my home State of Pennsylvania, when you look at the \nnumber of Pennsylvanians overseas--Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as other \nplaces around the world where they are serving, where they are \ndeployed--10,430 Pennsylvanians are serving around the world. There are \n6,431 active duty and 3,999 Guard and Reserve Pennsylvanians. Many \nother States could point to similar numbers. So we have tens of \nthousands of Americans serving around the world, especially those who \nare serving in Afghanistan and in Iraq right now, and yet we have the \nSenate, on the Republican side of the aisle, using a Defense \nappropriations bill to slow down the health care debate and to stop the \nbill. It is beyond insulting to the American people that they would use \nthis tactic.\n  What is the bill all about? Well, I won't go through all of it, but \nhere is what the Department of Defense Appropriations Act entails. \nFirst of all, military personnel: Funding for more than 2.2 million \nAmericans who are serving our country. More than 1.4 million are active \nduty and over 844,000 for the Reserve component.\n  Military pay: The bill provides for a 3.4-percent military pay \nincrease above the requested amount.\n  Operations and maintenance, readiness and training: The bill includes \n$154 billion for Defense operations and maintenance.\n  Procurement, research, development, testing and evaluation, a whole \nseries of expenditures that our fighting men and women need to have in \nplace to help them around the world, and a whole list of vehicles and \nother equipment that are paid for by this bill.\n  It goes on from there, a long, important list of what our fighting \nmen and women need. What they don't need is a group of Washington, DC \npoliticians using the Defense appropriations bill to play a game on \nhealth care. If the Republicans want to slow down health care or stop \nit, they have every right to do that, and they have every right to use \nlots and lots of tactics and procedures. What they should never do--\nthere may not be a rule against this per se, but one would think as \nAmericans who are supposed to be supporting our fighting men and women \nin Afghanistan and in Iraq and other places around the world, one would \nthink they would draw the line and not cross the line of using the \nDefense Appropriations Act to enforce their will as it relates to \nhealth care.\n  What our fighting men and women expect of us is they expect us to \ngive them the resources they need to fight those battles and not to \nplay petty, insulting political games in the midst of that, but that is \nwhat we have had. We had Republican Senators come down to this floor at \n1 o'clock in the morning last night and vote one after another after \nanother against moving the Department of Defense Appropriations Act \nforward.\n  I will note that in the midst of all that, the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Gates, who we know served several Republican Presidents--he \nserved\n\n[[Page S13442]]\n\nnow former President Bush and President Reagan and served under the \nfirst President Bush as well--recently wrote that delay of this bill, \ndelay of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, would result in \na ``serious disruption'' in the military's ability to pay troops. The \nSecretary of Defense continued:\n\n       It is inconceivable to me that such a situation would be \n     permitted to occur with U.S. forces actively deployed in \n     combat.\n\n  I couldn't say it better myself. It is inconceivable. We know \npolitical parties fight and both parties have battled and they carry it \ntoo far once in a while, but I don't know of an example where a \npolitical party, in order to stop a domestic bill that deals with \ndomestic issues--in this case health care--to stop that from moving \nforward would use the Department of Defense appropriations bill as its \nvehicle.\n  As it stands now, we know the vehicle that keeps our government \nmoving and paying for government programs--the so-called CR, which is \nan acronym for continuing resolution--which, to get out of the \nWashington-speak for a moment, means the way we are paying for \ngovernment to operate over a limited period of time, we know that \nresolution, the funding in that resolution as it relates to Pentagon \noperations runs out at midnight. I recognize there is some flexibility \nthat will allow operations to move forward, but it is outrageous and \ninsulting when a political party feels the need to unreasonably delay \nfunding for the troops because they want to put something in the way of \nhaving health care move forward. There are lots of ways to obstruct. \nThere are lots of ways to slow things down.\n  Under the Senate rules, the minority party--in this case the \nRepublicans in the Senate--have rights to do that. But one would think \nwhen we have people on the battlefield they would draw the line at \nthis, but they haven't. They have crossed this line, and I think the \nAmerican people know what is going on here. It is a game. It is a big \nWashington game. The only problem here, the fundamental problem here is \nthat it is in direct conflict with our obligation to make sure that we \nmove legislation as it relates to our military as fast as we can. This \nisn't something that people have been working on for a couple of days. \nThere have been hearings that are the undergirding or the foundation of \nthis appropriations act. There have been debates about what the \nspending increases should be. All of that took place over many months, \nand now we want to move a Defense Appropriations Act forward, and what \nare the Republicans doing? They are using that vehicle to stop the \nhealth care bill.\n  So, even as I said before, to say it is insulting or outrageous \ndoesn't begin to capture it, but I think the American people know what \nwe are talking about. They understand a game when they see it, and they \nare seeing it with this shell game that has been played over the last \ncouple of hours.\n  We are going to continue to make sure that we do everything possible \nto move this legislation forward, and then, after we get this \nlegislation moved forward, then we are going to get back to health care \nand pass a health care bill before Christmas.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand there is a member of the \nDemocratic Caucus who is headed to the floor. I will immediately cease \nspeaking as soon as he or she arrives. I simply wish to make a few \ncomments with respect to statements made with respect to the schedule. \nThe question was asked by my colleague from Texas: Why would people \nwant to rush this bill through when the effective date is not until \n2014?\n  The other question was: Why would someone want to delay the vote? I \nthink the answer to both questions is the same. The American people are \nlooking at this bill. Admittedly, they are not looking at the specific \nbill, because no one knows what it is. It is still, for the umpteenth \ntime, being rewritten. They are looking at the general outline of the \nbill, and the more they see, the more they don't like it.\n  Every poll that comes out shows increasingly decreasing support for \nthe bill and increasingly opposition to the bill. The gap between these \ntwo positions is growing wider and wider. This is quite remarkable, \nbecause when we began the debate in the Spring, support for the idea of \nhealth care reform, and particularly for some of the specifics, was \nvery high, and disapproval was very low. We have seen, over time, those \ntwo lines cross. Now opposition to the bill is, according to some \npolls, as high as 60 percent or more, and support for the bill has \ndropped.\n  I can understand that those who want the bill passed want to rush the \nprocess as fast as possible, because they don't want any more erosion \nin popular support. Those who want the bill stopped want to stretch the \nprocess out so that the polls can have their impact on Members of this \nbody. It should not, therefore, come as a surprise to anybody that the \nprocedures will be handled in the way they are--with the one group \nsaying, let's get it done quickly before people find out more about it, \nand the other group saying let's slow it up as much as we can while \npeople find out more about it.\n  I think that is the answer to the questions that have been raised \nhere with respect to the procedure.\n  I see other Senators may well be coming. Until they arrive, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time currently is all located to the Democratic side The Senator \nmust ask unanimous consent to do so at this time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the fact that there are few remaining moments on the \nother side of the aisle, I be permitted to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me emphasize that it was cleared with \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2010 National Defense \nAppropriations Act. Let me begin by thanking the committee's \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Inouye, and the ranking member, Senator \nCochran, for their leadership in crafting this bill and for their \nstrong commitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  I am very proud of the work that the State of Maine does that \ncontributes to our national defense. The appropriations bill provides \nvital resources that our troops need and recognizes the enormous \ncontributions made by the State of Maine to our national security. From \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, to the Pratt & Whitney Plant \nin North Berwick, to the Bath Iron Works shipbuilders to the University \nof Maine's engineers, to the Maine Military Authority in Aroostook \nCounty, Mainers all over our great State are leading the way to a \nstronger national defense.\n  This legislation will provide funding for essential training, \nequipment, and support to our troops as they bravely and skillfully \nengage in national security efforts at home and abroad. This is a \ncritical time in our nation's history and the Committee has, once \nagain, demonstrated its strong support of our soldiers, airmen, \nsailors, and marines.\n  This legislation also will fund critical force protection and health \ncare initiatives for our troops, while continuing development of \nimportant technologies and acquisition programs to counter existing and \nemerging threats.\n  The legislation before us includes a strong commitment to \nstrengthening\n\n[[Page S13443]]\n\nNavy shipbuilding. Our nation needs a strong and modern naval fleet \nallowing us to project power globally and to respond to threats. This \nbill authorizes $1 billion in funding for construction of the third \nDDG-1000, a priority of mine. The Pentagon's decision to have Bath Iron \nWorks, BIW, build all three of the DDG-1000s demonstrates well-deserved \nconfidence in BIW and will help ensure a stable work load for the \nshipyard and more stable production costs for the Navy.\n  In addition, this legislation authorizes $2.2 billion for continued \nDDG-51 procurement and nearly $150 million for the DDG-51 modernization \nprogram. The lessons and technology developed in the design of the DDG-\n1000 can be incorporated into the DDG-51 program to reduce crew size \nand to improve capabilities.\n  The legislation fully funds the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter request for \nboth the Navy and the Air Force. This aircraft, powered by the superb \nengines made by Pratt & Whitney, will enable our servicemen and women \nto continue to maintain our air superiority.\n  At the request of Senator Snowe and myself, the Committee provides an \nadditional $20 million for Humvee maintenance to be performed at Maine \nMilitary Authority's, MMA, Army National Guard Readiness Sustainment \nSite, RSMS, located in Limestone, ME. For nearly 13 years, the Army \nNational Guard has relied on Maine Military Authority to provide a \ndependable service to our Nation's war fighters. The dedicated and \ntalented professionals at MMA have demonstrated their value to the Army \nand to the Nation and consistently have performed Humvee refurbishment \nat a lower cost than the Army's own depots. This funding would help to \nensure that MMA's valued workforce and high quality product remain a \nnational asset supporting the defense of our country.\n  The bill also provides $250 million for cancer research through the \nDefense Health Programs with $150 for the Breast Cancer Research \nProgram, $80 million for Prostate Cancer Research program, and nearly \n$20 million for the Ovarian Cancer Research Program. I believe that \nthere is simply no investment that promises greater returns for America \nthan its investment in biomedical research. These research programs at \nthe Department of Defense are important to our nation's efforts to \ntreat and prevent these devastating diseases that also affect our \nveterans and servicemembers.\n  The bill provides $307 million to address the Tricare private sector \nshortfall in fiscal year 2010 as identified by the Department of \nDefense. I know Tricare funding is vital to so many Maine veterans. We \nmust continue to support robust funding for this important program and \nlimit increases in Tricare premiums and copayments.\n  I strongly support the additional $15.6 million to strengthen the \nOffice of the Inspector General in order to keep pace with the growth \nin the size of the defense budget and the number of defense \ncontractors. More vigorous oversight of defense contracts to prevent \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars will complement the \nprocurement reforms we approved earlier this year.\n  This bill also includes funding for other defense-related projects \nthat would benefit Maine and our national security.\n  Funding is provided, for example, to Saco Defense in Saco, Maine, to \nenable the company to continue manufacturing weapons that are vital to \nthe Armed Forces.\n  In addition, at my urging, the legislation appropriates $5.28 million \nfor the University of Maine. This funding would support the development \nof LGX High Temperature Acoustic Wave Sensors and allow the University \nof Maine to continue to investigate fundamental sensor materials and \ndesign concepts as well as demonstrate functional prototypes of \nacoustic wave sensors that will be tested under extreme temperature \nenvironments. The funding for the University will also provide for \nwoody biomass conversion to JP-8 fuel, which will provide affordable \nalternative sources for military aviation fuel.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment further on the health care bill \ncurrently before the Senate. I have talked about my concerns previously \nregarding the impact on premiums, my belief that the bill will actually \ncause many middle-income Americans to pay more for health insurance. I \nhave also talked about my concerns about the impact on our small \nbusinesses.\n  I want to talk about a couple of other issues that are particularly \nimportant to the State of Maine. The first is the impact of the nearly \n$500 billion in Medicare cuts on Maine's home health, hospital, and \nother health care providers, including our nursing homes.\n  I am concerned that the bill before us is financed, in large measure, \nthrough these enormous cuts in the Medicare Program--a program that \nalready has long-term financing problems. According to the CMS Actuary, \nthese proposed deep cuts will threaten Medicare's fiscal stability and \npush one in five hospitals, nursing homes, and home health care \nproviders into the red. Many of these providers, I fear, would simply \nstop taking Medicare patients, which would jeopardize care for millions \nof seniors.\n  I want to make clear that I do believe there are savings that can be \nfound in the Medicare Program. For example, far too much is lost each \nyear to fraudulent claims. That is an area where we need to crack down. \nAs we put in place the health care reforms that have widespread support \non both sides of the aisle, we could also achieve real breakthroughs \nthat would improve the quality of care while lowering costs. But that \nis not what we are talking about in the underlying bill. Instead, we \nare talking about essentially across-the-board cuts, deep cuts, cuts \nthat are going to hurt some of the most vulnerable people in our \ncountry--our seniors and our disabled citizens.\n  This became even more clear to me as a result of a conversation I had \nthis past week with Peter Chalke, the CEO of Central Maine Health Care. \nHe runs not only the tertiary hospital in Lewiston, ME, but also rural \nhospitals in western Maine, in Rumford and in Bridgton, as well as a \nsmaller hospital in Brunswick, ME. So you can see from that \ndescription, if you are familiar with the State of Maine, that the \nhospital network he covers makes a huge difference in the lives of so \nmany Mainers. Here is what he told me. He first pointed out that Maine \nis one of the oldest States in the country. So we have a substantial \nMedicare population.\n  Despite being recognized nationally for providing high-quality care, \nMaine's hospitals currently receive the second lowest Medicare \nreimbursement in the country relative to their costs. There is no fat \nto cut in the reimbursements of hospitals in the State of Maine. They \nhave very high quality, some of the highest quality in the Nation, \naccording to health care experts, and according to Medicare itself. Yet \nthey get the second lowest reimbursements.\n  The CEO of this hospital network put it bluntly to me. He said \npassage of this bill in its current form would be disastrous for the \nState of Maine. He said the bill would saddle Maine's hospitals with \nsome $800 million in Medicare cuts over the next decade, with very \nlittle upside benefit from expanded coverage since about 90 percent of \nMaine residents are covered by some type of insurance policy today.\n  We also have a large Medicaid population in our State, which led him \nto another concern. Mr. Chalke told me that a further expansion of the \nMedicaid Program is simply not sustainable, since Maine has repeatedly \ndemonstrated its inability to pay for the current Medicaid Program.\n  In Maine, that program is known as MaineCare. It pays Central Maine \nHealth Care just 60 percent of its allowable costs. Moreover, MaineCare \nwill owe Central Maine Health Care more than $50 million by the end of \nthe year.\n  The failure on the part of Medicare and Medicaid to pay their full \nshare, to pay the amount that it actually costs to provide the care, \nsimply results in cost shifting to private payers. In Maine, this cost \nshifting means that individuals who have private insurance cover 130 \npercent or more of hospital costs. That should not be a surprise to us. \nIf both Medicare and Medicaid are not paying at a sufficient level to \ntruly cover the cost of care, what happens? The cost gets shifted to \nprivate insured patients. This big gap is one reason Maine's insurance \nrates are the fourth highest in the Nation.\n  This is an untenable situation. The CEO told me that if Congress \npasses\n\n[[Page S13444]]\n\nthis bill, Maine's hospitals and physicians will be forced to expand \ncost shifting, further increasing the pressures on private insurance \nmarkets, further making that cost an extraordinary burden on middle-\nincome families.\n  Medicare, which is so critically important to our Nation's seniors, \nshould not be used as a piggy bank for new spending programs when the \nrevenues are needed to shore up the current program. I know my \ncolleague from Tennessee has been talking about that issue for a long \ntime. I joined him in a letter that said if there are savings to be \nfound in Medicare, let's use those savings to shore up Medicare. We all \nknow that Medicare is not financially sustainable. So what are we \ndoing? We are cutting nearly $500 billion out of a program that does \nnot have sufficient funds to deal with the influx of the baby boom \ngeneration, much less with the costs it is now incurring. It is \nfiscally irresponsible to raid Medicare to pay for a new entitlement \nprogram.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Maine yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think I heard some of our colleagues say these \nDraconian Medicare cuts would actually lead to the closure of some \nrural hospitals. I am wondering if the Senator from Maine thinks that \nmay even be possible given the magnitude of these Medicare cuts we are \nhearing complaints about all across America.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the minority leader brings up a very good \npoint. I know the Republican leader is familiar with the analysis that \nwas done by Medicare's own Actuary that says that one out of five \nhospitals--and these are likely to be the small rural hospitals that \nare so important in our States--would be so jeopardized by these cuts \nthat they may not survive. Another thing that will happen is that \nphysicians are going to start turning away Medicare patients.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Maine, isn't that beginning to \nhappen in some States already before we even take this additional step?\n  Ms. COLLINS. It is. My friend from Kentucky is exactly right. In my \nState, there are already severe shortages of primary care physicians, \nparticularly in the more rural areas of the State--the northern, \neastern, and western parts of the State. Their practices are full to \nstart with. What we are asking them to do is to keep accepting new \nMedicare patients whose reimbursements will not cover the cost of their \ncare. That is why in many States you see physicians limiting how many \nMedicare patients they will take. I know how painful that is for our \nphysicians. After all, they became physicians to care for people. They \nwant to ensure people have the care they need. But there is a limit to \nwhat they can do.\n  I share the concerns of the Senator from Kentucky that the result of \nthis bill will be to jeopardize the very existence of rural hospitals, \nsmall nursing homes, home health care providers, which, in my State, \nare absolutely critical. After all, I know my colleagues from Tennessee \nand Kentucky have had the same experience I have had of talking to \nseniors who are getting home health care. They are so happy to receive \nhealth care in the privacy and the comfort and security of their own \nhomes rather than being forced into a hospital setting or a nursing \nhome. Yet the bill before us singles out the Medicare home health \nbenefit for a disproportionate share of the cuts. It proposes that home \nhealth care and hospice care--hospice care, Mr. President--would be \nslashed by $42 billion over the next 10 years. That makes no sense \nwhatsoever. That's $42 billion in cuts for home health care and $8 \nbillion on top of that for hospice care.\n  A home health care director in my State, a nurse whom I know well, \nreally summed it up well. First, she described the impact on Visiting \nNurses of Aroostook, the county I am from in northern Maine. It had \ntotal revenues of $1.9 million last year. It estimates that it will \nlose $313,000 in the first year of the House bill, if that were to \npass, and $237,000 under the Senate bill.\n  According to the director of this agency, cuts of this magnitude \nwould cause this home health agency to consider shrinking the area \nserved or discontinuing some services. They cannot afford to cover such \na geographically huge area as Aroostook County with that kind of cut.\n  Here is another thing I want to share with my colleagues, because \nthis is what this debate is really all about. What she told me is the \nfollowing: It is going to be hard for our staff--and our staff is \nscared--but it is our patients who will pay the price if Congress makes \nthese cuts in home care.\n  That is what concerns me. It is not just the impact on our rural \nhospitals, our dedicated physicians, our struggling nursing homes, and \nour valiant home health agencies. It is their patients. It is the \nvulnerable senior citizen who lives on a rural Maine road who may lose \naccess to home health care. It is families who want to live in rural \ncommunities but cannot if there is not a hospital nearby. It is a \nnursing home that closes, forcing families to move a loved one far away \nfrom the home. Those are the real-life consequences of slashing \nMedicare.\n  I hope we will reconsider the cuts in this bill. It is so \ndisappointing that the Senate has repeatedly rejected attempts to try \nto mitigate those cuts.\n  There are so many other problems with this bill.\n  I see the Republican time is about to expire. I hope as we proceed \nthat we can also talk about the impact of the 4-year gap between when \nall the new taxes under this bill go into effect and when the subsidies \nare proposed to go into effect. $73 billion in new taxes and fees will \ngo into effect by 2014, and some of those new taxes start in 2 weeks--2 \nweeks--if, in fact, this bill is passed. And I hope it will not be. For \nexample, the bill taxes pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The bill \ntaxes health insurance. Next year, the bill imposes a penalty for \nhealth savings accounts, which makes no sense to me. We want people to \nbe able to save money to help cover their deductibles.\n\n  Next year, the bill proposes to restrict flexible spending accounts--\nagain, this makes no sense to me.\n  The $73 billion in new taxes and fees imposed by the bill over the \nnext four years are going to be passed on to consumers, without a \ndoubt. CBO says that and the Joint Committee on Taxation says that. But \nwhen do the subsidies go into effect to mitigate this upward pressure \non premiums? Not until 2014. I do not see how imposing these new taxes \nnow--before the exchanges are set up that the chief benefits of the \nbill are supposed to become available--makes health care more \naffordable.\n  Mr. President, the health care legislation that the Senate is \ncurrently considering would have enormous consequences for our economy \nand our society. It would affect every single American and 17 percent \nof our economy. There are many reforms that have strong, bipartisan \nsupport, that could have been the basis of our efforts here in the \nSenate. It has therefore been disappointing that this process has been \nso divisive and partisan. While I continue to believe that our health \ncare system is in need of fundamental reform, the bill before us takes \nus in the wrong direction and will do more harm than good. In keeping \nwith the Hippocratic oath of ``first of all, do no harm,'' I plan to \noppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the Department of Defense appropriations bill we are \ncurrently considering and my disappointment that some of my colleagues \nhave chosen to hold up this important legislation for reasons \ncompletely unrelated to anything to do with this bill.\n  We have been debating health care in this Senate for months, and in \nthe coming days we will continue to debate health care. There are many \nhonest disagreements about the best ways to reform our Nation's health \ncare system. They deserve discussion.\n  I will say, hearing my colleague from Maine speak, that I am \nconcerned about Medicare as well. I am concerned because Medicare is \ngoing in the red in 2017 if we don't do anything about it. I\n\n[[Page S13445]]\n\nlook at my mom, who is 82 years old, who wants to make sure she stays \non Medicare. I look at friends who are in their fifties and who want to \nmake sure they get Medicare when they are 65. We need to make sure we \nput in place those cost reforms that are going to give us the high-\nquality kind of care we have in Minnesota.\n  But what I want to talk about today is the Defense appropriations \nbill. Whatever disagreements we may have on health care, they have \nabsolutely nothing to do with the Defense spending bill. Funding for \nour troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world, as well as for \ndefense health and other critical programs should not be dragged into \nthis debate. We should be able to separate the two issues and pass this \nDefense bill swiftly and overwhelmingly.\n  Senator Inouye and several of my other colleagues have already \ndiscussed the importance of this bill's funding provisions to our \nongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and to our Nation's overall \ndefense. I would like to spend a few minutes on the importance of this \nbill to my home State of Minnesota and where the Acting President pro \ntempore also resides.\n  There are currently over 1,300 members of the Minnesota National \nGuard deployed in Iraq. These deploying members are with the 34th \nInfantry Division, the famous Red Bulls--the longest serving unit in \nIraq. They assumed command of all U.S. forces in Iraq's southern \nquadrant in May of this year, taking over from the New York-based 10th \nMountain Division. This means these Minnesota National Guard soldiers \nhave command responsibilities for 9 of Iraq's 18 provinces. For the \nlast 7 months, they have overseen the continuing transfer of security \nresponsibility to Iraqi forces, which will ultimately enable the \nresponsible withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. In order for these \nMinnesota National Guard soldiers to successfully complete their \nmission and return home to their families early next year, as \nscheduled, we need to provide them the funding included in this bill.\n  I know all of my colleagues share my belief that we have a \nresponsibility to the brave men and women we send overseas to provide \nthem with the resources they need to carry out their mission. And there \nis simply no reason for delay.\n  In addition to providing our troops with what they need when they are \noverseas, we also have the responsibility to take care of them when \nthey return home.\n  As the Chair knows, in Minnesota, we are proud to have created the \nBeyond the Yellow Ribbon reintegration program. This groundbreaking \ninitiative, pioneered by the Minnesota National Guard, helps soldiers \nmake the transition from their life as a soldier to civilian life \nthrough counseling and other services.\n  Due to its overwhelming success in Minnesota, this program now serves \nas a model for the national Yellow Ribbon program that I have worked \nwith my colleagues to authorize and fund in recent Defense bills. The \nbill on the floor right now includes funding that will continue the \nMinnesota Yellow Ribbon program, as well as funding for similar \nreintegration programs in States across the Nation.\n  These are soldiers who don't have a base to come home to. They come \nhome to small towns all over the country. The idea here is to bring \nthem in to meet with their commanders again, to see if they have a job, \nto see if they have the right health care, to see if they have their \neducation benefits set. That is the idea with Beyond the Yellow Ribbon.\n  When the 1,300 Minnesota National Guard soldiers return home early \nnext year, they and their families need the funding in place in this \nbill in order to resume civilian life. Any delay makes it harder for \ncommanders to have the necessary resources in place.\n  When our brave soldiers signed up to fight for us, there wasn't a \nwaiting line. When they come home to the United States of America, \nthere shouldn't be a waiting line. When they need health care, when \nthey need their education or they need a job, there shouldn't be a \nwaiting line. When they signed up to fight, there wasn't a delay, and \nthere shouldn't be a delay in Washington, DC, when it comes to funding \nfor our troops.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to support this \nbill and get this voted on as soon as possible--in fact, immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I agree with my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota, there shouldn't be a delay in funding our troops. I do find \nodd the urgency of the bill that has come to us a week before \nChristmas, something we passed out of here months ago.\n  I know that history has shown and certainly the Members who are part \nof the Republican side of the aisle have shown constantly that we care \ndeeply about our troops and want to make sure they are funded. But the \nfact that this bill has come up at this time just demonstrates the \ntremendous hypocrisy with regard to what is happening as this sausage \nis being made in the majority leader's office on this health care bill.\n  The reason I speak to that is this is must-pass legislation. The \nSenator from Minnesota--as we all do--wants to see this passed. And all \nof us know this will pass. But I want to point out that in this bill, \nthere is $1.2 billion in money to go to physicians so that their pay \nwill not be cut.\n  What this bill does is just point out again the tremendous fallacies \nof the process taking place beyond the ultimate passage of this bill, \nand that is the health care bill we have been discussing now for months \nand months. The fact is, we are taking $464 billion out of Medicare if \nthis bill passes and we are using that money to leverage a whole new \nentitlement program. The fact is, we are not dealing with the physician \npay cuts, which we all know are looming. We all know there is $250 \nbillion worth of cuts that will take place in physician pay over the \nnext 10 years. We know this bill does not deal with that. Yet, somehow \nor other, on this Defense appropriations bill, we are dealing with that \nfor a few months because everybody in the world who can wake up and put \none foot in front of the other knows that right after this health care \nbill passes, in the name of being budget neutral--again, using all the \ngimmicks the Senator from Maine just talked about a minute ago; using 6 \nyears' worth of cost and 10 years' worth of revenue; taking money from \nan insolvent program to create another program that will become \ninsolvent over time--what it doesn't deal with is the SGR and the doc \nfix.\n  So what will happen is the majority leader, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee will come forth with a bill--right after this passes, \nI am sure, ironically--and pass another $250 billion or try to pass \nanother $250 billion piece of legislation, unpaid for, just so that we \ncan say--so that you can say--so that they can say that, in fact, a \npiece of health care legislation passed that was budget neutral.\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you, I came from a world where we \nfocused more on results, and the process really wasn't much a part of \nit. But in this body, with 100 Senators and 435 House Members on the \nother side of the building, process matters some. It matters because it \nreally keeps each of us feeling, hopefully, if we have the right \nprocess, that there is integrity in what is happening.\n  I think between the way this body and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have used the CBO office and 6 years' worth of cost and 10 \nyears' worth of revenues and all this to make it look as if this bill \nis budget neutral, yet knowing we haven't dealt with this very \nimportant aspect, it points to one part of this process. The fact that \nin the morning the majority leader is going to lay down about a 300-\npage amendment--one I haven't seen yet--that a few people working in \nclose quarters developed--and I don't know if the Acting President pro \ntempore has seen this piece of legislation--and then he will file \ncloture on an amendment with 300 pages worth of changes, which I \nunderstand are going to be fairly important changes, without our having \nthe ability to amend this legislation, to me, is pretty incredible. \nThis is an important piece of legislation. It is going to affect every \nAmerican in this country.\n  I was talking with some of my colleagues earlier today--and I know \nthe Senator from South Dakota has been very concerned about the \nprovisions of this bill--and Senator Thune pointed\n\n[[Page S13446]]\n\nout the other day, as the Senator from Maine did, about the taxes that \nstart in 2 weeks and the benefits starting in 4 years, mostly. I know \nthere are some benefits that start on the front end. But what my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle were saying is that once this \nbill passes, that is just the beginning. There will have to be multiple \nchanges over the next 4 years to actually cause this bill to work. This \npoints to the fact that this is about a political victory.\n  I guess I would ask my friend from South Dakota, if we were going to \npass a landmark piece of legislation and do so in a way that would \nstand the test of time, wouldn't you think we would vote on more than \nseven amendments? Wouldn't you think we would actually debate the bill \nin a real way and try to work out these difficulties in advance?\n  Again, just a few hours ago, my friends were telling me we are just \ngoing to try to pass this thing, then we are going to try to fix it \nover the next 4 years before all these problems hit Americans \nthroughout our country, because what we are really doing on the front \nend is just collecting a lot of money. That is what we are doing to \nmake this budget neutral. And then the real changes to the health care \nsystem take effect over time. We know we have problems, but we will fix \nthose down the road. That is not exactly a process that I think passes \nmuster with most people back home.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORKER. I would love to hear from the Senator from South Dakota \nas to what he thinks about this type of process.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might, through the Chair, Mr. President, ask a \nquestion of the Senator from Tennessee, if he will yield, because he is \nabsolutely right. This is being rushed. This is a massive reordering \nand restructuring of one-sixth of our economy, which we are going to be \nexpected to vote upon in just a few days, on a managers' amendment \nwhich will be the so-called latest deal struck behind closed doors, as \nthe Senator mentioned. We are going to be expected to vote upon that \nwithout having seen it today. In fact, I don't think any of our \ncolleagues on the other side, or very few of them, have seen it, nor \nhave the American people.\n  I have listened as the other side has gotten up here today with all \nthese statements of outrage and that it is insulting, it is \nunconscionable that this side would be holding up funding for the \ntroops, and what strikes me about that is the deadline for passing the \nappropriations bills is September 30. I think that feigned outrage is \nall about a bigger, grand sort of cynical plan at work here to try to \npush this health care bill through.\n  But would the Senator from Tennessee be able to answer a question \nregarding this. The Defense appropriations bill passed the House last \nsummer. It passed the Senate in October, I think October 6. So we are \ntalking 8, 9, 10 weeks ago now. Clearly, the Democratic majority's \nclock management is either very bad or this was part of some big, grand \nplan to push this thing to the very end and to jam this thing through, \nto try to set it up so that the health care bill could be passed right \nbefore the Christmas holiday without the American people having had an \nopportunity to see it, and the Defense appropriations bill, which \ncarries a bunch of other unrelated items, would pass as well.\n  Does it seem a little odd and coincidental to the Senator from \nTennessee that you would be debating the Defense appropriations bill \nright now when it could have been done weeks ago, if not months ago? In \nfact, these bills are supposed to be done by September 30, which is the \nend of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. CORKER. I do think it is odd. As my colleague knows, I think the \ntwo of us--all three of us on the Senate floor on our side of the aisle \nsigned a letter to the Appropriations Committee and to the leader of \nthe Senate asking that these be taken up one at a time so we would be \nfinished with this work by the time the fiscal year ended. So it is \nironic.\n  Let me tell you the purpose, in my opinion. I certainly do not know \nall the inner workings of what is happening on this floor in the \nSenate. But this is sort of a filibuster. In other words, there is a \nsegment where we discuss this must-pass piece of legislation, where \nsome things can be added in that have not been dealt with that are \nunrelated--unrelated to defense but also 1,720 earmarks, many of which \nare mighty suspect. But this is a filibuster, in my opinion, where \nduring this period of time we can be drafting, or the majority leader \ncan be drafting what I would call the ``bad actors amendment.''\n  What I mean by that is, if you have had opposition to the health care \nbill, which is the real issue we are going to be dealing with over the \nnext few days, if you have had some trouble with the bill, then you can \ngo in and get some niceties.\n  For instance, I am sure if I decided I was going to support this \nbill, the health care bill--which I am not--I am sure there are all \nkinds of things that might spring up in Tennessee as a part of this \nhealth care legislation to make it so that the bill was more suitable, \nif you will, to the people of Tennessee and to me myself. My guess is \nthis managers' amendment is going to be quite interesting to read. I \nlook forward to seeing the details because my guess is it not only will \nfix technical issues, but my guess is it will also fix some wants and \nneeds of some people who might otherwise have difficulty supporting \nthis legislation. So, yes, I think this Defense appropriations bill--\ngive it a little time for this to germinate. We will have a chance to \nsee that tomorrow for the first time when cloture is filed on it--as I \nunderstand, no debate, no amendments. I think it is a shame the Senate \nhas gotten to the point where this is the type of process that is in \nplace.\n  I understand my time may be up. If not, I would love to yield to the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Republicans has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the proceedings in the Senate in the last few days. I call \nupon my fellow Senators to reconsider the tactics which are being used \nto defeat the pending legislation. This body prides itself on being the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. But that designation has been \ndestroyed with what has occurred in the last several days.\n  We have seen a filibuster on the Defense appropriations bill. We are \nat war, and we have 68,000 young men and women in Afghanistan today who \nare giving life and limb for this country. We are debating whether they \nought to be funded. I have heard the question raised by those in the \nmilitary: Doesn't the Congress support the troops?\n  The impact on morale is potentially devastating when the Senate is \nnot moving ahead to provide the funding, the money to support their \nefforts. I have no hesitancy in extolling their virtues at the highest \nlevel of patriotism. I wouldn't want to make any comment about a \ncorollary negative, as to what is going on in this body. But it is \nhardly in the spirit of patriotism that we are asking these young men \nand women to be in harm's way and to give life and limb.\n  We have seen procedures involved on the reading of the amendments.\n  Rule 15 does provide for reading: Amendments shall be reduced to \nwriting, read, copies deposited on the desks of the majority leader and \nthe minority leader before being debated.\n  Those are the purposes involved. But there is no intent in the rules \nof the Senate to have hours spent reading an amendment for dilatory \npurposes. The intent of the rule and the spirit of the rule is to \ninform people but not to have this body paralyzed by this kind of \nconduct.\n  We have passed the point of civility. We have passed the point of \ndecency in the way this body is being conducted. I call upon my \ncolleagues to reconsider these tactics and to try to move ahead and do \nthe people's business. The American people are perplexed, mystified--it \nis hard to find words strong enough on what the public reaction is. The \npublic opinion polls show that approval ratings are plummeting--\nplummeting. People have no confidence on what is happening in this \nbody, no understanding as to what is going on, and they see partisan \npolitical gridlock of the worst sort in the time since my election in \n1980, and from my conversations with those who have been in this body a \ngood bit longer and from my own study of the history of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S13447]]\n\n  I urge my fellow Senators to reconsider these kinds of tactics and to \ntry to get on with the people's business because that is why we are \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis comments. I associate myself with them and appreciate what he just \nsaid.\n  We find ourselves in a remarkable situation, where, frankly, there is \nan extraordinary amount of distortion and fakery taking place on the \nfloor of the Senate. There is a great strategy of deception which the \nRepublicans have engaged in and in which they continue to engage, \nclaiming they are being left out of the process; claiming we ought to \ngo back and start over; claiming they haven't been included; claiming \nthey do not know what is going on. We are where we are today after a \nyear and a half of effort in this initiative specifically--years and \nyears beyond that if you want to go back to Teddy Roosevelt and Harry \nTruman and every President since then.\n  But right now we have a specific effort going. We began in the \nFinance Committee a year and a half ago, the summer of a year ago, \nwhere we assembled over at the Library of Congress, and we had an \nentire day during which time we had Republicans and Democrats. We \nlistened as a committee to experts from across the country about how to \ndo health care.\n  Subsequent to that we began hearings, constant hearings. And then at \nthe beginning of this year, 11 months ago, we began what we hoped would \nbe a bipartisan process. No chairman in the 25 years I have been here \nand working here has ever reached out as much as I watched Chairman Max \nBaucus reach out in an effort to try to get a bipartisan effort. How \nmany Senators from the other side came to the table? For the entire \nsummer, 3 months were taken up with the so-called Gang of 6, 6 \nSenators--3 Republicans and 3 Democrats.\n  Unfortunately, several of the Republicans have already walked away \nbecause they didn't like something that 60 Members of the Senate might \nwant to do. So they walked away. The Senator from Utah is one. He was \npart of those early negotiations. Then he said: I am not going to \ndo this.\n\n  In the end, the Senator from Colorado, Senator Enzi, and Senator \nGrassley, the Senator from Iowa, walked away. And Senator Snowe, to her \ncredit, has stayed at the table, worked hard with people, and continues \nto try to have a dialog about what it might need or not need. But \nsomehow they come here with the notion that they have a right to \ndictate what is in the bill that 60 Senators might think otherwise \nabout, and because they just cannot get their way on the big picture, \nthey are even willing to try to block the funding for the troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. That is just stunning to me.\n  I learned full well firsthand what it is like to be fighting in a war \nwhen people back home are not supporting it. I vowed when I came back \nthat would never be a mistake we might make again. We might disagree \nwith the war, but we would never confuse the war with the warriors, the \npeople fighting it.\n  In fact, these folks don't care, the folks on the other side. They \nare willing to just hold it hostage, do anything they can--not just to \ndefeat health care because they don't like it because it is different \nphilosophically from how they would approach it.\n  Incidentally, they opposed Medicare. I hope America hears this. This \nis the party over here that opposed Medicare when it was put in. They \nopposed Medicaid. They do not believe in that. They run around talking \nabout the ills and dangers of a government program for health care. \nWhich of them has brought an amendment to the floor ever or a bill to \nthe floor to say: Stop Medicare, end it? They never do that.\n  It is a government program. How many of them want to take away \nveterans health care, a government program? They never do that. But \nthey come to the floor and they jumbo mumbo the words around on the \nfloor and confuse America and make everybody believe this bill is \nsomehow what it is not. These are tried and true tactics. In a lot of \nplaces you call it demagoguery.\n  They have come here relying on crude but effective emotionally laden \nbuzz words, tried and tested in focus groups, funded with millions of \ndollars. Where do the millions of dollars come from? They come from the \npeople who want the status quo. Fourteen thousand people a day in \nAmerica lose their health insurance. Where is their plan to put those \n14,000 people back on the rolls? They don't have one. But we do; we do. \nThat is what we are here to do.\n  There is so much good in this bill. Is it perfect? Of course it is \nnot perfect. I will talk about that in a minute. But it is \nextraordinary to me that the folks who oppose it philosophically--they \nare never going to change. They keep talking about let's go back and \nstart over. Going back and starting over to them means let's write the \nbill the way we want it even though there are only 40 of us and \nliterally to hell with the rest of you 60 who represent the majority of \nthe country. That is their idea of going back to the beginning.\n  It is not going back to the beginning and coming up with a \nconstructive way to approach it because they had that chance. All year \nlong they had that chance. All they want to do is beat President Barack \nObama. That is their theory.\n  I was here in 1994. Unfortunately it has some potency out there. You \nmake the institution look bad, make the entire Congress look bad, and \nthen the voters will say: O, my God, who is running it? Oh, it is those \nguys. We better go to the other guys now. Just make it look bad because \npeople will not discern who is really responsible.\n  Let me be very clear. We are trying to move this forward. We have \ntried and tried, again and again, to reach out in a bipartisan way \nwhich requires compromise. Some people have come to the Senate in \nmodern times with a new definition of compromise. Their definition is \n``do it my way,'' not meet you halfway, not give in to what a majority \nmight believe they have a right to say is a fundamental bedrock \nprinciple of the way they want to approach a particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  Here we are with some of our folks now on our side of the fence \nactually being emboldened by the comments they hear that distort the \nbill on the other side, to say: Oh, you guys better throw it in. Don't \nvote for it.\n  Yesterday we heard a person I admire and like and have become a good \nfriend of, Howard Dean, who worked his heart out in 2004 to try to win, \nand then worked his heart out in 2008 to help elect this President.\n  Yesterday he wrote something which, incidentally, had some errors in \nfact about what was included and not included in the bill. But he said \nyesterday:\n\n       Let's kill the bill and start over.\n\n  As another person whose work I greatly admire because I think he \nholds things accountable, Keith Olbermann said Wednesday night:\n\n       This is not health, this is not care, this is certainly not \n     reform.\n\n  I respectfully--and I mean that--respectfully disagree with both of \nthem. I don't think they fully evaluated what is in this bill and what \nit accomplishes for America, nor fully evaluated the realities of what \nit would mean if you said kill it and start over. There is no President \nwho is going to step up in the next few years if we don't make \nprogress. There is no Senator who is going to invest in a process after \nthis, if we don't make this reform work now.\n  If you follow that kind of advice and give up now because this bill \nisn't everything you want it to be individually, then the very reforms \npeople have spent their life working for, reforms that the Democratic \nParty has been proposing for decades that are in this bill, many of us \nran on them and said: This is why we want to come to Washington to \naccomplish this--they would be destroyed. That would be it. It would be \ngone. What a mistake that would be.\n  The fact is, there are things I wanted that are not in this bill. I \nam a passionate supporter of a public option. Do you know what our \npublic option was in this bill? Our public option, ultimately, in this \nbill required the people who take part in it to carry the option with \ntheir premiums, not very different from a regular plan, except that it \nwasn't for profit. It had no public money to support it, and it \nwouldn't allow public money to come in and bail it out. It had to abide \nby the actuarial\n\n[[Page S13448]]\n\nvalues and rules of the marketplace, the way private insurance \ncompanies do. But it just wouldn't have shareholders and a for-profit \nstructure. It could drive competition in order to have those companies \nthat we all know have not stepped up when it comes to making sure that \nthey are there for the patients. Why? Because if you are for profit and \nyou are one of these insurance companies answerable to Wall Street and \nyour shareholders, your principal concern is to drive that profit. So \nwhat do they do? They hold onto the money until the last minute because \nthey get the float in the market. As long as the money is in your \ncoffers, then you are working the interest on it or you have it to use \nfor your company. If you pay out at the last moment, you make more \nmoney. If you pay less than you have to pay, you make more money. If \nyou cut people off, which they would do all the time, you make more \nmoney. If you tell people who bought their insurance, who thought they \nhad the insurance: Sorry, we don't have that insurance for you because \nof a little clause down here that you didn't read, too bad for you, but \nyou don't have the insurance, even though you have stage 4 cancer and \nyou have two kids and you are a divorced parent, too bad for you, you \ndon't have insurance. They do that because then they make more money. \nThese are real stories. You can find thousands of them across America. \nHow else do you lose 14,000 people a day who lose the insurance they \nthought they had or wanted?\n  This wasn't easy for Franklin Roosevelt when he tried to do it. It \nwasn't easy for Harry Truman when he tried to do it. It wasn't easy for \nBill Clinton when he tried to do it. Some of us were here and tried \nwith him. We understand how difficult it is. But you don't sound \nretreat. You don't ignore history and say: We are going to be better \noff by giving in to 40 people who are trying to destroy a Presidency \nand simply can't stand the fact that there are 60 votes here and there \nis a President who has an agenda to fix things. So the best thing they \ncan do is try and stand and stop it.\n  Some of our progressive friends have said because it doesn't have the \npublic option, we ought to do that. Even though it doesn't have a \npublic option, the bill encourages the creation of more not-for-profit \ninsurers, which I will say a little more about in a minute, that have \nthe ability to drive costs and increase competition. We don't have that \ntoday. Is that not worth fighting for on the Senate floor and putting \ninto this bill?\n  Again, my friend, Howard Dean, wrote in the Washington Post that real \nhealth care reform needed this public option to ``give all Americans a \nmeaningful choice of coverage.''\n  I happen to know this because he and I spent some time combating each \nother for the Presidency. In 1993, Howard Dean said of Medicare:\n\n       One of the worst Federal programs ever and a living \n     advertisement for why the Federal Government should never \n     administer a national health care program.\n\n  That shift of opinion on something as important as this leaves me \nasking whether they have analyzed, all these folks, the level of reform \nin this bill.\n  We need to step back and see the forest for the trees of what this \nlegislation does. I believe this legislation, even though it doesn't \nhave the public option I want--and there are a lot of other things it \ndoesn't do that could make the bill more effective--I believe when you \ntake the totality of this bill and measure it against the problems we \nhave in America today in delivery of health care and you look at the \nways in which this bill increases coverage for seniors, provides lower \ncost drugs for seniors, expands the number of people who will be able \nto afford health care, helps to promote any number of individual \nreforms, almost every single idea that is worth considering that has \nbeen put forward by any think tank or any group in America is in this \nlegislation in an effort to do what we call bending the cost curve--a \nterrible phrase, a Washington phrase.\n  It just means lower the cost increase in health care. Bring it down \nso it is reasonable with respect to what people can afford in relation \nto the rate of increase of inflation and other costs in our lives.\n  The Senate bill that is attracting all this trumped up, completely \ninapplicable but effective politics of destruction, this Senate bill, \nin fact, provides a provision that will allow the States to establish \nhealth care coverage for people between 133 percent and 200 percent of \npoverty. It allows States, not the Federal Government telling them what \nto do, no government from Washington, as everybody is trying to pretend \nthis does, it doesn't tell the States what to do, but it allows the \nStates to contract directly with plans that provide insurance. It \nallows those States to have the authority. This is States rights. This \nis the party that always talked about States rights. We are empowering \nGovernors, we are empowering States individually to have the right to \nnegotiate the premiums, the cost sharing, and the benefits for their \ncitizens.\n  Something else the Senate bill does. It provides $6 billion in \nstartup funding under the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, CO-OP \nprogram. This money fosters the creation of a new nonprofit member-run \nhealth insurance that offers coverage in the individual and small group \nmarkets. Those are the markets where the costs have gone up most \nrapidly and where Americans have the hardest time surviving.\n  I just came back from Boston. A fellow came up to me, an unemployed \npilot, at the airport and talked to me about the $1,100 a month he pays \nfor his family premium and how it was killing them. It goes up 20 \npercent a year. It is the market that is squeezing most Americans out. \nWe lower those costs. We dampen down that increase, and we make it more \naffordable for people who are at the lowest end of the income scale, \nwho deserve to buy insurance, deserve to have insurance. We make it \nmore accessible to them and affordable for them.\n  The press has reported that one of the options being considered in \nthe managers' amendment is the creation of the Office of Personnel \nManagement-administered plan. That is a plan administered by the \nFederal Government that would offer individuals an option to get a \nnational nonprofit plan. I would say to Keith Olbermann and Howard \nDean, take a look at this. Look at the OPM-managed and co-op-managed \nplans that actually provide a not-for-profit option at the Federal \nlevel.\n  When I ran for President, I proposed allowing everyone to have access \nto the same health care coverage offered to Federal employees and to \nMembers of Congress. Ask any American, do you think you should have \naccess to the same health insurance that the Members of Congress \ngive themselves? They will say yes. That is exactly what we do. We give \nAmericans the option of participating in a plan administered by the \nsame entity that administers the health insurance for Members of \nCongress. I think leveraging the role of OPM to encourage creation of a \nnational nonprofit plan is a key way to lower health care costs and to \nroll more Americans into plans that devote a higher premium portion of \ndollars to medical dollars.\n\n  Some of our progressive friends have also said we ought to kill this \nbill because it has an age-rated premium. They want us to kill this \nbill because it has an age-rated premium. I don't like age-rated \npremiums. It would be wonderful to get rid of them altogether. An age-\nrated premium is a premium, let's say for a lot of young people, \nbecause young people are healthier. When an insurance company looks at \nthe young person, they say the odds of that young person having high \nblood pressure, any number of other diseases that seniors tend to have \nmore because they are older, is less, therefore, we ought to charge \nthose people less and we are going to charge the seniors a whole bunch \nmore because they are much more likely to be a lot sicker, and it costs \nthe system more. That does make sense to some degree. But the whole \ntheory of insurance is to spread the risk of being sick among \neverybody.\n  Those young people are going to be old people one day--not a bad idea \nthat they are going to be able to pay an affordable premium for good \nhealth care when they are older too. So maybe there is a sharing across \nthe board. That is how you do your home insurance. That is how you do \ncar insurance. It is spread across the entire population of users and \nrisks that are within those user fields. Although there is some \nallocation, even in automobile insurance, we all understand, for age \nratings and the likelihood that if you are young and a new driver, you \nmay have\n\n[[Page S13449]]\n\nan accident, more prone, and we have some deferential there, as we do \nin this bill.\n  People who are criticizing this bill ought to stop and take a look at \nwhat it does. Insurance companies are going to be prohibited from \ndenying coverage or charging more because of a preexisting condition. \nHow many people in America complain: I can't get insurance. They turned \nme down because, once upon a time, I had this or I had cancer 4 years \nago, but now I am cured but they won't give me insurance because they \nthink it may come back and I am going to be sick later on. That is what \ninsurance is for. But companies have been allowed to say no. This bill \nwill prohibit companies from denying insurance to people because they \nhave a preexisting condition.\n  I introduced the Women's Health Insurance Fairness Act, which \nprevents insurers in the individual market from charging women higher \npremiums than men. That is what has been happening all this time. I am \nhappy to say that in this legislation, in our bill, we prohibit \ndiscrimination in those premium increases for women. Insurance \ncompanies will also be prohibited from dropping coverage once someone \nbecomes seriously ill, and they are going to be required to renew your \ncoverage each year. Why would Americans across the board not say: Wow, \nyou guys are going to protect me so I can't be kicked off. You are \ngoing to guarantee that I can buy it, even though I had a preexisting \ncondition. That sounds pretty reasonable to me.\n  Our colleagues don't come to the floor and talk about that. They just \nuse a lot of scare tactics, pretending they don't know what is in the \nbill. They know what is in this bill because we did it in the HELP \nCommittee, and we did it in the Finance Committee, and we have been \ndoing it for 11 months. So insurance companies are going to be \nprohibited from providing a lifetime cap or an unreasonable annual \nlimit on coverage. That sounds pretty reasonable to me.\n\n  Now, I also wish the bill would include an age rating so that \ninsurance could not charge older Americans more. I hope older Americans \nare listening to this carefully because the fact is, the Senate bill \nimposes a 3-to-1 limit on age rating, i.e. the rating charged seniors \nis restricted to three times the level of premium that is charged to a \nyoung person.\n  A lot of people are going to react: Oh my God, you mean I am going to \npay three times more than a young person? That doesn't sound fair to \nme. Guess what. When it began in the bill, it was 5 to 1. Under current \nstate, premiums can be 25 to 1. There are States that charge 25 to 1, \n20 to 1, 15 to 1. That is the way it is today. That is what seniors \nface today without this bill.\n  Guess what. In this bill, in the Finance Committee, we knocked it \ndown from 5 to 1 to 4 to 1, and then, in the merged bill, we knocked it \ndown to 3 to 1. In the House bill, it is 2 to 1. I ask a simple \nquestion: Is 3 to 1 or 2 to 1 better than 25 to 1 or 20 to 1? That is \nwhat is in this bill. This limits the age rating disparity in America. \nI offered an amendment to try to limit it to 2 to 1, but we were not \nable to carry that in the committee. Republicans spoke out against \nimposing a cap age rated premiums.\n  Charging older Americans nearly three times as much for health \ninsurance is by no means ideal. I know that. But, boy, when you look \naround the country, the majority of States have no rating structure in \nthe individual market at all, and there is a huge rate disparity, as I \ndescribed, in the small group market. So you have no rating restraints. \nSo we get down, at least, to 3 to 1. The House is at 2 to 1. Today, in \nmost places in America, there are no restraints, nothing--zero--for the \nindividual market, and there are high rating bands, as I said, of 20, \n25 percent for the small group market.\n  Let me give you an example for Kentucky. We have a couple Senators \nfrom Kentucky on the Republican side. The rate bands in the small group \nmarket in Kentucky are as high as 25 to 1. I guess that is OK with them \nbecause they do not want this bill.\n  In Utah, the rate bands in the small group market can be as high as \n34 to 1. I guess that is OK with them.\n  As I said, the 3 to 1 is too high, but, boy, is it a vast improvement \nover current law.\n  Some of our friends have said we should kill this bill because the \nexchanges are not strong enough. Well, I have been working on the \nexchanges with about 70 different groups in America ranging from \nseniors' representatives, union representatives, small business, and \nother representatives, all of whom are concerned about the exchanges \nbeing strong. I am pleased to say those who claim the exchanges in this \nSenate bill are not strong enough have not read the bill. You do not \nhave to get past the first 200 pages in this bill to see how the \nexchanges have been strengthened.\n  In the Finance Committee, I offered an amendment to allow State \nexchanges to engage in prudent, selective purchasing of insurance. \nUnder my proposal, exchanges would negotiate with plans for lower bids, \nencourage plans to form select networks, and exclude plans that did not \noffer good cost and good value.\n  The Senate bill we are looking at now provides exchanges with strong \nauthority to certify whether a plan can participate in the exchange \nbased on a number of criteria, including whether the plans meet certain \nmarketing requirements, whether it has broad provider networks, whether \nthey deliver quality benefits for the price. They can literally \nnegotiate for all of those things. You do not have that today. You just \nhave plans, and you have no control over what is in them.\n  So we actually create an exchange that can negotiate down the prices. \nAnd they have the power to approve the participation of plans if they \nare determined to be in the best interests of qualified individuals and \nqualified employers in the State.\n  I have advocated for these provisions because of a simple reason. In \nMassachusetts today we have this ability. We do this, and it has driven \ndown the premiums. In Massachusetts, we have something called the \nConnector. In fact, the exchange that is in this bill is significantly \nbased on the Connector in Massachusetts. In that, the Connector has the \nability to negotiate contracts for what is called Commonwealth Care, \nand it has placed pressure on the carriers to reduce the rates overall. \nWe have had this in place for 3 years now. The average premium \nincreases have been only 4.7 percent compared to 8 percent average \npremium increases for private insurance.\n  The language in the Senate bill is modeled after the strength of the \nexchanges in Massachusetts, and I believe it will ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent in a smart way. That is what this does. It guarantees \nyou can go negotiate for lower premiums, so you are driving down the \ncost to the taxpayers.\n  This bill also will ensure that all Americans have access to quality, \naffordable health care and will create the transformation within the \nhealth care system necessary to contain costs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has determined that it is fully paid for--fully paid for--and it \nis going to provide coverage to more than 94 percent of all Americans. \nEven as it does that, it stays under the $900 billion limit President \nObama established. It reduces the costs of health care in America, and \nit reduces the deficit over the next 10 years and beyond.\n  I cannot think of how few the times were over the course of 25 years \nwhere we had a piece of legislation that accomplished a social goal \nthat managed to simultaneously lower the deficit. That is an enormous \naccomplishment.\n  This bill includes immediate changes to the way health insurance \ncompanies do business to protect consumers from discriminatory \npractices, and it provides Americans with better preventive coverage--\nsomething we do not do enough of in America. We spend an amazing amount \nof time in our health care system just responding to symptoms, \naddressing disease, hospitalizing people with expensive procedures. A \nclassic example of that is diabetes because we do not screen people. \nBecause a lot of Americans do not have coverage, they do not get \nscreened at an early stage. Therefore, when they are discovered to have \ndiabetes, it becomes a far more acute treatment as a consequence of \nhaving gone all those years without the discovery. So you wind up with \nexpensive alternatives, such as the amputation of limbs, dialysis, \ninstead of having treated them earlier with oral intake of a pill or \nother treatments, diet, and other kinds of things that ultimately would \nsave billions.\n\n[[Page S13450]]\n\n  Well, this bill tries to encourage the embrace of better coverage for \nprevention and wellness. It empowers people in America. It does not \nsay, in Washington: You have to do this or that. It is not command and \ncontrol. It puts information at the disposal of Americans, so every \nAmerican can decide what they want, where they want to go get it, who \nwill treat them. That fundamental principle of American health care is \nabsolutely, totally preserved and sacrosanct in this bill. Every \nAmerican can choose their own doctor, choose their own plan. No one is \ntold to go do this or go do that.\n  Uninsured Americans with a preexisting condition can have access to \nan immediate insurance program and help them avoid medical bankruptcy. \nOne of the huge bankruptcy causes in America is health care. How many \nseniors have had the situation where they have had to spend down by \nselling their homes, selling--if they are lucky enough to have any \nstocks--whatever assets they have, sell the family farm, sell the small \nbusiness because they are very ill and they do not have the money, the \nkids do not have the money? But they hope to leave that money to their \nkids. They hope to leave something to their children. Instead, we just \nwipe it out because we do not provide a lot of those folks with the \ninsurance they deserve.\n  The new health insurance exchanges will make coverage affordable and \naccessible for individuals and small businesses. Premium tax credits \nand cost-sharing assistance is going to help people who need \nassistance. Insurance companies are going to be barred from \ndiscriminating based on preexisting conditions, health status, and \ngender.\n  The bill also improves the quality and efficiency of health care \nitself. As the Presiding Officer knows, we are strengthening the \nMedicare Program for America's seniors. I cannot believe the distortion \nthat has been taking place over the course of these last weeks, months. \nTime and again, someone on the other side of the aisle will come to the \nfloor and say this is attacking Medicare or this is going to tax the \nbenefits.\n  Well, we believe--we, the party that created Medicare; we, the party \nthat expanded Medicare; we, the party that has lifted a huge percentage \nof Americans out of poverty over the last 50, 60 years through \nMedicare--that it is a sacred trust, and we are going to keep it. This \nbill helps, in fact, to extend the life of Medicare. The cost of \ninaction is unacceptable for seniors and the Medicare Program that \nserves them. In fact, the Medicare hospital trust fund, as we know, is \nexpected to go broke in over 7 years. This bill makes Medicare \nstronger. It makes it more sustainable. It extends the solvency by 9 \nyears.\n  Medicare currently reimburses health care providers on the basis of \nthe volume of care they provide rather than the value of the care they \nprovide. For each test, scan, or procedure conducted, Medicare provides \na separate payment. So we do that regardless of whether that was \nnecessary or whether it had anything to do with the outcome for that \nparticular patient. That does not make a lot of sense. We do not pay \npeople to build our home the wrong way, or to build something we did \nnot ask for and charge us more, or a whole bunch of other kinds of \nexamples. But Medicare is doing that.\n  I think Americans deserve to get something better out of their \ntaxpayer dollar. This bill includes a number of proposals to move away \nfrom what we call the ``a la carte'' Medicare fee-for-service system so \nthat we begin to pay for quality and value, and that reduces costs to \nAmerica's seniors.\n  This bill promotes, as I said, preventive care and improves the \npublic health to help Americans live healthier lives and to help \nrestrain the growth of health care costs over time. It, importantly, \neliminates copays and deductibles for recommended preventive care, and \nit provides individuals with information they need to be able to make \ngood decisions about their health care and improves education on \ndisease prevention, public health, and invests in a national prevention \nand public health strategy. It does all of that. All of those things \njust put to shame the idea of just scrapping this legislation.\n  Currently, 65 million Americans live in communities where they cannot \naccess a primary care provider. An additional 16,500 practitioners are \nrequired to meet their needs. If you scrap this, that number is going \nto go up, and the number of millions--65 million today--of Americans \nwho do not have access to a primary care provider is going to go up.\n  This bill addresses the shortages in primary care in other areas of \npractice by making necessary investments in the Nation's health care \nworkforce.\n\n  Specifically, this bill will invest in the National Health Service \nCorps, scholarship and loan repayment programs. It will expand the \nhealth care workforce. The bill includes incentives for primary care \npractitioners and for providers to serve underserved areas.\n  Don't listen to me on the transformational changes. Listen to a \nfellow by the name of Jon Gruber, who is a very respected and renowned \neconomist from MIT, and here is what he writes:\n\n       The United States stands on the verge of the most \n     significant change to our health care system since the 1965 \n     introduction of Medicare. The bill that was passed by the \n     House and the parallel bill before the Senate would cover \n     most uninsured Americans, saving thousands of lives each year \n     and putting an end to our status as the only developed \n     country that places so many of its citizens at risk for \n     medical bankruptcy. Moreover, the bill would accomplish this \n     while reducing the Federal deficit over the next decade and \n     beyond. They would reform insurance markets, lower \n     administrative costs, increase people's insurance choices, \n     and provide ``insurance for the insured'' by disallowing \n     medical underwriting and the exclusion of preexisting \n     conditions. The Senate bill in particular would move us \n     closer to taming the uncontrolled increase in health care \n     spending that threatens to bankrupt our society.\n\n  That is what this bill does. That is what the Republicans are \nopposing.\n  These aren't minor things. These are things we have been striving to \naccomplish here for decades. I see colleagues who were here with me \nback when we struggled with the Clinton administration's effort on \nhealth care and every one of us would have been more than happy back \nthen to have accepted--right then and there, we would have accepted \nwhat we have here today. I will tell you something: We would have had \nRepublicans, such as Senator John Chafee, and I think Bob Packwood and \nothers at that time, who would have tried to get a compromise passed, \nnot totally dissimilar from the direction we are moving in here, and it \nwas totally rejected by the Clinton administration.\n  So now is the time to examine what we have promised our people and \ndecide where we stand. We know where the other side stands when they \nsay ``let's begin over,'' pretending to America there is some place to \nbegin over here. They have engaged in fear-mongering and deliberate \nmisinformation. Those have been the core of the arguments they have \nused, fundamentally, to stop the success of President Obama.\n  They are also continuing now, obviously, to use procedural tactics, \nchewing up the Senate's time. The week before Christmas: Boy, let's see \nif we can back this right up and make it look as bad as possible and \ntry to make the Congress look as bad as possible; make them fold. So \nthey use this idea, and they are willing to block the funding for our \ntroops so we can go on with this delay. We could have voted today, but \nthey have said no.\n  There is no reason to do this. I think there is a snow storm coming \nto Washington. I suspect they are hoping the snow will prevent some \nSenator from getting here and then they won't be able to vote, because \nnormal decency would have said, Hey, why don't we convenience everybody \nand have the vote before the snowstorm, but no. So they link it to \nblocking the money for the troops. I hate to think what some of those \ntroops think is going on here. It is embarrassing.\n  We have heard repeatedly from Republicans that our health care reform \nbill is going to drive insurance premiums sky high for families. That \nis what they say, but the Congressional Budget Office says the \nopposite. It says that the 134 million Americans who get their \ninsurance through their employer would end up paying 3 percent less for \ntheir premiums if we passed the reform measure before us. In addition, \nthe CBO says the subsidies included in the measure would result in a \n59-percent reduction in costs for nearly 18 million Americans who \npurchase their own insurance--a 59-percent reduction for a\n\n[[Page S13451]]\n\nlot of Americans out there who buy their insurance individually. You \ndon't think they want a 59-percent reduction? And despite the fact that \nthe CBO says there is a 59-percent reduction, they continually come out \nhere and tell people otherwise. Because one of the things we have \nlearned in American politics is that if you throw the mud out there, \nthrow the lie out there, throw the distortion out there enough, enough \npeople will hear it and they won't know the difference.\n  Health care reform has dramatically reduced the premiums in \nMassachusetts. Premiums fell by 40 percent. We are not here \nconjecturing as to what is going to happen. This isn't some pie-in-the-\nsky theory that if we do this, here is what is going to happen. We have \ndone it. In Massachusetts, we are insuring over 97 percent of all of \nour citizens, the highest level of insurance in the United States of \nAmerica. Guess what. The number of companies participating in the \nprogram has gone up since it was passed, and they like it. The premiums \nfell by 40 percent, from $8,537 at the end of 2006 to $5,143 in mid \n2009, while the rest of the Nation saw a 14-percent increase. So in \nMassachusetts, premiums go down for the individual market by 40 \npercent; the rest of the Nation they go up 14 percent. What do you \nthink most Americans would rather have, the 40-percent reduction or the \n14-percent increase? Our bill gives Americans the opportunity to \nexperience the same success we have enjoyed in Massachusetts.\n  We have also heard repeatedly from Republicans that this bill will \nadd billions of dollars to the Federal budget deficit, despite the fact \nthat the CBO analysis concludes that the bill is not going to add one \ndime to the Federal deficit--not one dime. From the very beginning of \nthis debate, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have tried \nto make the case that seniors' Medicare benefits--benefits--are \njeopardized by our reform measure. Well, it is patently false, but we \nkeep hearing it. It gets repeated again and again no matter how many \ntimes it has been shown to be false. The bill before us, in fact, does \nexactly the opposite. It actually adds benefits for seniors.\n  For example, there are new screening benefits. The bill shrinks the \nso-called doughnut hole in the Medicare prescription drug benefit. When \nwe passed the prescription drug benefit, millions of seniors had a \nlarge gap in coverage. In 2009 seniors will experience a $3,454 \ncoverage gap. Even though they must continue to pay their monthly \npremium, they will receive no assistance with their drugs costs between \n$2700 and $6,154. That is a lot of money out of pocket for seniors. \nWell, we have reached an agreement where now that will be closed, and \nno longer will those seniors be out of pocket for the costs of drugs in \nthe middle of that bracket.\n  In addition, the nonpartisan National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare sent a letter to every Senator a few days ago. \nThe Republicans and Democrats alike got this letter, but it hasn't \nstopped them from continuing to make the argument, but here is what the \nargument says: Not a single penny in the Senate bill will come out of \nthe pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare Program. In \nfact, the letter adds that our reforms: ``will positively impact \nmillions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate of increases and \nout-of-pocket costs and improving benefits, and it will extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 5 years.''\n  To me, and to I think all of my colleagues here on our side of the \naisle, that is a win-win for seniors, and it is a win-win for the \nMedicare Program.\n  Since sending that letter, the CMS actuary released a report saying \nthat the solvency of the Medicare trust fund would be extended by 9 \nyears as a result of the Senate bill. So it has been interesting to \nwatch Republicans speak about protecting Medicare, as I said earlier, a \nprogram that their party has opposed since the very beginning. While \nclaiming to be trying to protect Medicare, they have simultaneously \nwarned us many times about the evils of a government-run program. \nAgain, I would ask, if they are so opposed to a government-run program, \nwhy don't they come to the floor with an amendment or a proposal to do \naway with Medicare? They won't, of course, because Medicare prevents \nmillions of seniors from falling into poverty due to health care costs.\n  They also always promote the idea that competition is good for the \nmarketplace, yet they adamantly oppose adding an option that could help \nprovide some of that competition. President Obama said it clearly, that \na public plan would help keep the private plans honest. I couldn't \nagree more.\n\n  Like some of our friends, some of our progressive friends, the \nRepublicans have argued again and again about starting over. Let me \nremind my colleagues about one of the greatest legislators of the \nSenate's attitude about that, and one of the greatest champions of \nhealth care. Ted Kennedy fought for health care from the day he came \nhere. One of his early speeches on the Senate floor was about health \ncare. He often said that the biggest political mistake that he \npersonally made in the 46 years he legislated was turning down a health \ncare deal with Richard Nixon in 1971 that for the first time would have \nrequired all companies to provide a health plan for their employees, \nwith Federal subsidies for low-income workers. That is how far the \nRepublican Party has drifted from one of their own Presidents who, most \npeople would agree, despite what happened in terms of what cost him the \npresidency, that he was a strong and capable President with respect to \nsocial policy in America.\n  The fact is that for the first time, all companies would have been \nrequired to cover their employees. That is the plan Richard Nixon \noffered Ted Kennedy and Ted Kennedy made the mistake of turning it \ndown. He backed away from that deal under heavy pressure from fellow \nDemocrats who wanted to hold out for a single-payer system once the \nparty recaptured the White House in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\n  Well, 38 years have passed and single payer is still out of reach; \nnot even on the table. Some people want to give up what we have \navailable to us here and repeat that greatest mistake.\n  The lesson Teddy learned is this: that when it comes to historic \nbreakthroughs in America, especially in social policies, you make the \nbest deal you can and then immediately start pushing for ways to \nimprove the deal.\n  Let me share a quick story with my colleagues. We all remember how \nTed Kennedy on the floor of the Senate kept pushing and pushing to \nraise the minimum wage, which hadn't been raised in years. Finally, he \npushed so hard that Robert Dole, who was then the majority leader and \nwho was then running for President, decided he couldn't run for \nPresident while Ted Kennedy was pushing that hard, tying up the Senate, \nto get the legislation passed. It might raise people just a little bit; \nit wouldn't even get them up to par. Robert Dole resigned from the \nSenate to go run for President. He said, Ted Kennedy doesn't run the \nworld, but he did.\n  Trent Lott came in. Senator Lott from Mississippi became the majority \nleader. He vowed the same thing. He said: This isn't going to happen. \nWithin months, within months, Senator Kennedy was doing the same thing \nagain, pushing for the rise in the minimum wage. Senator Lott acceded \nto him. We got the minimum wage passed. And at a rally where he was \ncelebrating the rise of the minimum wage, which was then not even up to \npar, he was in the victory moment and he turned to Congressman George \nMiller and he said: I am introducing a bill to raise the minimum wage. \nGeorge Miller said, What do you mean? We haven't even let the dust \nsettle. He said, We have to move on this.\n  That is what is going to happen with this bill. We all know there are \nthings we are going to have to watch, there are things we are going to \nhave to do, things we are going to have to improve, things that aren't \nin it that we want to get in it. But to pass up the opportunity for all \nof the things I have talked about and listed would be an enormous--an \nenormous--mistake.\n  Since 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid were created, they have \ninvolved and improved over the years.\n  When Medicare first passed, it didn't cover individuals with \ndisabilities or individuals with end-stage renal disease. Now it does. \nSimilarly, Medicaid evolved to allow States to cover additional \nservices such as home- and community-based care. Now, both Medicare and \nMedicaid are indispensable elements of the social contract of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S13452]]\n\n  Our march to this point has been too long and too slow--almost a \ncentury, in fact. It began in 1912 when Teddy Roosevelt ran for \nPresident promising government protection against, as he put it, ``the \nhazards of sickness.'' There have been fits and starts ever since--\nthrough the shouting and distortions and big interests clinging to the \nstatus quo, and we cannot allow that to continue any longer.\n  We know the legislative process is a long one. But 97 years is way \ntoo long for America to finally join the other major industrialized \nnations in guaranteeing health care for all of our people. That we are \nhere today, with an opportunity to take a giant step, shows not only \nwhat a challenge this undertaking has been, but it shows what hard \nwork, skill, and dedication a lot of Senators have shown trying to get \nus here.\n  I particularly applaud the effort of Senator Reid, who personally has \nsacrificed the effort to help move this, and the entire leadership, \nincluding Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nSenator Dodd, of the HELP Committee, who was carrying that load for \nSenator Kennedy. Tom Harkin is now doing that job, and he and Barbara \nMikulski and Jeff Bingaman were central to shaping what is coming to \nthe floor.\n  Hundreds of Republican amendments were accepted during that process. \nSenator Baucus considered hundreds of amendments on the Republican \nside. The bill is not perfect. Tell me what bill is. All of us would \nlike to change it here and there, but none of us can credibly claim we \ndidn't get a chance to have input to this bill.\n  Make no mistake, this legislation, with cooperation and \nbipartisanship, can make history and improve the lives of Americans for \ndecades to come, and that is important to this country and to our \neconomy. It can help change who we are as a country. Ninety-four \npercent of Americans will have health care. Just think of that. If we \ndo nothing, things are only going to get worse--more expense, more \nbankruptcies, and more people without coverage.\n  I can't help but think how often we have private conversations around \nhere at the Prayer Breakfast, at the National Prayer Breakfast, at the \nSenate Prayer Breakfast, and in private conversations about what the \nduties and obligations are of good adherence to most of the organized \nreligions of the world and certainly most of the philosophies of the \nworld. They all embrace a component of the Golden Rule. You can go to \nany Scripture and you can read about one person's human responsibility \nto another human. These kinds of opportunities to live up to those \nguidelines, these values, don't come very often. Many of us here saw \nthat pass in 1993. We learned a lot of tough lessons then.\n  I say to my progressive friends in this country, after that, we did a \nlittle better with the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did \nbetter with portability and little pieces here and there. But still the \nsystem is out of whack and gets more expensive, and still more \nAmericans lose their health insurance. Still, we wind up with \ninstitutionalized unfairness.\n  I remind my colleagues of when Ted Kennedy worked on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. Do you know who the minority cosponsor was? \nIt was Orrin Hatch. He said that passing it was the mark of a \ncompassionate, caring Congress. We still have millions of kids who are \nnot covered by health insurance.\n  Compassion can be the mark of this Congress, if we act with respect, \ncourage, and with cooperation. I don't think we can stop now. I don't \nthink there is any object but to get this job done after all these \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts has been talking about the urgency and the importance of \nthis legislation, and he has done so masterfully. We have been debating \nhealth care for weeks. We have been debating it for months if you think \nabout the markup that took place in the HELP Committee, as well as in \nthe Senate Finance Committee. We have been debating it even more if you \nconsider the times of negotiation that took place between a group of \nsix Members of the Senate--three Democrats and three Republicans--in \nsearch of a bipartisan effort. So all of this talk that this is a rush \nto judgment doesn't square itself with the facts.\n  But there is another bill that is pending before the Senate, a bill \nthat should have passed without any difficulty.\n  Mr. President, the tactics of delay and obstruction we have seen on \nthis floor for the last few weeks on the part of the minority have now \nreached critical mass. We are fighting two wars. It is nice to be home. \nIt is nice to be home for the holidays. It is nice to be here in the \ncomfort of the Senate. It is nice to be able to see your family. But we \nare fighting two wars abroad. We have work to do for the American \npeople, and these continued unnecessary delays from the Republican side \nof the aisle are now impacting our military men and women on the ground \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. These delays come at a time when we are seeing \ngreater success in Iraq, a time when we are more focused on wiping out \nal-Qaida along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are engaged not in \ngoverning, not in the bipartisanship they claim to embrace, but in pure \npolitics--a political game that does not threaten the majority, does \nnot benefit the minority; what it does is threaten the health, safety, \nand in some cases the lives of military men and women in harm's way.\n  Never have so few been asked to sacrifice so much on behalf of their \ncountry. Never have a relatively small group of Americans in uniform, \nin harm's way, been asked to sacrifice so much, with multiple tours of \nduty, while the rest of America enjoys security at home because of \ntheir sacrifice. You would think that our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would want to join expeditiously to make sure that their pay, \ntheir health care, and the equipment they need would be there as \nquickly as possible.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have determined that their \nonly strategy is to bring the work of the Senate to a halt--to diminish \nthe effectiveness of the Senate they serve in an effort to diminish the \nmajority. It is a shame, but our Republican colleagues have come to \ntheir view as a political tactic, the road to electoral victory next \nyear in the midterm elections of 2010 and then preparing themselves \nalready for the Presidential election of 2012, wanting this President \nto fail and this Congress to fail. If you looked at it as a political \ntactic, you might say, well, as a political tactic it might make sense \nfor them.\n  It is a horrid political tactic because it is not about this \nPresident failing. It is not about this Congress failing. It is about \nthe failure for the country in one of its most precarious moments.\n  This President inherited the worst economy since the Great \nDepression, and I don't think people understand how close to the abyss \nwe were from facing a real depression once again in our history. \nFinancial institutions were collapsing, and we cared but not for the \nsake of them as big institutions but what they would have meant to the \neconomy as a whole. There was a free-fall in the housing market and the \nreality of two wars raging abroad, which he inherited, in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. There is a nuclear North Korea and nuclear-thirsty Iran, \nan energy policy that sends $1 trillion to countries that are despotic \nand wish us ill. Ultimately, we give them the money to act out on their \ndespotism. This is what this President inherited.\n  Instead of working with him, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have determined that the politics of failure will lead them to \nelectoral victory, and that is more important than the future of the \ncountry. They have come to the floor of the Senate to say no to \neverything--first, health care, and now to providing for our troops in \nharm's way. They have come armed with an arsenal of parliamentary \nmaneuvers--not to govern or do what is best for the American people, \nnot to do what is best for the Senate, but to do what is politically \nexpedient for them.\n  Diminishing the Senate's ability to pass the Defense appropriations \nas well as health care reform in order to score political points--and \nthen call it victory--is an insult to the American people. It flies in \nthe face of what our Founders intended of a true representative \ndemocracy--not to tear down the\n\n[[Page S13453]]\n\ninstitutions of government and bring them to a halt but to make them \nwork for the people.\n  Sam Rayburn once said:\n\n       A jackass can kick a barn door down, but it takes a \n     carpenter to build one.\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle seem intent on kicking the \nbarn door down. In my view, that is not victory. Doing nothing, \ndelaying, obfuscating, saying no, no to everything, blocking the \nability of this Chamber to fulfill its duty to the people is no \nvictory.\n  Saying no to funding our troops serving bravely overseas in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is hardly victory. Delaying it is hardly victory. Saying no \nto funding medical care for our military men and women and their \nfamilies is not a victory; it is shameful delay of needed care. Saying \nno to $120 million for traumatic brain injury and psychological health \nresearch at a time when so many of our troops are coming home from Iraq \nand Afghanistan with such injuries is by no means a victory. Saying no \nto necessary funding to train and equip Afghan security forces so they \ncan stand up for their own country and get our people out is contrary \nto the President's surge policy, which our friends on the other side \npublicly supported.\n  Imagine if the tables were turned and it were the Democrats delaying \nfunding for mine resistant vehicles to protect our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. What would our friends on the other side say then? Imagine \nif it were this side of the aisle delaying passage of $636 billion for \nthe military, including $128 billion in funding for contingency \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Imagine if it were this side of the \naisle delaying $154 billion to increase readiness and training of our \ntroops. Imagine if it were this side of the aisle delaying funding for \nBradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker Combat Vehicles, and three E-2D \nHawkeye aircraft. Imagine if it were this side of the aisle delaying \nall of this critical equipment. Imagine if Democrats were standing in \nthe way of funding military health care for service men and women and \ntheir children. This is all included in the Defense appropriations \nbill. But that is what our Republican friends on the other side are \ndoing. Imagine if the Democrats were holding up needed assistance in \nhealth coverage for Americans who lost their jobs and are unemployed in \nthis economy at this time of the year. That is included in the bill as \nwell. But that is what our friends on the other side are doing. What \nwould our colleagues on the other side say of our patriotism if we on \nthis side were delaying funding for our troops?\n  Patriotism doesn't shift with the political tides. It is not \nsomething used to advance a political agenda because if it is, it is \nnot patriotism.\n  We can disagree on the issues. We can disagree on substance. We can \nhold opposing views. That is what happens in a democracy. But there is \nno victory in diminishing the functions of government, the \nresponsibilities of government, the duties of this Chamber for \ncalculated political gain. There is no victory in holding up extending \ndesperately needed unemployment benefits included in this bill. There \nis no victory in blocking the extension of COBRA health insurance \nsubsidies in this bill for people who have lost their job, their health \ncare, and may be in danger of losing everything--everything--they have \nworked for, especially at this time of the year.\n  As I think about this time of the year, it is not a stretch to look \nat the delaying tactics of our friends on the other side of the aisle \non this legislation and think of that famous Christmas movie, ``A \nChristmas Carol,'' and think of Ebenezer Scrooge who, when asked for a \ncontribution to those who were in need, replied: What, are there no \npoor houses?\n  Our colleagues on the other side are holding so tightly to their \ntactics that they are forgetting the very democratic values they \nprofess so fiercely to protect.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to see victory not in delay \nand obstruction but in doing what is right for the American people. Do \nwhat is right for our military men and women who will spend this \nholiday season in Iraq and Afghanistan in harm's way.\n  I say if the tables were turned, my colleagues on the other side \nwould come to this floor, wave the flag, proclaim themselves the only \ntrue patriots and vilify this side of the aisle as un-American, \nunpatriotic, undemocratic.\n  The fact is, we are all patriots, and as patriots, though, we have a \njob to do. That job is to make sure our men and women have everything \nthey need, even when we disagree as to whether it is an appropriate \nengagement. Once they are engaged, it is our responsibility to ensure \nthey are appropriately taken care of.\n  The tactics of delay for political advantage can never--never--be \naccepted. I urge my colleagues: Do not play politics with the Defense \nappropriations that includes funding necessary to protect our men and \nwomen in uniform. Let's not play politics at the expense of unemployed \nAmericans in need in this economy at this time of the year. It is not \ntime for those debates. Those debates should be behind us. And it is \nnot time for the political tactics that, in essence, put people at \nrisk.\n  There are many other ways to try to achieve political victory. You \ncan do it with the power of your ideas, but you certainly do not have \nto do it by a political tactic that puts the country in jeopardy, that \nputs our men and women in jeopardy, that at the end of the day says we \nwould rather see failure than success so we can win an election. That \nis not acceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the momentum \npropelling us forward in the health care reform debate.\n  Today, one-sixth of our economy is consumed by health care. In the \nabsence of reform, the Congressional Budget Office projects total \nhealth care spending to consume an ever greater share of our economy, \nup to 30 percent by 2035. What should we expect in return for the \nstaggering amount of money our nation spends on health? Shouldn't one-\nsixth of our economy buy us health care for every American? I believe \nthat it can. Not only will the Senate health care reform proposal \nextend access to health insurance to 30 million Americans, but it will \nreduce health spending in the long run. This is vital to the future of \nour economy and our continued competitiveness in the international \ncommunity.\n  We may be at the global forefront of medical innovation, but we \nremain the only industrialized nation to not guarantee each of its \ncitizens access to basic health care. Americans are being priced out of \nour private health care market at alarming rates. Health care premiums \nhave risen 98 percent since 2000 and continue to rise four times faster \nthan wages. In South Dakota, where incomes are lower than in most other \nStates, families making $50,000 per year can expect to pay on average \n10 percent of their income for a policy on the individual market. And \nthis share will only grow if we fail to reform the system.\n  Families and small businesses are faltering under the weight of \nincreasing health care costs and medical bankruptcies. A 2005 study \nlinking medical bills to bankruptcy found that even brief lapses in \ncoverage, such as during a job change, expose individuals to \nsignificant risk. I have heard from far too many South Dakotans forced \ninto bankruptcy due to a health emergency. I would like to share one of \nthose specific stories with my colleagues. Mary had just started a job \nwhen she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her new policy required a 3-\nmonth waiting period before coverage began, but cancer treatment could \nnot be postponed. She frequently traveled over 50 miles to the nearest \nfacility for radiation, chemotherapy and follow-up appointments, but \noften went without necessary care because she could not afford it. Her \nbrief lapse in coverage left her with thousands of dollars in out-of-\npocket medical bills and, after 2 years of garnished wages, she was \nultimately forced into bankruptcy.\n  Her problems didn't end there. The aggressive radiation and \nchemotherapy treatment for her breast cancer has caused her other \nhealth problems. She now requires dental care to address her weakened \ntooth enamel, but can't afford to pay out-of-pocket and doesn't qualify \nfor low-income public programs. At one point, this woman was securely \nemployed and carried health insurance, but misfortune left her in \nfinancial ruin and with poor health. Like millions of underinsured \nAmericans,\n\n[[Page S13454]]\n\nshe discovered the inadequacies of our health care system the moment \nshe needed it most.\n  Most insured Americans have a false sense of security and don't \nrealize that many health insurance policies prove inadequate in the \nface of serious illness. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nholds health insurance companies accountable, creates competition and \nprovides assistance to those who need help buying insurance. As the end \nof the year approaches, we stand on the brink of passing historic \nlegislation. Never before have we been this close to reforming our \nhealth care system in such a positive way. I urge my colleagues to \nseize this opportunity to provide all American with the security of \nhealth insurance through all of life's transitions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we may be quickly approaching the end of \nthis health care debate in the Senate. It has been a partisan event. \nRepublican amendments have consistently failed roughly along party \nlines. However, I don't want to overlook some of my Democratic \ncolleagues who have voted with us on a number of the Republican offered \namendments. However, I want to focus my remarks on the half a trillion \ndollar increase in taxes this health care bill imposes on individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses. I would also like to focus my remarks on one \nof the 471 amendments filed to this bill highlighting the new taxes on \nassistive medical devices under this bill.\n  President Obama repeatedly promised during his campaign that no one \nmaking under $250,000 per year would see their taxes increase. However, \nthe Democrats plan to spend $2.5 trillion in new healthcare promises at \na time when the country can't afford the promises we have already made \nand we have a record 1-year budget deficit of $1.4 trillion. This \nhealth care reform bill, currently under consideration in the Senate, \nraises revenues to a large extent on the backs of middle class \nAmericans despite Obama's pledge--his firm pledge--that this would not \nhappen.\n  Reading through the legislation, I am struck by the myriad of ways \nthis bill raises taxes on American citizens, from job-creating small \nbusinesses to middle class families. I count about a dozen of them, \nadding up to about $500 billion in tax increases over the next few \nyears. Half a trillion dollars in new taxes. So everyone should get \nready to pay a higher health care bill and a higher tax bill should \nthis measure become law. I mentioned the tax increases in this \nlegislation last week, but I believe it bears repeating and I plan to \nspecifically point out a tax increase in this bill I find particularly \nobjectionable.\n  First let me remind the Senate and the American people that when the \nbill is fully enacted, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, \nJCT, found that, on average, individuals making over $50,000 and \nfamilies making over $75,000 would see their taxes go up in this bill. \nLet me repeat that: if you make over $50,000 as an individual or \n$75,000 as a family, your taxes are going up under this bill. Indeed, \naccording to the JCT 42 million middle class families and individuals, \nthose making less than $200,000, on average will pay higher taxes in \nthis bill.\n  If you have health insurance, you get taxed. According to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, new excise taxes applied to \nhealth insurance providers will end up taxing the beneficiaries. This \ntax also has the effect of increasing premiums as well. So you are \ndouble taxed on this deal. That is if you do have health insurance.\n  If you don't have health insurance, you get taxed. Under the bill, \nyou get taxed if you don't carry health insurance as a penalty. Where \ndoes this burden fall? You guessed it, middle class Americans. CBO has \nsaid that half of the Americans affected by this provision make between \n$22,800 and $68,400--for a family of four.\n  If you take prescription drugs, you get taxed. According to JCT and \nCBO, new taxes in this bill applied to the provision of prescription \ndrugs will end up raising the cost of those drugs. Taxed again.\n  So those are some examples of what you can do to pay higher taxes \nunder this bill: have health insurance, don't have it, take \nprescription drugs. All of these activities are taxed mercilessly under \nthis legislation. There is yet another tax provision that I find \nextremely detrimental and objectionable. If you happen to need a \nmedical device, you get taxed. Section 9009 imposes a new $2 billion a \nyear tax on assistive devices which includes items like pacemakers, \nventilators, prosthetics, hearing aids, glucose monitors for diabetics, \nand incubators for premature babies. It has no regard for the age or \nstatus of the individual requiring the device. It's totally \nindiscriminate. I have filed an amendment that will exempt assistive \ndevices for individuals with disabilities from this tax. It is \namendment No. 3053.\n  Let's look at some of the individuals impacted by this $2 billion a \nyear tax.\n  My son-in-law, Brad Swan, installs pacemakers and defibrillators. One \nmorning last week, at 1 a.m., he was called to an emergency involving \nan 8-year-old boy with no heartbeat. He was born with congenital heart \ndisease, had a pacemaker put in, and was healthy that morning. My older \nsister, Marilyn, faced a similar situation 9 years ago and is alive and \nhealthy today. Additionally, Dr. Stanley DeFehr, a cardiologist in my \nhometown of Tulsa, explained to me that ``the decision of who needs a \npacemaker could be complicated, particularly the decisions to put in a \npacemaker on someone we might consider quite elderly. But it's a false \neconomy to deny putting one in because of their risk of falling and \nbreaking a hip or shoulder. In the case where they fall, the costs \nbecome quite high. The cost of a pacemaker ($5,000, lasting 10 years) \npales in comparison to the cost of a stroke or multiple fractures.''\n  Let's look at the impact this tax will have on our servicemen and \nwomen.\n  We all remember when Congress passed the Wounded Warriors Act as part \nof the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Reauthorization Act, which \nrequired the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration to \njointly develop a comprehensive policy on improvements to care for our \nservicemembers. The bill created three Centers of Excellence in the \nprevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of \ntraumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and eye \ninjuries.\n  The very next year, I successfully amended the Wounded Warriors Act \nin the Fiscal Year 2009 National Defense Reauthorization Act to expand \nthe Center of Excellence care network in the Wounded Warriors Act to \ninclude amputations and traumatic extremity injuries. Eighty-two \npercent of injuries from the global war on terror involve the \nextremities, and are often severe, including multiple injuries to the \narms, legs, head and neck.\n  In fact, Congress has found, ``Extremity injuries are the number one \nbattlefield injury. Dynamic research and treatment is necessary to \nprovide servicemembers the greatest ability to recover from injuries \nsustained on the battlefield.'' When limbs cannot be saved, often these \ninjuries are treated with the use of state of the art prosthetic \ndevices enabling our service men and women in some part to regain the \nuse of arms or legs lost from combat injuries.\n  I have long supported the innovations in prosthetics and assistive \ndevices for our Nation's service men and women. Today, there are nearly \n2 million Americans with limb loss. Prosthetic technologies developed \nfor military medicine are almost universally dual-use, meaning the \ntechnology can be applied for civilian use as well. Much of this \nresearch is being done at the University of Oklahoma and by Oklahoma \ncompanies such as Hanger Prosthetics, Martin Bionics, and Sabolich \nProsthetics. Oklahoma has a long, proud history of excellence in \nprosthetic care. For the past twenty-five years, persons who have lost \nlimbs have traveled to Oklahoma from around the world to receive the \nfinest in prosthetic care. Only this past October, I visited the \nOklahoma City-based company, OrthoCare Innovations, which is developing \na robotic prosthetic alignment system which builds on its prosthetic \ninnovations.\n  The Democrat health bill includes a tax on all assistive devices. In \nfact, to add insult to injury, the Democrat health bill contemplates \nthe detrimental effect the bill may have on our veterans. Section 9011 \ncalls for a study on the impact of this tax on our veterans after the \nfact. However, a study after the damage is done is too little,\n\n[[Page S13455]]\n\ntoo late. This is simply irresponsible and damaging for those veterans \nwho need these devices.\n  The Democrat agenda and this bill clearly include more taxes on \nAmericans. The new taxes may be hidden but they are there. It is \ndisingenuous. It is costly. This bill is expected to cost $2.5 trillion \non top of our already exploding debt. This bill is exactly what America \ndoes not need, and that is why Americans oppose it. It is common sense.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about the \nFiscal Year 2010 Defense Appropriations Act which is currently pending \nbefore the Senate. I was one of the seven Members of the Senate to vote \nagainst our version of this bill in October and I regret that I must \nvote against it once again. This time it was also held to a time when \nthey thought Christmas would force fast action even on things that \ndon't belong on a defense bill that should have been last October.\n  Congress has gotten into a bad habit of using our military funding \nbills as ``must pass'' legislation to get approval for other unrelated \nitems. This year, the items are a number of extensions on legislation \nwe were not able to finish as part of our regular business. The \nmajority leadership wouldn't allow us to work together to get our job \ndone so some are using a troop bill as cover. There are 13 sections \nattached to this bill that have nothing to do with our troops.\n  Now folks might wonder why Congress attaches unrelated items to \nmilitary bills. Because doing what is right is a difficult stand to \ntake and say no to military funding. The majority party is hoping that \nenough Senators will want to avoid voting against military funding and \nbe willing to take the bad or the unknown with the good.\n  We are also now considering this defense bill not as a conference \nreport that has gone through our regular process, but as a message \nbetween the House and Senate in order to avoid normal Senate \nprocedures. The Senate has our rules and procedures for a reason. Our \nprocedures are designed to allow Senators the opportunity to fully \nconsider what legislation does and does not do. When Senate leaders \navoid Senate rules and procedures, they dodge their responsibility to \nthose who elected us.\n  I want to make very clear my strong support for the members of our \nArmed Forces and the vital work they are doing around the world every \nday. My State of Wyoming currently has about 900 soldiers deployed with \nour National Guard in Iraq and Kuwait our largest deployment ever.\n  I have the greatest admiration for all of them for their commitment \nto preserving our freedoms and maintaining our national security. They \nare all true heroes and they are the ones who are doing the heavy \nlifting and making great sacrifices in our country's name so that we \nmight continue to be the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n  I am extremely disappointed that our troops must continue to pay the \nprice for political posturing in a must-pass military funding bill \nloaded with unrelated and unquestioned provisions.Do our troops at home \nand deployed need the funding for the programs in this legislation? Do \nthey deserve better from their elected congressional representation \nthan being used as cover to enact unrelated legislation? The answer is \nyes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for 2010.\n  This legislation provides the funding our men and women in uniform \nneed to continue their efforts on behalf of our Nation. The $128.3 \nbillion included in this bill to fund operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is an important statement of support for the troops who are \nserving so bravely so far from home.\n  This bill also includes important measures that will help Michigan \nand other states weather the economic strain they now face.\n  Most important of these are provisions that will extend unemployment \nbenefits and Federal assistance to offset the costs of health insurance \nfor those who have lost their jobs. Existing unemployment benefits are \nexpected to expire at the end of this year. I am pleased that under \nthis bill, benefits will be extended to February 28, 2010, making many \nMichiganders and other Americans eligible for expanded benefits that \nprovide more support, and for a longer duration. This is crucial \nassistance to families coping with the devastation of job loss.\n  In addition, the bill extends from nine to 15 months the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act's assistance to workers who have \ninvoluntarily lost their jobs to pay for health coverage under COBRA. \nThat assistance pays up to 65 percent of workers' COBRA premiums. Under \ncurrent law, workers who lose their jobs after December 31 would not be \neligible for this assistance, but the bill extends that deadline to \nFebruary 28, 2010, ensuring that thousands of Americans will not have \nto deal with the loss of health care at the same time they face the \nloss of a job.\n  The legislation also would continue improvements in Small Business \nAdministration loan programs, improvements enacted in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act to make SBA loan guarantee programs more \nattractive to borrowers and lenders. Through February 28, 2010, the SBA \nwould be able to continue offering guarantees up to 90 percent of loan \namounts, and to continue waiving or reducing loan fees. Access to \ncapital is among the biggest factors keeping companies from hiring, and \ncontinuing these measures is an important step toward boosting \nemployment.\n  This bill also includes provisions to ensure that the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, has the funding required to meet \nincreasing demand, and to provide States with funding to process the \ngrowing number of applications for the program more quickly. And it \nwill maintain 2009 poverty guidelines for Health and Human Services \nprograms through February 28, 2010, preventing a loss of eligibility \nfor many recipients of means-tested programs, including Medicaid, SNAP \nand child nutrition programs. These provisions will prevent the opening \nof holes in our social safety net just as Americans are most in need of \nsupport.\n  These provisions are much needed to help blunt the impact of \nrecession on America's workers as we work toward a brighter economic \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/18/senate-section/article/S13455-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly as the Copenhagen \nconference on climate change approaches its final hours.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary of State Clinton announced on behalf of \nthe United States the intention to work with other governments to raise \n$100 billion in long-term financing by 2020 to help developing \ncountries address global climate change. This is an important \ncommitment and an essential part of any comprehensive approach to \nglobal warming. If the United States is to play a leading role in \naddressing climate change, we must provide not only strong policies and \nresources here at home in our factories and on our farms, but also help \npoor countries adapt to rising sea levels and temperatures which affect \nagricultural productivity, and to reduce their own emissions of the \ngreenhouse gases that affect every American as well as billions of \nothers across the globe.\n  The United States has been historically the major emitter of \nCO2, and we clearly have a responsibility to help address \nthis global problem. Those who suggest otherwise ignore history. But \nthis is a win-win situation: By exporting U.S. clean energy technology \nand expertise, we will also generate jobs here at home, help other \ncountries reduce their emissions in a transparent, verifiable and \naccountable manner, and help to avoid the worst effects of global \nwarming.\n  Other nations, particularly China and India, are also major \ncontributors to global warming. The administration is right to insist \nthat they be part of the solution and agree to verifiable limits on \ntheir own greenhouse gas emissions. It is encouraging that China is \nalready a major investor in renewable energy technology, but at the \nsame time is building coal-fired powerplants at an alarming rate.\n  For the past 8 years, the policy of the Bush administration was to \nignore this problem. In fact it was worse than that, as the last \nadministration actively sought to discredit the scientific evidence and \noppose any efforts both here and abroad to address global warming with \nanything more than lipservice.\n  Fortunately, times have changed. We have a President and a Congress \nthat are committed to developing a strategy to invest in clean energy, \nenergy efficiency and new high-tech infrastructure that will bring us \nto long-sought goals: energy independence, good jobs for our citizens, \nand a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. The recently \npassed fiscal year 2010 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs Appropriations Act provides more than $1.2 billion for \nclimate change and environment programs overseas. This is a significant \nincrease over last year. From exports of renewable energy technology to \nprograms to protect tropical forests, these funds will play a part in \nour bilateral and multilateral efforts to work collectively with other \ncountries.\n  This and Secretary Clinton's announcement are important steps, but \nthe relentless burning of fossil fuels and destruction of the world's \nremaining forests call for nothing less than unprecedented commitments \nto reverse these trends. There is already speculation that Copenhagen \nwill fall far short of what is needed. I am hopeful that before the \nconference concludes the Obama administration will demonstrate further \nthat the U.S. is going to do what is necessary so future generations \nwill not look back and ask why we failed when faced with this great \nchallenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/18/senate-section/article/S13456-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Private First Class Jaiciae L. Pauley\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of PFC Jaiciae L. Pauley. Jaiciae was 29 years old when he lost \nhis life on December 11, 2009, in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was assigned to the \n1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd \nInfantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA. Jaiciae died supporting Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Today, I join Jaiciae's family and friends in mourning his death. \nJaiciae will forever be remembered as a loving son and a friend to \nmany. Jaiciae is survived by his parents, Mr. Roger D. Pauley of \nMuncie, IN; his mother, Ms. Caitlin Ramshaw of Fort Pierce, FL; and a \ncommunity of his family and friends.\n  Jaiciae was an ambulance aide and driver. He joined the Army in 2008, \nand this was his first deployment.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in Jaiciae's service as a soldier and in his life as a son and \nfriend. Today and always, he will be remembered by family, friends and \nfellow Hoosiers as an American hero, and we cherish the memory of his \nservice and his life.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families of \nsoldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we search for \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Jaiciae's sacrifice and memory \nwill outlive the record of the words spoken here.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jaiciae L. Pauley in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and to \nfreedom, democracy and peace. I pray that Jaiciae's family can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jaiciae.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/18/senate-section/article/S13456-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2847) making \nappropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and \nScience, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2010, and for other purposes, with an amendment, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to section 1238(b)(3) of the \nFloyd D.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Udall of \n        Colorado):\n  S. 2907. A bill to establish a coordinated avalanche protection \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce in the \nSenate legislation that will help to reduce the Nation's yearly death \ntoll caused by snow and ice avalanches.\n  As a member of the Congressional Hazards Caucus, I am introducing \nlegislation, the Federal Land Avalanche Protection Act of 2009 to \ntackle the impacts of one of our Nation's natural hazards, avalanches. \nI am introducing this bill jointly with Senators Mark Begich and Mark \nUdall. It is identical to a measure introduced earlier this week in the \nHouse of Representatives by Alaska's Congressman Don Young, who was its \nprime sponsor when first introduced in May 2008 late in the 110th \nCongress.\n  The goal of the bill is to better protect people in avalanche zones \nnationwide and to reduce the growing potential for avalanches to damage \nproperties, as more and more building takes place on mountainsides and \nin valleys threatened by potential avalanches. Avalanches are a \ncontinuing problem in this country. Last year 49 avalanches in 10 \nStates and Canada caused 54 fatalities in North America, 28 in America. \nThe fall-winter-spring of 2008-2009, however, was not unusual.\n  In the 2007-2008 season, 36 Americans lost their lives as a result of \navalanches. Another 16 Canadians died that season in 43 reported \navalanches. In the 2002-03 season, 58 people in North America died as a \nresult of 55 reported avalanches. For the past decade 38 people have \ndied on average each year in North America from avalanches. Most occur \nin the western States of Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, \nAlaska, California, Oregon, Washington, but deaths certainly have \noccurred in eastern States such as Vermont and New Hampshire, as well.\n  Many think that avalanches are just a problem for backcountry skiers, \nhikers, or snowboarders. But as urbanization spreads the dangers caused \nby snow and ice buildups on steep slopes will grow and affect more \nurban populations, and especially more motorists traveling through \nmountain passes and along valley roads. So far this season, just in the \npast 2 months, 11 skiers and 1 ice climber have been caught in \navalanches in Montana, Utah, and Colorado. Fortunately only one death \nhas so far resulted. But this Nation needs to devote additional \nresources to warning and battling the impacts of avalanches because \nthere are things that we know how to do to improve forecasts, increase \nwarnings, and take advance actions to reduce the build up of snow loads \non steep slopes, thus lessening the danger of larger, deadly avalanches \nwhen snow packs release.\n  The bill I introduce today directs the Secretary of Agriculture, \nacting through the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, to establish an \navalanche protection program to: identify the potential for avalanches \non Federal lands and inform the public about the probability of \navalanches and their potential adverse effects; carry out ongoing \nresearch to improve avalanche forecasting; and reduce the risks of \navalanches and mitigate their effects.\n  The bill requires the Secretary to coordinate the program to ensure \nprotection for recreational users of public land under the Secretary of \nthe Interior's jurisdiction, using resources of\n\n[[Page S13460]]\n\nthe Forest Service's National Avalanche Center; to establish an \nadvisory committee to assist in program development and implementation; \nand with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Army, \nto establish a central depository for weapons, ammunition, and parts \nfor avalanche control purposes.\n  The measure also authorizes the Secretary to make grants to carry out \nprojects and activities to assist in the prevention, forecasting, \ndetection, and mitigation of avalanches; maintain essential \ntransportation, utilities, and communications; assist avalanche \nartillery users to ensure the availability of adequate supplies of \nartillery and explosives required for avalanche control in specified \nareas; and assist research and development activities for alternatives \nto minimize reliance on military weapons for avalanche control.\n  It directs the Secretary to give priority to projects carried out in \navalanche zones with a high frequency or severity of avalanches or in \nwhich deaths, injuries, or damage to public facilities and communities \nhave occurred. It requires the Administrator of the General Services \nAdministration to transfer specified property suitable for avalanche \ncontrol purposes to a user of surplus ordnance.\n  When first introduced last year for public and professional \nconsideration and comment the measure was strongly supported by Federal \navalanche officials.\n  Just in my home State of Alaska avalanches are a concern not just in \nthe backcountry at Hatcher Pass, north of Palmer, or for heli-skiing \nenthusiasts near Thompson Pass outside of Valdez or Johnson Pass on the \nKenai Peninsula, but in urban areas, such as the capital city of \nJuneau, or for motorists who daily drive the Seward Highway from \nGirdwood to Anchorage or through Turnagain Pass. While Alaska's three \nfatalities last year occurred in Thompson and Johnson Pass among \nrecreational skiers, the future is that we need to do more on Federal \nlands, and we need to do more to assist states to lessen the severity \nof avalanche dangers on State and private lands.\n  This bill would take logically, fiscally prudent steps, to doing just \nthat. I urge members to support its passage and modest funding for \nimplementation next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Corker, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2908. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Energy to publish a final rule that \nestablishes a uniform efficiency descriptor and accompanying test \nmethods for covered water heaters, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenator Corker that would establish a uniform energy efficiency \ndescriptor for all water heaters and improve the testing methods by \nwhich that descriptor is determined. Currently, water heaters are \nlumped into two categories under two federal statutes, based on \narbitrary gallon capacity and energy input ratings. ``Smaller'' water \nheaters are covered by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, \nNAECA, and must be rated using an energy factor or EF rating. \n``Larger'' water heaters are within the scope of the Energy Policy Act, \nEPACT, and must be rated using a thermal efficiency or TE rating. Not \nonly do the testing methods differ, but a manufacturer is forbidden to \nplace an EF rating on a TE-sized unit, and vice-versa.\n  The difference between energy factor and thermal efficiency was based \non the assumption that smaller units are exclusively for residential \nuses while larger units are exclusively for commercial purposes, so the \ncompeting rating methods would not cause any confusion or adverse \neffects. Due to advances in manufacturing technology over the past 15 \nyears, the assumptions underlying the earlier dividing line are no \nlonger accurate. In fact, both larger and smaller units made by leading \nU.S. manufacturers are used in residences without regard to which \nFederal law applies. Yet, Federal legislation continues to be written \nby taking this distinction into account.\n  This legislation would direct the Department of Energy, DOE, to work \nwith industry stakeholders to develop a uniform energy efficiency \ndescriptor that applies to all sizes of water heaters. It also would \ndevelop a test method to accurately determine that descriptor for all \ntypes of water heaters, including new, efficient, advanced \ntechnologies, like heat pump water heaters, hybrids, and others, that \nare not correctly rated under today's test methods.\n  This bill, which has the support of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, \nand Refrigeration Institute, AHRI, and the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, ACEEE, brings the DOE and affected industries \ntogether to focus on this effort. It is my hope that the water heating \nmanufacturing community can develop and implement the new test method \nand descriptor that will eliminate confusion and enable consumers and \nbusiness owners to make informed purchasing decisions on water heaters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 2913. A bill to establish a national mercury monitoring program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Carper, I am introducing the Comprehensive National \nMercury Monitoring Act. This bill will ensure the Environmental \nProtection Agency has accurate information about the extent of mercury \npollution in our nation as it works to enforce regulations about this \ntoxic chemical.\n  Mercury is a dangerous substance that can cause serious neuron-\ndevelopmental harm, especially to children and pregnant women. \nScientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, estimate that \nsome 630,000 infants are born each year with blood mercury levels \nhigher than what is considered safe.\n  Mercury is hazardous not only to people, but also to wildlife. As of \n2006, States issued 533 new fish advisories bringing the nationwide \ntotal advisories to 3,851. These advisories cover 38 percent of the \nNation's total lake acreage and 26 percent of the Nation's total river \nmiles. Almost 65 percent of the U.S. coastline, except Alaska, is under \nadvisory, including 92 percent of the Atlantic coast and 100 percent of \nthe Gulf coast.\n  Each new scientific study seems to find higher levels of mercury in \nmore ecosystems and in more species than we had previously thought. We \nmust have more comprehensive information and we must have it soon; \notherwise, we risk making misguided policy decisions.\n  For example, in 2005 the Environmental Protection Agency issued a new \nmercury regulation based on computer measurements that were not peer-\nreviewed and that were not verified with actual measurements. The \neffect of the regulation was to allow power plants to continue spewing \nunlimited amounts of mercury into our air until the year 2018. Many \nexperts, including the EPA Inspector General, sharply criticized the \nscience underlying that new regulation and recommended that EPA develop \nand implement a mercury monitoring plan. That was a major reason why I \nam introducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act.\n  Specifically, my mercury bill would establish mercury monitoring \nsites across the nation in order to measure mercury levels in the air, \nrain, soil, lakes and streams, as well as in plants and animals; \nauthorize about $30 million annually for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 \nfor the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Geological \nSurvey, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, and the National Park Service to \nperform scientific mercury measurements; and create a ``Mercury \nMonitoring Advisory Committee'' to advise the Administrator of the EPA \nin choosing the monitoring sites.\n  We must establish a more robust national mercury monitoring network \nto provide EPA the data it needs to make decisions that protect the \npeople and environment of Maine and the entire Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13461]]\n\n                                S. 2913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive National \n     Mercury Monitoring Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that\n       (1)(A) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n     ecological and public health concern;\n       (B) exposure to mercury occurs largely by consumption of \n     contaminated fish;\n       (C) children and women of childbearing age who consume \n     large quantities of fish are at high risk of adverse effects;\n       (D) it is estimated that more than 630,000 children born \n     each year in the United States are exposed to levels of \n     mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair \n     neurological development; and\n       (E) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n     found that 8 percent of women in the United States of \n     childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of \n     values determined to be safe by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency;\n       (2)(A) as of 2006, 3,080 fish consumption advisories due to \n     mercury contamination have been issued for 48 States, \n     including 23 statewide advisories for freshwater and 12 \n     statewide advisories for coastal waters;\n       (B) that is a 26 percent increase over the number of \n     advisories issued in 2004;\n       (C) those advisories represent more than 22,000 square \n     miles of lakes and 882,000 miles of rivers;\n       (D) however, fish and shellfish are an important source of \n     dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important \n     to the economy of the United States; and\n       (E) the extent of fish consumption advisories underscores \n     the extensive human and ecological health risk posed by \n     mercury pollution;\n       (3)(A) in many locations, the primary route for mercury \n     input to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions, \n     transport, and deposition;\n       (B) the cycling of mercury in the environment and resulting \n     accumulation in biota are not fully understood; and\n       (C) computer models and other assessment tools provide \n     varying effectiveness in predicting mercury concentrations in \n     fish, and no broad-scale data sets exist to test model \n     predictions;\n       (4)(A) on September 14 through 17, 2003, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency cosponsored a Society of Environmental \n     Toxicology and Chemistry workshop involving more than 30 \n     international experts to formulate a system to quantify and \n     document mercury changes in the various environment fields \n     resulting from anticipated reductions in mercury emissions in \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the resulting plan proposes a holistic, multimedia, \n     long-term mercury monitoring program that is documented in 2 \n     sources--\n       (i) on January 1, 2005, the article entitled ``Monitoring \n     the Response to Changing Mercury Deposition'' was published \n     in the journal Environmental Science and Technology; and\n       (ii) in 2008, the book entitled ``Ecosystem Responses to \n     Mercury Contamination: Indicators of Change'' was published \n     by CRC Press;\n       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, many \n     regulations limiting mercury emissions from different sources \n     have gone into effect or will be implemented, but ongoing \n     monitoring programs are not adequately measuring the \n     environmental benefits and effectiveness of mercury emission \n     controls;\n       (6) on May 15, 2006, the Office of Inspector General of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency issued a report entitled, \n     ``Monitoring Needed to Assess Impact of EPA's Clean Air \n     Mercury Rule (CAMR) on Potential Hotspots'' , Report No. \n     2006-P-0025, which states, in part--\n       (A) ``Without field data from an improved monitoring \n     network, EPA's ability to advance mercury science will be \n     limited and `utility-attributable hotspots' that pose health \n     risks may occur and go undetected''; and\n       (B) ``We recommend that the EPA develop and implement a \n     mercury monitoring plan to assess the impact of CAMR, if \n     adopted, on mercury deposition and fish tissue and evaluate \n     and refine mercury estimation tools and models'';\n       (7)(A) on January 1, 2007, the articles entitled \n     ``Biological Mercury Hotspots in the Northeastern U.S. and \n     Southeastern Canada'' and ``Contamination in Remote Forest \n     and Aquatic Ecosystems in the Northeastern U.S.: Sources, \n     Transformations and Management Options'' were published in \n     the journal BioScience; and\n       (B) the authors of the articles--\n       (i) identified 5 biological mercury hotspots and 9 areas of \n     concern in the northeastern United States and southeastern \n     Canada associated primarily with atmospheric mercury \n     emissions and deposition;\n       (ii) located an area of particularly high mercury \n     deposition adjacent to a coal-fired utility in southern New \n     Hampshire; and\n       (iii) concluded that local impacts from mercury emissions \n     should be closely monitored in order to assess the impact of \n     Federal and State policies; and\n       (8)(A) building on previous efforts in 2003, on May 5 \n     through 7, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     coconvened a workshop with experts from the United States \n     Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     the National Park Service, State and tribal agencies, the \n     BioDiversity Research Institute, the National Atmospheric \n     Deposition Program, industry, and other institutions;\n       (B) more than 50 workshop scientists participated and \n     agreed on a goal and major design elements for a national \n     mercury monitoring program, including a national distribution \n     of approximately 20 intensive sites to understand the \n     sources, consequences, and trends in United States mercury \n     pollution;\n       (C) the consortium found that ``policy makers, scientists \n     and the public need a comprehensive and integrated mercury \n     monitoring network to accurately quantify regional and \n     national changes in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem \n     contamination, and bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and \n     wildlife in response to changes in mercury emissions.''; and\n       (D) the workshop findings are published in a report of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (430-K-09-001).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 24. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the Department of Labor relating to financial disclosure \nand transparency by labor union management; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of \nLabor-Management Standards, OLMS, is responsible for ensuring that \nlabor unions follow basic standards of fiscal responsibility. OLMS \ncollects annual financial disclosure reports, LM-2, from labor \norganizations with annual receipts of $250,000 or more. Union members \nwho work hard to pay their dues deserve to know how their money has \nbeen spent. So, these annual financial disclosure reports provide rank-\nand-file members with an essential tool for exercising union democracy: \ninformation about important financial decisions made by their union \nleadership. Consequently, it is vital that OLMS have the necessary \ntools to monitor union compliance with the law as well as to deter \ncorruption. Yet, on average, over ONE third of all unions fail to \ncomply with existing requirements to file annual financial disclosure \nreports on time.\n\n[[Page S13463]]\n\n  In fact, between 2001 and 2008, OLMS reported that its investigations \nyielded a total of 1,004 indictments with 929 convictions and court-\nordered restitution of more than $93 million dollars. For example, \naccording to statistics reported by the Office of Management and \nBudget, OMB, the OLMS audits turned up criminal violations in about \n11.5 percent of audits and nearly 8 percent of unions showed some \nfraudulent activity in 2008 alone. Between January 1 and October 19, \n2009, OLMS reported obtaining indictments, convictions and sentences in \nembezzlement cases that total nearly $3 million in theft from union \nfunds.\n  in order to provide a better method for collecting information about \nunion finances, the Department of Labor proposed modifying the LM-2 \nform. After a lengthy rulemaking process, the Department issued a final \nrule on January 21, 2009, which required additional information about \nthe receipt and disbursement of labor organization funds, and \nestablished standards and procedures for revoking, where appropriate, a \nlabor organization's simplified filing privilege. But politics got in \nthe way of transparency and good government. And on October 13, 2009, \nthe Department announced a final decision to rescind these regulations.\n  This is outrageous. No one is talking about protecting rank-and-file \nmembers' ability to hold their leadership accountable. Instead, the \nSecretary of Labor has bowed to pressure and complaints from labor \nunions. The unions argued that requiring labor organizations with \nreported annual receipts over $250,000 to file more detailed disclosure \nreports was unnecessarily burdensome and imposed additional \nadministrative costs on their organizations.\n  Rigorous disclosure requirements promote union transparency and \naccountability of union leaders to their rank-and-file members. The \nannual financial reports ensure that workers' dues are used \nlegitimately and can also help workers and oversight investigators \ndetect fraudulent or criminal activity. Bringing corrupt union \nofficials to justice and recovering millions of dollars in hard-earned \ndues would not be possible if unions were not required to file annual \nfinancial disclosure reports.\n  For this reason, I am introducing a Congressional Review Act \nresolution disapproving the Department of Labor's October 13 decision \nto rescind the LM-2 rule. My resolution, which is cosponsored by 17 of \nmy colleagues, would have the effect of reinstating the original LM-2 \nrule published in January 2009 and would ensure that OLMS continues to \nprotect the rights of rank-and-file union members against corrupt union \nleaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/18/senate-section/article/S13463-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 380--DESIGNATING JANUARY 2010 AS ``NATIONAL MENTORING \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Specter, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Burr, Ms. Collins, \nMs. Murkowski, and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 380\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for those \n     serving as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 4,700 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in solid mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas in spite of the progress made to increase \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2010 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will help call attention to the critical \n     role mentors play in helping young people realize their \n     potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most significantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more people to \n     become mentors and help close the mentoring gap in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2010 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors and encourages more adults and \n     students to volunteer as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of, and volunteer \n     involvement with, youth mentoring.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join many of my \ncolleagues in introducing a resolution designating January 2010 as \nNational Mentoring Month.\n  We all agree that young people need a supportive environment based on \nstructured and trusting relationships with adults. The world is more \ncomplicated for children today than it ever was when I was growing up. \nMentors can help young people through the difficult periods, help them \nsee the difference between right and wrong, alleviate their doubts and \nconcerns, and answer their questions frankly. Mentors can dramatically \nimpact a young person's life by providing the support and encouragement \nthat children need in order to grow into responsible, caring adults.\n  This resolution recognizes the value of volunteering time to make a \ndifference in the life of a child. A growing body of research has shown \nthat high-quality programs can make all the difference and help \nstudents in need achieve the type of future they might never have \nthought possible. Children with mentors are shown to improve in school \nperformance and attendance. Also, they are more self-confident, have \ngood social skills, and above all else, they are motivated to reach \ntheir full potential. Unfortunately, a severe shortage of volunteers \nhas left over 15 million young people without mentors.\n  National Mentoring Month highlights the needs and goals of mentoring \nin this country and honors the contributions of the many volunteers \nacross the country that are currently connecting with youth in such \nprograms. Next month, non-profit organizations, schools, businesses, \nfaith communities, and Government agencies--led by the National \nMentoring Partnership and the Harvard School of Public Health--will \njoin together to encourage adults to serve as mentors for our young \npeople. Programs must be expanded to recruit more volunteers to help \nfill the mentoring gap. Mentoring has successfully helped many children \nin this country and we must work together to expand such valuable \nprograms. I urge the Senate to approve this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/18/senate-section/article/S13463-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13463-S13464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 381--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 1 THROUGH \n        FEBRUARY 5, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 1377 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1377) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to expand veteran eligibility for reimbursements by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs for emergency treatment \n     furnished in a non-Department facility, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I urge our colleagues to pass \nlegislation that would rightfully correct a deficiency in the law \ngoverning emergency health care treatment for veterans.\n  H.R. 1377, which passed the House in March of this year, would expand \nveteran eligibility for reimbursement for emergency treatment furnished \nin a non-Department facility. H.R. 1377 is a companion bill to \nprovisions contained in S. 1963, the Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus \nHealth Services Act of 2009, which passed the Senate just a few weeks \nago.\n  Under current law, originally enacted on November 30, 1999, a veteran \nwho is enrolled in VA's health care system can be reimbursed for \nemergency treatment received at a non-VA hospital. However, the statute \nonly permits such VA reimbursement if the veteran has no other outside \nhealth insurance, no matter how limited that other coverage might be. \nThis means that a veteran who has any insurance is not entitled to \nreimbursement from VA for emergency medical treatment received at a \nnon-VA facility. This holds true even if the veteran's insurance policy \ndoes not cover the full amount owed.\n  In discussing the importance of this legislation, I mention one \nparticular story that came to the committee's attention. A disabled \nVietnam veteran from Illinois was in a serious motorcycle accident \nwhich led to emergency medical bills totaling over $100,000. This \nveteran had state mandated motorcycle insurance, but it only covered \n$10,000 in expenses. Because under current law veterans are personally \nresponsible for any difference between whatever coverage they have and \nthe costs of their emergency care, VA was prohibited from paying for \nthis veteran's care.\n  H.R. 1377 would modify current law so that a veteran who has outside \ninsurance would be eligible for reimbursement in the event that the \noutside insurance does not cover the full amount of the emergency care. \nVA would be authorized to cover the difference between the amount the \nveteran's insurance will pay and the total cost of care. In essence, VA \nwould become the payer of last resort in such cases. This would keep \nthe veteran from being burdened by medical fees with no insurance with \nwhich to pay them. Additionally, this bill would also allow the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to retroactively apply this law to \nemergency treatment received between the effective date of the current \nlaw and the date of enactment of the legislation, thereby ensuring \nassistance to as many veterans as possible.\n  Mr. President, I urge passage of H.R. 1377 to rightfully fill this \nhole in veterans' health care.\n\n[[Page S13469]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
