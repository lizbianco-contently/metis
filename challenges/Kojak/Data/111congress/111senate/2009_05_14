I hope we \ndon't have to work into Saturday. But we have to do this credit card \nlegislation, the financial fraud. We have been in contact with \nRepublicans. They will have a number of amendments. They want it to \ncome back from the House. There will be some amendments in order. I \nhave spoken to the Republican leader on that, and they are going to try \nto get us those amendments as quickly as possible.

Madam President, last night we learned that the \nsupplemental war spending bill the Senate will take up contains $80 \nmillion to be used for closing Guantanamo. But the language of the bill \nacknowledges what Republicans have been saying for months: The \nadministration has no plan to safely close this secure detention \nfacility.\n  Closing Guantanamo without a safe alternative would be irresponsible,\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\ndangerous, and unacceptable to the American people. Americans are \nworried that closing Guantanamo by an arbitrary deadline won't keep \nthem as safe as Guantanamo has. They are particularly worried about the \nadministration's reported plan to transfer some detainees to detention \nfacilities right here on American soil. State and local officials in \nplaces such as Louisiana, California, Virginia, and Missouri have been \nintroducing resolutions to keep terrorists from coming to their \ncommunities.\n  One look at the experience that Alexandria, right across the river \nhere, had a few years ago during the trial of 9/11 conspirator \nZacharias Moussaoui makes it easier to see why all these communities \nare so concerned. Moussaoui was just one terrorist. Yet the effect his \npresence had on the city of Alexandria was enough for the city's \ncurrent mayor to state emphatically that he is absolutely opposed to \nrelocating prisoners from Guantanamo to Alexandria. ``We had this \nexperience,'' he said recently. ``Let someone else have it.''\n  According to press accounts, housing Moussaoui turned parts of \nAlexandria into a virtual encampment. Every time he was moved to the \ncourthouse, he was transferred in a heavily armed convoy that shut down \ntraffic and locked down the surrounding community.\n  One security expert recently told the Washington Post that housing \ndetainees from Guantanamo would likely be even more complicated than it \nwas for Moussaoui, with more locations for security personnel to cover \nand even more snipers.\n  According to the same Post article, one of Moussaoui's lawyers said \nthat bringing just two or three Guantanamo detainees to Alexandria \nwould be a ``major headache.'' Alexandria's sheriff has warned that \nmultiple detainees could ``overwhelm the system.''\n  Based on the Moussaoui experience, local business owners in \nAlexandria also think the arrival of detainees from Guantanamo could be \na serious drag on commerce. But even more worrisome for residents is \nthe concern that housing detainees in Alexandria could invite terrorist \nattacks.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post article I am \nreferring to entitled ``Security Worries in the Suburbs, Possible Move \nof Terrorist Suspects to Alexandria for Trial Raises Outcry'' printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2009]\n\n                    Security Worries in the Suburbs\n\n                           (By Jerry Markon)\n\n       An outcry is growing in Alexandria over a prospect no one \n     seems to like: terrorist suspects in the suburbs.\n       The historic, vibrant community less than 10 miles from the \n     White House markets itself as a ``federal friendly zone.'' \n     But it has turned decidedly unfriendly to news that the Obama \n     administration might move some detainees from their highly \n     controlled military fortress at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to \n     Alexandria to stand trial at the federal courthouse.\n       ``We would be absolutely opposed to relocating Guantanamo \n     prisoners to Alexandria,'' Mayor William D. Euille (D) said. \n     ``We would do everything in our power to lobby the president, \n     the governor, the Congress and everyone else to stop it. \n     We've had this experience, and it was unpleasant. Let someone \n     else have it.''\n       The 2006 death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was \n     convicted of conspiring in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, \n     2001, turned the neighborhood into a virtual encampment, with \n     heavily armed agents, rooftop snipers, bomb-sniffing dogs, \n     blocked streets, identification checks and a fleet of \n     television satellite trucks.\n       President Obama has vowed to close Guantanamo by January, \n     and the government is reviewing files on the roughly 240 \n     detainees. The administration has strongly indicated that \n     some will be transferred to federal courts, and a senior \n     Justice Department official recently named Alexandria, along \n     with Manhattan, as possible destinations.\n       Alexandria Sheriff Dana A. Lawhorne, who operates the city \n     jail, said federal security requirements for housing suspects \n     could ``overwhelm the system'' if multiple detainees are \n     brought there.\n       City officials and some legislators are concerned that \n     terror trials would take years, shut down roads and cost \n     millions and could invite attacks from terrorist \n     sympathizers. Business owners in the dense area around the \n     courthouse--newly filled with hotels, restaurants and luxury \n     apartments--fear disruptions amid a declining economy.\n       Local officials acknowledged that they cannot control the \n     docket at the federal courthouse and said they would work \n     with the Justice Department to minimize problems. But the \n     resistance in Alexandria, one of the few places known for \n     handling high-level terrorism and national security cases, \n     illustrates some of the practical complexities facing the \n     president's plan to shutter the controversial detention \n     facility.\n       The Guantanamo detainees include the five accused planners \n     of Sept. 11, among them former al-Qaeda operations chief \n     Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Putting detainees on trial in \n     Alexandria would mean moving them from an isolated island \n     prison 90 miles from Florida to a neighborhood brimming with \n     residents, thousands of federal employees and the new Westin \n     Alexandria Hotel 190 feet from the courthouse door.\n       ``It would be a disaster,'' said Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-\n     Va.), who co-sponsored legislation to ban the use of federal \n     funds to transfer detainees to Virginia detention facilities, \n     one of at least 10 similar bills filed by Republicans \n     nationwide. In a March 13 letter to Attorney General Eric H. \n     Holder Jr., Wolf questioned how officials would protect the \n     community.\n       Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said the \n     administration is reviewing how to handle Guantanamo \n     detainees. ``It's far too early to speculate on the final \n     disposition of any particular detainee at this time, much \n     less begin speculating about potential judicial districts for \n     prosecution,'' he said. He declined to comment on Wolf s \n     letter.\n       Matt Branigan, president of Fairfax-based Watermark Risk \n     Management International, said that the security could cost \n     millions and that a courthouse in a less-populated area would \n     be safer than Alexandria.\n       ``The concern is that someone from the terrorist side of \n     things would want to make some statement in conjunction with \n     the trials,'' said Branigan, a former senior Air Force anti-\n     terrorism officer. He said the new development in the area \n     ``makes the security plan much more complicated. You have \n     more locations to cover, more roofs to lock down with \n     snipers.''\n       When the Alexandria jail, an eight-story red-brick building \n     adjacent to the Capital Beltway near the Woodrow Wilson \n     Bridge, opened in 1987, the area had been a city dump.\n       ``The idea wasn't that you were going to house \n     terrorists,'' Lawhorne said. ``It was a local jail.''\n       The 10-story federal courthouse opened a few blocks away in \n     1996 in what had been a field of mud. The chief judge brought \n     bag lunches to work because there were so few restaurants \n     nearby.\n       Major terror trials were held in Manhattan in those days, \n     but Alexandria became the Bush administration's courthouse of \n     choice after hijacked airplanes slammed into the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon. Northern Virginia jurors and judges \n     were considered more conservative, and officials thought the \n     area was more secure.\n       By early 2002, about a dozen terrorist suspects were held \n     at the jail, which by contract accepts up to 150 federal \n     inmates, and more if it can. Moussaoui, who spent 23 hours a \n     day inside his 80-square-foot cell, was constantly monitored \n     and never saw other inmates. An entire unit of six cells and \n     a common area was set aside just for him.\n       ``It was a real hassle,'' said Alan Yamamoto, one of his \n     lawyers. ``Bringing even two or three or four people over \n     there is going to be a major headache.''\n       Lawhorne said he would discuss any requests to hold \n     Guantanamo inmates with city officials.\n       ``It would be a very extremely high-risk situation for us. \n     . . . My first obligation is to protect the interests of the \n     city,'' said the sheriff, who added that he would do what he \n     can: ``You can't run the other way when your country calls.''\n       The 450-inmate jail was locked down every time Moussaoui \n     was moved to the back of the nearby courthouse in a heavily \n     armed convoy. Traffic was stopped as snipers watched from \n     rooftops. The route from the jail is much denser today.\n       On a single block behind the courthouse, there is a luxury \n     326-unit apartment complex with a Fed Ex/Kinko's, cleaners \n     and cafe on the first floor; an office building with room for \n     ground floor retail; another office building; and a Marriott \n     Residence Inn. All opened within the past 18 months.\n       Pramod Raheja, owner of Intelligent Office on the ground \n     floor of one building, said he would ``strongly oppose'' \n     bringing Guantanamo detainees to the neighborhood.\n       Directly in front of the courthouse, in a thriving \n     community near Old Town known as Carlyle, the Westin anchors \n     a virtually all-new block with a coffee bar, an upscale \n     restaurant, a condominium complex with units costing more \n     than $1 million and a Thai restaurant. A Starbucks is opening \n     this month. The new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office complex, \n     with more than 7,000 employees, starts on the next block.\n       ``I've never agreed with people who say `not in my back \n     yard,' but there are just too many people around here,'' said \n     Jim Boulton, president of the unit owners association at the \n     Caryle Towers condominium complex, which has been trying to \n     get the government to remove security barriers left over from \n     the Moussaoui trial. ``They need to find someplace else.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The problems that one terrorist caused for Alexandria \ncould be duplicated in any city or town to which detainees from \nGuantanamo\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nare sent. Although the administration hasn't given us any details on \nwhich cities or towns they might choose, we can imagine what they could \nlook forward to, based on Alexandria's experience with Moussaoui. So \nhere is what a community would have to experience: heavily armed agents \npatrolling local neighborhoods, rooftop snipers, streets locked down \nand access to local businesses cut off, identification checks and bomb-\nsmelling dogs checking cars, millions of dollars in cost and strained \nlocal resources. That is what you get when you have a terrorist in your \nhometown. Kentuckians don't want to live under these conditions. I \ndoubt any other American would either, especially if we consider that \nany community that becomes a home to these detainees could have to \nendure these conditions for literally years, given the possible length \nof terror trials.\n  Some of the other locations that have been mentioned as possible \ndestinations for the terrorists at Guantanamo include facilities in \nSouth Carolina and Kansas. One local official in South Carolina \nresponded to the possibility by saying he didn't have the police \nresources to deal with an influx of terrorists from Guantanamo. An \nofficial in Kansas said Guantanamo detainees would significantly tax \nhis police resources.\n  The administration claims that closing Guantanamo and transferring \nsome detainees to U.S. soil would make the American people safer. It is \nhard to understand that statement. But based on the experience of \nAlexandria, it is easy to see why many Americans are skeptical. The \nadministration has said that when it comes to Guantanamo, its highest \npriority is the safety of the American people. But safety is our top \nconcern. The administration should rethink its plan to transfer \nterrorists to American communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5461-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to address an issue that is \nfront and center for us. It is the Guantanamo Bay detainees. Tomorrow I \nwill be leading a congressional delegation to Guantanamo to look at the \nfacility there. We will bring this issue up--it will be up next week in \nthe supplemental appropriations bill--the effort of the administration \nto close Guantanamo Bay, which most of the American public do not \nsupport. I realize it is quite popular in Europe to close Guantanamo \nBay. I would hope we would start to get a more factual setting on this \nissue.\n  I would also hope, and I would invite the administration to engage \nall of us here in the Senate--certainly I am willing to be engaged--\nabout what we can do with the detainees. They need to be treated \nhumanely. They need to be treated appropriately under international \nconventions. They do not need to be brought to the United States.\n  We do not have a facility in the United States to be able to hold \nthese detainees in a way and in a situation that would be safe for the \npeople of the United States. We are not prepared to release these \ndetainees because we have found so many of them back on the battlefield \nafter they have been released. So there is a quagmire that exists as a \nresult of the administration's efforts to close Guantanamo Bay to \nplease foreign detractors who I don't believe will be pleased, even if \nthe facility is closed. They will complain about the next facility. I \nwould invite them to work with us--the administration to work with us--\nto come up with an acceptable solution to this difficult problem. I \nstand ready and willing to do that.\n  To borrow a phrase from Winston Churchill, the administration's \ndetainee policies seem to me to be a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside \nan enigma. The administration started with a confident announcement \nthat military commissions would end and Guantanamo's detainee facility \nwould be closed. But according to a report in Saturday's Washington \nPost, the administration is preparing to restart military commissions.\n  That same report, however, also cited an unnamed lawyer who said that \nthe new commissions would be held on American soil, probably at \nmilitary bases. Such a move would be a first step toward permanent \ntransfer of detainees to the United States. Apparently, detainees would \nbe moved to the United States whether or not the new commissions would \nbe able to prevent the release of terrorists in the United States. Such \na policy is truly an enigma.\n  I have not been briefed on these plans, and it is disappointing that \nunnamed lawyers apparently know more about the administration's plan \nthan Members of Congress. The administration is famous for its \nwillingness to talk with its opponents and have meaningful dialog on \ntough issues. I hope that desire to talk extends to detainee policy \nmatters.\n  Detainee policy is too complicated and controversial to make \ndecisions behind closed doors and have them be made by one party alone. \nIt needs to be a bipartisan approach. As I said in January, when the \nadministration announced its plans to close Guantanamo Bay, I believed \npolicy changes must be made openly and transparently and in a \nbipartisan fashion to be credible. So far we have had riddles, \nmysteries, and enigmas, but no clear sense of direction. Now the \nAmerican people are skeptical of what is going to happen.\n  A poll last month showed that just 36 percent of Americans agree with \nthe administration's decision to close Guantanamo Bay. I am sure that \nnumber would be higher in Europe, but we don't represent the European \npeople. Seventy-six percent oppose releasing detainees in the United \nStates. Two weeks ago, Secretary of Defense Gates told the \nAppropriations Committee that he expects that every Member of Congress \nwould oppose detainees being moved to his or her district or State. In \nfact, I learned in a written response from Secretary Gates yesterday \nthat DOD will make no attempt to discuss detainee transfers with State \nand local officials until a final decision about where to put detainees \nis reached. As I said, the number was 66 percent opposing releasing \ndetainees into the United States.\n  If my constituents in Leavenworth, KS, are any indication of the \nlevel of American concern over the administration's mysterious plans, \nSecretary Gates is right to be wary about negative reactions to \ndetainees in the United States. Folks in Leavenworth are quite \ncomfortable with tough criminals living in nearby prisons, but they see \ndetainees differently. They don't want terrorists coming into Kansas. \nWe are not set up to handle terrorist threats because of detainees \ncoming to Fort Leavenworth.\n  The administration cannot and should not duck this debate. They need \nto tell the American people how their security is improved by bringing \nterrorists inside our borders. They need to be upfront about how \ndetainees will be handled and where they will be housed.\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nThen the administration needs to listen to the American people before \nit charges forward.\n  Of course, a national debate on this issue should be based on facts. \nJust after last year's election, I invited members of the Presidential \ntransition team to visit Fort Leavenworth to see for themselves why it \ncould not handle a detainee mission. Nobody visited. Nobody even \nresponded.\n  In January, I invited the President to Fort Leavenworth so he could \nhear the facts directly from the people who work and live at Fort \nLeavenworth. That invitation is still open.\n  I tried to provide some facts to Attorney General Holder during his \nconfirmation hearing. I noted that Fort Leavenworth's primary mission \nis education, and that many international students of the command and \ngeneral staff college will refuse to participate in military education \nprograms if detainees are nearby. This could harm the interests of our \nNation. Unfortunately, Fort Leavenworth is still being considered as a \ndetainee destination.\n  I was pleased that Attorney General Holder made his visit to \nGuantanamo Bay in February and found out that it is, to use his words, \n``a professional and well-run facility.'' I would like for him to visit \nFort Leavenworth, too, because the facts speak for themselves. It is \nnot just that Fort Leavenworth should not have the detainees; it cannot \ntake on this mission.\n  The Missouri River forms the eastern border of the post. The city of \nLeavenworth wraps around the other three sides. There isn't enough \nspace in the existing maximum security prison wing to handle the \nGuantanamo detainees. The post doesn't have a hospital. It doesn't have \nadequate legal facilities. The fact is, the Fort Leavenworth idea just \ndoesn't work.\n  In order to resolve all of the issues surrounding the Guantanamo \ndetainees, we need a full debate with all of the facts available and \neverybody engaged. That means everyone needs to do their homework. I \nwas pleased that our colleagues in the House rejected the \nadministration's request for more than $80 million in supplemental \nfunding related to closing the Guantanamo detention facility. The House \nAppropriations Committee chairman was absolutely right to demand that \nthe administration come to Congress and defend a concrete plan before \nwe consider this request. We should not be in the business of spending \ntaxpayer money on hypotheticals, especially in a matter as significant \nas moving terrorists inside the borders of the United States.\n  It is my hope that next week this body will vote on whether detainees \nshould be moved to the continental United States.\n  I hope that we would vote against such a move. I believe there would \nbe a strong bipartisan vote against such a move.\n  I am doing my homework as well, as I mentioned previously. I will be \ntraveling to Guantanamo Bay tomorrow. I have been to Fort Leavenworth \nmany times. I want to see what we have accomplished at Guantanamo with \nthe more than $200 million in taxpayer funds in the last 8 years that \nwe have spent on that facility. I want to understand what it takes \nexactly to operate a detainee facility that is ``professional and well \nrun,'' to use Attorney General Holder's statement.\n  When the supplemental reaches the floor, I hope we can have a full \nand informed debate over detainees. I hope we can agree to set aside \nthe request for the funding of hypothetical detainee transfer plans. I \nhope we can agree that we are not ready to bring detainees to the \nUnited States. I hope we vote on that and send a clear message to the \nadministration and to the American people, most of which oppose moving \ndetainees to the United States.\n  If we poll different States on whether that State wants detainees \nmoved to their State, they are overwhelmingly opposed--the States are--\nto moving detainees to their States. From my own State, I know we do \nnot feel confident at all that we would be able to house the detainees \nin a safe fashion for the people of Kansas.\n  I hope we can set aside the arbitrary timeline for withdrawing \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay and do the hard work of determining what \nstatus detainees should have, how military commissions work, how long \nwe are willing to hold detainees, and whether they might ever be \nreleased to threaten Americans again. This is a tough problem. The Bush \nadministration wrestled with this for years. When I was on the \nJudiciary Committee, we wrestled with the issue of how to handle the \nlegal rights of detainees. We have a situation that we haven't seen \nbefore. This is one where we have detainees who are enemy combatants \nbut don't represent a foreign country. They are freelancing or in an \norganized effort not based in a country. Normally, in the past, we \nwould have a conflict with another nation, and we would hold prisoners \nof war until the conflict is over, and then there would be a military \nexchange or an exchange of prisoners at the end or there would be \ntrials for these combatants so they didn't go back on the battlefield.\n  We are still in the war on terrorism, despite efforts by the \nadministration to rename it. Whether it takes place in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and many other places; whether it is the Horn of Africa, where we \nare seeing problems, or Somalia, and in many other locations around the \nworld, there is a dedicated terrorist force that doesn't represent a \ncountry which seeks to do us harm and kill American citizens and harm \nour interests. That continues to be the factual setting.\n  When people are released from Guantanamo, we are seeing them back on \nthe battlefield, and it is like they have received a promotion. In \nAfghanistan, one of the leaders of the Taliban effort was a person \nreleased from Guantanamo Bay. It is like this was a credentialing \nexercise. Now he is leading a broader group. We don't want that to take \nplace. We don't want to release new commanders into the field.\n  In normal history, this wouldn't be an issue until the war itself was \nresolved. We have to figure out the military commissions. We tried \nmultiple times, in various ways, to be able to give legal rights to \nindividuals without revealing confidential information that would hurt \nour troops on the battlefield. We haven't found the appropriate route \nyet. I stand ready to try to do that. But I don't stand here willing to \nrelease people who will harm U.S. citizens. I don't think that is in \nour interest, and that is not our job.\n\n  I don't think it is our job to try to meet a European public's \nimpression of a facility that our Attorney General believes is well \nrun. It may have image issues that are taking place, but let's get \nactual facts. If the Europeans are that concerned about it, why don't \nthey get more involved in Guantanamo Bay or be willing to take some \ndetainees and not release them back onto the battlefield. I think this \nis one of the tough problems that needs to involve everybody. If there \nis an open debate and dialog--and the American people and interests \nshould be our primary concern--we can resolve this but not by releasing \ndetainees or putting them on U.S. soil, and certainly not by putting \nthem at Fort Leavenworth, KS, where people are saying clearly that we \ncannot handle this. We are not prepared to do this.\n  It will hurt the primary mission at Fort Leavenworth and the \neducation of our students and also the foreign military officers as \nwell. We have students from Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. \nThese are students and army officers from those four countries. We get \narmy officers from 90-some countries on a regular basis to Fort \nLeavenworth for training and for relationship building with U.S. \nmilitary forces. When we go to joint exercises--and there is rarely one \naround the world that isn't a joint exercise--there is confidence and \ncommunication that is built up among the individuals. We have been told \nby these four countries--by students from these countries--if we move \nthe detainees to Fort Leavenworth, KS, at the same place we are \ntraining future military leaders, they will pull their students out. We \nwill defeat the purpose.\n  We need to be able to work with the Pakistani military, the Saudi \nmilitary, and the Jordanian and Egyptian militaries. Now we will lose \nthose officers because we move detainees to Fort Leavenworth, a place \nwe are not set up to handle them. It will cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars, even if we could put a facility there, and the people in the \ncommunity will feel threatened. This is an urban setting. For what? Why \nare we doing this? So we can make ourselves less secure and make \nourselves\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nless effective around the world? So that we can please the European \npublic with this move? That is the reason.\n  None of this makes any sense. We have invested $200 million in the \nGuantanamo Bay facility that is well run. I don't know why we would do \nthis. It doesn't make any sense. I think we ought to work on this in a \nbipartisan fashion and roll up our sleeves and see what is in the best \nAmerican interests. Treating detainees humanely, rightly under the \ninternational conventions we have agreed to with other countries, yes, \nbut not harming U.S. citizens or subjecting our military to recycled \nindividuals who have been captured and put at Guantanamo Bay and \nreleased, and where we can meet them on the battlefield again as \norganizers and as people held up as examples to the terrorist fight.\n  We can do this but not with the direction that the administration is \ngoing in, and certainly not by excluding members of the other party.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I rise in support of an important \nsmall business amendment to the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, \namendment No. 1079. It would expand the truth in lending protections of \nthis bill and cover our Nation's small businesses in addition to \nindividual credit cardholders. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  I thank Senators Landrieu and Snowe, who are the chair and ranking \nmember of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. I thank \nthem for their leadership on this issue. I also thank Senators Dodd and \nShelby for their tireless work on the Credit Cardholders' Bill of \nRights.\n  This legislation is important because, as we have heard Senator \nDorgan say so eloquently, we can no longer allow predatory and \nmisleading lending practices to jeopardize American consumer credit. \nReform of the credit card industry is truly long overdue, and the \nmembers of the Senate Banking Committee should be commended for \nbringing such a strong bill to the floor. I look forward to supporting \nit. But we need to make a change in the bill because small businesses \nare critical to America's economic recovery, and in States such as \nmine, small businesses are the anchor of our communities and our \neconomy, providing the jobs and the services that help families pay \ntheir bills and put food on the table.\n  Unfortunately, many small businesses in New Hampshire and throughout \nthe country continue to struggle in today's economy. That is forcing \nlayoffs and slowing our path to economic growth. I have met with small \nbusiness owners across New Hampshire. They are small business owners \nwho have excellent credit histories, but they cannot access much needed \ncredit because of this economic crisis. Many small businesses have seen \ntheir credit lines reduced or even eliminated on short notice, \npreventing them from restocking their shelves and investing in future \ngrowth. Unfortunately, more and more small businesses are relying on \ncredit cards to meet their cash flow needs.\n  I am proud to have led a successful effort to increase access to \ncredit through the Small Business Administration's 7(a) Loan Program. \nBut we must also ensure that small business owners have credit cards on \nwhich they can depend.\n  The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights makes important changes that \nwill protect consumers from unfair practices such as arbitrary interest \nrate increases and unfair credit terms. This amendment simply expands \nTruth in Lending Act protections to small businesses with 50 or fewer \nemployees.\n  As business owners across the country grapple with the economic \nrecession, we must ensure that credit cards help, not hinder, our \nrecovery effort. By protecting small businesses from unfair credit card \npractices, business owners will be better able to manage their cash \nflow, plan for future growth, and contribute to our economic recovery.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Snowe \nin support of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday we heard on the radio and in \nnews accounts of the National Transportation Safety Board investigation \nof the crash that occurred in Buffalo, NY, of a commuter airline. I \nchair the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee; Senator \nRockefeller is chairman of the Commerce Committee. I visited with him \nearly this morning on this subject.\n  I was stunned yesterday to read and hear the results of the National \nTransportation Safety Board investigation. Last evening, I met with the \nfamilies of some of those who lost their lives in that commuter airline \ncrash.\n  I want to make a point that the things we now have learned about that \nparticular flight are very disturbing--the question of crew rest, the \nquestion of training, of safety issues. I am not here to suggest that \nwhen someone gets on an airplane today or tomorrow or anytime, they \nshould worry about who is in the cockpit, but I do suggest this: In \nthis case, what we have now learned is that one of the people in the \ncockpit traveled all night because the duty station was in New York and \nthe person lived on the west coast. That person traveled all night from \nthe west coast, stopping in Memphis, then on to New York, and then went \non a flight. Well, one wonders about having an all-night flight. Many \nof us have it. I have been on red-eye flights from the West many times. \nBut for a pilot in the cockpit to live on the west coast, fly to New \nYork, and take an all-night flight, poses real questions for me in \nterms of crew rest.\n  The voices in the cockpit suggest that one of the people in the \ncockpit said that person had no experience with icing. Well, I have had \na lot of experience with icing, and it is unfathomable to me that \nsomeone in the cockpit of a commuter airline would have no experience \nwith icing if they are flying in the Northeast at a time of the year \nwhen icing would be present.\n  It appears from what we know that the person in charge of the cockpit \non that airplane had 3 months of experience with that type of airplane. \nThe question is not just experience but how much experience do you have \nin the cockpit of that type of equipment.\n  The copilot on that flight was paid $16,000 a year. Think of that. A \ncopilot was paid $16,000 a year salary and worked part time in a coffee \nshop to make ends meet and lived with the parents in order to make ends \nmeet. I don't know if most people understand this when they get on a \ncommuter flight. A lot of flights in this country are on commuter \nairlines. You get on a plane that has the same markings on the tail and \nwings and fuselage of a major carrier, but in many cases it is not that \ncarrier at all that is operating the flight. When people get on an \nairplane, they expect the same standard, the same standard of training, \nof crew rest, the same set of standards no matter what airplane they \nare on if they are flying commercially.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration has the responsibility to set \nstandards and then enforce them. The National Transportation Safety \nBoard investigation of the Buffalo crash has raised very serious \nquestions that need to be resolved. As chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, working with the chairman and ranking member of the full \nCommerce Committee, I intend to be very involved in investigating what \nis happening.\n  I don't say this to alert people to be anxious or excited about \nhaving to take a flight somewhere but as someone who flies a great \ndeal. This disclosure about these issues on this flight is\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nvery troublesome. I want every American to believe that when they walk \nonto an airplane, no matter the company, that the experience, the \ncapability in the cockpit is such that they can have comfort. I don't \ncare whether you are flying on an Airbus 320, a Boeing triple 7 or A-8, \nyou ought to feel, as a passenger, that that experience, the crew rest, \nthe capability with the airplane in the cockpit gives you a substantial \nmargin of safety.\n  We have an unbelievable record in the skies across the country. We \nhave had very few accidents. In recent years when we have had \naccidents, most of them have been with commuter airlines. I am not \nsuggesting in any way that we get along without commuter airlines, but \nI believe the FAA has some significant questions to answer. I believe \nthe FAA has a lot of work to do. We will now have a nomination hearing \nfor Randy Babbitt to head the FAA. Frankly, the FAA has not had \nconsistent leadership. I hope Mr. Babbitt will provide that. I expect \nduring his confirmation hearing he will get a great many questions \nabout these issues.\n  I will have more to say about what we will do in my subcommittee as \nwell later today. I did want to mention that I have been stunned by \nwhat has been revealed by the National Transportation Safety Board \nabout that crash in Buffalo, NY by that commuter carrier. The family \nmembers of those who perished in the crash obviously are very concerned \nas well by what has been disclosed. It is a service to this country for \nthe NTSB to have done a complete investigation. It will provide for all \nof us a reminder that there is much yet to do in the FAA to make \ncertain that we maintain a good record of safety going forward. That \napplies to the major airlines and just as well and equally to commuter \nairlines.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are considering a bill which affects \nmillions of Americans. It is about credit cards. We all have them. We \nall wonder each month, when we get a monthly statement, what in the \nworld it means. I am a lawyer. I have been a legislator for a while. I \ncouldn't even tell you what the back of my credit card statement says \nevery month. But I know if you end up missing a payment, if you end up \nbeing late on a payment, the world can crash down on you, because I \nhave gotten plenty of letters from people around my State and the \ncountry about some of the things that happen when it comes to these \ncredit cards.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. This is the first credit \ncard reform legislation in how many years? Ever. That is a long time. \nIt is overdue.\n  All of us know how much they have become a part of our lives, and all \nof us know how vulnerable we are when interest rates go through the \nceiling, when they end up saying: Because you are a day late on your \npayment, unfortunately, you have to pay a penalty. Then there is \ninterest on the penalty. And did we tell you there is interest on the \ninterest on the penalty. You think it will never end--$25, $50, $75.\n  Senator Dodd, in this credit card reform legislation, does one of the \nmost significant things for American consumers we have seen.\n  I want to offer an amendment. Understand, if you go to your local \nrestaurant in your hometown and have a meal and pay for it with a \ncredit card, the owner of that restaurant has to pay part of your bill \nto the credit card company and the issuing bank. It is called an \ninterchange fee. So the owner of the restaurant doesn't get the $20 \nthat you put on the counter. That owner may end up paying several \npercent of that $20 to the credit card company and to the bank.\n  When we created the original law in this area back in 1981, we said: \nIt is OK for people in restaurants and other places to say to their \ncustomers: We will give you a discount if you pay in cash or by check. \nThat is the law; right? It makes sense. The person who owns the \nrestaurant says: I am only going to charge you $18.75 instead of $20 \nbecause you are paying in cash instead of with the credit card. That \nway I don't have to send part of your $20 back to that credit card \ncompany.\n  That was the law, and it seemed to be a pretty good one. The credit \ncard companies weren't happy with that. They didn't want people to get \nincentives not to use credit cards. They created new, legal entities \nfor credit card companies that didn't quite fit into the 1981 \ndefinition so that they wouldn't be covered by the possibility of a \nconsumer discount. And then, for those bold companies like that \nhometown restaurant that decided they still wanted to offer a cash \ndiscount, they piled up the rules on them at the credit card companies \nand said: If you don't advertise in just the right way, we will fine \nyou. I can tell my colleagues, gas stations are being fined $5,000 \nbecause they offered a discount of $1 or $2 to a consumer.\n  As a consequence, retail merchants came to us and said: Give us a \nbreak. If we are going to have a discount for cash or check, say so in \nthe law so that we can offer this to the American consumer.\n  The credit card companies hate it like the devil hates holy water. It \nis like old Senator Bumpers from Arkansas used to say: Like the devil \nhates holy water. They don't want to change.\n  This bill will change a lot of things they don't like. Thank \ngoodness. I hope the Members of the Senate will accept the amendment I \nam offering with Senator Bond of Missouri, a Republican, a bipartisan \namendment that says: Merchants across America can offer a discount over \ncredit cards for people who pay in cash, check, or with a debit card, \nwhich is the new checking account for many younger people.\n  That discount is going to help that establishment to be able to say \nto folks: Well, we can give you a break here on the product you just \nbought or the meal you just bought; and say to the consumers across \nAmerica who are struggling in this economy: Here is a way to save a few \nbucks. You can pay in cash, and you will not have to pay as much as you \nwould on a credit card.\n  I think that is a move in the right direction. I am glad retail \nmerchants, large and small, all across America have rallied behind this \namendment. Whether it is your gas station or a little shop in your \nhometown or the restaurant you go to, they will be able to say to you: \nIf you pay in cash, check, or debit card, we can offer you discounts on \nyour final bill. I think that is a good break for people across America \nthat they can enjoy every single day if they want to, if that is the \nway they want to make the purchase. If they want to use the traditional \ncredit card, that is up to them.\n  So this goes back to the original law, knocks away all of the \nobstacles put in the path of this law by the credit card companies, and \nbasically says, this gives retail merchants across America a way to \noffer a discount to American consumers.\n  So I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me on \nthat amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have in my hand a memo by Obama \nadministration attorneys--a compilation of attorneys--from a number of \ndifferent Federal agencies. It is marked ``Deliberative'' and \n``Attorney Client Privilege.'' This memo is well thought out. It is \nscientific as well as a legal critique of the decision by this \nadministration to use the Clean Air Act to regulate climate change. The \nmemo confirms the fears of every small business owner, every farmer, \nevery school and hospital administrator, in both large and small \ncommunities, that the Obama administration knows that using the Clean \nAir Act to regulate climate change is bad for America. They know it, \nbut for political reasons they have ignored the science. The \nconsequences to our economy have also been ignored, as well as the \nimpact on the American people.\n  I am going to be clear. To me, this memo is a smoking gun. This memo\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nmakes clear statements about the dangers to America of using the Clean \nAir Act to regulate climate change.\n  The memo states:\n\n       Making the decision to regulate carbon dioxide under the \n     Clean Air Act for the first time is likely to have serious \n     economic consequences for regulated entities throughout the \n     U.S. economy, including small businesses and small \n     communities.\n       Should EPA later extend this finding to stationary sources, \n     small businesses and institutions would be subject to costly \n     regulatory programs. . . .\n\n  Costly programs.\n  The document also highlights that EPA undertook no ``systemic risk \nanalysis or cost-benefit analysis'' in making their endangerment \nfinding.\n  The White House legal brief questions the link between the EPA's \nscientific technical endangerment proposal and the EPA's political \nsummary.\n  The EPA Administrator said in the endangerment summary that \n``scientific findings in totality point to compelling evidence of \nhuman-induced climate change, and that serious risks and potential \nimpacts to public health and welfare have been clearly identified. . . \n.'' But the memo states that this is not at all accurate. The memo \nactually questions--questions--the science behind designating carbon \ndioxide as a health threat, stating the scientific data on which the \nagency relies are ``almost exclusively from non-Environmental \nProtection Agency sources.''\n  The memo goes on to say that the essential behaviors of greenhouse \ngases are ``not well determined'' and ``not well understood.''\n  The memo says:\n\n       The finding rests heavily on the precautionary principle, \n     but the amount of acknowledged lack of understanding about \n     the basic facts surrounding [greenhouse gases] seems to \n     stretch the precautionary principle to providing regulation \n     in the face of unprecedented uncertainty.\n\n  Under the same precautionary principle, the memo says the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency could ``also regulate electro-magnetic \nfields and noise.''\n  This memo confirms that the administration has ignored its own \nadvice. It is looking to make up scientific facts to make a \npredetermined conclusion. This is politics trumping science. It is the \nAmerican people who will ultimately pay the price.\n  I have long stated my concerns that using the Clean Air Act to \nregulate climate change is a bad idea for our country.\n  The Chamber of Commerce has stated that 1.2 million new entities such \nas schools, farms, hospitals, office buildings, big-box stores, \nenclosed malls, commercial kitchens, nursing homes, and small \nbusinesses--in both large and small communities--all would be captured \nunder this preconstruction permit program under the Clean Air Act.\n  If only 1 percent of the 1.2 million major stationary sources of \ncarbon dioxide in this country undertook new construction or \nmodifications each year, well then, the agencies would have to process \n12,000 permits every year. Given the EPA's statement in its Advanced \nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2008 that 2,000 to 3,000 new permits \ncould ``overwhelm'' the EPA and the States, how can permitting \nauthorities handle the 12,000 they would have to look at? How can they \nhandle 12,000 permits annually? The answer is, with everything they do \nand everything they stated, they cannot.\n  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson says she is not planning to regulate \nsmall emitters. She says she can be targeted in what she regulates. But \nby what authority can the Environmental Protection Agency of this \nNation not include all the emitters of carbon dioxide that meet the \nemission thresholds that are set out in the Clean Air Act? Strangely \nenough, not just the authors of the administration's legal brief but \nalso environmental groups disagree with the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency because she says she can limit those \nand regulate those she chooses.\n  The Sierra Club's chief climate counsel stated last year that:\n\n       The Clean Air Act has language in there that is kind of \n     [an] all or nothing if carbon dioxide gets regulated and it \n     could be unbelievably complicated and administratively \n     nightmarish.\n\n  The Center for Biological Diversity says:\n\n       The EPA has no authority [at all] to weaken the \n     requirements of the [Clean Air Act] simply because its \n     political appointees don't like the law's requirements.\n\n  I have warned the Administrator of the EPA that groups such as these \nwill sue the EPA if the EPA does not capture both large and small \nemitters. She has dismissed these threats. This is despite the Wall \nStreet Journal last week reporting that a representative of the Center \nfor Biological Diversity stated that her group is prepared to sue for \nregulation of smaller emitters, such as farms, schools, hospitals, and \nnursing homes--and they will do that--if the EPA stops at simply going \nafter the large emitters.\n  I have asked for a plan from the Administrator on how she will \naddress losing court cases if the agency is sued for picking winners \nand picking losers. Her response in a committee hearing--this was this \nweek--is that she cannot share with me any such plans they might have \nin that forum of a committee meeting. Well, I would ask the \nAdministrator, if you cannot share information with the elected \nrepresentatives of the 50 States, then in what forum can you share the \ninformation? None of this is in keeping with the transparency that has \nbeen promised under this administration.\n\n  Similarly, I have asked the person who has been nominated to head up \nthe Air and Radiation Office, Mrs. Regina McCarthy, in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the same question. Her response was \nshe cannot share with me her plans because she is not in the job yet. \nShe has said she would like to be informed of potential suits and would \nthen personally meet with anyone wanting to sue to convince them not to \nsue. Well, Government officials cannot go running around trying to \nconvince every litigant--whether it be an environmental group or a \nlocal group that does not want something in their backyard--not to sue. \nThis is not a good policy. This is not good enough.\n  I am seriously troubled with the administration and their approach to \nthis issue. I have a hold on Mrs. McCarthy's nomination because this \nprocess of using the Clean Air Act to regulate climate change is \nflawed. There appears to be no plan to address it.\n  With the release of this internal document, we now know that the plan \nthe administration has to address climate change is political and not \nscientific. They know that using the Clean Air Act to regulate climate \nchange is bad for America. They choose to ignore the threat to America. \nThey are playing a dangerous game of chicken with Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  Either we will all jump to pass the President's energy tax--his cap-\nand-tax plan--or we will crash head-on into this regulatory ticking \ntimebomb. In the end, it will be the American people who will have to \npay the price.\n  The administration has tried to convince the public to support this \ncap-and-tax proposal.\n  Charlie Munger, who is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway--who works \nclosely with Warren Buffett; they have been partners for years--stated \nthat creating an artificial market in Government-mandated carbon \ncredits would be a ``monstrously stupid thing to do right now.'' And he \nsaid such a move is ``almost demented.''\n  Well, according to the Wall Street Journal, the administration has \nnow consulted pollsters who advocate avoiding such phrases now as ``cap \nand trade'' and ``global warming.'' The White House Council on \nEnvironmental Equality has also scheduled a meeting--earlier this \nweek--with the president of ecoAmerica, a Washington-based nonprofit \nthat uses--their terms--``psychographic research'' to ``shift personal \nand civic choices of environmentally agnostic Americans.'' This is a \nsign of desperation. The administration realizes the American people \nare not buying what they are trying to sell here. The consequences of \nthis issue are too grave for America.\n  Mr. President, I would say take this regulatory ticking timebomb off \nthe table. Let's pass legislation taking the Clean Air Act out of the \nbusiness of regulating climate change. Then let's forge a plan in a \nbipartisan way that makes America's energy as clean as we can make it, \nas fast as we can do it, without raising energy prices for American \nfamilies. Let's develop all of our energy resources--wind, solar, \ngeothermal, hydro, clean coal, nuclear,\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nand natural gas. We need it all. We need an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy to address our Nation's energy needs. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to address those needs for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5466-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5466-S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PROGRESS ON CREDIT CARD REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my good friend from Alabama is here as \nwell. I wanted to give my colleagues a little sense of an update. I \nknow we are all anxious to know how we are progressing.\n  While we haven't had a vote this morning on any amendments, I think \nwords of encouragement might be helpful at this juncture, to let \nMembers know we are reaching agreement or have reached agreement on a \nseries of amendments that will be incorporated into either a managers' \namendment or some manner or form.\n  To give my colleagues an idea of the amendments being worked out: \nSenator Collins of Maine and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, have an amendment on what is called ``stored value'' cards \nwhich we will reach an agreement on; Senator Feinstein and Senator \nCorker, along with Senator Casey and Senator Grassley, have an \namendment on university--I believe the word is either ``affiliates'' or \n``attitudes.'' Anyway, it is dealing with younger people on university \ncampuses and credit cards. We have either reached an agreement on that \nor are reaching one, but one will be reached on that as well. There is \nthe amendment from Senator Levin dealing with deceptive advertising, \nwhich I think we have reached agreement on as well. Senator Kohl has an \namendment for a study on the marketing of credit cards. Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Gregg have an amendment on an emergency PIN \nprogram FTC study that has also either been agreed to or is in the \nprocess of reaching an agreement. Senator Akaka has an amendment \ndealing with credit counseling standards. He has been a strong advocate \nof that for many years and we thank him for it. That is also an issue \nupon which we have reached some agreement. There is an amendment \ndealing with usury and an interest rate study which I will offer.\n  We had a vote yesterday on at least the waiver--we didn't actually \nhave a vote on the Sanders amendment--dealing with a cap on interest \nrates set to the national credit union standard. I supported the \nSenator's effort to waive the budget point of order for us to debate \nthat. That is not to say I would have agreed necessarily with that \nspecific amount, but clearly there is a strong desire in the country to \nget our arms around this issue of exorbitant interest rates. I thought \nmaybe we ought to be doing it, because there are different institutions \nwith different methods of calculating that. We probably ought to take a \nlook at how we can do that in a more comprehensive manner. So there are \na number of agreements.\n  I see my friend from Alabama. Our staffs worked together last night \nlate into the evening and were able to sit down with Members on both \nsides of the proverbial aisle, as we talk about here, to reach an \nunderstanding. While we have not had a vote this morning on any \namendments, work is being done to come to final conclusion on these \namendments.\n  There are amendments that we have not reached agreement on. Let me \nsay to my colleagues, cloture has been filed by the leader. My hope is \nwe can finish this bill today. I have a list of 30 or 40 amendments \nhere from Members who wish to offer them. We have a good bill. Is it a \nperfect bill? No. Is it a bill that Senator Shelby would have written \non his own? No. Is it one I would have written on my own? No. But, \nagain, we have a product that is worthy of this institution's support. \nIt is the first time we have dealt with reform of the credit card \nissuing industry. At a time when our fellow constituents are being \nhammered by rising costs, by fees and interest rate hikes that make it \nharder and harder for them to keep their families together \neconomically, it is a major step forward and it is deserving of our \nsupport.\n  That is not to suggest that many of these amendments are not good \nideas. It doesn't mean we have finished this debate once and for all, \nforever. Obviously, we will be back on these issues. We are in this \nCongress, and we will in the next as well. We want to see how this \nworks. We believe it will work well on behalf of our fellow citizens. \nBut at some point we need to get moving and get this done, even though \nit comes short of everyone else's ideal goal. I say that respectfully.\n  I have some Members with six or seven different amendments they want \nto offer. If that is the case, we will never finish this bill. I don't \nthink that is in our interests. Every day we delay is a delay for the \nfinal enactment of this legislation or the imposition of its standards. \nImplementation is nine months from enactment. Every day we wait pushes \nthat date further out at a time when we can help our fellow citizens in \nthis matter of credit card reform.\n  I won't go back through all the provisions that are incorporated in \nthe bill. I have done that several times. I think my colleagues are \npretty well aware of what is included. This is a bipartisan bill. \nPeople didn't think we could reach this point. We have done so. Once \nagain, Senator Shelby and I have worked together with our staffs to \nachieve that. This bill has been roundly endorsed and supported by \nevery major consumer group in this country. That is no small \nachievement. So there ought to be a moment of pride here that we have \nput something together worthy of our support.\n  These amendments I have mentioned already which we can adopt, we will \nin either a managers' amendment or by some means by which they can be \naccepted, but then we need to take these other remaining amendments and \nI need to have colleagues decide whether they are willing to have them \nmodified or studied or whether they are willing to have their \namendments not be offered at this time. They can help considerably or \nwe run the risk of losing this bill. I wouldn't have said that a day or \nso ago, but we are getting precariously close to that outcome: pushing \nthis off to next week. We have the supplemental coming up. When the \nagenda is taken over by other items, it is very difficult to come back. \nSo here we are on the cusp of actually achieving an unprecedented \nresult and I don't want to see us lose that opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to step up and come give us a hand to try and \nmove forward on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to join in and associate myself \nwith some of the remarks my colleague, the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Dodd, has made. One, we have what we think, with the Dodd-\nShelby substitute, is a step in the right direction. It is a step in \nthe right direction for consumers. It is also a step in the right \ndirection to bring balance to the credit card industry. Is it \neverything I would want from the Republican side? No, but it is not \neverything that Senator Dodd and some of the Democrats would want. We \nhave worked together to forge an outcome. We have put a lot of thought \nand a lot of work into this, as have our staffs, who have worked days \nand nights. We are close. We could pass this bill today if we could \nbring a few more people together. I think this is a milestone as far as \nprotecting consumers, informing consumers, as well as to give some \nbalance.\n  You cannot take risk out of the marketplace. You have to consider \nrisk when you make loans. We have some of that in here. But we have \ngreat reforms in here that I think we can live with. Some people don't \nwant a bill on both sides, or the others want something that is \nprobably not achievable, not good for the economy, and not good for the \nAmerican people. We have to remember that the credit card business does \nextend credit, to some extent, to people where that is their only \ncredit. This bill will at least let them know a lot of the terms \nupfront. It will let\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\nthem know what they are paying, and so forth. It is a step in the right \ndirection. I hope we can pass that bill. I would like to do it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the managers of the bill for their \ngood work. Their staffs have done a lot of hard work and put in a lot \nof time on the credit card bill. Their substitute amendment is a \nreasonable approach that protects consumers from abusive and deceptive \nlending practices, while allowing financial institutions to implement \nreasonable standards to account for credit risk.\n  I rise today to speak on behalf of the modified Durbin-Bond amendment \nto the Dodd-Shelby substitute. This amendment would clarify the fact \nthat consumers are allowed to receive a discount for purchases using \ncash, check, or debit instead of credit cards.\n  All of our offices have heard from credit cardholders who are angry \nand confused about sudden interest rate increases, hidden fees, and \nobscure rules. Much of the anger and confusion stems from inadequate \ntransparency in the financial system, which we are trying to address in \nthe underlying bill.\n  It is not only individuals and families who are struggling with \nconfusing credit card rules. Over the past several months, I have heard \ncountless complaints Missouri merchants, especially small businesses, \nwho believe they are powerless in negotiating credit card fees that \nare, in their view, unreasonably high and account for a significant \nportion of their revenue and may, in some instances, equal their \nprofit. As credit card usage has grown to become the dominant form of \npayment, these fees have squeezed their financial situation.\n  Small businesses are especially feeling the stress of credit card \nfees as many of them operate at very thin profit margins. With small \nbusinesses being hard hit by the economic downturn and finding more \ndifficulties in obtaining private financing from banks, this ``fees \nsqueeze'' is being felt even more.\n  Small businesses play a major role in our economy by creating jobs \nand acting as the catalyst for innovation. In order for our economy to \nrecover and sustain growth, and in order for our small businesses to \nput more Americans back to work, it is critical that their cost burdens \nbe minimized.\n  That is why I have always been a supporter of small businesses and \nbelieve their tax burdens must be held down. It is for that reason that \nI believe action is needed to address the credit crisis by clearing out \nthe toxic assets that clog our financial system.\n  My long-term and strong support for small businesses is the main \nreason I got involved in the merchant credit card fees last year, and I \ncosponsored legislation last year by Senator Durbin to address a key \ncomponent of merchant fees, called interchange fees. Mr. President, \nthese fees are generally set at around 2 percent. They have not \ndecreased. And studies indicate that rates may have increased over \ntime.\n  The Credit Card Fee Act of 2008 aimed at establishing a process to \nallow small businesses to negotiate so that fees could be set at \nreasonable rates. It was introduced by us. I have met, along with my \nstaff, countless times with concerned stakeholders, credit card \ncompanies, banks who issue credit cards, and large merchants to small \nmerchants. We have even held joint meetings with representatives of \nboth sides. While we gained some understanding, key questions remain.\n  One key question is whether interchange rates are set in a \ncompetitive, market driven manner. Despite several months of meetings, \nwe still don't have adequate information to answer that question or \nwhether the fees are reasonable and fair. It was my hope that we would \nhave been able to work out an agreement, but we have not been able to \ndo so.\n  Chairman Dodd has indicated that the issue of interchange fees will \nhave to be addressed another day. He included in the substitute \namendment a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office to \nprovide recommendations and information.\n  While interchange fees will have to wait for another day, I believe \nwe can take some modest, commonsense steps, and that brings us to the \nDurbin-Bond amendment, which answers a major question that consumers, \nincluding me, and small businesses have raised. It answers the question \nof whether merchants can provide consumers a discount if the consumer \nchooses to use cash instead of credit. Current law permits cash \ndiscounts, but in practice it is difficult, at best, for merchants to \noffer this option due to confusion about the rules. Our amendment would \nensure that cash discounts could be offered to consumers, and it would \nupdate the law so consumers can receive a discount for using debit \ncards, along with cash and checks, when making purchases.\n  It is also important to clarify some misconceptions about our \namendment. First, contrary to what some poorly informed lobbyists have \nsaid, the language doesn't allow merchants to discriminate between \ncertain brands or types of credit cards. It doesn't allow merchants to \ncut special deals with certain credit card issuers. This means the so-\ncalled ``honor all cards'' rule would be preserved and community banks \nand credit unions would not be unfairly affected.\n  To be clear, I strongly support our financial institutions that \nplayed by the rules and didn't participate in irresponsible and risky \nlending practices in recent years. That is why I was a strong supporter \nof the Dodd-Crapo-Bond language that raised the FDIC's line of credit \nso that community banks did not have to pay higher fees to support the \ndeposit insurance fund.\n  Second, the amendment language doesn't allow merchants to surcharge \ncustomers for using credit cards. In other words, the price displayed \non products must be honored, and merchants can only provide discounts.\n  Third, and most important, this amendment doesn't harm consumers. In \nfact, this amendment is structured with most consumers in mind. \nConsumers will benefit from this provision since they will be given the \nability to receive a discount for using less costly forms of payment \nand preserves the convenience of using all forms of payments. I believe \nthat makes it a win-win for comsumers.\n  Let me be clear so that there is no misunderstanding. This is not an \ninterchange provision. This amendment doesn't allow surcharges. It \ndoesn't give unfair competitive advantage to large banks at the expense \nof community banks and credit unions. It is not limited to the two \nlargest credit card companies, MasterCard and Visa. Most important, \nthis amendment won't harm consumers and the economy. In fact, the Bond-\nDurbin amendment is pro-consumer and pro-small business.\n  While we were unable to address interchange, I emphasize that the \nDurbin-Bond amendment represents a breakthrough. It also represents our \ngood faith effort to work openly and constructively with all concerned \nparties with the goal of finding common ground on the issue. I continue \nto hope that stakeholders will make a good-faith effort to provide us \nhard data and information to help us understand better the interchange \nissue.\n  I am a strong believer in the private markets. But Missourians and \nother taxpayers across the Nation, as well as policymakers and experts, \nhave significant questions about our private markets given the credit \ncrisis that is at the root of the economic downturn. We cannot afford \nto take things at face value. Taxpayers deserve greater oversight on \nfinancial and business matters so that taxpayers are not asked to bail \nout irresponsible businesses, and small businesses do not feel that \nGovernment policy is unfairly weighted toward ``too big to fail'' \ncompanies.\n  This amendment is a small but important step. It helps Americans save \nmoney at the store. It gives American families more choices when they \nare checking out at the supermarket or cafe. It makes sure small \nbusinesses understand the rules and provides them some financial \nrelief. It will provide immediate stimulus, since this is equivalent to \na modest but broad tax break. I extend my appreciation to Senator \nDurbin and his staff for their collaboration and cooperation in \ndeveloping this amendment.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-Bond amendment, \nwhich is endorsed by small business groups and consumer groups.\n  I thank the managers and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Missouri. He is absolutely right. \nThe interchange fees are a tremendously important issue. We have put \nin, at the urging of Senator Corker on our committee, a thorough study \nof the interchange issue. It is complicated, and the Senator is \ncorrect. Among small businesses, this is a very onerous area and we \nneed to address it.\n  I thought we needed to understand the fullness of the issue, so we \ntalked about the study. Senators Durbin, Bond, and others have a \nproposal that touches on the interchange issue. We are working with \nthem to see if we can reach an agreement on that. We will make an \neffort to do that. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have been on the floor often talking \nabout the subprime loan scandal that led to the financial crisis we are \ninvolved in, in this country. I have held up charts on the floor that \ndescribe the solicitations from the mortgage companies and others that \nsay: Come to us. If you have bad credit, if you have been bankrupt, \ncome to us. We want to give you a home loan.\n  I have shown all of those--from Zoom Credit, from Millennium \nMortgage, from the largest mortgage company in the country, \nCountrywide--all of them saying to people: You know what, if you have \nbad credit come to us. We want to loan you some money.\n  That subprime loan scandal was a tipping point for a significant \ndifficult time for this country's economy and that time includes right \nnow. I have talked about that at great length. But today we are talking \nabout credit cards. The same influence exists with respect to credit \ncards. We have companies that just wallpaper this country with credit \ncards. Go to a college campus and try to find out how many credit cards \nthey stick on those college campuses preapproved, saying to these kids: \nGet our credit card, please. Walk through the concourse of an airport \nand see how often you are accosted by someone who wants you to take \ntheir credit card. It is all over.\n  Last year the economy tipped over, and we went right into a financial \ncrisis. But in that year, 2008, 4.2 billion credit card solicitations \nwere mailed to consumers. Let me say that again. In the middle of an \neconomic crisis, at a time when there was so much unbelievable leverage \nand debt out there, companies in this country sent 4.2 billion credit \ncard solicitations to people.\n  Yes, some of them went to kids. The fact is, I spoke on the floor \nyears ago about my 10-year-old son getting a Diners Club card saying it \nis preapproved, we want you to consider going to Paris, France. My son \nwasn't going to France. As a matter of fact, he was 10 years old, for \nGod's sake. He had no money. He wasn't going to get a credit card. Was \nit a mistake that they sent him a credit card solicitation? Probably. \nBut I went to the floor one day with a whole pile of them, saying you \nare preapproved, please take this piece of plastic, spend it where you \nwant, as much as you want. Madam President, 4.2 billion new credit card \nsolicitations went out last year alone. They don't seem to care who \ngets them, as I said with home mortgages, which are much larger than \nmost of the limits on credit cards. For home mortgages they solicited \npeople with bad credit. You have been bankrupt? Come to us. You do not \npay your bills? Come to us. That is a business model I never learned \nabout, by the way, but it is what happened. They created the house of \ncards and the whole thing collapsed.\n  With credit cards, the big companies out there--and by the way it is \nheavily concentrated--wallpaper this country with preapproved credit \ncard solicitations: Come to us, load up; come on, spend what you don't \nhave on things you don't need; come on, you can load up on my card.\n  Then when they got everybody with all these cards and substantial \nbalances on the cards, here is what happened. This is a person from \nMinot.\n\n       My wife and I both have credit scores greater than 800 and \n     have never been late on any of our payments so it is odd that \n     Capital One just sent us a notice that our interest rate on \n     our credit card will almost triple.\n\n  There they are, using a plastic credit card, paying their bills on \ntime, and they are told we are going to triple your interest rate. At \nleast they know it. That is not an excuse, but a whole lot of folks \ndon't even know it.\n  Here is another constituent who wrote to me.\n\n       I just wanted to let you know how upset I am with my credit \n     card company--Citibank. They have decided to raise my \n     interest rate to 27 percent. I have always paid my bill on \n     time and have a good credit rating--820. Why would a company \n     who was bailed out by taxpayers because of bad practices then \n     decide to stick it to us by raising the interest rate so high \n     that it is competitive with the local Mafia rate?\n\n  There is no Mafia rate in Fairmont, I might say, but I get the point.\n  Williston, in my State:\n\n       Enough is enough. We shored up these banks with our hard \n     earned tax dollars just to have them raise the interest rates \n     on their credit cards to 28 percent and 26.3 percent--that's \n     Bank of America and Capital One--for absolutely no reason. \n     Something must be done.\n\n  One more:\n\n       I received a letter from my credit card company--\n\n  This person from North Dakota writes--\n\n     the Bank of America, that they are upping my interest rate \n     from 7.99 to 18.4 on my credit card and we have not been late \n     with a payment. We have been with them for 15 years. I want \n     you to know I am really angry over this. Billions have been \n     going to these banks and this is what we get for it.\n\n  Here is a solicitation for a bank debit card, Visa. You might look at \nthat and say what are they trying to solicit? Some 70-year-old codgers \nwho are retired, sitting around worrying about their teeth? No, they \nare trying to solicit kids. That is the purpose of the bow. It is a \nlittle like Joe Camel and cigarettes, except this is much more obvious, \na credit card for kids. It is pink with a beautiful little bow.\n  Here is a statement from Bruce Giuliano, a senior vice president with \na company that owned the Hello Kitty brand.\n\n       We think our target age group will be from 10 to 14 \n     although it could certainly be younger.\n\n  How much younger than 10 years old can you get people to start using \ncredit cards? That is unbelievable.\n\n       We think our target age group will be 10 to 14.\n\n  Here, by the way, is the Hello Kitty brand I was describing. Does it \nseem to you like they are targeting that 10-year-old to 14-year-old? It \nis a nice little pink thing with a kitty, new Platinum Plus Visa credit \ncard with world\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\npoint rewards. If they could couple this with an airline and get 10-\nyear-old kids flying to France, they would have what my son \nexperienced, plus a pink credit card. It is unbelievable to me. We \nwonder why people are upset. You have a bunch of companies out there \ngoing after your kids to see if they can put plastic in their pockets, \nkids who never had a job and will never get a job--at least not when \nthey are 10 years old--saying: Load up on debt.\n  Here, First Premium Card says:\n\n       Get our platinum credit card. We have a platinum card. Even \n     if your credit is less than perfect.\n\n  Once again, a solicitation to say if you don't do so well paying your \nbills, we have a credit card for you.\n  Has anybody thought through that maybe this is what steered the \ncountry into the ditch? Has anybody thought about that? By the way, \nsome of these financial companies are the ones that have gotten very \nlarge bailouts from the Federal Government.\n  This is interesting. This is a credit card, presumably, for somebody \nwho does not pay their bills so well. So it is hard for them to get a \ncredit card. Here is what they are going to do. It looks pretty good. \nIt is actually a gold card with a $250 total credit limit. The problem \nis the annual fee is $48, the setup fee is $29, the program fee is $95, \nand the monthly servicing fee is $7. So if you pay all these fees to \nthat bank, you get to have a piece of plastic in your purse or your \nwallet that allows you to charge up to $250. What an unbelievable \nopportunity for people who are not thinking or do not know or at least \nhave been cheated by a company that suggests these terms.\n  This chart simply describes a college credit card. Everybody makes \nmoney on credit cards. That is why they accost you when you are going \nthrough the concourses at an airport--the airline is actually pushing \ncredit cards. They are all making money on credit cards--including some \ncolleges, by the way.\n  They wallpaper all of those college hallways with credit cards \nbecause if you can get someone at that age to start using credit cards \nwith your company, then you have got them for a long period of time.\n  Now, 84 percent of undergraduates in college had at least one credit \ncard, up from 76 percent in 2004. Midwestern students continue to carry \nthe highest average number of credit cards, with more than half of the \nstudents--think of this--more than half of these college students have \nfour or more credit cards. Again, a cultural lesson about debt? I don't \nthink that is a lesson we want college students to understand. I am not \nsuggesting college students should not have a credit card. I understand \nthe value of that. But they ought to have a limit.\n  By the way, here is the other thing that happens with credit cards \nand college students. You cosign a credit card as a parent for the \ncollege student who does not have a job, and it is not very long before \nthe credit card company ups the limit to the college student without \ntelling the cosigner. I know that is an interesting business practice, \nto be pushing additional credit toward those who do not have income, \nbut it is part of the culture of this country, I guess.\n  Undergraduates are carrying record-high credit card balances. The \naverage balance grew to $3,100--the highest in the years the study has \nbeen conducted--and 21 percent of undergraduates had balances between \n$3,000 and $7,000.\n  My point is simple: This is some of the same culture and some of the \nsame difficulty that has tipped this country's economy over, beginning \nwith the subprime loan scandal in housing but very quickly going into \ncredit cards.\n  Someone said to me a while back: You know something, nobody spends \nmoney like the Federal Government. I am talking about debt. The Federal \nGovernment has run up all of this debt. Shame on the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I said: I agree with you. This Government has to decide it can only \ndeliver Government to the American people that the American people are \nwilling to pay for. We cannot continue with these deficits.\n  But, I said, understand this: It is not just the Government. This \nculture has had a dramatic runup in household debt, a dramatic runup in \ncorporate debt, you name it, all across the board, including trade \ndebt.\n  But we are here today because Senator Dodd has brought a bill to the \nfloor with his colleague, Senator Shelby, and they deserve great \ncredit. They deserve a lot of credit from the American people for doing \nthis. It is a piece of legislation that begins to put the brakes on, \nputs a bridle on those who are engaged in practices I have just \ndescribed: aiming credit card solicitations at 10-, 12-, 14-year-old \nkids, wallpapering college campuses so that kids came up with four or \nmore credit cards. The fact is many of these companies got involved in \nall of these unbelievable instruments--credit default swaps, CDOs, and \nshame on them. Shame on WaMu, shame on Wachovia, shame on the companies \nthat did it. They are supposed to be banks. Banking is supposed to be \nreasonably conservative. Instead, they loaded up with unbelievable \ndebt.\n  Now some of the same companies, by the way, that are putting credit \ncards out all over this country are saying to credit card customers: \nYou know, I understand you have never been late, never missed a \npayment, been a customer for 20 years, but you know what, your 7.9 \ninterest rate has now gone to 26 percent, and you are lucky we told you \nbecause some people are not going to know it. By the way, we are going \nto add some additional fees, and we do not care what you think about \nthis.\n  This legislation says: No more. You cannot do that. It says: If you \nare going to go in this direction--way overboard, in many cases \ncheating customers--then we are going to put the brakes on.\n  Some people say: Well, of what business is it of the Government?\n  Well, you know what, we have a responsibility, it seems to me, to \nstand up for consumers. In this case, you have some very large \ncompanies that have engaged in this business and now, in recent years, \nhave decided to impose very substantial fees and very high interest \nrates, in a way that I believe takes advantage of the people. These \npeople are good citizens, pay their bills on time, are conscientious \nabout it, and now discover that the company they have had a \nrelationship with for a very long time has imposed all kinds of \ndramatic penalties and fees that customer does not deserve.\n  So this legislation is legislation that I believe will pass the \nSenate with a very wide margin. Why? Because I think those companies \nthat have done this have invited this today. They asked for it. This \nCongress has a responsibility to stand up for the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  I come from a State in which Teddy Roosevelt lived for a while, and \nhe always said: Had it not been for my time in North Dakota, I never \nwould have been President. He was a rugged guy, and he went out there \nand ranched in North Dakota.\n  By the way, he was in the depths of despair because both his mother \nand his wife died in his home on the same day in New York. Think of it, \nlosing your mother and your wife the same day on different floors of \nthe same home. He went out to try to renew his spirit in the Badlands \nof North Dakota. He became a rancher and later became President of the \nUnited States.\n  One of the things I remember him for and the country remembers him \nfor is as a ``trust buster,'' willing to take on the big interests, \nwilling to stand up to the big interests when they rip into the \ninterests of the American consumer, the American people. Thank God for \nwhat Teddy Roosevelt did in so many areas in trust busting.\n  In many ways, this is a smaller piece of that larger issue, taking on \nthe bigger interests when they are taking on the American citizens in a \nway we believe is unfair and untoward.\n  So I came today simply to say to my colleagues, Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby, that I appreciate the work they have done. I am a \nstrong supporter of this legislation, and I know we have some \namendments back and forth. At some point, I am going to be proud to \ncast a ``yes'' vote.\n  I am not suggesting credit cards are bad--far from it. Credit cards \nare very helpful to the American people. I am suggesting there are some \npractices that have occurred that go way beyond that which is \nreasonable, and we are going to try to rein that in with this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise to speak for several minutes on \nthe\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nlegislation that is before us today dealing with credit cards, \nsomething that most of us have a personal experience with--we use them; \nwe have had good experiences and bad experiences. In some respects, \nthose experiences guide our views with respect to how we should \nlegislate. That is understandable. It is true with me too.\n  Earlier today, I had a chance to participate in a number of call-in \nradio shows, some specific to Delaware, one to the Delmarva Peninsula, \nand one a national call-in show. People raised a variety of different \nissues about the legislation we are debating. What I did with some of \nthe listeners, I took them back to the beginning and said: The reason \nwhy this legislation is before us actually grew out of the work of the \nFederal Reserve, which was begun over 2 years ago. The Federal Reserve \nsought to use their authority under the--I think it was the Federal \nTrade Commission law that says they have a responsibility to protect \nconsumers. That includes protecting consumers as they use credit cards.\n\n  For roughly 2 years the Federal Reserve held hearings, received input \nfrom consumer groups, from individuals, from the industry, from other \nregulators, as to how we might better protect consumers.\n  In the end, the Federal Reserve sought to strike a balance. They \nsought to strike a balance that was fair to consumers and better \nprotected their interests, which need to be better protected, and at \nthe same time not to further disadvantage our financial institutions in \nthis country, many of which are struggling literally to survive. That \nwas the balance the Federal Reserve sought to strike. The Federal \nReserve promulgated regulations last December after literally receiving \ntens of thousands of pages of comments on the draft regulations they \npromulgated earlier, last year.\n  What we are doing now is, rather than simply waiting on the Federal \nReserve regulations to be implemented between now and July 1 of 2010, \nCongress is seeking to codify, to literally turn into law those \nregulations and in some cases to move the effective date of those \nregulations up earlier and in some cases to add some provisions that \nwere not covered by the regulations.\n  One of the changes that is affected in this regulation was not raised \nin the regulation. It deals with credit cards and kids. It is really \ncredit cards and people under the age of 21. My boys are 19 and 20. \nThey are in college. They have been receiving preapproved credit card \napplications for a number of years, including when they were in high \nschool. I think Senator Dodd has talked about one of his girls, who I \nthink is 7 or 8 years old, having received a preapproved credit card \napplication at the tender age of 7 or 8.\n  The question is, do we need to do something differently? It is \ninteresting that the Federal Reserve, in their regulations, did not \nthink so. The legislation which comes out of the committee and comes to \nus for consideration says, no; we should do something. What the \nlegislation calls for, for us to do differently in this country, is if \na young person, under the age of 21, wants to sign up for a credit \ncard, either, No. 1, their parent or guardian has to cosign for them, \nwith them, for that credit card, or, No. 2, the young person has to \ndemonstrate the ability to pay their debts.\n  For the most part it means have a job, have a source of income to pay \ntheir debts. That is something that is in addition to the Federal \nReserve. I agree with that. I think it is a good change, and I think \nmost of my colleagues do, too.\n  In terms of being guided by your own personal experiences, I don't \nknow about the rest of you, but one person who called in today on a \ncall-in show said: Why don't we just let the marketplace make the \ndecisions for us? We are smart. We get these credit card solicitations \nin the mail. There are a lot of choices. Let the marketplace work, and \nlet people choose what card they want.\n  As it turns out, we have a lot of smart people in the Senate, maybe \nstaff who are even smarter. There are a lot of people in this country \nwho, frankly, have not had the opportunity for an education that some \nof us have had, and they lack, as do some of us, the financial literacy \nthat will enable them to make the right decision on a multitude of \noptions, choices; to understand them, read the fine print and \nunderstand how it will impact them.\n  As a result, we are not going to just let the marketplace work as it \nworked in the past because it didn't work perfectly. What we are trying \nto do is correct some of the bad behavior, clean up some of the \nbehavior on the part of the credit card issuers, and that will get to a \npoint where the marketplace can work, and the market will actually work \non behalf of consumers. That is really what we want to see happen.\n  I will use a couple of examples from my own personal life. I have \nthree credit cards that I use. One of the credit cards I use is for my \npersonal use. Another credit card I use is for government-related \nexpenses, official business. A third is for campaign-related expenses. \nThe Presiding Officer may have a similar kind of arrangement. It helps \nkeep everything straight for me. That is a benefit, a real advantage, \nand I believe it is an example of how our credit cards can be used for \nour advantage.\n  I had a credit card several years ago for campaign-related expenses. \nI lived in Wilmington, DE. The credit card bill had to be paid in New \nJersey. I was getting the bill about 10 days before it was due, and in \none instance I remember sending a check for that bill and it took 5 \ndays for my check to actually get to the credit card company and be \ncredited as a payment--5 days, Wilmington, DE, to New Jersey. I could \nhave driven it in less than 5 hours, but it took 5 days to credit.\n  The other thing I noticed about the credit card company, the due \ndates for my bill were always Saturdays or Sundays. They didn't process \non Saturdays or Sundays. I finally realized what was happening, and I \nsaid we will not use that credit card again. I tore it up, paid it off, \nand got another credit card that did not have that problem. That is an \nexample of letting market forces work.\n  Hopefully, a lot of us are smart enough to be able to do that sort of \nthing, but honest to God, not everybody is as sophisticated as they \nneed to be to be able to lay that out for themselves.\n  Another issue that has come before us is the issue of caps, our \ncredit card limits. If Senator Grassley over here has a credit card \nlimit, and I am his credit card issuer, he has a limit on the credit \ncard he has from us, from our company, say, a $1,000 limit. Currently, \nif he exceeds the $1,000 limit, we let him. My credit card company lets \nhim exceed it and he starts paying fees. If he continuously goes over \nthe limit, he pays more and more fees.\n  I don't think that is the way the system should work. The Presiding \nOfficer doesn't think that is the way the system should work. The \nlegislation before us says that is not the way this system should work.\n  Going forward, when a person signs up for a credit card, if there is \na limit--we will say there is a $1,000 limit--unless the cardholder \nobjects, that will be a limit. It will be a hard cap. If the \ncardholders want to exceed that limit, they may do that, but they fully \nacknowledge that they will accept fees in doing so. I think that is a \nreasonable way to approach this.\n  There is another major issue that has been before us, the issue of \nwhether the credit card companies should be able to assess risk and \ncharge for that risk, the perceived higher risk on the part of the \ncardholder. We worked with Senator Shelby, who is here today, to try to \nstrike a reasonable balance that says, again, I am a credit card \ncompany, he is the credit card holder, and we send him his statement. \nHe doesn't pay within 30 days. What the Federal Reserve said is after \n30 days, credit card companies should have to charge a higher interest \nrate. We changed that a little bit, and we say we will give the \ncardholder 60 days. If the cardholder has not paid a minimum payment \nwithin that 60 days of it being due, the credit card company can raise \nthe interest rate; however, we give the holder of the card 6 months on-\ntime payments, minimum payments for 6 months, to earn back the lower \ninterest rate. To me, that seems like a fair balance, looking out for \nthe consumer, looking out for the company in addition.\n  I want to mention, yesterday we had the opportunity to debate the \nquestion of a usury ceiling. The question was 15 percent--shouldn't we \nhave a 15-percent uniform usury ceiling on credit card rates. Maybe 33, \n35 people voted\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nfor it. I did not. I said to my colleagues wondering how they should \nvote, there are actually two or three problems with the amendment \nbefore us, or any usury ceiling rate.\n  If it is a 15-percent ceiling rate, the idea was we should limit \nbanks to charging 15 percent because credit unions are limited to 15 \npercent. As it turns out, credit unions do not operate under the same \nrules of the road as banks. The banks complained the credit unions get \na break and the banks do not enjoy that in a number of ways. To simply \nsay because the credit unions are capping at 15 percent we ought to cap \nthe banks at 15 percent, frankly, it is not a logical argument in my \nmind.\n  One thing I know is, if there were a limit of 15 percent, everybody \nhere, all the Senators, would be able to get credit. Most of our staff \nwould be able to get credit. The folks who would not be able to get \ncredit are lower income people. They wouldn't be able to get a credit \ncard because they may have a high risk, and if they do have a high risk \nand it is proven by their payments scheduled over time, those people \nare going to be cut off. That is not an intended consequence, it is an \nunintended consequence, but by virtue of not adopting yesterday's \namendment we allow credit card companies to charge eventually for risk, \nbut at the same time to offer the credit card holder the opportunity to \nearn back a lower rate of interest.\n  I compliment Senator Dodd. I commend Senator Shelby and their staffs. \nThey have worked very hard to get us to a point where all of us, \nwhether we happen to come from States where we have a lot of credit \ncard companies or we happen to come from States where we have a lot of \ncredit card holders, to try to get a right balance. I think you came \nreally close to doing that. I understand we may have one amendment \noffered later today dealing with fees that are paid by, in some cases, \nthe merchants--the interchange fees. I understand there is language in \nthe underlying bill that says--this is not something on which we have \nhad hearings, I understand, in the Banking Committee. I understand \nmaybe other committees have had hearings on it years ago. We have not \nhad hearings on this in the Banking Committee. It is a lot more complex \nthan people would lead us to believe.\n  Why don't we give the appropriate agency, and I think in this case \nthe GAO, the Government Accountability Office, a year to come back to \nus, study this, vet it, and tell us: This is what we think you should \ndo. To me, this makes a lot more sense on the Senate floor, without \nhaving had the benefit of hearings, informed hearings from the Banking \nCommittee, to tell us what we should do. Let's take our time and let's \ndo this right.\n  I commend my colleagues. I thank them for giving my staff and me, \nother Members who have had an interest, whether on the committee or \nnot, the opportunity to weigh in, express our concerns, and have the \nopportunity to shape in a small way the outcome of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1107, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent the Collins \namendment, No. 1107, be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. EXTENDING TILA CREDIT CARD PROTECTIONS TO SMALL \n                   BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) Definition of Consumer.--Section 103(h) of the Truth in \n     Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602(h)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(h)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of any provision of this title relating \n     to a credit card account under an open end credit plan, the \n     term `consumer' includes any business concern having 50 or \n     fewer employees, whether or not the credit account is in the \n     name of the business entity or an individual, or whether or \n     not a subject credit transaction is for business or personal \n     purposes.''.\n       (b) Amendment to Exemptions.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 104 of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1603) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting after ``agricultural \n     purposes'' the following: ``(other than a credit transaction \n     under an open end credit plan in which the consumer is a \n     small business having 50 or fewer employees).''\n       (2) Business credit card provision.--Section 135 of the \n     Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1645) is amended by inserting \n     after ``does not apply'' the following: ``with respect to any \n     provision of this title relating to a credit card account \n     under an open end credit plan in which the consumer is a \n     small business having 50 or fewer employees or''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would like to speak for 3 or 4 \nminutes. I see my colleague from Iowa is here to speak, so I will not \ntake any more time.\n  I spoke briefly about this amendment when I introduced it on behalf \nof Senator Snowe and others who joined us, from both sides of the \naisle. I have spoken at some length with the chairman and ranking \nmember as well. I am hoping we could have a positive outcome on this \namendment because it is so important to our small businesses in \nAmerica.\n  We have been trying with some degree of success to actually help \nsmall businesses on Main Street in our communities. I say ``with some \nsuccess,'' because we all go home on the weekends and we continue to \nhear very serious complaints from our grocery stores and our hardware \nstores and our shoe repair shops and our cleaners and our business \nowners saying: Senator when is any help coming our way? You are giving \nall of these billions of dollars to Wall Street and to these big banks. \nYet we are here really struggling. Is anyone listening to us in \nWashington?\n  Olympia Snowe and I, as chair and ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, are doing what we can, saying: Yes, we are \nlistening, and we want to be of some help. Every bill that comes to the \nfloor, we try to put a lens on it: How is this helping small business?\n  This bill is a good step to help consumers, individuals, persons, who \nhave a credit card. Unfortunately, the way the bill is currently \ndrafted, it leaves out small businesses.\n  My amendment with Senator Snowe will simply put them in this bill so \nwhen this bill passes, we can have a real celebration about helping, \nnot just individual cardholders but small businesses that are \nstruggling to keep their doors open.\n  Madam President, you serve on the Small Business Committee. You have \nheard the testimony, immediate past testimony, of, really, businesses \nthat have 500 employees that are struggling, to businesses that have 2 \nemployees; from a conservative perspective, from a liberal perspective, \nthat have come before our committee. That is how this amendment came to \nbe.\n  As I reviewed the underlying bill and thought there were some \nterrific things in this bill that will help credit card users, let me \njust quickly say, it bans at any time, for any reason, increases in \nrates. No more can credit card companies just raise your rate any time \nfor any reason. That is eliminated in this bill.\n  No longer can credit card companies charge you for a balance that you \npaid. If you owe $1,000, you send them a check for $900, they can \nstill, under current law, charge you interest on the entire $1,000.\n  That is not fair. It is not fair to individuals. It is not fair to \nsmall businesses. That will be corrected in this bill.\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n  It simplifies disclosures. Yes, I believe in the free market, but I \nbelieve in order to have a free market you need to be able to read the \nprint. Sometimes not only is the print small, but it is almost \ndifficult to understand. So it is more simple disclosures.\n  I think small business owners need that opportunity as well. It \nprohibits credit card companies from charging interest on transaction \nfees that they add to monthly bills. So small business will get that \nbenefit.\n  This is, in conclusion, not going to solve every challenge that small \nbusinesses have, but at least they will know there are Members of the \nCongress, Senators and House Members, who hear them, who are trying to \ndo what we can to respond, and this amendment will actually cover 26 \nmillion small businesses in America, in addition to the millions of \nother credit cardholders, perhaps over 50 million, maybe more. This \nwill include small businesses with less than 50 employees.\n  I would like to help every business in America. I will continue to \nwork on that. But for this bill, because it was directed to \nindividuals, we thought by keeping it to relatively small businesses, \nit would fit in the overall scope and framework of this bill.\n  Senator Snowe and I are going to continue to work to expand credit \nopportunities for businesses with your help. This bill also is \nsupported by Senator Shaheen, as an original cosponsor, and Senator \nCardin. I wish to thank them very much for their support and help.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa and will reserve the remainder of my \nremarks for Tuesday, when I hope we can vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                       Government-Run Health Care\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I \nwill only be speaking about 11 minutes or so. I will proceed.\n  Yesterday--no, it was not yesterday, 2 days ago--the Medicare \ntrustees announced that Medicare's Part A hospital trust fund will be \ninsolvent in 2017. That is 2 years sooner than last year's estimate. \nThis announcement shines a spotlight on an issue Congress cannot \nignore. Our largest Federal health program is on an unsustainable \ncourse.\n  Medicare, according to the trustees, is going broke. We have all \nheard the reasons over and over: People are living longer, health care \ncosts are increasing, and most seniors are developing chronic and very \ncostly conditions.\n  All this leaves the Federal Government with a $35 trillion unfunded \nliability over the next 75 years because the trustees always look ahead \n75 years. That is updated annually.\n  Some in Congress recognize the financial black hole that is looming \nbefore us. I hope my colleagues know I am working with Senator Baucus \nand other members of the Finance Committee to reform the way the \nGovernment pays for health care.\n  Our options for delivery reform will bring the Medicare Program into \nthe 21st century by improving quality and reducing costs. We \ndesperately need to retake control of the costs of the Medicare \nProgram, obviously, so it can be around for future generations. Yet in \nthe face of that reality, some people think the best way to accomplish \nhealth care reform is to create another entitlement program.\n  In the face of Medicare's pending insolvency, some people want to \ncreate a new public program, a government-run health insurance program. \nI am one of the most vocal supporters of health care reform. We need to \nimprove quality, access, and affordability. But we need to understand \nby adding another unsustainable government-run health insurance plan \ninto our health care system, it cannot be the answer.\n  We cannot afford what we already have, so let's add more. Put that \nagainst the commonsense test. It does not make much sense. As the \nsaying goes: History is a vast early warning system. Today, debate over \nhealth care reform is eerily similar to the debate in 1965, before \nMedicare was created.\n  Let's look at that history. Before the bill became law, doctors, \nhospitals, and other health care providers were concerned about this \nnew government-run health care program that was passed back then. We \ncall it Medicare.\n  Much like today, way back then, they were worried the Government \nwould use this program to ration care and cut payments. To deal with \nthese concerns, Congress and the President actually promised back then \nto doctors and others that they would continue to be paid, as the law \nsays, the usual and customary rates.\n  That is why, to this very date, the Medicare legislation still states \nthis:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall authorize any Federal officer \n     or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the \n     practice of medicine or compensation of any person providing \n     health care services.\n\n  That was written in 1965. It is still in the law. But--and a big \n``but''--we all know that the cost and the political pressure has \nincreased.\n  As a result, this section that I quoted, written in 1965, has become \nmeaningless. Time and time again, Congress has intervened in medical \ndecisions and cut reimbursement rates. Legislation in the late 1980s \nplaced limits on what doctors could charge and put in place a \ngovernment-mandated fee schedule.\n  One American Medical Association trustee recounted the AMA's original \nconcern about Medicare by stating it this way: ``Many of the things we \nfeared have come to pass.'' Surprise. Surprise. Despite the promise to \npay ``reasonable rates'' when Medicare was created, today the \nGovernment pays between 60 and 70 percent of what private insurers pay.\n  By setting payment rates well below costs, it is becoming more and \nmore difficult for seniors to find a doctor who accepts Medicare. \nAccess issues for Medicaid, as we all know, are even worse. But some \nsay we can avoid these problems by putting the government-run plan on a \nlevel playing field with private insurers.\n  They say Congress could set up a system so the government-run health \ninsurance plan has to follow the same rules as private insurers. They \nsay it would have to pay the same rates, form networks, be \nindependently solvent, all sounding good. My question is this: When \nthis new government-run health insurance plan starts to cost too much, \nthen following the pattern since 1965 with Medicare, is Congress going \nto start breaking its promises? Will it change the rules?\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article tried to answer this question \nthis way:\n\n       Any policy guardrails built this year can be dismantled \n     once the basic public option architecture is in place . . . \n     That is what has always--\n\n  And ``always'' is emphasized--\n\n       That is what has always happened with Government health \n     programs.\n\n  Maybe at first Congress somehow repeals the requirement that the \ngovernment-run plan has to form a network. Next, Congress might allow \nthe Government plan to start paying lower rates than private insurers, \njust like we have done with Medicare and Medicaid. At that point, \nCongress might let the government-run plan dip into the Treasury from \ntime to time to keep the Government plan solvent.\n  This, of course, would increase costs for everyone. As the Government \ntakes more and more control over the plan, providers would get paid \nless and taxpayers would end up paying more. Rates for government-run \nhealth insurance plans would be lower than private insurers because \nGovernment can impose lower rates by law, also known--can you believe \nit--as price fixing.\n  This is a common talking point for supporters of the government-run \nplan. They say the Government can use its numbers to lower costs. But \nas the Government cuts payments to providers, costs will go up for \neveryone who is left in the private market. Slowly but surely the \nGovernment plan takes over the market. Eventually, all the promises \nabout creating a level playing field have been broken, and we would be \nleft with a single-payer, government-run health insurance plan, such as \nCanada.\n\n  Canada brags about having a single plan. But Canada does not have \njust a single plan. There is a second plan, and it is called the United \nStates of America. So if you do not want to wait around 3 months for an \nMRI in Canada, you can come to the United States, if you have the money \nto do it and the time to do it, and get it right away.\n  But what happens if you have such a plan in America? Where do \nAmericans go for what the plan does not provide\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nfor our people when you have delay? Well, we will not go to Mexico, \nsurely. Eventually, all the promises about creating a level playing \nfield will have been broken, and we would be left with a single-payer, \ngovernment-run health insurance plan.\n  The simple truth is, supporters of a government plan absolutely \nintend for this to be the outcome. Independent analysis by the Lewin \nGroup agrees. According to Lewin's work, 119 million people would lose \ntheir private insurance. In other words, they would be crowded out. \nThey would end up where? On the Government plan.\n  It also breaks one of the most important promises that President \nObama made during his campaign, and I agree with this promise. What is \nit? If you like what you have now in the way of health insurance, you \ncan keep it.\n  Independent analysis has shown that a government-run insurance plan \nwill drive up prices in the private market and force employees and \nemployers to drop that coverage. So the President does not get his plan \nor his promise during the campaign kept.\n  This, of course, will make our emergency rooms more crowded than they \nare today. It will limit access to high-quality care through rationing \nand price fixing. It will increase waiting time for lab results and \nlifesaving and life-enhancing procedures. It will add hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new Government spending.\n  This is not the kind of change the American people are looking for. \nInstead of creating a government-run plan and making a bunch of \npromises Congress cannot keep, let's create stronger rules and \nregulations for the private insurance market.\n  For instance, we should prohibit health plans from denying coverage \nto people with preexisting conditions and provide tax credits to people \nwho cannot afford coverage.\n  Instead of introducing a government-run health insurance plan that \nwould cost too much, limit choices, and lower quality, let's clean up \nthe private market. Instead of introducing a government plan, let's \nhelp President Obama keep his promise that if you like what you have in \nthe way of health insurance, you can keep it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make a few \nobservations on President Obama's request in the emergency war \nsupplemental for $80 million in funding to close the detention facility \nat Guantanamo Bay. Shortly after taking office in January, President \nObama announced, with much fanfare, the closure of the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility. At the same time, he also said he would work with \nCongress on any legislation that might be appropriate.\n  But instead of consulting Congress, President Obama is asking for $80 \nmillion to close Guantanamo, with no justification or indication of a \nplan. The House Appropriations Committee has already refused to provide \nthe funding because, in the words of the chairman of the committee, the \nPresident has no plan in place on what to do about the detainees housed \nthere. We are now hearing reports that the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee will be providing funding for Guantanamo and its version in \nthe emergency war supplemental, but that it will be ``fenced off'' \nuntil the President provides a plan on disposition of the detainees \nheld at Guantanamo Bay. I believe any plan to close Guantanamo that \nincludes bringing these terrorists into the United States is a mistake. \nWe don't want the killers who are held there to be brought into this \ncountry.\n  The administration is actively seeking to circumvent a Senate \nresolution which passed by a vote of 94 to 3 in July of 2007. That \nresolution stated the detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay should not be \nreleased into American society and not transferred stateside into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n  In fact, not only does the Obama administration wish to hold open the \npossibility that some of these detainees may be transferred to \nfacilities in American communities, it is even considering freeing some \nof them into American society. These are the 17 Chinese Uighurs whose \ncombat status review tribunal records were deemed insufficient to \nsupport the conclusion that they are enemy combatants but cannot be \nreturned to China because of fear that the Chinese Government will \ntorture or kill them. At a press conference on March 26, ADM Dennis \nBlair, the Director of National Intelligence, went so far as to say:\n\n       If we are to release them [the Uighurs] in the United \n     States, we need some sort of assistance for them to start a \n     new life.\n\n  However, the Uighur detainees are not simply unfortunate souls who \nhappened to be scooped up on the battlefields of Afghanistan because \nthey were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They took firearms \ntraining at camps run by the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, which \nhas been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. \nThey were at Tora Bora when we were heavily bombing that area and \nseeking to capture Osama bin Laden. The leader and chief instructor at \nthese camps was Abdul Haq. In a Treasury Department advisory issued \nonly a few weeks ago, the Obama administration labeled this man a \n``brutal terrorist'' with ties to al-Qaida.\n  It is hard to believe that this administration is seriously \nconsidering freeing these men inside the United States, and, most \noutrageous of all, paying them to live freely within American \ncommunities and neighborhoods. The American people don't want these men \nwalking the streets of America's neighborhoods.\n  Aside from the issue of turning loose into the United States people \nwho have trained in terrorist camps, the American people don't want the \nGuantanamo detainees to be transferred to the United States and held in \ntheir backyards, either, whether at a military base or in a Federal \nprison. That is easy to understand when one looks at the details of the \nkillers who are held at Guantanamo.\n  Guantanamo is home to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. \nThere are 27 members of al-Qaida's leadership held there, along with 95 \nlower level al-Qaida operatives, 9 members of the Taliban's leadership, \n92 foreign fighters, and 12 Taliban fighters. Americans don't want \nthese killers brought into the United States, but President Obama's \nJanuary 22 of 2009 Executive order reads, in relevant part, that a \nreview of all Guantanamo detentions:\n\n       Shall identify and consider legal, logistical, and security \n     issues relating to the potential transfer of individuals \n     currently detained at Guantanamo to facilities within the \n     United States.\n\n  In my view, President Obama is willfully ignoring the views of the \nSenate and its resolution passed, as I said earlier, by a bipartisan \n94-to-3 votes. The detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be \nreleased into American society, nor should they be transferred to \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n  Since President Obama seems set on a course to bring these terrorists \ninto the United States, I have worked with my colleague in the Senate, \nSenator Inhofe from Oklahoma, to introduce a bill that would prevent \nany taxpayer dollars from being used to transfer detainees held at \nGuantanamo to any facility in the United States or construct, improve, \nmodify, or otherwise enhance any facility in the United States for the \npurpose of housing any Guantanamo detainees.\n  Transferring these terrorists held at Guantanamo to facilities in or \nnear American communities could make those communities terrorist \ntargets. I had the opportunity to question ADM Dennis Blair, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, on the potential security threat of \nrelocating the Guantanamo detainees to facilities in the United States \nduring an Armed Services Committee hearing on current and future \nworldwide threats to the national security of the United States. \nAdmiral\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\nBlair acknowledged that moving those detainees to the United States \n``does somewhat raise the threat level'' and ``does raise the concern \nsomewhat.'' That does not give me comfort. If we must close Guantanamo \nBay, it should not result in Americans being less safe.\n  Transferring these detainees would also stress the civilian \ngovernments in the communities where these detainees would be placed. \nThese communities would be faced with overwhelming demand from \nroadblocks to identification checks, along with having increased \nsecurity personnel necessary to deal with what is an obvious threat. \nThe value of homes and businesses would decline. South Dakotans \ndefinitely don't want these detainees, and my support of the Guantanamo \nDetention Facility Safe Closure Act will help to ensure that these \ndetainees will not be transferred to my home State of South Dakota or \nother States in the United States.\n  In conclusion, my view is that no Guantanamo detainee should be \nbrought into the United States to be incarcerated, and certainly should \nnot be brought into the United States and freed. Americans don't want \nthese killers brought into their communities and neighborhoods, period. \nThe Senate has clearly spoken on that front by a 94-to-3 vote on a \nresolution that we adopted in July of 2007 that detainees housed at \nGuantanamo Bay should not be released into American society and not \ntransferred stateside to facilities in American communities and \nneighborhoods.\n  These detainees are hardened, trained terrorists who are very smart \nand extremely dangerous, who understand the strategic vulnerabilities \nof this country, and who are capable of exploiting any situation and \nany vulnerability to inflict death and destruction on the United \nStates. These are not common criminals locked up in State or Federal \nprisons.\n  Guantanamo is secure. The facility is a $200 million, state-of-the-\nart prison. No one has ever escaped, and its location makes it \nextremely difficult to attack. Best of all, it is located hundreds of \nmiles away from American communities. If President Obama wishes to \nclose Guantanamo, he must do so in a way that keeps America safe.\n  In my view, America will be less safe if the Guantanamo detainees are \nbrought into the United States. I will do everything I can to make \ncertain that does not happen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arkansas, Senator \nLincoln, for her leadership on the credit card legislation and for her \nwork on this bill. I also thank Chairman Dodd for his work on the \nCredit Card Act. We have worked so many months on this vital \nlegislation, and we are finally debating it on the floor. It is long \noverdue. For too long, credit card companies simply were not content in \nreporting record profit after record profit. They were not content \nmaking reasonable money at reasonable rates. They wanted more, and they \nwanted interest that was far above their cost for funds. They wanted \nfees and more fees and more fees. Up against your credit card limit? No \nproblem. Instead of really being a limit, that ceiling served as a \nlicense to charge additional fees. For too long, the credit card \ncompanies convinced Washington to look the other way. No more.\n  While not all lenders that provide credit cards are engaging in the \nexorbitant and unethical practices, a great number are, and that is why \nthis bill is crucial. It protects not only the consumer, but it \nprotects the credit card companies from themselves. Nickel-and-diming \ndoesn't begin to describe the billions of dollars out of which \nAmericans have been cheated.\n  The bill would protect consumers from random, at-will interest rate \nincreases and account changes. It would banish unfair application of \ncard payments, and it protects consumers who pay on time and follow the \nrules. It would curtail fees and penalties and ensure that cardholders \nare informed of the terms of their accounts. This bill would help \nprotect young people from credit card predators. We all know, if we \nhave ever had teenagers in the last 15 years or so, that a huge number \nof solicitations keep coming at them. This legislation puts the well-\nbeing of millions of hard-working middle-class families first.\n  I have heard some outrageous complaints from big, multinational banks \nthat claim this bill is unfair because to make the changes it requires \nwould take years to implement.\n  It is a pretty weak argument for the big, sophisticated, multibillion \ndollar credit card companies, with armies of information technology \nemployees and lawyers. It certainly doesn't take them a year to \nincrease a fee or to figure out how to implement a universal default \npolicy or to work the mathematical magic needed to implement \nretroactive pricing.\n  For too long, the big credit card companies didn't step up and do the \nright thing, so there should be no surprise that they must do so now. \nMillions of Americans--their customers--were left in the dark at the \nmercy of whatever sleight of hand or shell game credit card companies \ncould contemplate. If there were a charge or policy imposed that \nconsumers didn't agree with or understand, they were forced to dial a \n1-800 number on the bill. If they were lucky, they could talk to an \nactual person who worked from a crib sheet on different ways to say no. \nIf they took it further, they could run into an army of lawyers.\n  No more. Consumers in my State of Ohio, and across this country, are \nno longer alone. The Government is going to work for them. It is time \nour laws were on the side of hard-working men and women. That is why we \nare working on this comprehensive legislation protecting consumers from \nmultibillion dollar predators.\n  Young people, who often are a prime target of these predators, will \nhave heightened protections with this bill. I have spoken many times \nabout the questionable practices of credit card companies which \ninundate our college campuses with their enticements and their \nadvertisements. With the escalating price of a college education, and \nour Nation's financial problems, why would credit card companies dole \nout credit to unemployed or underemployed students? Because they can, \nand because no one has been willing to stand up to them, and no one--as \nthis bill does--has been willing to stand up for those students. Now \nthe Government is stepping in and will fairly regulate what was too \noften the wild west of consumer lending.\n  College students should have access to credit cards. They should have \nthe ability to take out consumer loans. This is an important way to \ndevelop good credit practices and good credit for those students. But \nuniversities such as Ohio State--the Nation's largest university--tell \ntheir students to avoid taking on large amounts of credit card debt. \nEven so, many credit card companies flood campuses with deceptive \nadvertising and hidden fees and penalties and unscrupulous practices. \nNo more.\n  This bill shouldn't even be necessary. Credit card companies should \nbe responsible corporate citizens. Sadly, many have not been willing to \nplay fairly. Last November signaled a shift from large corporate \nshareholders running this country to middle-class families taking back \nthe reins of government. This bill is one of the results of that \nchange, with a new President and a different Congress actually putting \nthe Government on the side of the middle class.\n  I am a cosponsor of the CARD Act, and because of that, I look forward \nto its passage.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Collins amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1126 to Amendment No. 1107\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment to \nthe pending Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1126 to amendment No. 1107.\n\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, I begin by commending Chairman Dodd and \nthe ranking member, Senator Shelby, for putting together such an \nimportant package of reforms to protect our consumers all across this \ngreat Nation. Without a doubt, rampant credit card debt is a problem \nfacing a great and growing number of Americans. In my own home, my twin \n12-year-old boys get preapproved credit card requests weekly--at the \nage of 12.\n  Looking at how we can do a better job of both financial literacy and \nhelping people during this time of credit crisis to be able to do a \nbetter job in terms of responsibility, the Federal Reserve's most \nrecent data estimates that the average American household now has about \n$2,200 in credit card debt compared to an average of about $1,000 in \n1992, and overall household debt has risen drastically, more than \ndoubling in this last decade.\n  Confusing terms, constantly changing interest rates, and high penalty \nfees have all contributed to this trend, as many people struggle to \neffectively manage their credit and their credit card use and the debt \nthey have.\n  While it is the responsibility, obviously, of consumers and borrowers \nto manage their own financial affairs, it is also absolutely essential \nthat we ensure they have all the information they need, in an easily \nunderstandable form, so that they are able to make fully informed \ndecisions about their credit and the amount of debt they might be \nincurring and what it means to their families; what the long-term \nimplications might be. It is also important that credit card companies \nprovide stable, easy to predict interest rates, and reasonable penalty \nfees that do not overly punish innocent mistakes that might be made.\n  This bill, on which Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby have \nworked so tirelessly, has come together in a bipartisan way to improve \nconsumer protections regarding excessive fees, ever changing interest \nrates, and complex contracts seemingly designed to do one thing above \nall, and that is to keep people in debt. This bill will clean up the \nfine print so consumers don't get blemished by their credit card \ncompanies.\n  I am very pleased to be supporting the underlying bill, because \nultimately I believe it will help restore fairness and common sense in \nour Nation's credit card practices.\n  On that note, talking about fairness and common sense, I wish to \ndiscuss the second-degree amendment to Senator Collins' amendment I \nhave called up. This is an amendment I am offering on behalf of the \nentire Arkansas delegation--the entire delegation as well as our State \nofficials, and others. This is a critical legislative proposal that \nwill provide temporary emergency relief for an Arkansas-specific \ninterest rate problem that is having a severe impact on Arkansas \nstudents, our consumers, our businesses, as well as our municipalities \nand our State government. We are all, in Arkansas, affected by this \nsituation.\n  Arkansas is the only State in the Nation with an artificially low \ninterest rate limit that is tied to the Federal discount rate. Under \ncurrent law, the interest rate on special revenue bonds and nonbank \nconsumer loans may not exceed 5 percent above the Federal discount \nrate, which is currently set at one-half percent. So we are completely \nuncompetitive. Other bonds are capped even lower, at 2 percent above \nthe Federal discount rate. As a result of this, Arkansas State and \nlocal governments, our public universities and utilities--in search of \nfinancing for construction and improvement projects--are severely \nhampered by the current limit, as are our Arkansas consumers, who are \nfacing a lack of credit availability, as is everyone in this great \ncountry during this economic crisis.\n  Practically speaking, the current interest rate limit--the top rate \nthat is legally allowable in Arkansas on all nonbank lending--is no \nhigher than 5\\1/2\\ percent. Not surprisingly, this low rate of interest \nhas contributed to bond investors looking to other States across the \ncountry where their yields will be much higher, as well as credit \nrationing by nonbank lenders that have been forced to restrict funds to \nconsumers--particularly now, when capital is so hard to come by \nanywhere else.\n  The biggest frustration of all for people in my State is that the \nFederal Government has continued to make this problem worse and worse \nby lowering the Federal rate. This was done in an effort to improve the \neconomy, and we certainly understand that in Arkansas. The Fed took \nthose measures in order to try to improve the economy overall. But \nsince we are the only State that has that unusually low rate that is \ntied to the Fed, we are actually suffering tremendously from what is \noccurring. As I said, we do appreciate the Federal Reserve's actions in \nthese recent months to continue lowering the Federal discount rate \nwhere necessary to combat the economic crisis and stave off a further \ndecline in our financial markets, but the lowering of that rate has \nonly exacerbated the economic challenges faced in our State, and in our \nState alone, for that reason.\n  Additionally, many of the tools put into place in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act--the stimulus package that we offered \nearlier this year to jump-start our economy, such as the Recovery Zone \nbonds and the Build America bonds--are not available in our State \nbecause of our lack of competitiveness in the bond market, due to those \nabnormally low interest rates that are tied to the Fed. As stated in \nthe recent Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article on this issue:\n\n       The bond market has responded to the Build America program. \n     Since its introduction, investors have purchased $8 billion \n     in offerings, providing the bulk of activity in the taxable-\n     bond sector. Arkansas is not in a position to take part.\n\n  This is an issue that impacts our State of Arkansas alone. We \nunderstand that, and Arkansas does intend to fix that problem. However, \nwe can't do so immediately because this archaic clause in the Arkansas \nlaw must be rectified through a statewide ballot initiative. Therefore, \na proposal to permanently modify this outdated law will be voted on by \nthe people of Arkansas, but not until the next statewide ballot in \n2010. Unfortunately, the economic challenges our Nation now faces are \nmagnified in our State and immediate emergency intervention is\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nessential; otherwise, our State's recovery will lag behind due to a \nlack of capital in our State.\n  There is precedent for Federal action on this issue, as the Congress \nenacted an Arkansas-specific provision to exclude Arkansas bank lenders \nfrom this exact interest rate limit in 1999. The second-degree \namendment we are offering today is even more limited in scope, allowing \nfor a temporary relaxation of the current interest rate limit to a more \nreasonable level of no more than 17 percent until the State ballot \ninitiative is considered.\n  This is temporary, it is an emergency for Arkansas, and it is only in \nregard to the State of Arkansas. This is merely a temporary bridge to \nget us through this immediate crisis. We are all part of this economic \ncrisis in this great country, and we are working hard together to pull \nourselves out of this ditch and to get the economy back on track. I \nwould hate to think that my State, and my State alone, was the only one \nthat could not access the stimulus dollars to help our universities, \nour airport authorities, our municipalities, and others to access some \nof those dollars, to help create jobs in our State, and to put people \nwho may have lost jobs back to work. We want to be sure we have the \nresources as well in order to be a healthy part of reviving the economy \nin this great country.\n  This is a matter of great urgency for our State. This is a matter \nwith broad consensus in our State. We have worked as an entire \ndelegation and in a bipartisan way. We have the State government, our \nGovernor, and others who have been working with us--just for Arkansas, \nbecause it is Arkansas specific--to figure out a way to provide that \ntemporary bridge, that temporary assistance we need. Because if we wait \nuntil that ballot initiative, the stimulus package will be over and we \nwill have missed that opportunity. So this is a matter we have been \nworking on, as I said, in a bipartisan way to try to solve.\n  We hope we can count on the support of our colleagues when this \namendment comes up later on today or whenever we vote on it. But I do \nplead with my colleagues, this is an Arkansas-specific issue. It is one \nthat is detrimental to our State. We have an opportunity to help the \npeople of Arkansas, the communities of Arkansas, the student loan \nauthority, which can no longer issue new student loans because of that \nbonding authority and the cap that exists there. The problems that \nexist for us are monumental, and we want to ensure that over the next \n18 months we too can be a part of reviving the economy of this great \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since there is some time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be acknowledged as in morning business for whatever time \nI shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there are several things toward the end of \nthe week that I was wanting to elaborate a little bit on. They are kind \nof unrelated subjects, but we do not get this opportunity very often.\n  The whole idea of Guantanamo Bay is something that I know a lot of \npeople have talked about. I was very proud at the inauguration when our \nnew President, President Obama, gave a lot of statements that were, I \nthought, logical, and, frankly, a speech that I could very well \nhave made--not as eloquently as he but from a content perspective.\n\n  He said, in relationship to the problem of Gitmo, or Guantanamo Bay, \nthat, yes, we want to close that. However, we first must figure out \nwhat we are going to do with the detainees, recognizing that there are \n245 detainees, recognizing further that there will be more as there is \nan escalation in activity in Afghanistan and that there is no place \nelse to put these people.\n  I felt pretty satisfied at that time that this great American \nresource we have called Guantanamo Bay is something we need to keep. It \nis one of the few good deals the Government has. We have had it since \n1903. It is a resource unlike anything else, not only in our holdings \nbut anyplace in the world. It is a place where we have actually built a \ncourtroom that will handle tribunals, that will handle cases with rules \nof evidence that would fit tribunals as opposed to our court system. I \nfelt pretty comfortable knowing there is nothing that can be done with \nthe 245 detainees. Many are very dangerous terrorists.\n  Since that time, he has changed his position. Now he is saying we \nwill close it regardless. He has already closed the courtroom. This \nfacility took 12 months to build. It cost $12 million. There is nothing \nelse quite like it. If we are going to ever adjudicate these \nindividuals, bring them to trial, we have to put them someplace. One of \nthe alternatives would be our court system. Obviously, that is not a \ngood idea. Most thinking people realize it is not a good idea because, \nthe rules of evidence being different from what they are in a normal \ncriminal case, most likely we would not get convictions. What happens \nwhen you don't get convictions? You turn people loose. If there is \nanything we don't want, it is terrorists being turned loose. The \npolitics of that is such that people who want to close Guantanamo Bay \nare backing away from that issue, but they are still talking about \nclosing it.\n  I have had occasion to be down there several times. The last time I \nwas there, I used a new technology that I didn't understand too well: \nYouTube. I did a program down there from Guantanamo. I commented at \nthat time: Here we are with about six levels of security for six levels \nof detainees. There is no place else like it where we can do something \nlike this.\n  In terms of how they are treated, I have had them say, with a \ntranslator, that it is probably the best food they have ever had in \ntheir lives. There is one medical practitioner--in most cases, a \ndoctor--for each two detainees. Where else will you find that? There \nare procedures that are offered to the detainees that they would never \nhave offered anywhere else. For instance, when they offered a \ncolonoscopy, which was described to the detainees in terms of what it \nentailed, they decided they didn't want it. Nonetheless, these were \nthings that were offered in the way of health care.\n  In the case of torture, there has never been a documented case of \nwaterboarding or any severe torture taking place there. I can remember \nthe week after 9/11, when we had immediately a few people in there. I \nwent down and found that our own troops who were stationed down there \nwere not treated as well as the detainees.\n  Even if that were not true, there is no other place that we can put \nthem. There has been a proposal that there are some 17 detention \ninstallations in the United States that would be suitable for these \npeople. One of them happens to be Fort Sill, which happens to be in \nOklahoma. I went to Fort Sill and talked to a young lady there who is a \nsergeant major. This is in Lawton, OK. I talked to her about this. She \nsaid: Senator, I have to ask you a question. Why is it that everyone is \nso concerned about closing Guantanamo Bay? This facility here is not \nnearly as suitable for detainees.\n  Then she went on to explain why this separation of people and of \nclasses of security problems. She said: Besides that, I spent 2 years--\nthis is Sergeant Major Carter, stationed at Fort Sill--at Guantanamo \nBay. That facility is better than any Federal facility we have.\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n  Why is it we are so bent, just because of some ugly rumors that are \nnot true about treatment of detainees, on closing a resource we have \nhad and we are still paying $4,000 a year for, as we have been ever \nsince 1903? You don't get many bargains like that in government. \nAnyway, they seem to be concerned about doing that.\n  I believe public pressure is going to come around on our side and \ncommon sense will prevail and we will not close that resource. We will \nneed it in the future. We need it today. We have needed it in the past. \nIt has served us well.\n  As this moves along, I hope the public knows there are several of us \nwho are going to make sure we do not do anything that is going to allow \nsome of these detainees to be floating around in the continental United \nStates. If we are inclined to do this program where we put them in some \n17 installations, we will have 17 magnets for terrorism in the United \nStates. That is not going to happen.\n\n\n                       The First One Hundred Days\n\n  I also wish to talk about the striking similarities between what is \nhappening today and what happened back in 1993.\n  The first 100 days of President Obama's administration will be \nremembered for its unprecedented level of new Federal spending--no \nquestion about that; no Democrat or Republican can deny that--and the \nreturn to big government. This, together with his advocacy of far-left, \nliberal causes--everything from abortion rights, to gun control, to \nuniversal health care--will put him on a track to repeat the \nperformance of 1993, when a very attractive, young Bill Clinton entered \nthe Oval Office under the banner of change. After Americans realized \nthat his so-called change was simply an extremely leftwing position, \nthe American people revolted and put Republicans back in charge of \nCongress. If President Obama continues down this path, I would not be \nsurprised to see that happen again in 2010.\n  Nothing is more indicative of the stark contrast between \nconservatives and liberals than the massive Government spending spree \nnow underway in Washington. In his first year in office, Bill Clinton \nput forward what was then the largest budget to date in our history. It \nwas $1.5 trillion. It included domestic spending of some $123 billion.\n  Now in this 100th day of President Obama's administration, the Senate \nis poised to vote on what would become the largest budget to date. This \nbudget, which highlights his priorities, is the most radical and \npartisan budget we have ever seen. It includes $4.4 trillion in \nadditional deficits and $3.5 trillion in total spending. Let's compare \nthat to 1993. I was down on the floor complaining about a $1.5 trillion \nbudget. This is a $3.5 trillion budget.\n  When I go back to Oklahoma, sometimes I come to the conclusion that \nthere aren't any normal people in Washington, because they ask the \nquestion: Senator, how can we afford all this spending when we had a \nstimulus bill of $789 billion, increasing debt by $1.8 trillion in the \nfirst year, and a $3.5 trillion budget? Where is the money going to \ncome from?\n  Here I am, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, and I can't answer the \nquestion. We do have choices. We can borrow. We can print it. It will \nhave to be a combination of the above. We know all of the very damaging \neffects: $1 trillion in taxes on individuals and businesses, a $634 \nbillion downpayment for government-run health insurance. There is \nanother similarity. Remember, in 1993 it was called Hillary health \ncare. The concept was the Government can run a health care system \nbetter than people can. I always invite people who believe that to go \nspend some time in some of the hospitals up north; the Mayo Clinic and \nsome others come to mind. See the number of people who are there who \ncame over from Canada because they couldn't get treatment. Maybe their \nage was right above the federal guideline for a particular type of \nprocedure, and they could no longer do it. Again, the similarities are \nso similar, 1993 and what is happening today. Then, of course, we had \nthe Wall Street bailout and all of that.\n  I am very concerned about the direction this administration has \nproposed to take us. Anyone who works hard, plays by the rules, pays \ntaxes, drives a car, turns on the lights, saves, invests, donates to \ncharity, or plans to be successful should also be concerned.\n\n  Defense cuts--I probably am more concerned about this than most \nMembers. I am the second ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have watched what is going on. To me, it is deplorable.\n  I happened to be in Afghanistan when Secretary Gates came out with \nObama's defense cuts. They tried to claim they are not defense cuts. \nThey are. It is just that they are talking about the DOD appropriations \nbill versus all the other funding sources that have been used before.\n  The best evidence that they are cuts is what has happened to our \nplatforms. Right now, the F-22 is the only platform we have that is \nfifth-generation maturity. This is something he is stopping right now. \nWe were originally supposed to have 750 F-22s. Now we will stop at 187. \nAt the same time, you have China with its J-12, Russia with its SU \nseries, a fifth-generation airplane. That is going to put us in a \nposition where it will hurt and hurt bad.\n  The same thing is true with the Future Combat Systems. We have been \nworking on that for 8 years now since Shinseki helped to start it. It \nis the first transition in ground capability in at least 50 years. This \nis something we have been working on so that we don't send our kids \ninto battle against countries that might have a better artillery piece \nand better equipment than we. He axed that program.\n  How long has it been since we started working with the Parliament of \nPoland and the Czech Republic to get them to let us put a radar system \nin the Czech Republic and interceptor capability in Poland so that when \nIran gets the capability of sending a nuclear missile over to western \nEurope or the eastern United States, we would have the ability to shoot \nit down? It didn't happen. The Parliaments that had to be politically \npretty strong to agree to do that. Now they are sitting back and \nfinding out that they are talking about axing that program too.\n  The airborne laser is the closest thing we have to knocking down a \nmissile in the boost phase. We were coming along with that program. \nThey axed that program too.\n  I am very concerned about what happens and what has happened in this \nbudget to our capability of defending ourselves. Then I go back to \n1993. That is exactly what happened back then. If we look at the 8 \nyears of the Clinton administration, we cut military spending from what \nwould be just a straight line by $412 billion in that period. Of \ncourse, we ended up cutting our military by about 40 percent over that \nperiod.\n  The bottom line is, all these programs were cut. I happened to be in \nAfghanistan when that happened. We did a report from over there. We \ncould see the Bradleys driving by and the helicopters taking off, the \nbad weather, soldiers coming back from patrols and turning on the tube \nand finding out President Obama is going to gut the military. It is \ntotally unacceptable. But that is the same thing that happened in 1993. \nIt is deja vu all over again.\n  Gun control is the same. We see now that they are going to try to get \nus to sign on to a treaty that is called CIFTA, a treaty in the Western \nHemisphere where we will all get together and we will allow Central \nAmerica and Mexico and South America and Canada to determine what gun \nmanufacturers can do. It is the first major step to gun control, in \nviolation of second amendment rights. People care about that. It is \nexactly what happened with Bill Clinton in 1993.\n  Energy taxes--back when Bill Clinton was doing it, it was called the \nBtu tax. That stands for British thermal unit. It was a massive tax \nincrease on energy and very similar to what they are trying to do right \nnow--which, incidentally, I have no doubt we will stop them from being \nable to do--the cap-and-trade tax. One thing about the cap-and-trade \ntax, that is something that is not just a one-shot deal like the \nstimulus bill. That is every year. It would be somewhere around $350 \nbillion a year in taxes on the American people, a regressive tax \nbecause it is a tax on energy. People with lower incomes spend a larger \npercentage of their expendable income on that kind of energy than rich \npeople do.\n  We are not going to let that happen. I tell all my friends, we have \nbeen fighting that battle now for 8 years,\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nand it is over. We are not going to let that happen in America. But \nthat is what Bill Clinton tried to do in 1993. It is the same thing all \nover again.\n  We went through the same thing on abortion. I think personally there \nis no mission more important than standing up for the sanctity of human \nlife. Here again, President Obama, like President Clinton, quickly \nmoved to appease pro-abortion advocates.\n  Just a few days ago, the Senate confirmed Kathleen Sebelius for \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. As Governor of Kansas since \n2002, she has a clear record of supporting abortion and policies that I \nbelieve impact the health and safety of women and parental rights. \nAgain, it is abortion. Either you are for it or against it. But this is \none of the strong pro-abortion positions in 1993 that now we are \ngetting again out of this administration.\n  So when you look at this, I cannot help but think that all the signs \nare there, that we are seeing the same thing now that we saw back in \n1993. I believe we are going to be positioned to keep a lot of these \nthings from happening, No. 1, and No. 2, let's remember what happened \nin 1993. Young, attractive Bill Clinton went in as President of the \nUnited States, and he had the House and he had the Senate, and he had \nit all just as President Obama has it all. He has the House and the \nSenate. Therefore, it is not someone else's fault for all these \nprograms. Consequently, we had a major turnover in the 1994 election. \nRepublicans took over the House and the Senate. So I just warn my \nliberal friends from the other side of the aisle, be real careful. \nWatch what you are doing because it could very well happen again.\n\n\n                       EPA'S Endangerment Finding\n\n  Mr. President, I do have something that is a little heavier lifting \nsubject. I am the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. When the Republicans were in the majority, I was chairman of \nit.\n  Something is happening right now, and something happened Tuesday \nmorning. I want to make sure everybody understands, as this week is \ncoming to an end, that on April 17, the administration set in motion a \nticking timebomb with its release of a proposed endangerment finding \nfor carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases. This proposal \nfinds--this, incidentally, is what all the scientists do not agree \nwith--this proposal finds that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant \nthat threatens the public health and welfare and therefore must be \nregulated under the Clean Air Act.\n  This is interesting because they first tried to pass cap and trade. \nThey know there are not the votes for it. There are in the House. \nSpeaker Pelosi pretty much gets anything she wants through. It is a \nsimple majority vote over there. Over here, it would take 60 votes to \npass that massive tax increase, and we are not going to do it because \nthey do not have more than 34, maybe 35 votes, and it takes 60 votes. \nBut, nonetheless, since they cannot do it, they decided to do it under \nthe Clean Air Act and do it through regulation so it could be done from \nthe White House. This so-called endangerment finding sets the clock \nticking on a vast array of regulations and taxes, with little or no \npolitical debate or congressional control.\n  On May 12, we learned of a White House document. This is significant. \nWe did not know it was there. I want to credit our committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--the minority side--for finding \nthis document. It is a White House document marked ``privileged and \nconfidential.'' It was buried deep within the docket of the proposed \nrule. It outlines some of the very same concerns shared by me and many \nof my colleagues, including Senator Barrasso. I could not be here for \nthat Tuesday morning meeting, and he was good enough to take this memo \nand expose it and did an excellent job of it.\n  Keep in mind, we are talking about their proposal for new taxes, new \nregulations--all these things they want to go through with because they \ncannot legislatively pass a cap-and-trade--or cap-and-tax, as some call \nit--proposal.\n  The document we found--allegedly a compilation of concerns from \nunnamed officials within the White House, or the administration, as \npart of an interagency review of the proposed regulation--raises some \nquestions, very serious criticisms of the endangerment proposal. Chief \namong them are questions raised about the link between the EPA's \nscientific argument for endangerment and its political summary.\n  I am going to quote from it. I have three quotes. Keep in mind, this \ncame from the administration. This report says:\n\n       The finding rests heavily on the precautionary principle, \n     but the amount of acknowledged lack of understanding about \n     basic facts surrounding greenhouse gases seems to stretch the \n     precautionary principle to providing for regulation in the \n     face of unprecedented uncertainty.\n\n  In other words, what they are saying there is that the science is not \nthere; we do not know yet; we know there are a lot of problems with \nthis, and we should not be rushing into it. This came from the White \nHouse. I am glad we found it.\n  Here is a further quote. Additionally, it says:\n\n       There is a concern that EPA is making a finding based on \n     ``harm'' from substances that have no demonstrated direct \n     health effects, such as respiratory or toxic effects, and \n     that available scientific data that purports to conclusively \n     establish the nature and the extent of the adverse public \n     health and welfare effects are almost exclusively from non-\n     EPA sources.\n\n  Again, this is not me talking, this is a quote from the White House \nin a buried document we fortunately--but surprisingly--did find.\n  You can ask: What source is the EPA relying on if it is going to go \nthrough all this? That source is the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. This is where it all started. It was the United Nations \nthat started this whole issue of greenhouse gases, of CO2, \nanthropogenic gases, and methane causing global warming. When you look \nat their ``Fourth Assessment Report'', which, as I have documented \nbefore many times in speeches on this Senate floor, is a political and \nnot a science-based body, it has no accountability here in the United \nStates.\n  You keep hearing people say: What about the NAS, the National Academy \nof Sciences? What about them? They are scientists.\n  The reports they give are not from the NAS, they are from the \npolitical review or the summary for policymakers, which is a political \ndocument, not another document.\n  In addition, this White House memo also warns of a cascade of \nunintended regulatory consequences if the endangerment finding is \nfinalized. It states--and again, I am quoting from this report:\n\n       Making the decision to regulate CO2 under the \n     Clean Air Act--\n\n  That is what they want to do, regulate CO2 under the Clean \nAir Act--\n\n     for the first time is likely to have serious economic \n     consequences for regulated entities throughout the U.S. \n     economy, including small business and small communities.\n\n  This report talks about the small businesses, the small communities, \nchurches, other groups that are going to be adversely affected by this. \nAgain, this is a document that came out of the White House.\n  Now, for one thing, I am glad to know we are not alone with our \nconcerns and that several in the Obama administration share views \nsimilar to ours on the endangerment finding. I am hopeful more will \ncome forward.\n  So what was the administration's official response to the release of \nthis memo? Well, it depended on whom you asked. One source in the Obama \nadministration chose to again blame it on the Bush administration, \nstating it was written by a holdover appointed by George W. Bush. \nHowever, earlier in the day, Peter Orszag, who heads the White House \nbudget office, where the memo apparently came from, stated that the \nquotations circulating in the press are from a document in which the \nOMB simply ``collated and collected disparate comments from various \nagencies during the interagency review process of the proposed finding. \nThese collected comments were not necessarily internally consistent, \nsince they came from multiple sources, and they do not necessarily \nrepresent the views of either OMB or the Administration.'' Well, it is \nfine to say this, but that is where it came from. It came from the \nadministration. It is very fortunate we found it.\n\n  It begs the question: Does this document reflect one rogue leftover \nBush appointee, who, based on followup news\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nreports, actually appears to be a Democrat or does it reflect a more \nsystematic summary of comments from various agencies that have serious \nconcerns with the proposed finding, as Orszag suggested? I am hoping \nsomeone from the administration will come forth with a consistent \nresponse.\n  In either case, I welcome the comments as an open and honest \ndiscussion of the potential costs, benefits, and legal justifications \nfor such a finding.\n  Regardless of the Supreme Court decision, the EPA has the discretion \nto carefully weight the science and the causes and effects in its \ndetermination of endangerment, and, despite recent claims by \nadministration officials, it is under no court order to find in the \naffirmative that such greenhouse gases endanger public health or \nwelfare or cause or contribute to air pollution.\n  If we are going to have a debate on this issue, let's have it here in \nCongress, where the American people deserve an open and honest \ndiscussion about the costs and alleged benefits, about the \neffectiveness of such policies and what it will mean to the consumers \nwho ultimately pay the bill. As I said before, it is going to be the \npoorer Americans who pay the larger percentage of their incomes who are \ngoing to be punished.\n  By the way, we had the debate here. In the House, they have never had \nthe debate because it has never come up as an issue. Here we had the \ndebate during the ratification debate on the Kyoto treaty. And we had \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill, the Warner-Lieberman bill, the Boxer--there \nis another bill that came up just in the last year. So we have had the \ndebate, a full and open debate, and we are going to have to debate this \nissue because there is an effort to try to do through regulation what \nthey cannot do through open debate in the process on the floor.\n  The administration, and this EPA in particular, has claimed they will \nusher in a new era of transparency. In April, Administrator Jackson \nissued a sweeping memo to all EPA employees committing the agency to an \nunprecedented level of transparency. I applaud her for it. She told me \nthis in my office. We also found that she made this statement in a \nprivate memo to Members. So she is being very honest in what her effort \nis. I have a feeling a lot of this stuff is happening, and she is not \neven aware of it.\n  She says--and this is a quote; this is beautiful:\n\n       The success of our environmental efforts depends on earning \n     and maintaining the trust of the public we serve. The \n     American people will not trust us to protect their health or \n     their environment if they do not trust us to be transparent \n     and inclusive in our decision-making. To earn this trust, we \n     must conduct business with the public openly and fairly.\n\n  Again, this is Lisa Jackson, the new Administrator of the EPA. I \napplaud her for saying this.\n\n       This requires not only that EPA remain open and accessible \n     to those representing all points of view, but also that EPA \n     offices responsible for decisions take affirmative steps to \n     solicit the views of those who will be affected by these \n     decisions.\n\n  She went on to say at her confirmation hearing--not only did she \nreaffirm this statement, but she said she would be responsive to us on \nthe minority side, the same as she would be to the majority, and I \nbelieve that.\n  Certainly, the allegations in this White House memo make one question \nwhether the EPA is open and accessible to all points of view. For one \nthing, it was marked ``privileged and confidential,'' which tells me \nthat perhaps they knew about it, but then they did not want to use it \nand they did not want people to find out about it. Nonetheless, the \ndocument speaks for itself.\n  My colleagues may criticize the Bush administration for how it \nhandled the endangerment finding, but at least they did not try to bury \nor hide these types of comments when it proposed its advance notice of \nproposed rulemaking last summer. I know a lot of this sounds a little \nconfusing. This is a process you go through, an advance notice of \nproposed rulemaking. In fact, the previous administration; that is, the \nBush administration, went so far as to lay all of these comments out in \npublic view so all sides could be represented. If this latest action is \nany indication of how the EPA has begun to operate, then the American \npublic should have serious reason to be concerned.\n  On this CO2 endangerment issue--potentially the largest \nand most sweeping regulatory effort ever to be proposed--transparency \nshould be a cornerstone of every agency action. Opinions from all \nsides, pro and con--and certainly from all other agencies--should be \nweighed equally and fairly and, just as important, openly, in full view \nof the American people. The American people deserve to know all sides, \nall costs, and all benefits. This thing is so costly, and with the \nquestionable benefits, this is that much more important.\n  Because of these issues, I am hopeful the Administrator will commit \nto a determination on endangerment that would be based on the record of \nthe scientific data and empirical evidence rather than political or \nother nonscientific considerations. It is of the utmost importance that \nregulatory matters of this scope and magnitude be based on the most \nobjective, balanced scientific and empirical data.\n  While I am still hopeful that ultimately Congress or the agency will \ndecide to take this option off the table, a full on-the-record \nexamination during any endangerment rulemaking should be a minimum \nrequirement of transparency.\n  But the administration has essentially politicized the issue by \npresenting policymakers with a false choice. The choice is to use an \noutdated, ill-equipped, and economically disastrous option under the \nClean Air Act or pick another bad option--cap and trade--that commits \nus to requirements for unaffordable technology and would certainly be \nthe largest consistent annual tax increase in the history of \nAmerica. This isn't going to happen.\n\n  I would repeat we are fortunate in that we have had this debate, and \neach time we have the debate, there are more and more people who come \ndown and say: Well, I didn't know it was going to cost that much money. \nBack in the original Kyoto days, it appeared that a majority of the \npeople, in fact, in the Senate would support that type of an approach.\n  By the way, I have to say this: The Kyoto treaty was one thing. That \nis a treaty that affects the whole world, a lot of developed nations \nand some undeveloped nations. It was something you signed onto and \neveryone signs onto and everyone agrees to. Since that didn't happen--\nand even if you are one of those individuals who believes that \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, and methane are causing global \nwarming--if you believe it, which isn't true, but if you did believe \nit--then does it make sense for us to pass something unilaterally in \nthe Senate, making us less competitive than the rest of the world? What \nis going to happen to our manufacturing base? What is left of it is \ngoing to end up in places such as China, India, and Mexico, where they \ndon't have these emission requirements. What is going to happen then? \nThere will be a net increase in CO2.\n  Back to the memo, and I will conclude with this. I have to repeat \nwhat the memo says. This was a memo that was advice to the process from \nthe White House.\n\n       The finding rests heavily on the precautionary principle, \n     but the amount of acknowledged lack of understanding about \n     basic facts surrounding greenhouse gases would seem to \n     stretch the precautionary principle to providing for \n     regulation in the face of unprecedented uncertainty.\n\n  In other words, it is uncertain.\n  Further, it states:\n\n       There is a concern that EPA is making a finding based on \n     harm from substances that have no demonstrated direct health \n     effects such as respiratory or toxic effects, and that \n     available scientific data that purports to conclusively \n     establish the nature and extent of the adverse public health \n     and welfare effects are almost exclusively from non-EPA \n     sources.\n\n  That is an admission.\n  Finally:\n\n       Making the decision--\n\n  Which I hope we will not make the decision to do, but we will oppose \nthat decision--\n\n     to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act for the \n     first time is likely to have serious economic consequences \n     for regulated entities throughout the United States economy, \n     including small businesses and small communities.\n\n  In other words, nobody wins. Nobody wins.\n  So with that, I would say there is this effort that what they cannot \ndo\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nlegislatively they want to do through regulations, and we are not going \nto allow that to happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nyielding. There are two issues I wish to address. The first will be \nthis bill, in particular, the gift card title in the Credit Card Act. \nSecondly, I wish to speak a little bit about the NTSB hearings on \nflight 3407 which, as my colleagues know, crashed outside Buffalo and \nClarence with a tragic result.\n  First, before I get into the substance on gift cards, I wish to \ncommend Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and all the members of the \nBanking Committee for doing an excellent job on this bill. The bottom \nline is we need good, strong, tough regulation on credit cards. The \ndays when disclosure was enough are over. I happened to believe that \nonce and worked hard for disclosure measures. There is something called \nthe ``Schumer box'' that is on all credit card solicitations \napplications because it puts in large letters the interest rates. Back \nin the old days, that worked. Every credit card, even though interest \nrates were 6, 7, 8 percent, was at 19.8 percent, but you couldn't find \nthat out. So when people signed up for a credit card, they had no idea \nwhat interest rate they were paying. Once the box got on the \nsolicitations, on the applications, interest rates came down. Good old-\nfashioned American competition began to work.\n  But in recent years--maybe they just got smarter or maybe they got \nmore desperate for profits--credit card companies have found a way \naround disclosure. A person believes they are signing up for one rate, \nbut then in the fine print, basically, if you wake up out of bed, the \nrate goes higher--much higher. We have gotten letters and heard stories \nfrom people who were on a 7-percent fixed rate and it went up to 23 \npercent overnight.\n  If it is on a future balance, that is fine. You can get another \ncredit card. But it isn't. These rates go up on existing balances. \nLet's say you have a $4,000 balance, which is the average for American \nfamilies with credit cards. Calculate it. You go from 7 percent a month \non $4,000 to 23 percent on $4,000, and that is a difference of hundreds \nof dollars a month. These days, with the economy the way it is, with \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet, a couple hundred dollars a month \nis the difference between being able to survive and perhaps going \nbankrupt; being able to survive and not being able to provide some of \nthe basic necessities.\n  The legislation before us stops all those practices. The frustration, \nI must say, on both sides of the aisle, with the practices of the \ncredit card industry is mounting. I would say to those in the credit \ncard industry: Unless you get your act together, there may be other \namendments and bills you will not find to your liking. It is about time \nto be responsible. I understand the banking industry is in tough times, \nand we all hope they will recover, but to recover by taking advantage \nof consumers is unfair, unwise, wrong, and we aim to stop it with this \nlegislation.\n  The provision I wish to address specifically is one that I worked on \nwith the Presiding Officer. We are both sponsors. The Senator from \nColorado has done great work on this legislation, and I wish to thank \nhim for his assistance as we move it forward. I also wish to thank, on \nthis particular issue, both Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby, who walked \nthe extra mile. I think it shows that if you work hard at legislating, \nand you are willing to compromise, it pays off. The original bill the \nPresiding Officer and I put in was tougher than the proposal here, but \nthe proposal here is good and strong. It makes a huge difference \nbetween what exists now--which is virtually nothing--and what will \nbecome law, and it is something I think everyone can be proud of.\n  I also wish to thank those in the consumer industry. As do I, as well \nas the Presiding Officer, they wanted a stronger bill, but they \nunderstood that when you legislate, you can't let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good. Getting something strong is better than getting \nnothing, even if you would have preferred something stronger.\n  Well, we are all familiar with gift cards. In many ways, they are the \nperfect present. You get the opportunity to choose whatever you want \nthe most. When you get a gift card, it is great. You can think of 15 \ndifferent things you want and decide which one you want to buy. You can \ngo to the store, pick out what you want, and get it without spending a \ndime of your own money.\n  We have all opened that gift from Aunt Edna and wished she had spent \nthe money on a gift card instead of that sweater you are never going to \nwear. I, for one, am not very good at picking out gifts. So gift cards \nare a boon to me, not only as a recipient but as somebody who gives \ngifts because I can buy the gift card, and I can breathe a sigh of \nrelief that my family member or friend will have something they want \ninstead of something I have chosen that they might not want at all, \nwhich often happens when I choose gifts. I guess I am a little like \nAunt Edna.\n  Gift cards are a very good thing, and we don't want to snuff them out \nor limit their extent.\n\n  But what most people do not realize is that these gift cards often \ncome with hidden fees and short expiration dates. After a period of \ntime that can be as short as 6 months, the issuer begins charging value \noff the cards, reducing their value and depriving recipients of their \ngifts. That means if your mom or aunt or friend did their holiday \nshopping early, by the time April or May rolled around, you could be \nslowly but surely giving your gift card back to the bank piece by piece \nby piece.\n  Consumers usually pay a high fee when you buy the card, sometimes as \nmuch as 20 percent of the value. Well, on top of that, the recipient of \nthe cards faces other charges such as monthly maintenance fees, \ndormancy fees or even a separate fee for each time the card is used. \nThat is not fair. It is not fair when you get a gift card, say, at \nChristmastime and you say: I will save it until June to buy something I \ncan use in the summer, and you go to the store and the gift card \ndoesn't have the whole value on the card. That is not right. It is not \nfair. Frankly, it is not what the giver signed up for when he or she \nbought that card and gave it to you in a gesture of friendship or love.\n  For years, issuers of these cards have used fees to make hefty \nprofits, largely on the backs of consumers, but with this legislation \nwe are going to ensure that recipients are protected and can use their \ncards free of these duplicitous fees for a reasonable period of time.\n  First, the bill ensures that no fee can be charged unless there is no \nactivity on the card for 12 consecutive months from the date on which \nthe last charge is imposed. Let me explain. If you purchased the card \nthe week before Christmas and give it to your child, parent, spouse on \nChristmas Day, for a whole year, until next Christmas, that card \ndoesn't decline in value one penny. That is a very good thing and very \nmuch needed. During that year, if you use the card once but don't use \nthe whole value--let's say it is a $50 card and you buy something for \n$22--the 12-month period starts again so you have plenty of time to use \nthe card.\n  Second, the bill will require the Federal Reserve to determine a fair \namount for the fees and set a minimum balance above which fees can't be \ncharged. So the issuers aren't charging people exorbitant rates to use \ntheir cards and aren't taking up the entire value of the cards with \nthese fees. If, for instance, the gift card is for $50 and they charge \nyou $5 a month, within 10 months, the gift card is useless. It is my \nview the fee will not be more than $1 or $1.50 when the regulator sets \nit, and it will give the gift card a much longer life. Of course, we \nare leaving it up to the Federal Reserve.\n  We are also letting them set a minimum balance. My guess is it will \nbe $15 or so, above which the fee doesn't bite in, so the gift card \nwill last a lot longer.\n  Fourth, the bill ensures that gift cards have expiration dates of at \nleast 5 years from the time they are issued. It is simply unfair to \ncancel the gift totally after 6 months or even a year. So now the gift \ncard stays in existence for 5 years.\n  I believe this legislation makes gift cards fairer, better, and even \nhappier gifts to give during the holiday season, for birthdays or an \nanniversary. I encourage people to use the gift card.\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\n  One other point I think is very important. This legislation, for the \nfirst time, will make sure that so-called open loop cards--the kind \nwhich can be used anywhere and that you get as a holiday present--will \nbe regulated at all. There has been no regulation before. Consumers \nUnion, U.S. PIRG, the National Consumer Law Center, and the Consumer \nFederation of America all support the actions we are taking on this \nissue. We have heard from one of the biggest gift card issuers that \nthey, too, are comfortable with this bill because we are making \ncommonsense changes to this business to ensure that consumers can get a \nfair deal and that issuers can continue to offer these valuable \nproducts. The bottom line: You get a gift card, you know it is going to \nhave its full value for at least a year, with no expiration date, no \nmonthly fee that takes a chunk off the gift card. It means what you are \ngiving the recipient is getting, nothing less.\n  At the end of the day, the reason this bill has been so important to \nme and to the Senator from Colorado, who worked so hard on it with me \nand others, is we want to protect consumers who purchase these products \nas gifts for their friends and loved ones. Consumers who purchase or \nreceive a $50 gift card should get $50 in value without having to pay \nexcessive fees.\n\n\n                   Continental Connection Flight 3407\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit about the conclusion of \nthe NTSB hearings that occurred this week in reference to Continental \nConnection Flight 3407.\n  We all know what happened on that flight. On February 12, 2009, the \nlives of family members, many of whom live in western New York, changed \nin a tragic and dramatic way when they lost their loved ones on a \nBuffalo-bound flight from Newark Airport.\n  I met with some of these family members on Tuesday--nine family \nmembers who lost loved ones on that flight. First, I have to express my \nrespect and admiration for these family members. It was a little less \nthan 3 months ago that they lost a husband, a wife, a child, a parent, \nor a fiance, and there is a huge hole in their hearts. Yet they were \ndown in Washington making sure that a thorough investigation was done \nto determine why flight 3407 crashed, and then to continue working to \nsee that corrective measures were taken on all other flights, so that \nwhat befell their loved ones would not happen to others. It was an act \nof bravery, courage, strength, fortitude, generosity, and compassion. \nThe people in that room--and we had some heartfelt moments together--\nwere saintly. They were trying to light a candle amidst the darkness \nthat enveloped their lives. I felt for them when we met, as I feel for \nthem today.\n  The crash of flight 3407 in Clarence, NY, claimed 50 lives and serves \nas a tragic reminder that our Nation's aviation industry is not immune \nto tragic incidents.\n  The 3-day-long hearings at NTSB have revealed some very disturbing \nsuggestions into what may have caused the crash of the Bombardier Dash \n8 Q400 airplane.\n  First, I am troubled by the reports that the Colgan pilots of the \nDash 8 were not adequately trained in the operation of the ``stick-\npusher''--the instrument installed in aircraft like the Dash 8 that \nprevents an aircraft from stalling. The stick-pusher is not \ndemonstrated in pilot flight training simulators, and experts believe \nthat the pilots are missing out on important hands-on training.\n  Suffice it to say that when the flight flew over Clarence, just \nbefore it crashed, the pilots may not have been adequately trained to \ndeal with what was happening.\n  Colgan maintains that the FAA does not require this kind of simulator \ntraining. Today, I have written to Secretary Ray LaHood and asked that \nhe reevaluate FAA's approval of airline training curricula.\n  We have also learned that the pilots of flight 3407 were not properly \nrested before their flights. It is obvious why. The young copilot of \nthe flight lived in a suburb of Seattle, and her salary was $16,000 a \nyear. She flew across country, tired, sleeping in an empty pilot seat, \nif she could--no stop, no rest, and then boarded the flight to Newark \nthat she was copilot of on its way to Buffalo. It seems that it may \nbe--I hope not, but it seems like it--that some commuter airlines both \nunderpay and overwork their pilots to save costs. There is an \nunfortunate possibility that they could put safety second, with cost \ncutting first. That just cannot be. That has to change.\n  The second thing I am doing is urging the FAA not only to look at the \nnumber of hours that a pilot can fly--they have regulations for that--\nbut the conditions which a pilot who begins a flight has endured \nprevious to the flight, so that they are alert and rested as their \ntenure for that day or that few days begins.\n  The airline industry is evolving. What we are seeing is more and more \nsmaller commuter airlines, and the FAA is not keeping up. The FAA needs \nto crack down on issues of pilot rest, compensation, and training, \nespecially with these young airlines that seem to be prioritizing \nissues of saving money. They should be making priority No. 1 the issue \nof safety.\n  For the last 8 years, the FAA has had ineffective leadership with one \ngoal: to cut costs. The head of the FAA--I met her and had arguments \nwith her--seemed to take direction almost all the time from the OMB. \nAll of us believe we should cut costs in this Government--I certainly \ndo--but not when it comes to safety. I believe that the FAA, which \nrequires the small commuter airlines to observe the same regulations as \nthe larger airlines, hasn't kept up enforcing the rules with so many of \nthe commuter airlines out there.\n  The crash investigation also initially suggested that icing \nconditions may have affected the aircraft. A bright light was shed on \nthe fact that the NTSB and the FAA have differing recommendations as to \nhow a pilot should handle an icing situation, and that the NTSB first \nasked the FAA to adopt the NTSB's recommendations 12 years ago--to no \navail.\n  For this reason, I, along with my colleagues Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Dorgan, called for an official GAO investigation into what \nspecific roles the NTSB and the FAA should be playing in aircraft icing \nprevention, and why such a lag exists between the time the NTSB makes a \nrecommendation and the FAA formally adopts it. It seems to me--these \nare just my observations--that the NTSB does put safety first, and I \nsometimes wonder if the FAA is always doing that.\n  The GAO has informed us that they are in the process of forming an \ninvestigatory team for our request and will begin to pursue answers \nsoon.\n  In conclusion, I cannot say enough how humbled I am by the work of \nall of flight 3407's family members. It is a tribute to their loved \nones' lives that they are in Washington to advocate for aviation \nsafety. I assured them, as we talked and prayed together, that I would \ndo everything I could to make sure we get to the bottom of what \nhappened on flight 3407, and then take whatever corrective action needs \nto be taken to prevent future flights such as 3407 from crashing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                            Aung San Suu Kyi\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I briefly rise on the floor today to \ndiscuss the latest outrage in the long-suffering country of Burma. I \nspeak of the imprisonment of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu \nKyi.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi is the leader of Burma's National League for \nDemocracy, the party that won the country's 1990 elections decisively--\nelections that were quickly nullified by the Burmese military. She has \nbeen imprisoned by the thuggish military junta that runs that country. \nMs. Suu Kyi has spent the majority of the past two decades under house \narrest. Now the Government has moved this remarkable woman to Insein \nPrison compound and charged her with violating the terms of her house \narrest, which was illegal to start with. She faces a potential sentence \nof 5 years in jail. Two other NLD members face similar charges.\n  While reports remain somewhat opaque, these charges appear to stem \nfrom the uninvited visit of a United States individual who entered Ms. \nSuu Kyi's home compound after swimming across a nearby lake. He then \nreportedly stayed on her compound for 2 days, despite requests to \nleave. Based on this occurrence, the regime appears now to allege that \nMs. Suu Kyi has broken the law by not requesting permission in advance \nto have a visitor.\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nAs a penalty, then, for an uninvited person showing up on her \ndoorstep--while she remained imprisoned inside--the Burmese regime \nproposes to sentence her for up to 5 years in jail.\n  All of this represents, of course, the latest pretext dreamt up by \nthe Burmese junta in order to prevent the legitimately elected leader \nof the country from interfering in its plans for dominance. The \ngenerals who run the country are planning ``elections'' to be held next \nyear, and which they believe will legitimize their illegitimate rule. \nThey seek ways to ensure that Ms. Suu Kyi and other NLD members are not \nfree to participate in these elections, since it is the NLD--and not \nthe military junta--that has the support of the Burmese people. As \npolitical prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, fill Burmese jails, \nthe international community should see this process for the sham it \nrepresents.\n\n  I once had the great honor of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a \nwoman of astonishing courage and incredible resolve. Her determination \nin the face of tyranny inspires me and every individual who holds \ndemocracy dear. Her resilience in the face of untold sufferings, her \ncourage at the hands of a cruel junta, and her composure despite years \nof oppression inspire the world.\n  Because she stands for freedom, this heroic woman has endured \nattacks, arrests, captivity, and untold sufferings at the hands of the \nregime. Burma's rulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she \nrepresents: peace, freedom, and justice for all Burmese people. The \nthugs who run Burma have tried to stifle her voice, but they will never \nextinguish her moral courage.\n  The world must now respond to the junta's latest outrage in a way \nthat demonstrates the inevitability of those values she so clearly \ndemonstrates. The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the National \nLeague for Democracy must be the world's work. We must continue to \npress the junta until it is willing to negotiate an irreversible \ntransition to democratic rule. The Burmese people deserve no less. This \nmeans renewing the sanctions that will expire this year, and it means \nvigorous enforcement by our Treasury Department of the targeted \nfinancial sanctions in place against regime leaders. It means being \nperfectly clear that we stand on the side of freedom for the Burmese \npeople and against those who abridge it.\n  The message of solidarity with the Burmese people should come from \nall quarters, and that includes their closest neighbors, the ASEAN \ncountries. The United States, European countries, and others have \ncondemned her arrest and call for her immediate release.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time a \ndeclaration of the Council of the European Union, and others by the \nFederation of International Rights, and the International Federation of \nHuman Rights.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Declaration of the Presidency on Behalf of the European Union on Daw \n                            Aung San Suu Kyi\n\n       The European Union expresses its strong concern following \n     reports on the health of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the \n     National League of Democracy and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, \n     and on the recent detention of her physician, Dr Tin Myo Win.\n       The EU calls on the authorities of Burma/Myanmar to \n     guarantee for Ms Suu Kyi immediate and proper medical care, \n     as well as access for her personal attorney. It furthermore \n     recalls that her house arrest, which has been imposed in \n     clear breach of international norms, will expire this month, \n     and therefore again urgently calls for her unconditional \n     release.\n       On the sad occasion of the anniversary of Ms Suu Kyi's \n     detention, the EU urges the authorities to halt systematic \n     torture and denial of health care to prisoners and to release \n     all political prisoners.\n       ``The regime's fear of the widespread popularity of Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi remains, and they hope to keep her silent \n     and hidden before the 2010 elections. There is widespread \n     anger in Burma over the sham constitution the election is \n     based on, and the only way to bring peace and stability to \n     our country is by genuinely involving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in \n     the process of national reconciliation. Otherwise, the \n     results could be disastrous'', said Mahkaw Khun Sa, General \n     Secretary of Ethnic Nationalities Council.\n       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi remains the world's only imprisoned \n     Nobel Peace Prize recipient.\n                                  ____\n\n\nInternational Community Must Ensure Release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and \n                               Her Doctor\n\n       Seven leading alliances, representing all major ethnic and \n     political forces of Burma's democracy movement, today express \n     deep concern for the security and health of Daw Aung San Suu \n     Kyi and urgently call for her immediate and unconditional \n     release, as well as the release of her doctor Dr. Tin Myo \n     Win.\n       There is serious concern for the health of Daw Aung San Suu \n     Kyi. She is found with low blood pressure and dehydration and \n     must immediately receive thorough medical attention. Her \n     doctor, Dr. Tin Myo Win, who has been the only person allowed \n     to visit her for monthly check-ups, was detained by \n     authorities on May 7, and his whereabouts is unknown and it \n     is uncertain when he will be released.\n       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 of \n     the past 19 years, and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary \n     Detention recently declared her continual detention illegal. \n     Her detention legally expired on May 24, 2008. While the \n     people of Burma and the world eagerly await for her release \n     as her year-long extension is set to expire, it is of grave \n     concern that the military regime may continue to hold her \n     without any charges.\n       Besides, they must not use false charges, such as the \n     incident of the intrusion of the foreigner into her home on \n     May 3rd, to try and further incarcerate her and Dr. Tin Myo \n     Win.\n       ``From the beginning of her arrest, authorities declared \n     that they had to detain Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for the reason \n     of `protective custody' and thus the authorities are the ones \n     responsible for the intrusion,'' said Moe Zaw Oo, Foreign \n     Affairs Secretary, National League for Democracy--Liberated \n     Area.\n       The seven alliances, representing a broad-based democracy \n     and ethnic forces, urgently call on the United Nations \n     Secretary General, as well as ASEAN and key regional \n     countries to take urgent and firm measures to ensure the \n     immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and Dr. Tin Myo Win.\n       ``The continual detention and mistreatment of Daw Aung San \n     Suu Kyi and the other 2100 political prisoners in Burma \n     stands against international and regional laws and \n     principles, and there should be no hesitation by the \n     international community to guarantee their direct release,'' \n     said Thin Thin Aung, Presidium Board member of Women's League \n     of Burma.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          International Federation\n\n\n                                             for Human Rights,\n\n                                              Paris, May 14, 2009.\n     His Excellency Ban Ki Moon,\n     Secretary General of the United Nations, United Nations \n         Secretariat, New York, NY.\n       Dear Secretary General: The International Federation for \n     Human Rights is addressing to you in order to request your \n     urgent intervention in Burma/Myanmar in favor of the Nobel \n     Prize for Peace and leader of the National League for \n     Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       FIDH has already expressed its deep concern regarding the \n     health of Daw Suu Kyi, following information that her \n     situation had worsened in the past few days. Ms. Suu Kyi's \n     blood pressure was reportedly low, she was suffering from \n     dehydration and had stopped eating. In addition, her medical \n     doctor, the physician Tin Myo was arrested on May 7th, \n     following his visit to Ms. Suu Kyi and is still under \n     detention.\n       Unfortunately and despite the fragile state of health of \n     the Nobel Peace Prize, FIDH was informed that Daw Aung San \n     Suu Kyi has been transferred to Insein prison in Yangoon, and \n     appeared today before a special court, in order to hear the \n     charges against her, her two live-in party members Daw Khin \n     Khin Win and her daughter Win Ma Ma and an American man, John \n     William Yettaw. They are all charged under section 22 of the \n     State Protection Act (Law Safeguarding the State from the \n     Dangers of Subversive Elements). The charges relate to the \n     violations of the rules and regulations surrounding her house \n     arrest. If she is convicted of this offence, she will be \n     subject up to three years of imprisonment under this article. \n     During her appearance before the court today, Ms. Suu Kyi was \n     not asked any questions. The judge ordered the defendants to \n     return to court again on May 18, 2009.\n       According to the latest information, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     Daw Khin Khin Win and Daw Win Ma Ma were not sent back to \n     their residence. They are currently detained in Insein \n     prison.\n       The International Federation for Human Rights condemns in \n     the strongest possible terms this new campaign of \n     intimidation and harassment against the Nobel Peace Prize, \n     ahead of the 2010 elections and just some days before her \n     house arrest is due to expire at the end of May. This last \n     episode deprives the ``road-map to democracy'' and the \n     electoral process in Burma/Myanmar from any legitimacy.\n       The United Nations and you personally have been long \n     engaged for the reconciliation process of all parties in \n     Burma and the dialogue with the Burmese authorities. The \n     United Nations have received in the past harsh criticism for \n     the absence of concrete measures to improve the human rights \n     situation in Burma/Myanmar, despite the strong engagement of \n     the various United Nations mechanisms.\n       The intentions of the Burma/Myanmar authorities are \n     seriously questioned today worldwide, it is time for the \n     United Nations\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\n     Security Council and you personally to take urgent action for \n     the immediate and unconditional release of Ms. Suu Kyi. Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi has a crucial role to play in the \n     democratization process in Burma as a major political \n     interlocutor. The collective responsibility of the \n     international community and of the United Nations in \n     particular, to protect the Nobel Peace Prize is now even more \n     crucial than ever. FIDH is trustful that the United Nations \n     will step up to this duty and guarantee the safety, security \n     and freedom of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       I'm urging you personally to act as soon as possible to \n     protect her integrity. The urgency of the situation requests \n     coordinated and strong action.\n       Hoping that you will take the above considerations fully \n     into account, I remain,\n                                                Souhayr Belhassen,\n                                                   FIDH President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the country's of Southeast Asia should be \nat the forefront of this call. ASEAN now has a human rights charter, in \nwhich member countries have committed to protect and promote human \nrights. Now is the time to live up to that commitment. ASEAN could \nstart by dispatching envoys to Rangoon in order to demand the immediate \nand unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. This courageous leader, \nand all those Burmese who have followed her lead in pressing for their \nown inalienable rights, should know all free people stand with you and \nsupport you. The world is watching not only your brave actions but also \nthose of the military government whose cruelty and incompetence know no \nbounds. Burma's future will be one of peace and freedom, not violence \nand repression. We, as Americans, stand on the side of freedom, not \nfear of peace, not violence, and with the millions in Burma who aspire \nto a better life, not those who would keep them isolated and oppressed.\n\n  The United States has a critical role to play in Burma and throughout \nthe world as the chief voices for the rights and integrity of all \npersons. It is a role we suppress at the world's peril and our own. A \nstrong public defense of the rights of oppressed people has been and \nmust remain an enduring element in American foreign policy. Nothing can \nrelieve us of the responsibility to stand for those whose human rights \nare in peril or the knowledge that we stand for something in this world \ngreater than self-interest. Should we need inspiration to guide us, we \nneed look no further to that astonishingly courageous leader, Aung San \nSuu Kyi.\n  The junta's latest actions are once again a desperate attempt by a \ndecaying regime to stall freedom's inevitable success in Burma and \nacross Asia. They will fail, as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi's campaign \nfor a free Burma will one day succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Credit Card \nAccountability and Disclosure Act of 2009 and the ways in which I \nbelieve this measure is in the best interests of my constituents in \nNorth Carolina.\n  Before I begin, I would like to thank my colleagues from Connecticut \nand Alabama, Senators Dodd and Shelby, for bringing together concerns \nand ideas from both sides of the aisle to craft a bipartisan \ncompromise. This bill could not come at a more critical time for North \nCarolina's hardworking families.\n  More often than not, through no fault of their own, North Carolina \nfamilies are suffering tremendously during this time--the harshest \neconomic climate since the Great Depression. Our unemployment rate is \n10.8 percent--the fourth highest in the Nation. Home values have \ndeclined dramatically. Many families have lost nearly all their \nsavings. Nearly a half million jobs have been lost in North Carolina. \nFrom banking to manufacturing, North Carolina is home to some of the \nindustries that have taken the biggest hit in this economic downturn. \nTo say the least, the situation is dire for many families in North \nCarolina and around the country.\n  The people of my State are hardworking and honest. While they are \nstruggling to make this month's mortgage payment or put food on the \ntable for their families, they are troubled by next week's and next \nmonth's bills. They are concerned about the unexpected expenses they \nmay have to bear--for example, an illness or their car breaking down. \nWith all the other issues these families are dealing with in this \neconomic downturn, imagine realizing that you are still paying interest \non a balance you thought you had already paid or watching that interest \nrate double because times are tight and you fell just a little behind.\n  Unfair, yet all-too-common credit card practices, such as interest \ncharges on debt paid on time--a practice known as double-cycle \nbilling--arbitrary interest rate increases, and exorbitant and \nunnecessary fees are only making matters worse for families who are \nalready struggling just to get by. Obviously, it costs money to borrow \nmoney. Nobody is suggesting that credit card issuers shouldn't be able \nto make a profit. But for consumers the rules should be fair, \ntransparent, and exactly the same from the beginning to the end.\n  I support the Dodd-Shelby amendment because it requires just that. \nThe bottom line is that this bill restores fairness and sensibility to \ncredit cards and a sense of security to families in North Carolina. \nThis bill ensures that credit card companies honor their promises and \nspecifies that the card companies can't change the rules in the middle \nof the game. While North Carolina's families are struggling, they \nshouldn't have to worry about hitting a moving target when it comes to \npaying their bills.\n  The Dodd-Shelby amendment will also provide consumers with simple, \nclear information that allows them to make informed decisions that make \nthe most sense for themselves and their families. One important step \nwhich will provide consumers with the information they need to make \ntheir choice is the payoff timing disclosure language included in this \nbill. The legislation we are considering would require credit card \nissuers to prominently display two important numbers on billing \nstatements: the amount of time it would take to pay off the bill if the \ncardholder is paying only the minimum balance due each month, and the \nminimum monthly payment required to pay off the entire bill in 36 \nmonths.\n  For example, it would take a cardholder with a $4,000 balance and an \n18-percent interest rate, making the minimum payments, nearly 6 years \nto pay off their credit card. It costs next to nothing for issuers to \nprovide borrowers with this information, but this information can be \nextremely helpful as cardholders try to become more efficient in their \nfinancial planning.\n  Ultimately, by keeping the rules fair, clear, and consistent, we can \nsave American families thousands of dollars each year. As we work to \nright this ship and get our economy moving again, I cannot imagine this \nrelief coming at a better time for North Carolina's families.\n  I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate and voice my support \nfor this measure. My constituents deserve progress, not lip service, on \nthis and so many other important issues that they are grappling with in \nthese hard economic times.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Credit CARD Act of 2009. I \nwant to commend the chairman of the Banking Committee for his \noutstanding efforts to craft this legislation. I also appreciate the \nwork done by Senator Shelby in developing a bill that should be able to \ngarner broad bipartisan support and become law.\n  Too many in our country are burdened by significant credit card debt. \nNot enough has been done to protect consumers and ensure they are able \nto properly manage their credit burden. We must do more to educate, \nprotect, and empower consumers. Although this comprehensive legislation \nhas numerous provisions that benefit consumers, my remarks will focus \non the portion of the legislation which is based on my legislation, the \nCredit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act. I originally introduced the \nact in the 108th Congress. I have greatly appreciated the efforts of \nSenators Durbin, Schumer, and Leahy, who helped develop and support\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nthe legislation. I also want to acknowledge Senator Feinstein for her \ncontributions on this issue.\n  We attempted to attach our legislation as an amendment to improve the \nflawed minimum payment warning in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Act. \nOn March 2, 2005, an editorial in the Washington Post criticized the \nbankruptcy legislation then being considered. The editorial stated, \n``at the very least, as Senator Daniel K. Akaka has proposed, credit \ncard issuers, who now send out five billion solicitations a year . . . \nought to be required to disclose to borrowers the true cost of making \nonly the minimum payments.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the entire editorial be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks. Unfortunately, our amendment was defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, although there have been some modifications \nand additions, the Credit CARD Act contains the primary provisions of \nmy legislation. The legislation requires that consumers be told how \nlong it will take to repay their entire balance if they make only \nminimum payments. The total cost if the consumer pays only the minimum \npayment, would also have to be disclosed. These provisions will make \nindividuals much more aware of the true cost of credit card debt. \nConsumers would have to be provided with the amount they need to pay to \neliminate their outstanding balance within 36 months, which is a \ntypical length of a debt management plan.\n  The personalized payment disclosures are important, but consumers \nmust be given opportunities to find reputable credit counseling \nservices. Section 201 also includes our requirement for creditors to \nestablish and maintain a toll-free number so that consumers can access \ntrustworthy credit counselors. The toll-free number will have to appear \non credit card billing statements along with the minimum payment \nwarning information. More working families are trying to survive \nfinancially and meet their financial obligations. Consumers often seek \nout help from credit counselors to better manage their debt burdens. It \nis extremely troubling that unscrupulous credit counselors exploit \nindividuals who are trying to locate the assistance that they need. As \nfinancial pressures increase for working families, credit counseling \nbecomes even more important. The CARD Act will assist working families \nwith finding credit counselors that will help, rather than exploit, \nthem.\n  Yesterday, I filed an amendment to the CARD Act to simplify the \nadministration of the credit counseling referral provision. The \namendment requires the Federal Reserve Board to issue the guidelines \nfor the development and maintenance by creditors of a toll-free number \nto provide information about credit counseling and debt management \nservices. Referrals for credit counseling services via the toll-free \nnumber could only go to nonprofit credit counseling agencies approved \nby U.S. bankruptcy trustees. This modification will utilize an existing \napproval process and list of reputable credit counselors rather than \ncreating a new approval process for the purposes of section 201. I \nthank the chairman and ranking member for their willingness to accept \nthis amendment.\n  After many years, it appears that we may finally be enacting a bill \nthat will educate, protect, and empower credit card consumers. Once \nagain, I thank Chairman Dodd for all of his outstanding efforts to help \nworking families. The administration also deserves credit for their \nefforts to help move this legislation closer to enactment. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the administration \non this and other essential consumer protection legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 2005]\n\n                      Fixing the Bankruptcy System\n\n       Until this year, the seemingly perennial congressional \n     debate about overhauling the nation's bankruptcy laws was \n     something of an academic exercise: The measure wasn't going \n     to pass because Senate Democrats insisted on an abortion \n     amendment unacceptable to the House. Now, with a bolstered \n     Republican majority, it's not clear that Democrats can muster \n     enough votes for that amendment, which would prevent \n     antiabortion protesters from filing for bankruptcy to evade \n     damage awards. As a result, the underlying question about the \n     bankruptcy bill suddenly matters: Does it strike the right \n     balance between preserving the protections of bankruptcy and \n     preventing abuse by spendthrifts? The bill is neither as \n     draconian as its opponents protest nor as balanced as its \n     supporters proclaim. Its central tenet, that those who can \n     repay some of their debts ought to do so, is reasonable. But \n     the bill could be made fairer with a number of amendments set \n     to be considered.\n       The number of Americans filing for bankruptcy exploded in \n     the past quarter-century. In 1980, there was one personal \n     bankruptcy filing for every 336 households in the United \n     States; in 1993, one for every 144 households; and in 2003, \n     one for every 73 households. But there is little agreement on \n     the cause of this growth. Those who support tightening \n     bankruptcy laws say the system is abused by people who could \n     repay their debts but are no longer deterred by the stigma \n     once associated with bankruptcy. Those who oppose the change \n     say credit card companies entice borrowers to run up their \n     bills; they also cite the toll of medical debt among those \n     who lack adequate health insurance.\n       The Senate bill would tighten access to the most generous \n     and popular form of bankruptcy, Chapter 7. People filing for \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy can wipe out their debts and get a \n     ``fresh start.'' The bill would impose a means test: Debtors \n     who earn less than the median income in their state--about 80 \n     percent of those who file for bankruptcy--still would be \n     entitled to file under Chapter 7. But those who earn more \n     than that--and who have the ability to repay at least $6,000 \n     over five years--would have to file under Chapter 13, which \n     requires a repayment plan. Experts estimate that means \n     testing would affect no more than 10 percent of consumer \n     bankruptcy filers.\n       In theory a means test is reasonable, but the test in this \n     legislation is unnecessarily rigid. It considers the previous \n     six months of earnings, even if the bankruptcy filer is now \n     out of work. Moreover, once filers show that their income is \n     below the median, there's no reason to require them to \n     provide additional information. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-\n     Mass.) has outlined amendments to address these issues, as \n     well as a sensible proposal that would provide a $150,000 \n     homestead exemption to help the elderly and those driven to \n     bankruptcy by medical expenses keep their homes.\n       If the Senate tightens rules for those filing for \n     bankruptcy, it also should crack down on the corporate \n     practices that contribute to the problem. At the very least, \n     as Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) has proposed, credit card \n     issuers, who now send out 5 billion solicitations a year and \n     whose profits have soared, ought to be required to disclose \n     to borrowers the true cost of making only the minimum payment \n     on their balances.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             General Motors\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it has come to my attention that General \nMotors, one of America's largest corporations--that General Motors, \nwhich is seeking Federal assistance to save their business--now has \nplans to take that money and create jobs. That should be good news. \nThat is, after all, what Congress intended; that General Motors take \nmoney the Government loans them and taxpayers send to them, that it \nawarded a U.S. company--this company--more than $15 billion in Federal \nloans earlier this year, that they would, in fact, create jobs.\n  But that is why I was in a state of disbelief last night when I \nlearned General Motors is not going to create those jobs in the United \nStates, not in my State of Ohio, not in Michigan, not in Indiana, not \nin big auto States, not in Missouri, they are going to create jobs not \nin the United States, those States which continue to hemorrhage auto \njobs.\n  In fact, what GM wants to do is take our tax dollars and create jobs \nin China by building a new car, a car they will then export back into \nthe United States for Americans to purchase. Let me say that again. GM \nis taking U.S. tax dollars, going to close American auto plants, open \nnew auto plants in China, then sell those cars it produces back into \nthe United States to Americans.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\n  The audacity of such a plan cannot be emphasized enough. In short, it \nis outrageous. It appears that what is good for GM is no longer good \nfor America. This is a slap in the face to American autoworkers, to \nAmerican taxpayers, to American communities. It is a slap in the face \nto every autoworker in Ohio, in neighboring Michigan, in every State \nwhere men and women work hard and play by the rules and pay their \ntaxes, not just States that produce autos, but the States--all 50 of \nour States--that produce auto parts, components and tires and glass and \ndoor locks and all the other kinds of things that go into cars.\n  These funds, those auto funds that came from taxpayers, were meant to \nrebuild our Nation's middle class, not dismantle it, not dismantle the \nmiddle class, not shut these plants and then send jobs overseas.\n  If GM officials think U.S. taxpayers will finance cars made in China \nwhile American plants are closing, GM is either tone deaf or tunnel \nvisioned. I would urge GM not to betray the working men and women of \nour Nation. We have the most talented labor force and qualified \nautoworkers anywhere, bar none.\n  I would invite GM officials to travel with me across Ohio; to Lorain, \nto Twinsburg, to Lordstown, all auto plants, all auto cities. That is \njust in northeast Ohio alone. All across our State we have the \ngreatest, most talented labor force to build these cars. We have the \nfacilities to produce these cars.\n  The question is whether GM has any commitment to our Nation, a nation \nwhose taxpayers are working to rescue them. There is no excuse for GM \nusing taxpayer funds for Chinese imports, not when there are American \nworkers ready to build these cars, when there are shut down or idled \nU.S. auto plants prepared to produce them.\n  Smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles represent the future of the \nauto industry, and American workers can produce and must produce those \nvehicles in the United States. Ohio workers will not stand idly by \nwhile GM sends these jobs and our tax dollars overseas to a nation with \nlittle or no labor standards and woefully weak safety standards.\n  Interestingly, when you think about the safety of these cars that \nmay, in fact, be built by GM in China and sent back to the United \nStates, think about some of the practices in other consumer products. \nThink about what happened with contaminated products, contaminated \ningredients that went into Heparin, a blood-thinning drug that came \nback and killed some 100 Americans because of contaminated ingredients, \nor think about Hasbro toys, which were outsourced to China, where those \nChinese subcontractors put lead-based paint on these toys. They came \nback to the United States and had toxic parts-per-million amounts of \nlead in the paint and on those toys.\n  If GM wants to receive more funds from U.S. taxpayers, it must commit \nto using those tax dollars to maintain jobs and production at home. \nToday, I wrote Secretary Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nurging the Obama administration, as part of the terms of further \nGovernment assistance, to require GM to invest in U.S. production.\n  The President's Auto Task Force has a difficult job. Its mission is \nto guide GM toward long-term viability and toward success. Given the \nnumber of auto manufacturing layoffs in my State, given the sacrifices \nautoworkers and their families continue to make to facilitate the \nrestructuring of GM, I do not see how the administration can, in good \nconscience, provide taxpayer funds to support General Motors' \noffshoring of auto production.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Derivatives Regulation\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to discuss what I hope will be \na turning point on our road to economic recovery. The Obama \nadministration yesterday asked Congress to swiftly pass sweeping and \nhistoric regulatory reforms on derivatives, credit default swaps, \ncommodities trading, and other sectors of the financial marketplace \nthat collapsed last year under the weight of unrestrained speculation. \nThe road to this point has not been easy. For months I have been urging \nthe administration to move quickly to propose strong regulatory \ncontrols on these markets, require transparency in derivatives trading, \nand restrict market manipulation. With the announcement yesterday by \nTreasury Secretary Geithner in a letter he sent to Senate and House \nleaders, the administration has come down decisively on the side of \nimposing order on a marketplace whose collapse made this current \nrecession so much deeper and more painful for the average American than \nit needed to be.\n  The administration clearly supported in writing bringing the \nunregulated ``dark'' over-the-counter derivative markets under full \nregulation for the very first time. The administration has correctly \nidentified the top three key goals of regulatory reform in the \nunregulated over-the-counter derivatives market. First, transparency on \nall dark markets. All derivative transaction dealers will be brought \nunder prudential regulation and supervision which means capital \nadequacy requirements, antifraud and antimanipulation authority, and \nvery clear transparency and reporting requirements.\n  Second, all standardized trading of physical commodities and other \nderivatives will finally be required to be traded on fully regulated \nexchanges.\n  Third, imposing position limits on regulated markets to prevent any \nmarket player from amassing large positions that can harm the market. I \nhave received in e-mail additional assurances from the administration \nthat they believe these position limits should be applied in the \naggregate across all contract markets to prevent fraud and \nmanipulation.\n  Mr. Geithner's announcement yesterday was truly historic. Americans \nhave suffered through an era of deregulation that is primarily the \ncause of this economic crisis. How did we get here and why is this \nhistoric?\n  A decade ago Congress passed, in the dark of night at the end of the \nCongress in 2000, a law known as the Commodities Futures Modernization \nAct that provided ironclad protections from regulation for financial \ntools. One courageous regulator, then Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission Chairwoman Brooksley Born, warned Congress and the financial \ncommunity that unregulated derivatives could cause potential serious \ndangers to the economy. But some in Washington blocked her efforts, \nincluding Wall Street and senior administration officials.\n  One high-ranking Treasury official charged with pushing this \nderegulation bill through Congress was Gary Gensler, a former high-\nranking executive at Goldman Sachs. As Under Secretary of the Treasury, \nMr. Gensler testified before Congress that he ``unambiguously opposed'' \nregulating the derivatives market. Mr. Gensler was wrong. For Brooksley \nBorn's courage in standing up to powerful financial interests in \nproposing tougher rules, she is being awarded the Profiles in Courage \naward by the John F. Kennedy Foundation this year.\n  With yesterday's announcement, this administration embraces the \nreforms that Brooksley Born argued we needed a decade ago. This was an \nuphill battle. There were too many people with a financial stake in the \nold, unrestrained trading system. But it was because of my concern that \nthe President's commitments to government reform and increased \ntransparency would be overshadowed by those willing to take a go-slow \napproach to regulatory reform that I placed a hold on the President's \nnomination of Gary Gensler to be Chairman of the Commodities Futures \nTrading Commission. In my view, Mr. Gensler helped perpetuate the lax \nregulation that contributed to our current economic crisis while he was \nUnder Secretary of Treasury during the latter years of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  While Mr. Gensler has recently stated he supports stronger regulatory \nrules for financial markets, in 2000, he supported legislation that \nprovided ironclad protections against regulation of financial products \nsuch as credit default swaps and derivatives. I hardly need to remind \nmy colleagues of the disastrous results of that course of action.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  The world of derivatives and credit default swaps is foreign to most \nAmericans. The vulnerability of these markets to rampant speculation \nand the complex set of regulatory structures needed to address the \nproblems are not easy to grasp, even for insiders of the financial \nindustry. But my constituents in Washington State know all too well the \nconsequences of inaction and lax oversight. To us, the financial \nmeltdown is not just an object lesson in greed and avarice playing out \non the other coast; it is an issue that has affected our daily lives. \nWe remember when the lights went out over the energy crisis brought on \nby Enron's predatory speculation that threw the western power grid into \ndisarray. This perfect storm--a combination of drought, botched \nregulation, and Enron's market manipulation--cost west coast consumers \nmore than $40 billion, and it took years to unravel the mess.\n  The rules of the financial game may be esoteric, but the consequences \nof a financial meltdown are well understood by my constituents. It is \nbecause of my involvement in bringing Enron's speculative schemes to \nlight and seeing the type of business abuse in the financial markets \nthat I am determined to take steps to ensure that such abuse does not \nhappen again. I am glad President Obama has listened to those on \nCapitol Hill and those within his own administration who believed \nstrongly that bold and timely action was critical to ensure stability \nof our financial markets. I continue to have concerns about Mr. \nGensler's appointment to head the agency responsible for regulating \nswaps and other derivatives whose collapse amid unrestricted \nspeculation caused so much damage to the economy. But in light of the \nadministration's significant and potentially historic stand on new \ncontrols over derivative markets, I am prepared to lift my hold on his \nconfirmation and, instead, focus on ensuring that the legislation we \npass includes the recommendations the administration has made.\n  I say that I hope the administration's new policy will become a \nturning point, because we have more work to do to make sure these \nconcepts become law. The Treasury Department announcement was not a \npiece of legislation but, rather, a policy outline, a statement of the \nkind of bill the White House would support. It is now up to us in \nCongress to turn this into law. I am committed to working with Senate \nleadership to ensure that the resulting legislation closes loopholes \nand that we get about making sure that the previously poorly designed \ncontrols are eliminated.\n  Where necessary, we must be willing to go even further than the \nadministration in crafting a bill that puts an end to destructive and \npredatory forms of speculation. But I applaud the bold position \noutlined in the Treasury Secretary's letter to House and Senate \nleadership yesterday.\n  The idea here is not to impose regulation for regulation's sake. The \nidea is to protect the American people from the consequences of \nunrestrained speculation. Our constituents are justifiably angry, \nbecause they have seen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in \nsavings evaporate while speculators who aggravated the crisis floated \naway on golden parachutes.\n  Undoubtedly, in the weeks to come, Wall Street interests will have a \nlot to say about regulatory reforms. They should say it to the average \nAmerican who has been taking a crash course in the financial crisis \nover the past year. Our obligation is not to these speculators. It is \nto the people who work hard, whose ingenuity and extraordinary \nproductivity have provided the lift that has made our economy the envy \nof the world. It is now our time to do our job to put in the robust \nreforms that will make their hard work pay off in the days ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: In late March I laid out in \n     congressional testimony a broad framework for regulatory \n     reform. As I indicated then, one essential element of reform \n     is the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework \n     for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which under current \n     law are largely excluded or exempted from regulation. Since \n     then, the Treasury Department has been consulting with the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other federal regulators \n     regarding the design of such a framework. Today I am writing \n     to follow up with further details on the amendments to the \n     Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the securities laws, and other \n     relevant laws that I believe are needed to enable the \n     government to regulate the OTC derivatives markets \n     effectively for the first time.\n       Government regulation of the OTC derivatives markets should \n     be designed to achieve four broad objectives: (1) preventing \n     activities in those markets from posing risk to the financial \n     system; (2) promoting the efficiency and transparency of \n     those markets; (3) preventing market manipulation, fraud, and \n     other market abuses; and (4) ensuring that OTC derivatives \n     are not marketed inappropriately to unsophisticated parties. \n     To achieve these goals, it is critical that similar products \n     and activities be subject to similar regulations and \n     oversight.\n       To contain systemic risks, the CEA and the securities laws \n     should be amended to require clearing of all standardized OTC \n     derivatives through regulated central counterparties (CCPs). \n     To ensure that this measure is effective, regulators will \n     need to take steps to ensure that CCPs impose robust margin \n     requirements and other necessary risk controls and to ensure \n     that customized OTC derivatives are not used solely as a \n     means to avoid using a CCP. For example, if an OTC derivative \n     is accepted for clearing by one or more fully regulated CCPs, \n     it should create a presumption that it is a standardized \n     contract and thus required to be cleared.\n       All OTC derivatives dealers and all other firms whose \n     activities in those markets create large exposures to \n     counterparties should be subject to a robust and appropriate \n     regime of prudential supervision and regulation. Key elements \n     of that robust regulatory regime must include conservative \n     capital requirements, business conduct standards, reporting \n     requirements, and conservative requirements relating to \n     initial margins on counterparty credit exposures. \n     Counterparty risks associated with customized bilateral OTC \n     derivatives transactions that would not be accepted by a CCP \n     would be addressed by this robust regime covering derivative \n     dealers.\n       The OTC derivatives markets should be made more transparent \n     by amending the CEA and the securities laws to authorize the \n     CFTC and the SEC, consistent with their respective missions, \n     to impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements (including \n     an audit trail) on all OTC derivatives. Certain of those \n     requirements could be deemed to be satisfied by either \n     clearing standardized transactions through a CCP or by \n     reporting customized transactions to a regulated trade \n     repository. CCPs and trade repositories should be required \n     to, among other things, make aggregate data on open positions \n     and trading volumes available to the public and to make data \n     on any individual counterparty's trades and positions \n     available on a confidential basis to the CFTC, SEC, and the \n     institution's primary regulators.\n       Market efficiency and price transparency should be improved \n     in derivatives markets by requiring the clearing of \n     standardized contracts through regulated CCPs as discussed \n     earlier and by moving the standardized part of these markets \n     onto regulated exchanges and regulated transparent electronic \n     trade execution systems for OTC derivatives and by requiring \n     development of a system for timely reporting of trades and \n     prompt dissemination of prices and other trade information. \n     Furthermore, regulated financial institutions should be \n     encouraged to make greater use of regulated exchange-traded \n     derivatives. Competition between appropriately regulated OTC \n     derivatives markets and regulated exchanges will make both \n     sets of markets more efficient and thereby better serve end-\n     users of derivatives.\n       Market integrity concerns should be addressed by making \n     whatever amendments to the CEA and the securities laws which \n     are necessary to ensure that the CFTC and the SEC, consistent \n     with their respective missions, have clear, unimpeded \n     authority to police fraud, market manipulation, and other \n     market abuses involving all OTC derivatives. The CFTC also \n     should have authority to set position limits on OTC \n     derivatives that perform or affect a significant price \n     discovery function with respect to regulated markets. \n     Requiring CCPs, trade repositories, and other market \n     participants to provide the CFTC, SEC, and institutions' \n     primary regulators with a complete picture of activity in the \n     OTC derivatives markets will assist those regulators in \n     detecting and deterring all such market abuses.\n       Current law seeks to protect unsophisticated parties from \n     entering into inappropriate derivatives transactions by \n     limiting the types of counterparties that could participate \n     in those markets. But the limits are not sufficiently \n     stringent. The CFTC and SEC are reviewing the participation \n     limits in current law to recommend how the CEA and the \n     securities laws should be amended to tighten the limits or to \n     impose additional disclosure requirements or standards of \n     care with respect to the marketing of derivatives to less \n     sophisticated counterparties such as small municipalities.\n       I am confident that these amendments to the CEA and the \n     securities laws and related regulatory measures will allow \n     market participants to continue to realize the benefits\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n     of using both standardized and customized derivatives while \n     achieving the key public policy objectives expressed in this \n     letter. I look forward to working with Congress to shape U.S. \n     legislation implementing these measures. We will need to take \n     care that in doing so we do not call into question the \n     enforceability of OTC derivatives contracts. We also will \n     need to work with authorities abroad to promote \n     implementation of complementary measures in other \n     jurisdictions, so that achievement of our objectives is not \n     undermined by the movement of derivatives activity to \n     jurisdictions without adequate regulatory safeguards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it was my intention to call up two first-\ndegree amendments at this time: Amendment No. 1094, which is an \namendment that is cosponsored by Senator McCaskill and Senator Collins; \nand then it was my intent to call up amendment No. 1095. Both of these \namendments are germane amendments. I understand that if I attempted to \ncall them up now and set them aside, there would be an objection. So I \nwill not do that at this time, but it is my intent to call up these, \neither before cloture or postcloture, because they are germane \namendments. I just wish to alert our colleagues it is our intent to \ncall up these two amendments.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to speak on an amendment that \nI intend to offer, cosponsored by Senators Durbin and Sanders, which \nwould complement the Credit Card Act by restoring to each of the 50 \nStates the power to enforce maximum interest rates against out-of-State \nlenders. I urge my Republican colleagues to attend to this as well \nbecause I know they have taken a particular interest over the years in \nthe sovereign power of the State, what a constitutional scholar would \ncall the Doctrine of Federalism, and this is certainly an important \nstep in that direction.\n  The bill we are debating this week will make enormous advances in \nbanning some of the most egregious credit card tricks and traps that \nconsumers face out there. I commend the distinguished chairman for his \nheroic, patient, determined work in bringing us to this point. I \nbelieve we also need to give State governments the ability to go after \nthe most dangerous trap of all: outrageous and unjustifiable interest \nrates.\n  I have heard so many stories from countless Rhode Islanders: A missed \npayment or a late payment turned a reasonable interest rate into a 25-\npercent or 35-percent penalty rate, and a family suddenly finds itself \nin a hole it can't climb back out of.\n  Professor Ronald Mann of Columbia University has called this credit \ncard business tactic the ``sweat box.'' Credit card companies have \nfound it profitable to hit their most distressed customers with penalty \nrates and fees that are designed to sweat out of those customers the \nmaximum monthly payments before the inevitable bankruptcy filing.\n  Prior to 1978, all the way back to the founding of the Republic, \nStates had the ability to prohibit excessive interest rates and to \nprotect their citizens. It is part of our national history. That \nchanged following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1978: Marquette \nNational Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp.\n  Marquette did not seem like a big case at the time--not a case that \nwould, in practice, end one of the sovereign State's most basic and \nancient authorities--to protect their citizens. In Marquette, the \nSupreme Court interpreted the word ``located''--one word--in the Civil \nWar-era National Bank Act as giving regulatory authority over a loan to \nthe States that was the primary place of business of the bank, as \nopposed to the State that was the location of domicile of the consumer. \nIt seemed like a technical case, but the meaning of this one-century-\nold word defined that way has had the effect of crippling the ability \nof States to effectively police usurious lending practices by out-of-\nState banks.\n  Following Marquette, credit card lenders realized they could avoid \nState law consumer protections by reorganizing as national banks and \noperating their businesses out of a handful of States that either \nlacked meaningful interest rate restrictions or were willing to toss \nout their consumer protection laws in order to attract this new \nbusiness. Thus began the proverbial race to the bottom. Today, it is \nunusual to find a credit card lender not based in one of the two or \nthree States that have turned weak consumer protection into a \nprofitable industry.\n  My amendment and the bill on which it is based, S. 255, would amend \nthe Truth in Lending Act to legislatively reverse the Marquette \ndecision, restore the historic power of the States, and to make clear \nthat each State has the right to protect its citizens with interest \nrate restrictions on consumer lending no matter where the lender \nchooses to locate their physical office.\n  If enacted, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and other States could, once \nagain, as they did for decades--for centuries before Marquette--say \n``enough'' to faraway credit card lenders gouging their citizens. As a \nformer State attorney general who was closely involved in consumer \nprotection issues, I feel strongly that States have an important role \nto play in protecting their citizens from abusive and heavy-handed \nbusiness practices. This amendment would acknowledge and strengthen \nthat role.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, would the Senator yield for an \nobservation?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I gladly yield to the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator for raising this issue, and I \nappreciate the time he has put into this and the effort he has expended \nfor what he is trying to accomplish. I know his constituents and mine \nsuffer, as all of us do, from abusive interest rates and fees and \nbelieve that broader interest rate reform is something we in the Senate \nshould carefully consider. In fact, a good part of this legislation is \ndesigned to do exactly that.\n  The Senator's amendment goes beyond the credit card reform, however, \nand would affect many varieties of consumer lending beyond just credit \ncards. I, therefore, would inquire of the Senator from Rhode Island if \nhe would be willing to withhold his amendment and defer consideration \nof the issue as we are preparing to take up broader financial \nregulatory reform later this year; in fact, within the next few months.\n  In the interim, I wish to assure the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse, that he has my personal commitment that the Banking \nCommittee, which I chair, will take a careful look at his proposal. We \nhave held a major series of hearings on regulatory modernization, we \nare planning a number of others, and this subject will be an \nappropriate one for consideration in these hearings during the \ncommittee's consideration of related legislation. Perhaps the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island can recommend a witness or witnesses--I certainly \nknow of several--who would like to testify, including himself or other \nMembers who are cosponsors of his amendment, or like many of us who \nshare his concern about the Marquette decision and what it has done in \nterms of usury laws.\n  I often point out that both in the Old Testament and the New \nTestament, while I don't claim to be a Biblical scholar, there was \nnothing that more outraged Jesus Christ than the money changers in the \nNew Testament. Certainly, there are plenty of examples in the Old \nTestament of usurious lending practices. It is as old as Biblical \ntimes, the admonition regarding charging outrageous interest rates. We \nhave rates today, as I have said before, that would make organized \ncrime blush if they were to see them.\n  Anyway, the Senator has proposed a reform of our system of banking \nregulation with wide-reaching consequences, and the proposal deserves\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nthe full vetting of the Banking Committee. I assure him we will have a \nfull vetting.\n  I ask my colleague and friend from Rhode Island whether he would be \nwilling to entertain this proposal and defer this matter until we deal \nwith a larger set of issues and to also confirm for him my similar \nconcern that he has raised and would have raised with this amendment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee for his offer. With this understanding, I will agree to \nwithhold on my amendment on this particular piece of legislation.\n  I believe we need to look at broader interest rate reform, and I \nappreciate the commitment of the distinguished Banking Committee \nchairman to look at the Marquette issue in that context. I also wish to \napplaud the chairman for developing the legislation we are debating. \nThis is one of those areas where wisdom accrued over years of \nlegislative experience allows us to expand the realm of the possible, \nand of course legislation is the art of the possible. Through his \nwisdom, through his experience, he has been able to get to the very \noutermost bounds of the possible on this legislation and perhaps even \nmove those outermost bounds out a little bit. So I applaud the chairman \nfor this extraordinary accomplishment. The Credit Card Act will go a \nlong way in cleaning up the practices of unscrupulous credit card \nlenders, and the Senators from Connecticut and Alabama deserve high \npraise for their hard work in bringing us to this point.\n  I thank both my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I congratulate the chairman of the \nBanking Committee for daring to go where no one was willing to go for a \nlong time; that is, regulating the credit card industry. I have learned \nabout some of the tricks of the credit card industry the hard way. My \nfather had a significant and serious and protracted illness, and mom \nwas trying to get through it without burdening any of us. Without any \nof us realizing it, she got in a hole with credit card companies. Once \nI figured out that she had gotten into the hole, I set about the \nbusiness of trying to help.\n  I have a law degree. I am not a shy person. I am someone who is \nwilling to say what I think. I helped write law at the State level, and \nI think I understand contract law. As I began to get through all the \nfine print and deal with the credit card companies that she was \nindebted to, I became more and more frustrated. I began to realize what \nhas happened with unsecured debt in America through credit card \ncompanies. There is a lot of bait and switch that goes on. There is a \ndesire to get hold of the credit card customer who never pays the \nprincipal. My mom was a dream customer. She paid like clockwork, in \nterms of the minimum payment, but never quite had enough to get around \nto the principal. The saddest part of the story is how hard it was for \nme to pay off the cards. They didn't want me to pay them off. I \nremember being on a phone call for 3 hours, and I had been to several \ncountries by the time the call was concluded. I was told that it was \nimpossible for me to send a payment to pay off the card the same month. \nIt had to be sent in a separate payment. We were trying to pay off the \ncard. They didn't want it. One of my favorites is that she made a \npayment on a card, and I paid off the balance. Then a bill came, and it \nwas a negative balance. They owed us money. But you are not going to \nbelieve it, but, again, they owed us money, and guess what they had \ndone. They charged us interest. I called this person on the phone and \nsaid, ``I am trying to figure this out. You owe us money and there is a \ncharge for interest on the bill.'' That is when I began to learn the \nreality of ``trailing'' interest. It was mind boggling to me, the \ntricks and the traps that were embedded in these credit card \nagreements.\n  We got an e-mail from a constituent. Actually, we have gotten \nthousands of them, especially in the last 6 months. This letter says \nthe following:\n\n       The reason I am contacting you is because of a problem with \n     Bank Corp. I received several emails from Bank Corp [asking \n     me] to apply for a credit card. I eventually did. The credit \n     card interest rate was to be a fixed 7.99 percent. . . . \n     After the card was approved, the interest rate was 7.99 \n     percent for several months. Then the rate was raised to 23 \n     percent and, as of the July, 2008 statement, the interest \n     rate was raised to 35.49 percent. I called Bank Corp and \n     spoke with Erin, the representative that answered the phone. \n     After being put on hold for [a long period of time], I was \n     told that my account was in good standing. The payments had \n     been made on time. She said Bank Corp had changed their \n     lending practices and that was the reason for the interest \n     hike. I was told there was no lower rates available, even \n     though my account was in good standing. I was also told there \n     was nothing I could do to change this and there was no way to \n     protest the interest hike.\n\n  This man asked me, ``Is this legal?'' Sadly, we had to tell him that \nit was every bit legal.\n  I understand the risk of unsecured debt. I understand that these \nbanks are trying to get credit to people. But one of my favorite parts \nof the hearing we had on this subject was in Senator Levin's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, when I asked one of the credit card \nexecutives about the fact that they want to give these cards to college \nstudents. I am not lying about this; this was actual testimony given in \nthis hearing. I asked him about the fact that they were sending cards \nto college students. I was trying to get to the bottom of the practice \nwhere they were doing kickbacks to colleges in return for their lists \nso that they could solicit the students, give them credit cards. My \nfavorite response was when I asked, with as much sincerity as I could \nmuster, ``I guess you find these college students a good risk for all \nthese insecure debt.'' He said, ``Yes, they are very good risks.'' I \nwas thinking: what planet is he on? I have college students. They are \nno more a good risk than someone who has a horrible credit rating. They \nsend these cards to kids because they know their parents, if they are \nin college, don't want them to get into trouble and they will bail them \nout if they get in too deep. They want to hook them into the pattern, \ncharging big, paying interest only, and being on line to them for the \nprincipal for the rest of their lives.\n  We have work to do on this bill. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle join us quickly in getting to a point where we can \nbring it to a final vote. It will stop many of these abusive \nbehaviors--the ability to raise the interest rate because maybe you \nmissed a utility bill by accident 1 month, or the practice of the \ntrailing interest, where you find the credit card company owes you \nmoney and they still charge you interest. There are 3 amendments that I \nworked on with Senators Levin and Collins. One is no over-the-limit \nfee. If they let you go over the limit, they should not charge you a \nfee. And no interest on fees. And a very important amendment that we \ncan do on credit card data collection so we have more information about \nwhat the interest rates are we are paying in America.\n  The irony of these spikes in interest rates for good credit customers \nis that this has occurred at a time when interest rates in our country \nare at a historic low. Ben Bernanke used about all the leverage he \ncould to help our economy by lowering the interest rate, and lower the \ninterest rate, and lowering the interest rate, and these companies can \nborrow money at very low rates. Yet, to the consumer right now, those \ninterest rates are getting hiked and hiked and hiked--even when the \nperson with the credit card has no indication that they present any \nkind of financial risk to that credit card company.\n  We wring our hands here about what we can do to help the people we \nwork for. We know people are hurting now. I am not sure there is any \npiece of legislation that is more important to the people at home than \nthis credit card bill, bringing to heel these companies who are taking \nadvantage of an unlevel playing field, which is strewn with all kinds \nof information that is too difficult to even understand. Let's keep it \nsimple and straightforward and make sure the rules are available for \nall people to understand, and let's make sure they are not engaged in \nthe kind of practices that caused my mother so many sleepless nights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1079\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about one \nof the pending amendments, No. 1079. In a few minutes, I am going to \nmake a motion on that amendment.\n  I did not get to hear all of what the wonderful Senator and colleague \nfrom\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nMissouri said, but I take it that she, like I, supports the underlying \nbill. I can appreciate the need for this consumer protection. As \nchairman of the Small Business Committee, I have been hearing literally \nfor months, as has the occupant of the chair, who has sat through \nhearings with me--we have heard the tragic stories of small businesses \nthat have done everything right--businesses that had excellent business \nmodels, people who have been in business for four decades or longer, \nbusinesses that have never missed a credit card payment. You have heard \ntheir pleas to us to give them some relief.\n  The consumers generally have said the same. The wonderful thing is \nthat this underlying bill gives some relief to consumers, to personal \ncredit cardholders. I commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for \nbringing this bill to the floor. It only got out of this Banking \nCommittee, which is tough to get any pro-consumer legislation out of, \nunfortunately, by only one vote, I understand. But they got it to the \nfloor. It is a very important bill. People cannot have their interest \nrates raised without notice. They cannot have their balances double \ncharged. In other words, right now, today, if you owed $5,000 on your \ncredit card and you cashed in your savings bonds and everything else \nand paid $4,500 on that balance to get it down, under the current law, \ncredit card companies can still charge you the full interest on $5,000. \nThat is wrong. These same companies are receiving billions and billions \nof taxpayer dollars so they can turn around and fleece the people who \nare sending them the tax dollars to bail them out. It is \nunconscionable, truly. So the committee acted. They did the right \nthing. They extended these protections to consumers.\n\n  But there were some potential jurisdictional questions, or perhaps an \noversight, that the bill does not protect holders of business credit \ncards. Twenty-five years ago, this wouldn't have been an issue, because \nmost people who were building a business, or financing one, had other \navenues of capital.\n  You can see on this chart the trend in credit card use. In 1993, 16 \nyears ago, 16 percent of business owners said they used credit cards to \nfinance their operations. In that 16 years, it has gone to 60 percent--\nfrom 16 percent to 60 percent. It has become a source of capital and \ncashflow, a tool, for small business.\n  Here again is another chart. We have learned this in our hearings we \nhave had. Sources of small business financing in 2009: Credit cards, 59 \npercent, just about 60 percent; bank loans, 45 percent; vendor credit, \n30 percent; used no financing--cash or savings--19 percent; private \nloans through a friend or family, 19 percent; and SBA loans, 5 percent. \nThat is an important part, although it is small, which helps to \nfinance. It is long term, I might say; our loans are 20, 25, 30 years. \nSome of these others are only 30- or 60-day loans. It is small, but it \nis important. We hope with your leadership, Madam President, and that \nof the Senator from Maine, we can get this number up.\n  The point of this discussion is this number--60 percent: Small \nbusinesses in Louisiana, from New Orleans, to Alexandria, to \nShreveport--small business people I see when I am shopping at Costco or \nat Sam's Club, standing in line, and I know it is not a family because \nthey have four dozen oranges. No family eats that many oranges in a \nweek, so you know they are buying for their small business or \nrestaurant or for their corner store. So we know that these small \nbusinesses are relying more and more on credit cards.\n  In this bill we are voting on, there is no protection for them--zero. \nThis bill only protects personal credit cards, not business credit \ncards. So the Landrieu-Snowe amendment, cosponsored by the occupant of \nthe chair--and I will get the list of others in a moment--it was \ncosponsored by several Members of the Senate, and they are Senators \nCardin, Shaheen, Brown, Cantwell, Inouye, Klobuchar, Snowe, Collins, \nand I think others will be joining in support of this amendment. We \nhave decided to offer an amendment that simply says the underlying \nsafeguards for holders of personal credit cards should simply extend to \nbusinesses of 50 employees or less, up to $25,000 on their business \ncard, because there are many people who carry a personal card for \npersonal business. Of course, they may carry a business card for \nbusiness-related business.\n  I know we have to give consumers relief, but I am here to say, as the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee, if we don't give our small \nbusinesses some relief, we are not going to have an economy to depend \non because if we are looking for people to create jobs--which I think \nis what the President is calling on us to do--those jobs are going to \nbe created by the small businesses of America. That is why in this \ndebate the National Federation of Independent Businesses--not a bastion \nof liberalism by any means--is supporting this bill, and the American \nSociety of Travel Agents, the American Beverage Licensees, the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Food Marketing Institute, the National \nAssociation for the Self-Employed, representing tens of millions of \nself-employed individuals--and they find it ironic that we say we are \ntrying to get help to the little guy and we say we are trying to get \nhelp from Wall Street to Main Street. Yet every time there are \namendments on the floor to actually do that, they never seem to be able \nto pass.\n  I know there are arguments that say: Well, we don't know what the \neffect of this amendment will be. I can tell you what the effect will \nbe. The small businesses in America, the 20 million that will be \naffected by this, will say: Thank you for not allowing my rates to go \nup without notice. Thank you for not allowing them to double-charge me \nif I am paying down $20,000 on my $25,000 balance. Thank you, because I \ndidn't get a penny from the TARP money, but at least I am getting some \nhelp through this consumer relief bill.\n  As I said, the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nNational Small Business Association, the Petroleum Marketers \nAssociation of America, the Service Employees International Union, the \nSmall Business Majority, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the \nWomen's Chamber of Commerce, and the Black Chamber of Commerce have all \nendorsed this bill. We haven't heard yet from the U.S. Chamber, but I \nam hoping they will step forward--at least the small business section \nof the U.S. Chamber. I understand they represent large banks, credit \ncard-issuing companies, so it is tough for them. But somebody has to \nspeak up for small business, and I hope that right now my colleagues \nwill consider this amendment.\n  Again, I am going to have to call it up for action now and actually \nmove to table it, and when I do that, we will not be able to have any \ndiscussion on this because that motion is not debatable. That is why I \nam speaking about it now. But at least we will get on the record how \npeople feel about this, and I am hoping we can get a substantial vote.\n  I have decided that even if it is just my vote, and the cosponsors \nand Senator Snowe, at least the small business people in America will \nknow there are some people here who understand they deserve the minimal \nprotections this bill provides, particularly at this time, and that in \nthe next year or two, or three, four, or five--until we get on safe \nground--we need to be doing everything we can to help small businesses \nbecause without them, there will be no recovery. It is not the large \nbusinesses that are going to create these jobs. They are going to \ncontract. They are going to redesign themselves. They are going to \ncontract until things are safe. They are going to poke their head out \nof that shell when the way is clear. The people who are going to run \nout in the line of fire are the small businesses these people \nrepresent. They are the ones who are going to say: No, I am not going \ndown. I am going to hire. I am going to keep moving forward because I \nknow my idea is good or because I know when we come out of this \nrecession, I will be able to make it. These are the people on whom we \nwill build this recovery, and these are the people who need help today. \nWe don't need to study it for 10 years or look at it for 5 years. These \norganizations represent the millions of businesses that need help \ntoday. So on behalf of this coalition, I think the facts are on our \nside.\n  This is not an anti-credit card company amendment, this is a pro-\nsmall business amendment. I know people have to make money. Everybody \nhas to make money. And everybody is trying\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nto do what they can. But there is no excuse right now, when small \nbusinesses have to rely--as I said, 60 percent of our small \nbusinesses--and this is an average. In some States, it probably could \nbe up to 70 percent of small businesses. In some States, maybe it is \nbelow 50 or 45. But it is still a significant number of businesses \nusing credit cards to help finance their business. Let's give them a \nlittle help today.\n  So I move to call up and I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. \n1079. I further move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I withdraw the request, and I ask for \nregular order on amendment No. 1079.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, in order for me to get a vote on this \namendment, I am going to have to ask for the amendment to be tabled. I \nwould like to ask for the amendment to be tabled. Of course, I will be \nvoting not to table it and will be asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable?\n  At the moment, there is not.\n  The motion to table is not debatable. Those in favor, say aye.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, at this time I would like to remove my \nmotion to table amendment No. 1079, but I would like it to remain \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is withdrawn.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand the amendment will still be pending. But \nwhen cloture is invoked, unfortunately, this amendment is going to fall \nbecause it is not germane to the bill so we will not be able to have a \nvote on this amendment, which was my hope. But because of time \nconstraints and because of the difficulty of getting Members to the \nfloor for the procedures that we would have to go through to have a \nvote, I am happy to report that the chairman of the committee has \nagreed to allow our committee, Small Business, to have jurisdiction \nover this matter.\n  We will, in the next few weeks, be putting together a bill on the \nSmall Business Administration Reauthorization, which we have to do by \nmatter of course and responsibility. I appreciate Senator Dodd agreeing \nto acquiesce to allow our committee to have jurisdiction over this \nnarrow matter. I intend, with the help of my ranking member, Senator \nSnowe, and the help of, I hope, the vast majority of the members of our \ncommittee, both Democrats and Republicans--I hope we will stand \ntogether to present at that time legislation that can provide real \nrelief to small businesses that need all the help they can get.\n  We are not asking for artificially low rates to be set. We are not \nasking to tie credit card companies' hands in the event that small \nbusinesses renege on their payment plans or are late paying. We are \njust saying, if you are a business operating out there and you have \npaid your bills on time, you are paying your credit cards, you are \nmeeting your obligations, that your rates cannot arbitrarily be raised.\n  We understand transactions and contracts between business people. \nThis is not the Government stepping in to try to negotiate. This is \nsimply a level playing field between consumers and small businesses.\n  Again, because 69 percent of businesses in America today depend on \ncredit cards to finance their operations, I am here to say, and our \ncommittee will be back saying to the Members of the Senate, we must get \nour eyes on small business, on their access to credit, on their ability \nto survive so this recovery can take root, and we can create the kinds \nof jobs that will be necessary.\n  I am sorry because of the time constraints and the unwillingness of \nsome here to be cooperative. But I thank the chair of the committee, \nSenator Dodd, for allowing our committee to have jurisdiction. I can \npromise, as the chair of that committee, this amendment will be on the \nbill when our bill comes to the floor for consideration and we will get \na vote. If people want to vote against our amendment--something may not \nbe exact--fine. Let them vote against it. But I want the record to be \nclear that there are a number of Members of the Senate, hopefully a \nmajority, who believe the same protections extended to consumers for \ntheir credit cards would be extended to businesses in America, small \nbusinesses--those with 50 employees or less--with at least a $25,000 \nlimit on their credit card. It is not going to be every business in \nAmerica that will get covered, but it is the small businesses that are \nhaving the most difficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to join my good friend \nSenator Landrieu, the chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, on an amendment addressing a key deficiency in \nthe Dodd-Shelby substitute, or Credit Card Accountability \nResponsibility and Disclosure--CARD--Act, currently pending before the \nbody.\n  I congratulate Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee \nChairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby for their stalwart efforts to \nbring this critical bill to the floor to protect consumers from credit \ncard abuses. However, as drafted, the measure would leave small \nbusinesses out in the proverbial cold. Accordingly, the amendment we \nare filing today would extend the protections in both the Truth in \nLending Act as well as the bill we are considering today to any credit \ncard used by the 26.6 million small businesses with 50 or fewer \nemployees. I would like to thank Senators Brown, Cantwell, Collins, \nCardin, Inouye, Klobuchar and Shaheen for cosponsoring our amendment.\n  Although we will undoubtedly debate how broadly they should be \nwritten, the provisions the CARD Act contemplates would provide vital \nsafeguards to consumer credit cards. No longer could credit card \ncompanies arbitrarily raise interest rates on outstanding balances at \nany time for any reason or increase them on future purchases without \nsufficient notice. Unbelievably, the Pew Charitable Trusts in its \nreport, Safe Credit Card Standards, found that ``93 percent of cards \nallowed the issuer to raise any interest rate at any time by changing \nthe account agreement.'' Should they choose to carry a balance, once \nthis bill is enacted into law, people will have certainty with respect \nto how much interest they will pay on their purchases and will not go \nto bed one night thinking they have a 10-percent rate only to wake up \nfacing a 32-percent rate.\n  Additionally, this bill will prevent credit card companies from \nengaging in other abusive practices, such as ``two-cycle'' billing \nwhereby a company assesses interest not only on the balance for the \ncurrent billing cycle, but also on the balance for days in the \npreceding billing cycle. Moreover, the bill before the Senate will put \nan end to schemes that allow credit card companies to apply the \nentirety of a payment to balances with the lowest interest rates and, \nthereby, help families, which today have an average credit card balance \nof nearly $10,700 and are struggling to stay afloat, emerge from a \nvicious cycle of debt. Finally, we will ensure that customers have 21 \ndays to pay a bill once it is sent so that they have sufficient time to \nmake a payment.\n  While this legislation would take great strides to shield consumers \nfrom abusive practices, it does not extend these safeguards to our \nNation's small business owners who use credit cards to purchase goods \nand services, make payroll, and ultimately create 75 percent of this \nNation's net new jobs. The fact is according to the National Federation \nof independent Business'--NFIB's--Access to Credit poll published in \n2008, 85 percent of small business owners have one or more credit cards \nthat they use for business purposes. NFIB data also revealed that 74 \npercent of small business owners use at least one business credit card, \nwhile 39 percent use at least one personal card.\n  Yet the bill before the Senate amends the Truth in Lending Act, which \napplies only to ``consumer'' transactions\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nthat are defined as ``one in which the party to whom credit is offered \nor extended is a natural person, and the money, property, or services \nwhich are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, \nfamily, or household purposes.'' The measure does not protect our \nNation's small business owners--many of whom, as I just mentioned--\nutilize credit cards to finance routine transactions.\n\n  First and foremost, the protections in the bill would not extend to \nentrepreneurs who make purchases for their enterprises using a small \nbusiness credit card. Even more troubling is that, in many cases, the \nsmall business credit cards are, like consumer cards, issued based on \nthe personal credit history of the card holder. Thus, although the two \ntypes of cards are in many instances indistinguishable, two different \nsets of rules and protections can apply.\n  Second, and although there is some debate among experts on this \npoint, there is concern that the safeguards in the CARD Act may not \napply if an individual made a significant amount of business purchases \non a consumer credit card. The reason is that the Truth in Lending Act \nonly protects purchases made on consumer cards primarily for personal, \nfamily, or household purposes, and it is unclear at what point \nbusinesses purchases would cease to qualify for protections if made on \nconsumer credit cards. To protect small businesses with 50 or fewer \nemployees, the Senate should clarify that purchases made on behalf of \nan enterprise using a consumer card will receive the protections in \nthis bill.\n  Omitting 26.6 million of this Nation's job-creating small businesses \nfrom credit card protections could have extremely serious consequences, \nparticularly at a time in which we are counting on our small employers \nto lead us out of the most devastating economic recession since the \nGreat Depression. Indeed, as Todd McCracken, the president of the \nNational Small Business Administration, NSBA, testified on March 19 \nbefore the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, on \nwhich I serve as ranking member, the credit card companies are abusing \nsmall firms. In fact, Mr. McCracken wrote in his testimony, ``Imagine \ntrying to run a business when one's carefully-constructed business plan \nis upended by a retroactive interest rate hike. How can a small-\nbusiness owner be expected to maintain--let alone grow--her business \nwhen the capital she has already used is no longer subject to the 12 \npercent interest rate she agreed to but an egregiously punitive 32 \npercent?''\n  These abuses are not just isolated incidents; they really do occur. \nTo quantify what small businesses are facing, the NFIB's Credit Card \nsurvey found that excluding cases involving an introductory offer, 20 \npercent of small business owners saw the interest rate on their \noutstanding balances increased at least once. Furthermore, 25 percent \nof small businesses were given less than three weeks notice to make a \ncredit card payment on at least one occasion, providing compelling \nevidence that action must be taken.\n  I would also like to mention that other survey results bolster the \nNFIB's conclusions. For example, the NSBA's 2009 Small Business Credit \nCard Survey found that 57 percent of small business owners reported \nreceiving their bill too close to the due date to mail it and have it \nbe received on time. Incredibly, 33 percent of respondents reported \nreceiving their credit card statement after its due date! That practice \nis simply outrageous, and it must be stopped!\n  To ensure that small businesses are not shortchanged and are \nadequately protected, the amendment Senator Landrieu and I are offering \ntoday would amend the definition of ``consumer'' in the Truth in \nLending Act to include any small business having 50 or fewer employees. \nAccordingly, our amendment would have two beneficial effects:\n  First, it would extend all of the safeguards in the bill before us to \nsmall businesses with 50 or fewer employees regardless of whether they \nuse a consumer of business credit card to make purchases. Small \nbusinesses would, therefore, be free from worries about any time \ninterest rate increases and other abuses from which Americans have \nsuffered from for far too long.\n  Second, the bill would extend protections already included in the \nTruth in Lending Act to small businesses. As a result, irrespective of \nwhether they use a consumer or business card, our small firms would now \nbe entitled to receive meaningful disclosures that will enable them to \nunderstand the terms of credit being offered and to compare one credit \nproduct to another. Such required disclosures include the finance \ncharge, annual percentage rate, any charges that may be imposed, and a \nstatement of billing rights. Our entrepreneurs should be focused on \ncreating jobs instead of having to try to navigate very complicated \ncredit card terms that are buried in fine print.\n  America's small businesses--the engine that drives our Nation's \neconomy--deserve to be protected from potential credit card abuses that \ncould cripple their operations. Their business plans should no longer \nbe subject to the whims and arbitrary rate increases of the credit card \ncompanies.\n  In closing, I am pleased to report that the following organizations \nhave endorsed the Landrieu-Snowe amendment: the National Federation of \nindependent Business, National Small Business Association, American \nBeverage Licensees, American Society of Travel Agents, Center for \nResponsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, \nDemos: A Network for Ideas & Action, Food Marketing institute, National \nAssociation of College Stores, National Association for the Self-\nEmployed, National Association of Theatre Owners, National Community \nReinvestment Coalition, National Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its \nlow income clients, Petroleum Marketers Association of America, Service \nEmployees International Union, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, U.S. \nPIRG, and the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us and the groups I have just mentioned \nto support this targeted and commonsense amendment that would allow \nentrepreneurs to focus on what they do best; namely, creating new jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I thank Chairman Dodd for \nhis hard work on this legislation. He deserves a great deal of applause \nand congratulations for putting the issue on Congress' agenda and for \nproducing a very strong bill.\n  Nobody in this body or in this country needs to be told about the \neffect of subprime mortgages on America's families. We have seen the \nimpact that unsustainable mortgage debt has had on our economy, and we \nknow the pain it has caused. But while mortgage debt grew by 200 \npercent over a quarter century, credit card debt grew by more than 350 \npercent. Studies suggest that credit card debt plays an even larger \nrole than mortgages in causing personal bankruptcies.\n  Even the explosion in mortgage debt has a lot to do with credit \ncards. Many Americans took predatory mortgages because they needed a \nway out of the massive credit card debt. A mortgage might have done \nthem in, but their story started with a credit card.\n  Credit card debt is more than an economic issue, it is a families \nissue and a children issue. The explosion in credit card debt has taken \na toll on all Americans, but children have been hit the hardest. In \n2004, families with minor children were more than three times as likely \nto file for bankruptcy as their childless friends, and more children \nlived through their parents' bankruptcy than their parents' divorce.\n  We know bankruptcy has a devastating impact on families. Children in \nbankrupt families lose the comfort of a stable home. They can lose \ntheir ability to go to college. They might even lose more. Credit \ncounselors report that families struggling with excessive debt are more \nlikely to experience domestic abuse.\n  The explosion in credit card debt in this country was not the result \nof reckless spending by American families. Family spending on luxuries \nis roughly what it was 30 years ago. The face of debt in this country \nis not an irresponsible teenager but is a mother in over her head. Nor \nis our debt problem simply a matter of supply and demand. American \nconsumers have not suddenly decided they liked high fees, harsh \npenalties, and skyrocketing interest rates. These expensive provisions \nare hidden in the fine print of card applications mailed to vulnerable \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\n  Card companies call this outreach. I call it deception.\n  The reforms we are considering will not disrupt the system. They \ncannot stop credit card companies from providing credit. Any company \nthat wants to help consumers live within their means has nothing to \nfear from this legislation. Any company that wants to offer a service \nto American consumers has nothing to fear. But if you are planning to \nmislead consumers, this bill will stop you. If you are planning to \noffer low rates and charge high ones, we will stop you. If you are \nplanning to trick customers into paying fees and penalties, we will \nstop you. If you are planning to profit from the misery of American \nfamilies, we will stop you. Frankly, it is about time.\n  Before I close I wish to quickly address an amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from Colorado. The amendment requires that Americans \nrequesting their credit report also receive their credit score. For 6 \nyears, credit agencies have violated the intent of Congress by failing \nto provide this information. Legislation passed 6 years ago required \nthem to provide one credit report each year for free, but these credit \nreports do not have to include the one piece of information that is \ncrucial and easiest to understand--the customer's credit score. The \nMark Udall amendment will help Americans manage their credit without \nburdening credit agencies or anybody else. It is a good idea. I support \nit. I encourage all my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1124\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for the \namendment on usury from my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln. As \nsome of you know--not all but some of you--Arkansas has a very strict \nusury limit in its State constitution, and it is been there for a long \ntime. In fact, it used to be even more restrictive. Back in the 1980s, \nthe people went to the ballot box, and they changed the constitution \nand made it much less restrictive than it was originally, but it is \nstill very restrictive by national standards. But what has happened \nnationally has changed things in Arkansas and put Arkansas at a \ndisadvantage.\n  I know there have been bills here like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nFinancial Modernization Act in 1999. I know it was well intentioned. I \nknow there were good reasons, good national reasons and good financial \nreasons and a lot of good reasons to do that. However, what that act \ndid is it preempted the Arkansas State Constitution by permitting in-\nstate banks to charge the same rate of interest as the home State of \nany out-of-State bank that has a branch in that State. It was not \nspecifically designed for or against Arkansas, but it was in the bill, \nit was in the law, and it has been the law since 1999. What that did is \nit, in effect, nationalized the usury rate for banks. Arkansas banks \ncan now charge a higher interest rate than they could before Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley.\n  The injustice occurs when you look at the lending institutions that \nare not banks--maybe the State Student Loan Authority, maybe captive \nfinance companies, maybe other types of lenders that are not banks. \nWhat has happened is it has worked a hardship, and some of those \nlenders cannot do business in Arkansas; they cannot afford to. So many \nsmall businesses, family-owned businesses such as car dealers and \nfurniture retailers, cannot finance their goods to Arkansas consumers. \nThe Arkansas consumer, if they can do it, maybe goes to a bank or a \ncredit union or some other lending institution, in many cases paying a \npretty high interest rate in order to get the money to do business. \nThis hurts the Arkansas business community. It hurts the Arkansas \neconomy.\n  Right now, what has happened is, given the stimulus bill--there are \nmany financing tools in the stimulus bill for constructing roads and \nschools, for building renewable energy projects, the Build America \nBonds, et cetera. But Build America Bonds are not available in our \nState because of the lack of competitiveness in the bond market. Again, \nit is our interest rate.\n  Given the financial times we are in, we find we are put at a \ndisadvantage. No one intended this. Congress never did, the White House \nnever did, the Congress back in 1999 did not want this to happen. But \nit is where we find ourselves today.\n  The people of Arkansas have once again decided to put this issue on \nthe ballot, and they are going to do it. It has been referred out to \nthe people. The legislature made that decision. It is on the ballot. \nThe problem is, it is not until November 2010. So we have a year and a \nhalf to try to struggle through this economy with this very difficult, \nvery adverse usury limit in our State.\n  What we are asking, what Senator Lincoln and I are asking, given this \namendment, is that we get temporary relief only through November 2010. \nThis is just about an 18-month fix, to give us some relief during this \ntime, get the credit flowing in our State the way it has been able to \nflow in other States, and let us take advantage of the stimulus bill, \nthe stimulus package, the America Recovery Act we have already passed, \nthat we all benefit in certain ways, to let us in the State of Arkansas \nhave the full benefit. The Governor supports this, and members of the \nlegislature support this. They have asked us to do this for the people \nof the State of Arkansas.\n  People need to understand what this amendment will do. It will permit \nthe current interest rate not to exceed--once this is passed, the \ninterest rate cannot exceed 17 percent. We are not talking about taking \nthe usury rate completely out of our State law; we are talking about \ngiving us some temporary relief, up to 17 percent. Again, when it comes \nto some of the financing vehicles, such as student loans and bonds of \nvarious types, this is crucial to letting investment happen in our \nState.\n  There is precedent for this. Congress enacted, several years ago, \nlaws that preempted Arkansas' usury provision for, as I mentioned \nbefore, the banking industry and for some other businesses. So we have \ndone this before. Again, I am not sure those laws just affected \nArkansas; they probably affected a lot of States. But basically, right \nnow Arkansas is the only State left that needs some relief under the \ncurrent situation in which we find ourselves.\n  The way it works right now, to let you all know, in our State, the \nlimit for usury--an interest rate in our State is 5.5 percent. And 5.5 \npercent is a very low rate. It is a historically low rate. But it is \nbecause the Fed rate and some of the other things have gone so low. Our \nrate is tied to those Fed rates, those national rates. Again, in a good \neconomy, in most years that makes sense, but right now it does not.\n  So what Senator Lincoln and I are respectfully asking our colleagues \nto do is support her amendment, allow it to become law, allow Arkansas \nthis temporary relief, not just to benefit from the stimulus bill we \nhave already passed but also to benefit from--or at least find some \nrelief in this very tight economy, to ease some credit in our State, to \nhelp the recovery in our State as we are hoping to find in every other \nState in the Union.\n  With that, I ask that when we do vote on the Lincoln amendment, we \nwould all support it and that we would help relief come to all 50 \nStates, not just 49 States. Again, this is temporary. It caps the \ninterest rate at 17 percent, which by most standards is a very \nreasonable cap. It is something that will allow the credit to flow in \nour State and will allow student loans, the Build America Bond Program \nto have the full effect they need to have here in Arkansas.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Corker, Casey, Grassley, Kerry, Levin, Menendez, and Kohl, to \nspeak about our amendment to strengthen the underlying bill's \nprotections for young consumers, and help\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\naddress the growing problem of college student indebtedness.\n  During this severe economic crisis and credit crunch, many \nAmericans--especially college students with limited incomes--find \nthemselves relying on credit cards more than ever before.\n  Our amendment will place commonsense restrictions on credit card \nmarketing to college students; provide for increased transparency in \nuniversity marketing deals with credit card issuers; and, protect \nstudents from some common credit traps.\n  This amendment achieves four essential objectives. It will: (1) \nprohibit credit card companies from offering gifts to students in \nexchange for completing credit card applications; (2) require \nuniversities to publicly disclose marketing agreements made with credit \ncard issuers; (3) require credit card companies to report how much \nmoney they are giving to schools and alumni associations through these \nagreements, and what they receive from the universities in exchange; \nand, (4) call upon the Government Accountability Office to study the \nextent of these deals and their impact on student credit card debt.\n  The growing reliance of college students on credit cards, and the \nstaggering credit card debt that many students accumulate by the time \nthey graduate, underscores the need for this amendment.\n  According to a report released earlier this year by Sallie Mae: 84 \npercent of all undergraduates have at least one credit card; the \naverage student has more than four credit cards; 9 out of 10 college \nstudents use credit cards for direct educational expenses, and 30 \npercent charge some tuition to their cards; the average balance for \nthese students is $3,173--and 82 percent of college students carry a \nbalance each month which requires them to pay finance charges. Nearly \none in five college seniors hold $7,000 or more in credit card debt.\n  A study by U.S. Public Interest Research Group found that college \nstudents' credit card balances have soared 134 percent in the past 10 \nyears.\n  The study also found that 76 percent of college students reported \nstopping at a table on or near campus advertising credit cards, and \nthat nearly a third of students were offered a free gift in exchange \nfor signing up.\n  Credit card companies lure cash-strapped students with all kinds of \noffers. Free food. T-shirts--the most-common inducement. Frisbees. \nCandy. Even iPods. All for filling out a credit card application.\n  More than a dozen States currently restrict credit card marketing on \ncollege campuses.\n  In California, credit-card marketers can't lure students with free \ngifts; in Oklahoma, colleges can no longer sell student information for \ncredit-card marketing purposes; and, in Texas, on-campus credit-card \nmarketing may only occur on limited days in certain locations.\n  With credit card companies aiming their marketing more and more at \nstudents, we are seeing colleges and universities increasingly entering \npartnership agreements with these companies.\n  These agreements produce millions in revenue for colleges and \nuniversities, while banks get exclusive marketing access and student \ncontact information.\n  As State funding shrinks for public universities, such deals grow.\n  We don't know much about the agreements between credit card companies \nand universities. But we do know that schools often receive large cash \npayments in exchange for providing students' personal information, \nincluding permanent addresses, e-mail addresses and phone numbers.\n  This enables companies to target students with precision.\n  Some contracts even pay universities if students have a balance on \nthe card after 12 months, which suggests some universities stand to \nprofit from the debt carried by their students.\n  The sheer scale of these contracts is astounding: Michigan State has \nan $8.4 million contract with Bank of America; and, the University of \nTennessee has a $10 million contract with Chase.\n  Bank of America has agreements with nearly 700 colleges and alumni \nassociations.\n  Virtually every major university boasts a multimillion-dollar \naffinity relationship with a credit-card company.\n  It is vital that schools make these agreements public.\n  Colleges should not encourage their students to sign up for products \nwith high interest rates and fees that could get them bogged down in \ndebt.\n  These arrangements can get students, who are just starting out, into \ndeep trouble that can stay with them for decades.\n  This is shameful.\n  The underlying bill provides much-needed safeguards for young \nconsumers, who too often do not have the financial knowledge and \nexperience to manage their credit wisely.\n  I commend Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby for their \nleadership in crafting this well-balanced legislation.\n  Under this bill, issuers are required to obtain a cosigner or income \nverification for anyone under age 21 that applies for a credit card.\n  And, prescreened offers of credit to young consumers under age 21 \nwill be limited.\n  Issuers also will not be allowed to increase the credit limit on \naccounts where a cosigner--such as a parent or guardian--is liable \nunless the cosigner authorizes the increase.\n  These provisions will play an important role in protecting college \nstudents, and all young consumers, from deceptive practices.\n  Our amendment will enhance these protections.\n  Developing good credit is essential, and it is difficult to develop \ngood credit without holding credit cards.\n  When used responsibly, credit cards are convenient, and provide \npurchasing power that otherwise may not be available.\n  But many students begin using credit cards with highly unfavorable \nterms, and end up ruining their credit.\n  Shining a light on the agreements between universities and credit \ncard issuers not only makes good sense. It may also act as a deterrent \nto deals with highly unfavorable terms for students.\n  Parents, students and the public should be aware of what kind of \ndeals are in place and why they exist.\n  Also, this amendment will address the incentive of the free gift for \nsigning up for a credit card. Too often, students sign up for credit \ncards to receive a free gift, and then have difficulty canceling the \ncard, or may face hidden fees and charges.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in putting in place these commonsense \nrestrictions to protect college students across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say a word about the minimum payment \ndisclosure provisions in this bill.\n  When we considered the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer \nProtection Act in 2005, we said that our goal was to balance fairness, \nand responsibility. I agreed with this goal, but in the end, I voted \nagainst the bill because I did not believe it achieved that balance.\n  Since that time, I have continued to say that we need to do more to \nprotect Americans from abusive credit practices and to ensure that \nconsumers have the information they need to make good, informed \nfinancial decisions.\n  In every Congress since 2005, I have introduced a bill to require \ncredit card companies to disclose what the real financial effects are \nwhen a consumer makes only the minimum monthly payment on her credit \ncard balance each month.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Dodd and Shelby have included similar \nprovisions in the credit card bill that we are considering today.\n  The bill requires that all credit card statements include a general \nwarning about the effects of making minimum payments, personalized \ninformation showing a cardholder exactly how much it will cost and how \nlong it will take to pay off their balance if they make only the \nminimum payment each month, and a phone number that consumers can call \nto get a reliable credit counseling referral.\n  I am confident that these warnings will make a significant difference \nfor consumers.\n  I think we are all familiar with minimum monthly payments--this is \nthe amount listed at the top of your credit card statement that you \nhave to pay each month to avoid a fee.\n  What people are less familiar with though, is the effect of these \nminimum payments.\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\n  Let me give you an example. In November 2008, according to USA Today, \nthe average American had $10,678 in credit card debt.\n  Now let's take a family holding that amount of debt at this week's \naverage interest rate of 10.78 percent. If that family consumer made \nonly a 2 percent minimum payment on their bill each month, it would \ntake them over 28 years and a total of $19,144 to pay that card off. \nAnd that is assuming they didn't ever charge another penny to the \ncard--no cash advances, no gas purchases, no trips to the mall.\n  In the end, the consumer would have paid $8,466 in interest on \nslightly over $10,000 in debt.\n  And 10.78 percent is a relatively low rate for many Americans. \nInterest rates around 20 percent are not uncommon, and penalty interest \nrates can reach as high as 32 percent.\n  Consumers need to know how these amounts add up.\n  Let me tell you one more troubling thing about minimum payments. In \nDecember, the Economist reported on a study done on these requirements.\n  In the study, a psychologist at a British university gave 413 people \nfake credit card bills. All of the bills said the person owed about \n$650 total, but half of them listed a minimum payment of around $8. The \nother half made no mention at all of a minimum payment.\n  What the study found was that when the minimum amount was listed, \npeople were inclined to pay less of their total bill. In fact, among \npeople who chose not to pay their full balance, people paid 43 percent \nless when they saw a minimum payment amount on their bill.\n  Behavioral economists describe this as a ``nudge'': By showing the \nminimum amount, the statement ``nudged'' the consumer to pay less than \nhe or she would have otherwise.\n  Now obviously, this is good for the credit card company--the consumer \nends up paying less each month but more in interest over time, and \nthat's how the credit card companies make their profits.\n  But this is terrible for consumers, who can end up underwater, with \nhuge balances owed, and not understand how they got there.\n  People need to know the effects of making minimum monthly payments, \nand this bill will finally require credit card companies to show them.\n  I believe the disclosure requirements in the bill will go a long way \ntoward helping consumers make good financial decisions and helping them \nto avoid ending up in bankruptcy. So I want to commend my colleagues, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby, for their hard work on the bill before \nus today. These warnings have been a long time in coming, and I will be \nvery pleased to see them enacted into law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order, except a managers' amendment, which has been \ncleared by the managers and leaders, and that at 10 a.m. Tuesday, May \n19, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 627, and proceed to vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the Dodd-Shelby substitute amendment \nNo. 1058; that if cloture is invoked on the substitute amendment, then \nthe Senate proceed to consider any pending germane amendments; that \nupon disposition of those amendments, all postcloture time be yielded \nback; the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and the Senate then proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill; that the cloture motion with respect to H.R. 627 \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay \nbefore the Senate a message from the House with respect to S. 386, the \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer laid before the \nSenate the following message from the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 386) entitled \n     ``An Act to improve enforcement of mortgage fraud, securities \n     fraud, financial institution fraud, and other frauds related \n     to federal assistance and relief programs, for the recovery \n     of funds lost to these frauds, and for other purposes'', do \n     pass with amendments.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate has passed the bipartisan \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, S.386. This bill will soon \nbe sent to the President to be signed into law. The House passed this \nbill overwhelming just last week. This bill is a major step toward \nholding accountable those who have caused so much damage to our \neconomy. It will also help protect our economic recovery efforts from \nthe scourge of fraud.\n  Our bill will strengthen the Federal Government's capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of financial frauds that have so \nseverely undermined our economy and hurt so many hard-working people in \nthis country. These frauds have robbed people of their savings, their \nretirement accounts, their college funds for their children, and their \nequity and have cost too many people their homes. The bill will help \nprovide the resources and legal tools needed to police and deter fraud \nand to protect taxpayer-funded economic recovery efforts now being \nimplemented.\n  I want to once again commend Senator Grassley, our lead cosponsor, \nfor his leadership at every stage in this process. He helped to write \nthis legislation and to manage it on the Senate floor, where it \nultimately passed 92 to 4. He also worked tirelessly to make important \nand difficult compromises with Senate and House leaders, which was \ncrucial to crafting a consensus a bill that could pass both Houses. He \nhas once again proven his dedication to protecting taxpayer funds by \ndeterring, investigating, and prosecuting fraud.\n  I thank Majority Leader Hoyer and the House leadership, as well as \nChairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith and Congressmen Berman and Scott \non the House Judiciary Committee, for working with us to promptly pass \nthis bill in the House with minimal changes and a number of helpful \nadditions. The new ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Sessions, was also very important and supportive in those \nnegotiations.\n  I thank our many cosponsors for their steadfast support for this \neffort. Senators Kaufman and Klobuchar have worked particularly hard to \nensure that this important fraud enforcement bill becomes law, and I \nthank them for their efforts. Senator Kaufman has spoken and written \nabout the need for fraud enforcement all year. We have been joined by a \ngrowing bipartisan group of cosponsors that now stands at 28. And I \nthank our majority leader and our underappreciated cloakroom and floor \nstaff for all that they have done on this bill.\n  Mortgage fraud has reached near epidemic levels in this country. \nReports of mortgage fraud are up 682 percent over the past 5 years, and \nmore than 2800 percent in the past decade. And massive, new corporate \nfrauds, like the $65 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard \nMadoff, are being uncovered as the economy has turned worse, exposing \nmany investors to massive losses. We can now finally take action to \nbetter protect the victims of these frauds. These victims include \nhomeowners who have been fleeced by unscrupulous mortgage brokers who \npromise to help them, only to leave them unable to keep their homes and \nin even further debt than before. They include retirees who have lost \ntheir life savings in stock scams and Ponzi schemes, which have come to \nlight as the markets have fallen and corporations have collapsed. They \nalso include American taxpayers who have invested billions of dollars \nto restore our economy, and who expect us to protect that investment \nand make sure those funds are not exploited by fraud.\n  This legislation will immediately give Federal law enforcement \nagencies the tools and resources they need to combat fraud effectively. \nIn the last 3 years, the number of criminal mortgage fraud \ninvestigations opened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nFBI, has more than doubled, and the FBI anticipates that number may \ndouble yet again. Despite this increase, the FBI currently has fewer \nthan 250 special agents nationwide assigned to financial fraud cases, \nwhich is only a quarter of the number the Bureau had more than a decade \nago at the time of the savings and loan crisis. At the current levels, \nthe FBI cannot even begin to investigate the more than 5000 mortgage \nfraud allegations referred by the Treasury Department each month.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress responded to the collapse \nof the federally insured savings and loan industry by passing \nlegislation similar to the bill we consider today, to hire prosecutors \nand agents. While the current financial crisis dwarfs in scale to the \nsavings and loan collapse, we are poised to once again take decisive \naction.\n  At its core, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act authorizes the \nresources necessary for the Justice Department, the FBI, and other \ninvestigative agencies to respond to this crisis. In total, the bill \nauthorizes $245 million a year over the next 2 years to hire more than \n300 Federal agents, more than 200 prosecutors, and another 200 forensic \nanalysts and support staff to rebuild our Nation's ``white collar'' \nfraud enforcement efforts. While the number of fraud cases is now \nskyrocketing, we need to remember that resources were shifted away from \nfraud investigations after 9/11. Today, the ranks of fraud \ninvestigators and prosecutors are drastically understocked, and \nthousands of fraud allegations are going unexamined each month. We need \nto restore our capacity to fight fraud in these hard economic times, \nand this bill will do that.\n  Fraud enforcement is an excellent investment for the American \ntaxpayer. According to recent data provided by the Justice Department, \nthe government recovers more than $20 for every dollar spent on \ncriminal fraud litigation. Strengthening criminal and civil fraud \nenforcement is a sound investment, and this legislation will not only \npay for itself, but will bring in money for the Federal Government.\n  In addition, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act makes a number of \nstraightforward, important improvements to fraud and money laundering \nstatutes to strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat this growing wave \nof fraud. It also strengthens one of the most potent civil tools we \nhave for rooting out fraud in government--the False Claims Act. The \nFederal Government has recovered more than $22 billion using the False \nClaims Act since it was modernized through the work of Senator Grassley \nin 1986, but this bill will make the statute still more effective. In \nfact, the amendments the House made to the bill, after extensive input \nfrom Senator Grassley and Congressman Berman, strengthen the False \nClaims Act further still.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act has broad bipartisan support, \nas well as the strong backing of the Justice Department and the Obama \nadministration. As explained in the Statement of Administration policy:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386. \n     Its provisions would provide Federal investigators and \n     prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and \n     resources that would assist in holding accountable those who \n     have committed financial fraud.\n\n  Strengthening fraud enforcement is a key priority for President \nObama. During the campaign, President Obama promised to ``crack down on \nmortgage fraud professionals found guilty of fraud by increasing \nenforcement and creating new criminal penalties.'' And the President \nmade good on this promise in his budget to Congress by calling for \nadditional FBI agents ``to investigate mortgage fraud and white collar \ncrime,'' as well as hiring more Federal prosecutors and civil attorneys \n``to protect investors, the market, and the Federal Government's \ninvestment of resources in the financial crisis, and the American \npublic.'' The initial Senate-passed recovery package included \nadditional money for the FBI for this purpose, but it was cut during \nthe negotiations that led to its passage. This bill, the bipartisan \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, is our chance to authorize the \nnecessary additional resources to detect, fight and deter fraud that \nrobs the American people and American taxpayers of their funds. Strong \nsupport from the President and the Justice Department has been integral \nto making progress on this important bill.\n  This is and has been bipartisan legislation. Our cosponsors and our \nsupporters in both Houses of Congress come from across the political \nspectrum--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. What we share is a \ncommitment to fight fraud and the horrible costs it is imposing on \nhard-working Americans. I believe that our efforts are supported by \nmost Americans. No one should want to see taxpayer money intended to \nfund economic recovery efforts diverted by fraud. No one should want to \nsee those who engaged in mortgage fraud escape accountability. Law \nenforcement agencies desperately need the resources and tools in this \nlegislation.\n  During these first months of the year, the Judiciary Committee has \nconcentrated on what we can do legislatively to assist in the economic \nrecovery. Already we have considered and reported this fraud \nenforcement bill, the patent reform bill, and worked to ensure that law \nenforcement assistance was included in the economic recovery \nlegislation.\n  The recovery efforts are generating signs of economic progress. That \nis good. That is necessary. But that is not enough. We need to make \nsure that we are spending our public resources wisely and that they are \nnot being dissipated by fraud. We need to ensure that those responsible \nfor the downturn through fraudulent acts in financial markets and the \nhousing market are held to account. That is why the Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act is so needed.\n  The bill has also received the support of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National \nAssociation of Assistant United States Attorneys, the Association of \nCertified Tax Examiners, and Taxpayers Against Fraud. It was strongly \nendorsed by an editorial in The New York Times on April 18, 2009.\n  I thank Senators for joining with us to take decisive action to \nprotect American families and our economy from fraud.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment with the amendment which is at the desk; \nand that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; further, that \nthe Senate then concur in the title amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the leaders leave the floor, I thank \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader for their tremendous help \nin putting this agreement together. I look forward to a favorable vote \non Tuesday. I wanted them to know how much I and the consumers in this \ncountry appreciate immensely the work of the leaders. I thank, \nparticularly, the majority leader, Harry Reid, for his involvement to \nmake it possible for us to get to this moment. I also include Senator \nShelby and others.\n  I hoped to be able to complete the bill today. Obviously, that didn't \nhappen. We have reached a framework by which we can vote on Tuesday. \nThere will be a managers' amendment, and we hope to be able to \naccommodate this agreement in that package. It doesn't suggest that \nevery amendment will be agreed to. Where we can, we will try to do \nthat.\n  This is a strong bill. I thank the members of the Banking Committee--\nboth Democrats and Republicans--who worked on it. I am grateful to \nSenator Shelby and his staff for bringing us to this moment in the \nhopes that on Tuesday we will have the final conclusion of this effort.\n  I thank the other body, as well, particularly Chairman Barney Frank, \nfrom Massachusetts, for his leadership. He has done a masterful job in \nthe other body in bringing Democrats and Republicans together with an \noverwhelming vote in that Chamber in support of credit card reform. We \nwill talk over the weekend, as we usually do, to see if we cannot \nresolve any outstanding issues that will allow this bill to quickly \narrive on the President's desk. The President said he wants it before \nMemorial Day. I think we can do that. My hope is that we will complete \nthe work on Tuesday and, by the end of next week, maybe we can send the \nbill to the President for his signature.\n  I cannot think of a better message to the American people. I say that \nwhile my colleagues and the President would like a bill, the people we \nrepresent need a bill to provide economic relief for them. That was the \ndesign of this legislation--to provide needed economic relief for \nmillions of Americans, who have watched rates and fees go through the \nceiling.\n  This bill is not going to solve every economic problem. For the first \ntime that I know of in the history of the Congress, despite these cards \nbeing available for half a century and more, in some cases, we are \ntaking a step to reform an industry that, frankly, has gotten out of \ncontrol when it comes to fees and rates, as we have witnessed with 70 \nmillion accounts having interest rates raised in the last couple of \nyears, and one out of every four families being adversely affected.\n  Every member of the Chamber can tell an anecdote about constituents \nwho have faced difficulties with credit card fees and interest rate \nhikes. I think we are all pleased that we are finally doing something \nin a meaningful way on this. It is not the end of the discussion.\n  There are a lot of other aspects of the industry that need reform as \nwell. My colleagues are anxious to get to those, including the \ninterchange issue, which retailers have talked to me about for years. \nWe can try to provide relief for them. We don't provide real relief in \nthis bill, except a study that Senators Corker, Durbin, and others, \nincluding myself, want to be done to get answers on how to reform the \ninterchange fees issue. I hope we can get answers to that and talk \nabout a legislative fix in that area as well. This bill avoids that \nquestion, not because we disagree with reforming the interchange fee \nbut we felt it was more than we could take on with this bill.\n  This bill only came out of the Banking Committee with a 1-vote \nmargin, 12 to 11.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate this Nation's \nmany dedicated public servants.\n  As we confront the global outbreak of the 2009 influenza H1N1 virus, \npublic servants are on the front lines in a coordinated Federal, State, \nand local government response, working to provide the public with \naccurate, real time information to reduce the possibility of further \ninfection. At our borders and ports, Federal employees are monitoring \nincoming visitors for signs of illness. State and local health \nofficials are monitoring, testing, and treating people with suspected \ncases of the flu virus.\n  This effort is one of the many contributions hardworking, talented \ngovernment employees make to improve our lives every day. They deliver \nour mail, care for our veterans, guard our prisons, protect our borders \nand communities, defend our country, and educate our children. They \ninfluence the lives of people around the world as diplomats, promoting \npeace, prosperity, and democracy in conflicted regions, and providing \ncritical assistance to developing and impoverished communities.\n  In honor of these and many other unsung activities of public \nservants, I offered an annual resolution, S. Res. 87, which unanimously \npassed the Senate on April 21, 2009, to recognize the dedicated men and \nwomen who serve our country, honor those brave heroes who died in \nservice to their country, and encourage all Americans to consider a \ncareer in public service.\n  Last week was Public Service Recognition Week. We set aside the first \nfull week of May to recognize and honor the accomplishments of Federal, \nState, and local government employees. Across the country, hundreds of \nevents took place in appreciation of the millions of public servants \nwho serve as the quiet bedrock of our Nation's workforce. This year's \ncelebration included a 4-day exhibition on the National Mall where more \nthan 100 civilian and military Federal agencies showcased their \nprograms and initiatives to the public.\n  In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F. Kennedy called on \nall Americans to make a commitment to public service. His call inspired \na generation to serve. President Barrack Obama again called for action \nin his inaugural address. Public interest in Federal Government jobs is \nincreasing, but we must ensure that Americans who embrace a public \nservice career are not deterred by the lengthy and complicated hiring \nprocess. Last week, I held a hearing on how to improve Federal job \nrecruitment so that we can harness the renewed spirit of service that \nPresident Obama has inspired. There is no better time to rise to the \noccasion and serve.\n  As a former teacher and a life-long public servant, I am proud to \nhighlight\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nthe importance of Public Service Recognition Week. This is a critical \ntime for our Nation, with many domestic and global challenges. Although \nwe have designated a week to honor government employees, I rise today \nto stress the importance of remembering the invaluable service of \npublic servants throughout the year. Our way of life--and the strength \nof our country would not exist without the work of public employees. \nAnd so to all the dedicated men and women currently serving our Nation, \nmahalo nui loa--thank you very much--for all that you do.\n  Mr. President, I am including Director John Berry's letter of support \nfor Public Service Recognition Week with my statement and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of Personnel Management,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \n         the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to thank you for your \n     sponsorship of S. Res. 87, a resolution expressing the sense \n     of the Senate that public servants should be commended for \n     their dedication and continued service to the Nation during \n     Public Service Recognition Week, May 4 through 10, 2009, and \n     throughout the year.\n       As you know, Public Service Recognition Week, celebrated \n     the first Monday through Sunday in May since 1985, is a time \n     set aside each year to honor the men and women who serve \n     America as Federal, state and local government employees. \n     Throughout the Nation and around the world, public employees \n     use the week to educate citizens about the many ways in which \n     government serves the people and how government services make \n     life better for all of us.\n       As the Director of the Office of Personnel Management \n     (OPM), Public Service Recognition Week is the perfect time to \n     spread President Obama's call to public service and to \n     recognize public employees. I am committed to making the \n     Federal government a better place to work by speeding up the \n     hiring process, increasing opportunities for veterans, and \n     implementing programs that help employees balance work and \n     family life.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership in recognizing the \n     hard work of our public servants during Public Service \n     Recognition Week and I look forward to working with you to \n     make the federal government a better place to work.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Berry,\n     Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5497-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING REVEREND ROBERT CORNELL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of Rev. \nRobert Cornell, a great Wisconsin public servant and teacher. For most \nof his life, Reverend Cornell called northeast Wisconsin his home--as a \nstudent at St. Norbert Abbey, a Congressman, and a professor of history \nand government at St. Norbert College.\n  Reverend Cornell was only the second Catholic priest to be elected to \nCongress when he represented Wisconsin's Eighth Congressional District \nfrom 1975 to 1979. Just as he did all his life, Reverend Cornell came \nto Washington to fight for education and social justice for the \nWisconsinites he represented.\n  But his greatest accomplishments may have come in the halls of St. \nNorbert College as he used history to help guide young Wisconsinites to \nnew levels of academic achievement. During his decades in the \nclassroom, Reverend Cornell would bring history to life like no other. \nHe brought out the best in his students with captivating lectures that \ndisplayed his tremendous knowledge, experience, and wit. His impact \nwill certainly be felt for years to come through the countless students \nhe taught and mentored.\n  Reverend Cornell stands out as a towering figure in the history of \nnortheast Wisconsin. His influence on education and public service has \nleft a lasting mark on our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5497-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK MACK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to pay \ntribute to Chuck Mack for his many years of service to the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n  After 43 years of dedicated service, Mr. Mack is stepping down from \nhis positions as secretary-treasurer for the International Brotherhood \nof Teamsters Local 70, and president of the Teamsters Joint Council 7. \nWhile Mr. Mack may be leaving his current leadership positions within \nthe Teamsters, he is by no means retiring. Instead, he is heeding the \ncall of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust, where he \nwill now serve as the co-chair of the organization.\n  During his four-plus decades of service to the Teamsters, Mr. Mack \nhas worked tirelessly to help negotiate first-class rights for bay area \nworkers and their families. With a reputation for integrity and hard \nwork, Mr. Mack has provided the Teamsters with unparalleled leadership \nin major labor disputes in northern California throughout his tenure. I \nparticularly commend Mr. Mack for his efforts in advancing \nenvironmental justice issues for port communities throughout the San \nFrancisco bay area.\n  As he transitions to his new position as cochair of the Western \nConference of Teamsters Pension Trust, I applaud Mr. Mack's continued \ninvolvement with the Teamsters Union. Unions provide valuable \nrepresentation to American workers and their families, and have worked \nto establish many of the rights and privileges that we now take for \ngranted--rights and privileges that have helped millions of workers \nachieve the American dream.\n  After over four decades of service to the International Brotherhood \nof Teamsters, I remain in admiration of Chuck's strong sense of civic \nduty, his unparalleled service to the labor movement, and his tireless \nadvocacy for workers' rights at the local, Sate, and national levels. I \nwish him many more years of continued community involvement and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5497-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO C. BRENT DEVORE\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I honor the career of Dr. C. \nBrent DeVore, the dean of higher education presidents in central Ohio. \nFor 25 years, Dr. DeVore has served Otterbein College, its students, \nand the Westerville, OH, community. He retires at the end of this \nacademic year.\n  A son of Zanesville, OH, who earned degrees from Ohio University and \nKent State University, Dr. Devore has dedicated his professional life \nto improving higher education for America's young people.\n  Dr. DeVore became president of Otterbein College in 1984. He helped \ndevelop the institution from a small, liberal arts college to a \nnationally ranked, comprehensive college. Dr. DeVore put Otterbein on \nstable financial footing, increasing the school's endowment by \nfifteenfold. He oversaw a transformation of the campus infrastructure, \nincluding the construction of new academic buildings, residence halls, \nathletic facilities, and an expansion of the library.\n  More importantly, Dr. DeVore helped transform the human capital of \nthe college. The graduate education program was added in 1989, the \ngraduate nursing program in 1993, and the MBA program in 1997. The \nnumber of faculty holding advanced degrees nearly doubled. Student \ndiversity increased, enrollment doubled, retention rates soared, and \nthe quality of incoming students skyrocketed.\n  Throughout Dr. DeVore's career, he has worked to develop innovative \nand comprehensive programs to encourage young people to engage in \ncommunity and volunteer service and oversaw the creation of Otterbein's \nCenter for Community Engagement. In 2007, Otterbein was one of only \nthree schools across the country to receive the Presidential Award for \nGeneral Community Service in the President's Higher Education Community \nService Honor Roll.\n  While, Dr. DeVore's leadership at Otterbein will be missed, his \nlegacy will remain for generations. Dr. DeVore has made Otterbein \nCollege better, he has made Ohio better, and he has made our Nation \nbetter. I wish him well and hope that his service to Ohio will continue \nin the next phase of his outstanding career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5497-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5497-S5498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OHIO'S SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BROWN.

ALLYN DINGEL, JR.\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a fellow \nIdahoan who served the Idaho legislature, the Idaho, judiciary, the \nEpiscopal Diocese of Idaho and the Idaho State Bar with honor, \nintegrity, and good humor. M. Allyn Dingel, Jr., passed away at his \nhome in Boise, ID, on April 23, 2009 after a courageous battle with \nlung cancer.\n  Allyn was born in Twin Falls, ID, where he played baseball and was \nthe student body president at Twin Falls High. He attended college at \nthe University of Idaho, and continued to organize spontaneous \nrenditions of the Idaho Vandal fight song, whether asked to or not.\n  Allyn attended New York University Law School, where he was one of \nthe top students and was a member of the NYU Law Review. Allyn worked \nfor the Idaho Attorney General's Office for 3 years, and then spent \nmore than 40 years in private practice. In his spare time, he served as \nChancellor for the Episcopal Diocese of Idaho, providing extensive \nlegal services pro bono.\n  Allyn was a trial lawyer, and the courtroom was his stage. His \nmethods were not always conventional. He had his own vocabulary, and a \nway of communicating that was sometimes humorous, but always \nbelievable. Allyn was a lawyer's lawyer. He was a fellow of the \nprestigious American College of Trial Lawyers. He served as Idaho's \nrepresentative to the Ninth Circuit Commission, and was Idaho's \ndelegate to the American Bar Association House of Delegates. The Idaho \nState Bar honored him in 2004 when he was named its Distinguished \nLawyer, and in 2008 the Idaho Judiciary named a courtroom in Boise \nafter him.\n  Allyn was a lobbyist for both the insurance industry and the Idaho \njudiciary. He was especially effective as a lobbyist because he never \nforgot a political story or a point of Idaho trivia. As a lobbyist, he \nwas generous with his humor and his story-telling. Shortly before his \ndeath, the Idaho legislature honored him with Senate Concurrent \nResolution No. 111, which commended him for his lifetime service to the \nlegislative branch of the State of Idaho.\n  But for all of Allyn Dingel's many accomplishments, he will be \nremembered most for his great compassion and his ability to find the \ngood in people. It was said that he never forgot, but he always \nforgave. We can imagine him at the Pearly Gates telling St. Peter some \nlong story about Idaho politics. We just hope those in line behind him \nwere patient as he tried to teach St. Peter the words to the Vandal \nfight song.\n  I am honored to reflect on Allyn Dingel's wonderful, exemplary life, \nand pleased to call him my friend. He was an individual who made the \nmost from the opportunities that presented themselves, and Idaho is \nbetter for that. My condolences go out to his family: his beloved wife \nFran, his sons and their wives, Bryan and Valencia and Mike and Lori, \nand his six grandchildren. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5498-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SAL GUARRIELLO\n\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of \nSal Guarriello, a decorated veteran and an incredible public servant.\n  Mr. Guarriello was a beloved citizen of West Hollywood, serving for \n19 years on its city council and for three terms as its mayor. During \nhis nearly two decades on the council, he was a voice for the Russian, \ndisabled, and LGBT communities, seniors, and veterans.\n  Mr. Guarriello received a Purple Heart when he was wounded while \nserving as an Army combat medic during World War II. For the rest of \nhis life, he strove to honor and represent the needs of his fellow \nveterans. In 1998, he proposed that a veterans' memorial be built in \nWest Hollywood to honor the sacrifices of all of America's veterans, \nand 5 years later his vision became reality.\n  Before joining the West Hollywood City Council, Mr. Guarriello worked \nto provide affordable housing as a member of the board of directors of \nthe West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation and the West Hollywood \nRent Stabilization Commission.\n  Mr. Guarriello also created the West Hollywood Children's Summer \nOlympics, initiated a successful anti-drunk driving campaign, and \nformed the Eastside Redevelopment Agency, which was instrumental in the \nsuccessful negotiation of a plan to rehabilitate Santa Monica \nBoulevard.\n  Sal Guarriello will be remembered by his family, friends, and \nconstituents as a patriot, a public servant, and an exceptional leader \nof the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5498-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5498-S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLEASANT VALLEY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Pleasant \nValley Elementary School in South Windsor, CT. Pleasant Valley, or \n``PV'' as it is affectionately referred to by many in South Windsor, \nwill be celebrating its 50th anniversary this June. To mark this \nmomentous occasion, I feel it is fitting to reflect back on all this \nschool has done for its students and its community.\n  Pleasant Valley's motto is ``Pleasant Valley School, a place to \nlearn, to grow, and to care,'' and many of the students, parents, and \nfaculty that have been involved with the school would attest that it \nhas more than succeeded in creating such an environment. For 50 years, \nPleasant Valley has helped the children of South Windsor develop a love \nof learning and discovery while instilling in them the skills and work \nethic needed to succeed in South Windsor's excellent secondary schools.\n  When Pleasant Valley first opened in September 1958, it taught grades \none through eight. While it was tough managing a large group of kids \nwith such large age differences, those who attended or worked at the \nschool during this time fondly recall basketball games, spelling bees, \nschool plays, dedicated teachers, and, of course, friendships that \nwould last a lifetime. Eventually, Pleasant Valley would become \nresponsible for teaching students in kindergarten up to the fifth \ngrade, and would always remain a vibrant, innovative place of learning.\n  Over the years, Pleasant Valley's staff has consistently launched \ninspired new initiatives designed to connect with their students. In \n1981, PV started the Read at Home Program, which was put together to \nencourage students to read on their own. The theme for the program's \nfirst year was ``footsteps to reading,'' which allowed students to post \na paper foot on the school's walls for every book they read. By the end \nof the year, students had\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nmanaged to cover almost the entire school, including the principal's \noffice. In 1989, the school established the Special Friends Program--\nthe first in South Windsor--to provide a safe setting, counseling, and \nfriendship to at-risk students and those students experiencing sudden \nchanges in their lives.\n  In the 1990-1991 school year, Nancy Mason, the school nurse, and \nPriscilla Spencer, the school's gym teacher, introduced an inventive \nproject designed to teach students about both geography and physical \nfitness. The students were told that the school's mascot--Popcorn the \nPanther--was going to take a walking trip across the United States in \nwhich he would travel a mile for every mile that each student walked or \nran. For the rest of the year, students were required to walk or run at \nleast half a mile during every recess period and were encouraged to \nwalk more. Prizes were given to the class and grade that contributed \nthe most miles to Popcorn's journey. Throughout the year, teachers \nwould have friends and family members who lived around the country send \npostcards ``from Popcorn'' so that students could see the fruits of \ntheir efforts and learn about various regions of the country. This \nsuccessful program concluded with a large welcome home ceremony at the \nend of the school year, with several students joining Popcorn, played \nably by an older student, for his final walk back to school.\n  At a time when much of our focus is understandably on improving \nschools that are not living up to standards, it is important to take \ntime out to recognize those schools that have consistently provided a \nquality education to their students and that are constantly striving to \nfind new ways to inspire students to reach new heights. For 50 years, \nPleasant Valley School of South Windsor, CT, has been one of these \nschools; providing students with the ideal setting in which to develop \ntheir abilities, meet friends, and cultivate new interests. It truly is \na place to learn, to grow, and to care. I congratulate all of Pleasant \nValley's students, alumni, faculty, parents, and volunteers on a \nremarkable 50 years and look forward to seeing how they tackle the \nchallenges of the future. Their dedication is truly an inspiration and \nshould serve as an example to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CAPTAIN WENDELL B. RIVERS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to honor \nNavy CAPT Wendell B. Rivers, who passed away on Saturday, May 9, 2009.\n  Wendell ``Wendy'' Rivers was born in Seward, NE, on July 6, 1928. He \ngraduated from Seward High School in 1946, where he was senior class \npresident, an all-conference football and basketball player, and an \n880-yard track specialist. Upon graduation, Rivers enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy, receiving an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1948 and \ngraduating in 1952, when he received his commission as an Ensign in the \nU.S. Navy. Following a brief tour on a destroyer during the Korean \nconflict, he entered flight training in 1953, receiving his wings in \nMarch 1954.\n  Over the course of his career, Captain Rivers distinguished himself \nin many assignments as a naval aviator, missile project officer, flight \ndeck officer, and squadron operations officer. Subsequent assignments \nwere in naval aviation on the west coast at San Diego, Moffett Field, \nMonterey, Point Mugu, and Lemoore. During the Vietnam conflict, Captain \nRivers deployed on his last cruise from Alameda, CA, aboard the USS \nCoral Sea, as a member of Air Wing 15, Attack Squadron 155. On February \n11, 1965, he flew the first of 96 combat missions over North Vietnam. \nTragically, on his 96th mission, he was shot down and captured at Vinh, \nNorth Vietnam, where he was then held in captivity for 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  While a prisoner of war, POW, Captain Rivers kept his faith in God, \ncountry, and Navy, despite all the hardships facing him and his fellow \nPOWs. His steadfastness and devotion to others was an inspiration to \nthose fellow POWs. In fact, shortly after he was freed, as the guest of \nhonor at a celebration of America's independence in Nebraska's Fourth \nof July capital city, which was also coincidentally his hometown of \nSeward, Captain Rivers expressed that deep down he and his fellow POWs \nwere always convinced they would one day come home.\n  After the tremendous sacrifice he had already endured, Captain Rivers \ncontinued to serve the Navy until 1976. The end of his career included \nserving as the head of the Aircraft Survivability and Vulnerability \nBranch of the Naval Air Systems Command, for which VADM F.S. Petersen \nsaid, ``It was through Captain Rivers' personal forethought and \ninitiative that this important aspect of Naval Aviation came to \nfruition.''\n  CAPT Wendell B. Rivers passed away in his home on May 9, 2009, at the \nage of 80. Over the course of his career, Captain Rivers received \nnumerous commendations, decorations, and medals, including the Silver \nStar, Legion of Merit with Star, Bronze Star, Distinguished Flying \nCross, Vietnam Service Medal with three Silver Stars, Navy Occupation \nMedal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, United Nations \nService Medal, and Korean Presidential Unit Citation. These awards \nreflect Captain Rivers' bravery and selfless service toward the \nsecurity of our great country. The life and service of individuals such \nas Captain Rivers represents an example of patriotism we should all \nstrive to emulate. I join all Nebraskans in mourning the loss of \nCaptain Rivers and offer my deepest condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5499-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5499-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5499-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5499-S5500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:41 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2162.

    \n\n[Pages S5504-S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson, of \n        Florida, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Casey,  Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1038. A bill to improve agricultural job opportunities, benefits, \nand security for aliens in the United States and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe it is fair to say that there \nis a farm emergency in this country. Some of it is caused by drought, \nincluding out West where California has had, for 3 years, a very \nserious drought. But most of it is caused by the absence of farm \nlabor--labor to help plant, prune, and harvest.\n  Many of us have listened to farm bureaus throughout the country, \nspoken with farmers who are losing land, fallowing land, and leasing \nland abroad. I think the time has come to do something about it.\n  Today, with 16 cosponsors, I am introducing an agricultural worker \nbill known as AgJOBS. This bill is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, \nSchumer, Kennedy, Kohl, Boxer, Dodd, Lieberman, Bingaman, Feingold, \nMurray, Kerry, Bill Nelson, Kaufman, Casey, Cantwell, and Levin. It \nwould provide farmers with the stable, legal workforce they deserve by \nreforming the broken H-2A seasonal worker program and offering a \npathway to citizenship for hard-working, law-abiding immigrants already \nemployed or who have been employed on American farms.\n  This bill is supported by more than 200 agricultural coalition and \nimmigration reform groups throughout the Nation.\n  Since I last came to the floor to talk about a solution to this \ncrisis, it has only grown. The bill is necessary, and I believe \nCongress must act now to save America's agriculture industry.\n  Today across the United States, there are not enough agricultural \nworkers to do the pruning, picking, packing, and harvesting of our \ncountry's crops. With an inadequate supply of workers, farmers from \nMaine to California, from Washington State to Georgia, have watched \ntheir produce rot in fields, and have been forced to fallow close to \nhalf a million acres of land, and billions of dollars are being drained \nout of our economy as a result.\n  Farmers are downsizing their operations. Many are buying or leasing \nland in Mexico. Others are going out of business. Quite clearly, the \nlabor situation facing the American farmer is an emergency.\n  So some ask: Why don't American farmers hire Americans to do their \nwork? The unemployment rate is high. People are looking for jobs. So \nwhy don't they hire Americans?\n  The fact is, they have tried and tried and tried. But there are very \nfew Americans who are willing to take the job in a hot field, doing \nbackbreaking labor, in temperatures that often exceed 100 degrees. That \nis a fact.\n  The other fact is that immigrant workers are the backbone of \nAmerica's agricultural industry--a huge industry and a proud industry, \nwhich is now dying due to the lack of steady labor supply.\n  Farmers are departing the country in order to stay in business, \nleaving devastated farm communities behind. In California, in the Great \nCentral Valley, farmers who once tended ``America's breadbasket'' are \nnow standing in bread lines, with unemployment rates in their \ncommunities that are as high as 45 percent. Topsoil from fallowed land \nturning into dust now blows up in sandstorms and has caused periodic \nshutdowns of Interstate 5, the State's main north-south freeway.\n  As a result of Congress's inaction, between 2007 and 2008--1 year--\n1.56 million acres of farmland, once rich with crops, are now dormant. \nThat is 1.5 million acres dormant in a year. In California alone, in \nthe past 5 years, that amount--1.5 million acres--of production has \nbeen lost.\n  American farmers have moved at least 84,155 acres of production to \nMexico. This is what we know of: Over 84,000 acres of farm production \nnow in Mexico. This has resulted in the growth of farm labor jobs in \nMexico; namely, 22,285 jobs to cultivate crops that vary in diversity \nfrom avocados to green onions to watermelons.\n  This shortage of workers is devastating American agriculture, and we \nneed to wake up and understand what is happening. In the next 1 to 2 \nyears, the United States stands to lose $5 billion to $9 billion in \nagricultural sales to foreign competition if Congress does not act to \nprovide a workforce for the American farming community.\n  California has already lost almost $1 billion from 2005 to 2006. It \nis estimated we will lose between $1.7 and $3.1 billion in the next \nyear. The California farm industry--the largest in America--was almost \na $40 billion-a-year industry. It is deteriorating every year.\n  We are witnessing nothing less than the slow vanishing of American \nagriculture.\n  Ayron Moiola, the executive director of the Imperial Valley Vegetable \nGrowers Association, predicts that California's asparagus crops will \ndisappear completely in the Imperial Valley if their demand for \nspecialized asparagus planters and harvesters is not met.\n  Colorado farmers have estimated their State's fruit and vegetable \nindustry will disappear completely in the next 5 to 10 years without \nsome program to provide a sustainable workforce.\n  As of February 2008, 35 to 45 New Hampshire farm operations have been \nat risk of going out of business or being forced to severely cut back \noperations due to labor shortages.\n  This reduction in farm production would result in an estimated loss \nof 22,000 acres of farmland and $58 million of agricultural production \nfor New Hampshire alone. In addition, over 600 full-time farm jobs and \n4,300 jobs in agriculture-related businesses could be in jeopardy.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I hear this from your apple growers \nin New York, and I hear it from the dairy industry throughout America.\n  The situation is dire from coast to coast, and urgent action is \nrequired to halt these trends. I do not think we can afford to lose our \nentire agricultural industry because this has always been a central and \nsustainable part of our national economy. Our food is clean; there are \nstrong pesticide controls in this country. I think most of us believe \nwe would much prefer to buy American produce than foreign produce. Yet \nwe may not have that opportunity.\n  When farmers suffer, there is a ripple effect felt throughout the \neconomy: in farm equipment manufacturing, packaging, processing, \ntransportation, marketing, lending, and insurance. Jobs are being lost, \nand our economy is going to decline further as a result. Low-producing \nfarms mean a lowered\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nlocal tax base--as farms no longer generate income and create jobs.\n  As can be seen from this graphic I have in the Chamber, for every job \nlost on a farm and ranch, the country loses approximately three jobs in \nrelated sectors that are supported by having the agricultural community \nin this country.\n  I have received a letter from the Port of Oakland, which depends \nheavily on agribusiness for its survival. According to the port, last \nyear more than 750 metric tons of agricultural products, worth \napproximately $2.6 billion, were shipped through the port, representing \n40 percent of the port's exports.\n  As these farms disappear, port jobs, basic jobs for people, also \ndisappear. The central issue is not immigration; it is the bottom line \nof the American economy. I think Congress should be doing everything we \ncan to prevent U.S. farms from closing down.\n  There is a solution, and it is this bill. This bill is well known, \nand this bill has been well supported in the past with a majority of \nvotes. It is bipartisan. We can take it up and pass it today, and that \nwould immediately help American farmers bolster the U.S. economy at a \ncritical time.\n  The AgJOBS bill has two parts. The first meets the immediate needs of \nour farmers by creating a program that would provide an opportunity for \nexperienced agricultural workers to earn the right to apply for legal \nstatus in this country.\n  The second part meets the long-term needs of farmers by reforming the \nH-2A program--that is the temporary worker program for the farm \nindustry--so that if new workers are needed, farmers and growers have a \nlegal path to bring workers in to harvest their crops.\n  The first step of the program requires that undocumented agricultural \nworkers apply for a blue card if they can demonstrate they have worked \nin American agriculture in the United States for at least 150 workdays \nwithin the previous 2 years before December 31, 2008.\n  The second step requires that a blue cardholder work in the U.S. \nagricultural industry for an additional 150 workdays per year for at \nleast 3 years, or 100 workdays per year for 5 years.\n  At the end of this time, a worker can obtain a green card and can \ncontinue to work in agriculture.\n  Workers participating in the program will be required to pay a fine \nof $500, show that they are current on their taxes, and that they have \nnot been convicted of any crime that involves bodily injury, the threat \nof bodily injury or harm to property.\n  Employment is verified through employer-issued itemized statements, \npay stubs, W-2 forms, employer letters, contracts or agreements, \nemployer-sponsored health care, timecards or payment of taxes.\n  At the end of 5 years, those workers will be able to gain citizenship \nin this country.\n  The blue card visa program will be capped at 1.35 million blue cards \nover 5 years and sunsets after 5 years.\n  All blue cards will have encrypted, biometric identifiers, and \ncontain other anticounterfeiting protections. This provides, in effect, \na biometric identifier for 1.35 million people who are undocumented but \nin the country today.\n  AgJOBS would also streamline the current guest worker program, known \nas the H-2A program, which is currently unwieldy and ineffective.\n  Among other things, the bill will shorten the labor certification \nprocess, which now often takes 60 days, reducing the approval process \nto between 48 to 72 hours.\n  Advertising and positive recruitment for U.S. workers in the local \nlabor market is required by filing a job notification with the local \noffice of the State employment security agency.\n  Petitions for admission of H-2A workers must be processed and the \nconsulate or port of entry notified within 7 days of receipt.\n  The adverse effect wage rate would be frozen for 3 years, to be \ngradually replaced with a prevailing wage standard.\n  H-2A visas will be secure and counterfeit resistant.\n  The reforms to the H-2A agricultural worker program are especially \nimportant to meet the needs of year-round agricultural industries, such \nas dairy, which are not covered by the seasonal program.\n  Many say that dairy should use the seasonal H-2A program--but it does \nnot work for that industry. They need workers 24/7, 365 days a year.\n  The National Milk Producers recently shared with me an economic study \ndone by researchers at Texas A that will be released next week on the \neconomic impacts of immigration on U.S. dairy farms. Over 5,000 dairy \nfarms, surveyed nationally, with responses from 47 States, are in this \nstudy. Of these, 50 percent use immigrant labor. Immigrant labor now \naccounts for 62 percent of milk production in 47 States.\n  As can be seen from this chart I have in the Chamber, eliminating \nimmigrant labor would reduce the U.S. dairy herd by 1.34 million, milk \nproduction by 29.5 billion pounds, and the number of farms by 4,532. \nRetail milk prices would increase by an estimated 61 percent.\n  This will be the result if we do not recognize what is a basic \nreality that farm and dairy communities depend on undocumented workers, \nwho are the only workers who will do this kind of work.\n  This is hard for people to believe. However, a while back, we posted \nnotices in the welfare departments of all 58 california counties that \nsaid: Agricultural worker jobs available. Please sign up here.\n  However, do you know how many workers came from this? Not a single \none.\n  When I drive down the highway, down to Monterey, along the coast, and \nI go through the great Salinas Valley, I watch the row crops either \nbeing planted or sprayed or harvested. You see the workers in the field \nstooped over, hour after hour, in the sun, when it is 100 degrees or \nmore in temperature, and you can see the specific nature of this type \nof work.\n  People think of this work as unskilled labor, but it is not. It is a \nlearned skill. These workers have to move fast and be trained to use \nthe farm equipment. They know how to work skillfully with their hands \nand move row after row, after row, down the field.\n  Last summer, a young pregnant woman working in the field collapsed \nfrom heat exhaustion and was taken to the hospital, where she died. \nWorking in the field is back breaking, difficult work, and there are \nvery few Americans who are willing to do this work.\n  The backbone of the agriculture industry in my State is the \nundocumented workforce and it is time to recognize that reality. I \ncan't have--and Mr. President, you can't have--farmers standing in \nbread lines because they can't get the labor to plant or harvest their \ncrops. The fields across America are increasingly being fallowed and \nthis does not make sense.\n  Congress must stand tall and acknowledge that the basic workforce in \nthe American agricultural community is undocumented farm labor. \nUndocumented workers take these jobs because they are professional and \nproud of the work that they do. I believe that is desirable.\n  This bill has previously passed with more than a majority in \ncomprehensive immigration reform. It recognizes that the American farm \nindustry is in crisis; that the industry is deteriorating; and that \nAmerica is losing its produce. This bill stands up for American farmers \nand provides them with the workforce they deserve--American farmers \nlike Toni Scully, a pear farmer from Lake County, CA.\n  Toni Scully experienced a devastating harvest that left much of her \npear crop rotting on the ground because she could not find workers in \ntime for the harvest.\n  Early last year, I heard from Dewey Zabka, an onion and potato farmer \nin northern Colorado who, for the first time in his company's 50-year \nhistory, had to downsize 25 percent of his production.\n  In the State of New York, 800 farms and $700 million in sales may be \nforced to go out of business or scale back their farm operations if \nlabor shortages continue. For the first time since 1991, Jim Bittner, \nthe owner of Singer Farms in Appleton, NY, razed 10 percent of his \nsweet cherry and peach orchards last year because he could not get farm \nlabor.\n  For the 2009 season, California growers who anticipate a shortage of \nreliable labor are deciding to move away\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nfrom planting permanent tree crops, including peach, plumb, nectarine, \nalmond, pomegranate, and olive trees. Many of these farmers are \nsupplementing these crops with pistachios, which can be harvested \nmechanically.\n  In June 2008, The Oregonian reported that Oregon's pear and onion \nindustries are at risk of not being able to sustain production without \nconsistent labor.\n  In Yuma County, AZ, where agricultural workers earn between $10 and \n$19 per hour, U.S. lettuce producers were unable to find enough \nlaborers to harvest the spring crop of lettuce for 2008.\n  The truth is Americans will not do the work that sustains \nagriculture. It is hard, stooped labor requiring long and unpredictable \nhours. As a result, the labor shortage will be persistent. It is not \ngoing to get better next year, unless we have the courage and the guts \nto stand up for a major industry in America which deserves a steady \nlabor base, particularly during these difficult economic times. And \nthere are examples all over the nation that Americans simply won't fill \nthese jobs.\n  H. Lee Showalter, a member of the Pennsylvania Apple Marketing Board, \npoints to the example of the largest Macintosh apple producer in New \nYork, who is required to advertise for local labor before joining a \nmigrant labor program. Of the 300 workers he needed to fill, only 1 \nAmerican worker applied.\n  Willoway Nurseries, Inc. has been in business in northern Ohio since \n1954. Willoway Nurseries has attempted to recruit local workers, though \nto no avail. General nursery workers on this farm earn a starting wage \nof $9.93 per hour. Yet it has been impossible for the nursery to \nrecruit American help.\n  The Washington Farm Bureau reported that nearly 500 tons of apples \nwere not picked in Washington State's apple harvests last year due to \npicker shortages. As Valoria H. Loveland, director of the Washington \nState Department of Agriculture, stated in a letter to me:\n\n       The reality of our local labor market [is that] local \n     people who want to work are already employed, or are not \n     interested in doing the seasonal and physically demanding \n     work that characterizes our specialty crop production.\n\n  Experts estimate that nearly 80 percent of Florida's approximately \n150,000 agricultural workers are undocumented immigrants. This is a \n$1.6 billion a year business that produces up to 90 percent of the \nfresh domestic tomatoes that Americans eat between the months of \nDecember and May.\n  Many farmers have been in business for generations. Many farm the \nland that their parents and their grandparents farmed before them. \nCalifornia farms produce approximately 350 different crops: pears, \nwalnuts, raisins, lettuce, onions, strawberries, and apricots, just to \nname a few. Without reform, we will continue to see the deterioration \nof American farms nationwide. This includes the possibility that \ncertain vegetables and fruits will no longer grow in our Nation, where \nwe have stricter rules and regulations for safety.\n  Once the trees are gone, they are replaced by crops that do not \nrequire manual labor. As a result, our pears, our apples, our oranges \nwill be increasingly coming from foreign sources. This is not what \nAmerica wants, but it is what Congress's inaction compels.\n  The trend is quite clear. If there is not a means to grow and harvest \nour produce in this country, we will import produce from China, from \nMexico, and from other countries that have sufficient labor. If our \nfarmers want to stay in business, they will continue to go to Mexico \nand lease land and grow crops there. We are not doing our duty if we \nlet this continue.\n  Steve Scaroni has been in the California lettuce and broccoli \nindustry for over three decades. In recent years he has moved 2,000 \nacres and 500 jobs from his $50 million operation in Heber, CA, to \nGuanajuato, Mexico. Steve wants his business to survive, and he can't \nhire or plant. If he can't plant, he can't pick. If he can't pick, he \ncan't pack, and he won't be able to deliver a harvest. As a result, \ntoday Steve exports to the United States about 2 million pounds of \nlettuce a week. He has spent thousands of dollars to start up the new \nfarms and to train workers to ensure that his crops meet U.S. food \nsafety standards.\n  In Wilcox, AZ, Eurofresh Farms has transferred tomato crops and 150 \nworkers to Sonora, Mexico, where tomatoes are grown and shipped to the \nU.S. on a daily basis.\n  Reforming the system means that we not only protect the agricultural \nindustry, but also the health of this Nation. This past July, the Food \nand Drug Administration confirmed that a variety of jalapeno and \nserrano peppers grown in Mexico caused an outbreak of salmonella in the \nUnited States. This outbreak was first thought to have originated in \ntomatoes.\n  The repercussions of the outbreak were felt on farms from coast to \ncoast. In Georgia alone, it is estimated that the tomato scare cost \nlocal farmers about $14 million in total production value. Nationwide, \nthe tomato industry lost at least $100 million due to lower prices and \nreduced demand. At the same time, over the last 15 years, imports of \ntomatoes have increased 179 percent. Right now, almost 40 percent of \nthe tomatoes that we eat are grown in a foreign country. Yet tomato \nfarmers are being forced to close shop.\n  The agriculture industry has been seeking a resolution for the labor \ncrisis for the past 10 years. Mr. President, I have received over 50 \nletters of support for AgJOBS.\n  I am committed to working with the Obama administration, and Senators \nLeahy, Schumer, and Kennedy, as well as the House champions, \nRepresentatives Berman and Putnam, and others, to support U.S. farmers \nand the workers who provide the skilled labor needed to plant, tend and \nharvest our crops.\n  The time is now, and the solution is before us. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in support of AgJOBS and help restore America's farms before \nit is too late.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, \nletters of support, and list of supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Farm workers and their families \n     live in fear of deportation, and agricultural growers across \n     the country face worker shortages. AgJOBS would enable farm \n     workers to bargain for better working and living conditions \n     and provide growers a legal stable labor supply by offering \n     undocumented farm workers the chance to come out of the \n     shadows and earn legal status by meeting stringent \n     agricultural-work requirements. It is important that AgJOBS \n     would also revise the H-2A agricultural guestworker program \n     in a balanced manner.\n       This bipartisan bill is the product of congressional \n     negotiations and an historic compromise between the United \n     Farm Workers and major agribusiness employers. It also has \n     the full support of hundreds of farmer, worker, and immigrant \n     organizations. Its passage would be a substantial down \n     payment on the kind of comprehensive immigration reform our \n     country needs.\n           Sincerely,\n         Anna Burger, Chair, Change to Win, International \n           Secretary-Treasurer, Service Employees International \n           Union (SEIU); Edgar Romney, Secretary-Treasurer, Change \n           to Win, Executive Vice President, UNITE HERE; Joseph \n           Hansen, International President, United Food and \n           Commerical Workers, International Union, UFCW); James \n           Hoffa, General President, International Brotherhood of \n           Teamsters (IBT); Geralyn Lutty, United Food and \n           Commerical Workers International Union (UFCW).\n         Douglas J.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, \n     largest, and most diverse civil and human rights coalition, \n     we thank you for introducing the Agricultural Job \n     Opportunities, Benefits and Security Act (``AgJOBS'') of \n     2009. We have strongly supported virtually identical versions \n     of the AgJOBS bill in previous Congresses, and we look \n     forward to working with your office and our other allies in \n     the effort to move it forward in the 111th Congress.\n       AgJOBS would provide a legal, stable agricultural labor \n     supply and, at the same time, give undocumented farmworkers \n     the chance to come out of the shadows and earn legal \n     immigration status a) by meeting a past-work requirement in \n     American agriculture and b) through stringent future \n     agricultural-work requirements. Giving farmworkers the \n     ability to legalize their status is critical to enabling them \n     to bargain for better working and living conditions. AgJOBS \n     represents a balanced approach and is a tremendous \n     improvement over the current H-2A agricultural guestworker \n     program, thanks to the concessions made by all sides in this \n     debate.\n       The treatment of farmworkers is a matter of great \n     importance to the civil rights community. Whether it was \n     Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, the 4.5 million \n     braceros brought into the United States during the World War \n     II era, or H-2A workers under the current program, \n     guestworkers have long been the most vulnerable and poorly \n     treated workers among us. Even today, they are subject to \n     below poverty-level wages and a lack of coverage by basic \n     labor standards that other American workers take for \n     granted--and they lack the political and economic power to \n     improve these conditions on their own. It is because of this \n     that we speak up today for their rights, and strongly urge \n     the enactment of AgJOBS.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Dairy Farmers of America,\n\n                                                     May 12, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Last Congress, you showed \n     extraordinary leadership in authoring the Agricultural Jobs, \n     Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act (AgJobs), a bill which \n     restructures and reforms the current H-2A temporary \n     agricultural worker program to ensure a reliable and legal \n     workforce for the agricultural community. On behalf of the \n     nearly 18,000 members of Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. (DFA) \n     we applaud your decision to reintroduce this important \n     measure in the 111th Congress.\n       Dairy Farmers of America is a dairy marketing cooperative \n     that serves and is owned by dairy farmers in 48 states. Our \n     cooperative's success is built on the success of its \n     producer-members, who raise their dairy herds and their \n     families on family farms across the nation.\n       Immigrant labor plays a crucial role in contributing to the \n     success of our members and the dairy industry as a whole. A \n     large percentage of the hired workers on dairy farms of all \n     sizes are immigrants. Unfortunately, unlike most other \n     immigrant-dependent agricultural sectors, the dairy industry \n     is currently blocked by the Department of Labor (DOL) from \n     using the H-2A program because of the program's requirement \n     that the worker and job both be temporary or seasonal. This \n     seasonality aspect of the H-2A program has prevented dairy \n     farmers from using the program to attract and maintain needed \n     workers. In order to survive, our industry needs reform in \n     the system now.\n       Once again, on behalf of DFA members across the country, we \n     appreciate your leadership on this matter and stand ready to \n     fight for its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  John Wilson,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Marketing and Industry Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       U.S. Apple Association,\n\n                                         Vienna, VA, May 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, thank you for standing up for the \n     U.S. apple industry and other labor intensive agriculture by \n     reintroducing the AgJOBS bill in the Senate.\n       Apple production and harvesting is highly labor-intensive. \n     The cost and availability of a predictable, consistent and \n     legal supply of labor is critically important to the U.S. \n     apple industry.\n       The past few years have brought great uncertainty to our \n     industry. Labor shortages coupled with increased enforcement \n     and a cumbersome, unworkable H-2A guest worker program have \n     meant that, even in good crop years, growers' livelihoods are \n     in jeopardy when they cannot get all of their apples off the \n     tree. This has lead many in the industry to delay or cancel \n     plans to expand and in some cases to get out of the fruit \n     business altogether.\n       We need AgJOBS! Without this critical legislation, the U.S. \n     could lose much of our domestic apple industry and with it \n     over $2 billion in farm gate value. Our apples would have to \n     be imported, most likely from China, the world's largest \n     producer of apples. We've seen what dependence on foreign oil \n     has been like. Can you imagine dependence on foreign food? \n     This is not what American consumers want.\n       USApple and our industry leaders stand ready to work with \n     you and your staff to pass AgJOBS. We have supported the \n     legislation since the first year it was introduced and it is \n     our top legislative priority.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Nancy E. Foster,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                 Society of American Florists,\n\n                                                     May 12, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the members of the \n     Society of American Florists (SAF), I understand that you \n     plan to reintroduce the Agricultural Job Opportunities, \n     Benefits and Security Act (AgJOBS) this week. We applaud you \n     for your courageous leadership and tenacity in working to \n     advance agricultural labor reform. AgJOBS reflects years of \n     negotiations on complex and contentious issues and will \n     achieve historic and critical reforms to our nation's labor \n     and immigration laws.\n       The bipartisan AgJOBS legislation recognizes the unique and \n     urgent need of labor intensive agricultural industries--\n     ranging from floral and nursery to fruits and vegetables, \n     meat and dairy farms--to have access to a legal workforce. \n     Thank you for recognizing these needs and taking the lead to \n     change the untenable status quo. Your efforts on behalf of \n     agriculture will go far to preserve one of our country's \n     strategic commodities--a stable and reliable labor supply \n     that produces our food and helps to sustain our economy.\n       An estimated two-thirds of farm workers lack proper work \n     authorization. No other segment of the economy is so \n     dependent upon a foreign-born workforce. Our industry is also \n     vulnerable to the increased workplace immigration enforcement \n     focused on employers. In addition, several pending regulatory \n     enforcement mechanisms like the ``no-match'' rule and ``E-\n     Verify'' mandate an immediate legislative solution to the \n     labor problems of agriculture.\n       Agricultural economists estimate that three non-farm jobs \n     in the upstream and downstream economy are sustained by every \n     farm worker job. Absent the reforms of AgJOBS, many of these \n     jobs will be lost because agricultural producers will have no \n     choice but to cut back or send some of their production \n     offshore.\n       In addition, AgJOBS will contribute to increasing national \n     security by enhancing the rule of law. In the short term, \n     those eligible to earn legal status must come forward, submit \n     to a background check and make substantial commitment to \n     agricultural work prospectively. This ability to retain our \n     trained workforce will lead to a long-term solution so that \n     capacity can be built to allow greater participation in a \n     reformed H-2A program.\n       Finally, the bipartisan AgJOBS continues to have the \n     endorsement and support of organized labor, agriculture, \n     immigrant rights and religious community groups, and general \n     business, through three Congresses.\n       Thank you for your leadership and vision on this vital \n     issue. We look forward to working with you in the months \n     ahead to enact AgJOBS.\n       The Society of American Florists is the national trade \n     association representing the entire floriculture industry, a \n     $21 billion component of the U.S. economy at retail. \n     Membership includes about 10,000 small businesses, including \n     growers, wholesalers, retailers, importers and related \n     organizations, located in communities nationwide and abroad. \n     The industry produces and sells cut flowers and foliage, \n     foliage plants, potted flowering plants, and bedding plants.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Kevin Priest,\n     Chairman, Government Relations Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                American Nursery &\n\n\n                                        Landscape Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Nursery & Landscape \n     Association commends you for your steadfast leadership toward \n     resolving the labor crisis that threatens every labor-\n     intensive sector of agriculture in America. ANLA represents \n     2000 active member firms and an additional 20,000 grassroots \n     network participants who grow, sell, and install landscape \n     plants. ANLA members also produce the orchard and vineyard \n     planting stock that sustains farms in California and across \n     the nation. At farmgate, our industry was valued by the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture at over $16 billion in 2007. \n     California is of course the nation's leading nursery stock \n     producer, but nurseries are an important agricultural \n     component from coast to coast. Nursery and greenhouse \n     production ranks among the top five sectors of agriculture in \n     28 states, and in the top 10 in all 50 states!\n       Nursery farming is inherently labor intensive and requires \n     specialized skills. As with the rest of agriculture, much of \n     the nursery workforce is comprised of foreign workers; their \n     labor here contributes immensely to the American economy and \n     secures the continued employment of hundreds of thousands of \n     nursery farm managers, office, marketing, sales, and other \n     staff--good American jobs that will move to Canada or Mexico \n     or China if we do not have a stable and legal workforce \n     performing the nursery work that cannot be readily \n     mechanized.\n       ANLA has long supported AgJOBS because its bipartisan, \n     common-sense reforms reflect how our country and our Congress \n     must confront and solve myriad tough challenges. AgJOBS \n     recognizes the unique experience and talent of the farm labor \n     force that is here, now, feeding America, and encourages \n     these workers to continue contributing to the well-being of \n     our nation as they earn their way to a brighter future. \n     AgJOBS also provides a lasting solution through a sweeping \n     overhaul of the H-2A program. Indeed, we could not support a \n     bill that fails to provide a lasting solution. Many ANLA \n     members now use H-2A and many more will be able to when the \n     reforms of AgJOBS are enacted.\n       Senator, we have shared a difficult journey, and the \n     journey is far from complete. We look forward to the \n     enactment of the urgently-needed reforms of AgJOBS, whether \n     as part of a much broader effort to reform America's failing \n     immigration system, or as part of a strategic first step. \n     Again, thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Robert J.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to commend you on the \n     AgJobs Act of 2009, a piece of legislation crucial to \n     maintaining America's position in an increasingly \n     internationalized market in vegetables, fruits, and grains. \n     The bill is a paradigm of what immigration reform should be--\n     friendly alike to families and businesses, but mindful of the \n     needs of public safety.\n       It is well known to those who represent agricultural \n     constituents that foreign migrant workers are crucial to \n     American farmers, ranchers, and foresters. What is less \n     understood is the vast network of white collar jobs that \n     depend on maintaining access to guest workers in America. \n     Roughly one half of the agricultural labor force consists of \n     those who work with crops in field, nurseries, and \n     greenhouses. The rest, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     NAICS codes reveal, represent a cross section of American \n     skills: Managers in production, finance, transportation, and \n     sales; computer programmers and systems analysts; accountants \n     and auditors; life scientists and agricultural engineers; \n     pilots and truck drivers, riggers and diesel mechanics; \n     salesmen, secretaries and receptionists--an entire world of \n     white collar jobs on American soil, much of it dependent on \n     the competitive nature of our operations in the fields, \n     nurseries, and greenhouses.\n       It has become fashionable in some circles to pretend that \n     the exclusion of foreign workers from America's farms will \n     relieve American farmers of their competition. This is not \n     so. It is possible, had one the heart for it, to remove \n     Mexican nationals from American fields--but we cannot remove \n     Argentinians from Argentina, Brazilians from Brazil, or \n     Malaysians from Malaysia. A healthy agricultural industry \n     requires access to all types of labor, including field labor, \n     on a competitive basis, here in America.\n       We hope you will succeed in moving AgJobs 2009 to keep \n     American agriculture competitive.\n           Best,\n                                                   Richard Nadler,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 2009.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing out of deep concern \n     for the future of the agricultural industry in California, \n     and the U.S. generally. For reasons set forth more fully \n     below, it is imperative that Congress pass legislation this \n     year, such as AgJOBS, that will provide agriculture with a \n     stable, reliable and legal workforce.\n       As you know, California agriculture relies upon a large \n     immigrant workforce. The current economic crisis and rampant \n     unemployment has only confirmed what you and our industry \n     have been saying for years: American workers will not do \n     these jobs. Despite staggering job losses, there has been no \n     perceptible shift in the demographic makeup of our workforce. \n     Today, as always, our industry relies on a community of \n     talented immigrant farmworkers. They are the best farmworkers \n     in the world, and our industry would cease to exist without \n     them.\n       Honest employers who do not intend to hire illegal \n     immigrants, but unknowingly do when employees provide them \n     with false but genuine-appearing employment verification \n     documents, stand beneath the proverbial Sword of Damocles, \n     never knowing if their workforce--or they themselves--will be \n     hauled off by federal agents. Where should agricultural \n     employers look to find labor when Americans won't do the job \n     and the ones that will are largely falsely documented? The \n     answer is not the current H-2A program, which is notoriously \n     cumbersome, uneconomical and prone to litigation.\n       I submit that the best opportunity to solve the farm labor \n     issues in California and the U.S. is AgJOBS. AgJOBS would \n     provide workable and fair legal channels for farmworkers to \n     enter the country, work, and return home after completing the \n     season. At the same time, there is a clear and compelling \n     need for experienced farmworkers who lack legal status to be \n     given a chance to earn legal status over time, subject to \n     reasonable conditions.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n       California's $32 billion dollar agricultural industry \n     produces one-half of the nation's fruits, vegetables and tree \n     nuts. Without the passage and implementation of AgJOBS, \n     California and the nation will continue to export farms along \n     with the field jobs and three to four upstream and downstream \n     jobs that are created in the agricultural industry. \n     Furthering U.S. dependency on imported crops from countries \n     such as China is not only dangerous for our health, it is \n     devastating to our economy.\n       It is imperative that AgJOBS pass this year. On behalf of \n     Western Growers, I urge you to introduce AgJOBS in the Senate \n     as soon as possible, as this legislation must not be delayed \n     any longer.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Thomas A. Nassif,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n     Western Growers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          United Farm Workers,\n\n                                          Keene, CA, May 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your leadership on \n     the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security \n     Act (``AgJOBS'').\n       As you are well-aware, the status quo for farmworkers and \n     agricultural employers is untenable and must be reformed. The \n     majority of farmworkers lack immigration status. Because they \n     live and work in the shadows, undocumented farmworkers are \n     too fearful to complain about violations of their wages and \n     working conditions and are vulnerable to exploitation by \n     labor contractors and growers. The wages of all farmworkers \n     are depressed by the presence of so many employees who lack \n     any meaningful bargaining power. The ability to legalize the \n     immigration status of farmworkers under AgJOBS is key to \n     enabling farmworkers to bargain for better working and living \n     conditions.\n       With this letter are just a few stories of farmworkers and \n     their families who will be helped by the passage of AgJOBS. \n     The United Farm Workers collected these stories from \n     farmworkers and farmworker groups and unions throughout the \n     country. There are thousands more like them.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership and commitment to \n     AgJOBS. We look forward to working with you to achieve this \n     desperately needed reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Arturo S. Rodriguez,\n     President\n                                  ____\n\n                                       The National Association of\n\n\n                             State Departments of Agriculture,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The National Association of State \n     Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) is a nonprofit nonpartisan \n     association that represents the Commissioners, Secretaries \n     and Directors of Agriculture in the 50 states and for US \n     territories. NASDA supports the Agricultural Job Opportunity, \n     Benefits and Security Act of 2009 (AgJOBS).\n       As leaders in agriculture, we recognize that a critical \n     workforce need exists today in agriculture. Millions of \n     American jobs depend on agricultural production and will be \n     enhanced with legislation that can secure a legal work force \n     for agriculture as well as regularize the status of current \n     agricultural workers through an adjustment program problem. \n     Farmers in most regions of the United States have faced \n     critical shortages of entry level workers for many years. \n     AgJOBS is a solution for workers and agriculture producers.\n       NASDA has carefully considered the farm labor issue and has \n     concluded that Congress needs to enact immigration reform \n     legislation that provides workable and fair legal channels \n     for farmworkers to enter the country, work, and return home \n     when the season is over. The best opportunity to achieve both \n     of these goals is the bipartisan and time-tested AgJOBS.\n       NASDA's current policy on agricultural labor is consistent \n     with the objectives of the AgJOBS legislation. NASDA policy \n     addresses four areas of concern to all agricultural \n     industries: concern for the basic rights of all agricultural \n     workers, recognition that the current H2A program does not \n     serve as a viable means for addressing gaps in the local \n     workforce, the need for a trustworthy identification system \n     for non-citizen workers, and the need to regularize the \n     status of the existing workforce during a transition to a \n     more transparent and enforceable means of meeting basic \n     workforce needs.\n       We greatly appreciate your support and reintroduction of \n     this important legislation.\n\n                                                   Ron Sparks,\n\n                                    NASDA President, Commissioner,\n     Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.\n       To The Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, supports the \n     ``Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of \n     2009'' (AgJOBS), which is expected to be introduced today.\n       The Chamber supports a comprehensive solution to fixing \n     America's broken immigration system and believes that AgJOBS \n     is a step towards that goal and one that can be taken now. \n     One of the bill's most important attributes is that it \n     provides a reasonable mechanism for the most experienced, but \n     unauthorized agricultural workers to earn legal status \n     subject to strict conditions.\n       Agriculture is a sector that is highly sensitive to foreign \n     competition. Forcing much of U.S. agricultural production \n     offshore through an enforcement-only approach to immigration \n     policy is resulting in significant loss of American jobs and \n     leaving the United States less secure. The U.S. agriculture \n     sector is the most reliant on the foreign-born labor supply. \n     However, each farmworker sustains jobs in the upstream and \n     downstream economy--equipment, supplies and services, \n     packaging and distribution, lending and insurance.\n       The bipartisan AgJOBS is the fruit of years of hard work by \n     business and labor, conservatives and liberals, Republicans \n     and Democrats alike. The Chamber urges your support for \n     enactment of AgJOBS, this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R.

Mr. President, once again I am pleased to join Senator \nFeinstein to introduce the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, \nand Security Act AgJOBS. Senator Feinstein has been pursuing these \nimportant reforms for several years now, and I commend her dedication \nto this legislation, and to America's farmers. I join her and the other \ncosponsors of this legislation in strong support of America's \nagricultural industry and the men and women who work hard every day to \nkeep our farms running.\n  In Vermont, as in many States across the country, farmers are feeling \nthe effects of a scarce labor pool. This problem is particularly acute \nfor the dairy industry, where the employment needs are year-round and \nrequire a significant investment from the farmer in terms of training \nand development. I have long been concerned about the dairy farmers' \ndifficulties in trying to use the agricultural visa program. It simply \nmakes no sense that the visa program dedicated to agriculture cannot be \nused by such an important arm of the industry.\n  I have long advocated for the dairy-specific provisions in the AgJOBS \nbill. I worked to include these protections for dairy farmers during \nCongress's last two debates on comprehensive reform, and it is time for \nthe immigration law to accommodate the legitimate needs of the Nation's \ndairy farmers. The AgJOBS bill will change this. It would give dairy \nfarmers needing workers the opportunity to lawfully hire foreign \nworkers who can remain with their employers for a meaningful period of \ntime.\n  The AgJOBS legislation contains other important reforms that will \nhelp all of America's farmers. The creation of a blue card for \nundocumented agricultural workers who have been working to keep our \nfarms running and fields planted and harvested is the right thing to \ndo. It is a targeted and limited proposal that will serve to help \nfarmers and farm workers. I have said before that no American farmer \nshould be forced to choose between his or her livelihood and obeying \nthe law. In Vermont it is estimated that as many as 2000 undocumented \nworkers work on dairy farms in the State. We can all agree that this is \nnot an ideal situation--not for the farmer and not for the worker, and \nnot for an overall immigration system that is in need of substantial \nrepair.\n  By providing a mechanism for loyal undocumented foreign workers to \ncome out of the shadows and into the sunlight of the protection of the \nlaw and the rights it will provide them, Congress can help begin a new \nday in American agriculture. No longer will farmers endure the waste \nand heartbreak of watching fields of crops rot for lack of workers to \nharvest. Workers will be able to contribute lawfully and openly to our \nNation's agricultural industry, and integrate into their surrounding \ncommunities, adding to the fabric of our diverse American life. The \nneed for this legislation is clear and present, and I hope that some \nwho have stood in opposition to sensible immigration reform will \nrecognize that hardworking farmers and their communities are as much \nthe victims of their misguided obstructionism as are the immigrants \nthey seek to punish. We will need the strong support in the Senate and \nfrom the Obama administration if we are to make these and other reforms \nto our immigration system. President Obama recognized the need for this \nlegislation as a Senator when he was an original cosponsor last \nCongress. His leadership will be critical as we move forward.\n  Our bill contains other sensible provisions concerning the rights of \nworkers, fair wages, and a streamlined process for farmers using the H-\n2A process. These are all important reforms that I am proud to support. \nSenator Feinstein is committed to the Nation's farmers and those who \nwork for them, and I am pleased to join her in support of these needed \nreforms.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I also rise today in strong support of \nthe Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2009, \nalso known as AgJOBS.\n  The distinguished Senator from California has already eloquently \nexplained what the AgJOBS bill is, what it seeks to accomplish and why \nAmerica needs this Congress to pass AgJOBS as soon as possible.\n  I simply wish to briefly explain to the people of my home State of \nNew York--as, their Senator--and to all of the American people, as \nchairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, why I support AgJOBS \nand why I think they should support AgJOBS too.\n  Simply put, the status quo in our agricultural industry is \nunsustainable.\n  What is the status quo? All around my home State of New York, and \nacross the country, family farmers are trying to do the right thing and \noperate lawful and successful farms.\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n  Virtually every family farmer I have met in my travels across New \nYork has aggressively tried to hire Americans to work in their \nnurseries, orchards, farms, and vineyards.\n  For instance, my friends in the Long Island Farm Bureau can tell you \nthat more than half of their members pay more than $12-$15 per hour per \nworker, and actively seek to hire American workers, often arranging \nbuses to recruit Americans into Long Island to work.\n  But what these family farmers are finding is that--even in this bad \neconomy, even if they offer Americans twice or sometime three times the \nminimum wage and provide benefits--American workers simply won't stay \nin these jobs for more than a few days.\n  Why don't Americans want to stay in many of these agricultural jobs? \nLet me share with you the description of the working conditions for \nagricultural workers as provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in \ntheir 2008-2009 Occupational Outlook Handbook. Here is their \ndescription:\n\n       Much of the work of farmworkers and laborers on farms and \n     ranches is physically strenuous and takes place outdoors in \n     all kinds of weather.\n       Harvesting fruits and vegetables, for example, may require \n     much bending, stooping, and lifting. Workers may have limited \n     access to sanitation facilities while working in the field \n     and drinking water may also be limited.\n       Farm work does not lend itself to a regular 40-hour \n     workweek. Work cannot be delayed when crops must be planted \n     or harvested or when animals must be sheltered and fed.\n       Long hours and weekend work is common in these jobs. For \n     example, farmworkers and agricultural equipment operators may \n     work 6- or 7-days a week during planting and harvesting \n     seasons.\n       Many agricultural worker jobs are seasonal in nature, so \n     some workers also do other jobs during slow seasons. Migrant \n     farmworkers, who move from location to location as crops \n     ripen, live an unsettled lifestyle, which can be \n     stressful.\n       Farmworkers risk exposure to pesticides and other hazardous \n     chemicals sprayed on crops or plants.\n\n  This is certainly not the description of a life most Americans would \nwant for themselves, much less for their children. And so what the \nfamily farmers in New York experience is that even when Americans take \nthese jobs, the vast majority quit after only a few days.\n  So who is stepping in to take many of these difficult agricultural \njobs? Immigrants who need these jobs to support the families they left \nbehind in their native country.\n  But the vast majority of the immigrants working in agricultural jobs \nare undocumented. For this reason, family farmers are often required to \nchoose between hiring undocumented workers or going out of business.\n  AgJOBS solves this problem in a way that is fair to everyone.\n  AgJOBS requires current undocumented agricultural workers to pay a \nfine, pay their taxes, undergo thorough background checks, and legalize \ntheir status in order to keep their jobs. If these workers refuse to \nlegalize their status, or have any kind of criminal record, they will \nbe deported.\n  AgJOBS provides America's family farmers with access to legal workers \nand removes the burden on farmers to perform the role of Federal \nimmigration enforcement officials.\n  But just as importantly, AgJOBS places increased penalties on farmers \nwho hire illegal aliens and places penalties on farmers who provide \npoor working conditions for their employees. This will make it far \nlikelier that Americans who want these jobs will stay in these jobs for \nlonger periods of time.\n  For this reason, AgJOBS is supported by hundreds of agriculture, \nbusiness, labor, religious, and ethnic affinity groups.\n  It is my profound belief that Americans are pro-legal immigration and \nanti-illegal immigration, and will support policies that are consistent \nwith this basic principle.\n  AgJOBS fits this description. It severely penalizes farmers who will \ncontinue to hire illegal immigrants and who choose to exploit their \nworkers. But it also provides farmers with the ability to hire \nAmericans and legal immigrants who will take these jobs.\n  The current situation is simply untenable. Every day, American farms \nare closing and America has to import more and more food from abroad \nbecause it is far cheaper to buy foreign food than it is to produce \nfood here.\n  For every farmworker job we lose to another country, America loses \nthree to four other American jobs in packaging, processing, supplies, \nequipment, and other related sectors.\n  Failure to pass AgJOBS will continue to result in devastating \nconsequences for our economy.\n  In New York alone, the Farm Credit Association of New York estimates \nthat if AgJOBS is not passed, New York State could lose in excess of \n900 farms, $195 million in value of agricultural production, and over \n200,000 acres in production in agriculture over the next 24 months.\n  Finally, our national security is threatened when we no longer are \nable to ensure that we can sufficiently feed our people with American \nfood. Without AgJOBS, we place our Nation's food security at risk from \nthose who might seek to do harm to America.\n  This situation can and should be remedied. AgJOBS provides the \nremedy, and I am therefore proud to be an original cosponsor of AgJOBS \nand strongly support its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 1041. A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to modify the \napplicability of certain requirements to double hulled tankers \ntransporting oil in bulk in Prince William Sound, Alaska; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, with my \ncolleague from Alaska Senator Mark Begich, that will require all oil \nladen tankers in Prince William Sound to be escorted by at least two \ntowing vessels or other vessels considered appropriate by the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security.\n  At 12:04 a.m. on March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez, carrying over 53 \nmillion gallons of crude oil, failed to turn back into the shipping \nlane after detouring to avoid ice, and ran aground on Bligh Reef. \nAlaskans will never forget that morning, waking up to hear about the \nworst oil spill and environmental disaster in U.S. history and living \nwith the lasting impacts it has had on our State and residents.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident \nand determined probable causes for the accident. While it determined \nthat it was primarily caused by human error of the captain and crew, it \nis my belief that we had also become complacent. It had been 12 years \nsince we had begun to tanker oil out of Valdez and there had not been \nan incident. However, when the spill occurred, we became acutely aware \nof how woefully unprepared we were. The few prevention measures that \nwere available were inadequate and the spill response and clean-up \nresources were seriously deficient. The oil eventually fouled some \n1,300 miles of shoreline, stretching almost 500 miles, and covered an \narea of 11,000 square miles.\n  While the captain and crew were found at fault for the immediate \ncause of the spill, the incident also highlighted huge gaps in \nregulatory oversight of the oil industry. The response of Congress to \nthe spill was passage of the Oil Spill Pollution Act of 1990 or OPA90. \nThe law overhauled shipping regulations, imposed new liability on the \nindustry, required detailed response plans and added extra safeguards \nfor shipping in Prince William Sound. Since the law took effect, annual \noil spills were greatly reduced and lawmakers, marine experts, the oil \nindustry and environmentalists credit the law for major improvements in \nU.S. oil and shipping industries.\n  Oil spill prevention and response have been greatly improved in \nPrince William Sound since the passage of OPA90. The U.S. Coast Guard \nnow monitors fully laden tankers all the way through Prince William \nSound. Specially trained marine pilots ride the ships for 25 of the 70 \nmile journey through the Sound and there are weather criteria for safe \nnavigation. Contingency plans, skimmers, dispersants, oil barges and \ncontainment booms are all now readily available. An advanced ice-\ndetecting radar system is also in place to monitor the icebergs that \nflow off of the mighty Columbia Glacier.\n  Two escort tugs accompany each tanker while passing through the Sound \nand are capable of assisting the tanker in the case of an emergency. \nThis world class safety system recently\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nsaw the 11,000th fully loaded tanker safely escorted through Prince \nWilliam Sound. It is estimated that if the Exxon Valdez would have been \ndouble-hulled, the amount of the spill would have been reduced by more \nthan half. While double hulled tankers are a huge improvement over \nsingle hulls, they do not prevent oil spills.\n  The legislation that Senator Begich and I are introducing today will \nmaintain the existing escort system in place for all tankers. \nPresently, the federal requirement that every loaded tanker be \naccompanied through the Sound by two tugs applies only to single-hulled \ntankers. Even though, right now, double-hulled tankers are escorted by \ntwo vessels, federal law does not require them to be. The last single \nhulled tanker in the Prince William Sound fleet is expected to be \nretired from service by August 2012 and our legislation ensures all \ndouble hulled tankers will always be escorted by two tugs.\n  Although there have been a number of marine incidents and near misses \nsince the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, over the past 20 years, \nthrough the efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard, industry, the State of \nAlaska, and the Prince William Sound Citizens Advisory Council to \nimplement the requirements of OPA 90, there have been no major oil \nspills. Today, as a result, the marine transportation safety system \nestablished for Prince William Sound is regarded as among the most \neffective in the world. A key reason for that accomplishment is, in \npart, because of the safety benefits resulting from having dual escort \nvessels available to assist oil laden tankers transiting the Sound.\n  Section 4116 (c) of OPA 90 requires that single hulled tankers over \n5,000 gross tons transporting oil in bulk in Prince William Sound, \nAlaska be escorted by at least two towing vessels or other vessels \nconsidered appropriate by the Secretary.\n  Subsection (a) makes applicable to double hulled tankers the \nrequirement in existing law including regulations in 33 CFR Part 168 \nissued to implement that dual escort vessel requirement for single \nhulled tankers. The subsection leaves the dual escort vessel \nrequirement in place for single hulled tankers. By making those cited \nregulations applicable to double hulled tankers, the U.S. Coast Guard \nwould not need to issue new regulations as a result of the amendment to \nsection 4116(c) of OPA 90. Rather, the Secretary is authorized and \ndirected to ``carry out subparagraph (A)'' by order without notice and \nhearing, and without issuing new regulations, under section 553 of \ntitle 5 of the U.S. Code.\n  The dual escort plan, as it was constituted and in effect as of March \n1, 2009 for Prince William Sound, is described in a document entitled, \n``Vessel Emergency Response Plan'' or ``VERP'', and is on file with the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\n  It is envisioned that, as advancements in technology are made in the \nfuture, any appropriate and warranted modifications to the VERP cited \nabove implementing the dual escort practice as in effect as of March 1, \n2009 and implementing the dual escort requirement in this section, \nincluding implementing regulations, will be made by the Prince William \nSound Tanker Owners/Operators in consultation with the U.S. Coast \nGuard, the State of Alaska, and the PWSRCAC and ratified and endorsed \nby the U.S. Coast Guard before being implemented.\n  The success of this escort system over the past 20 years has shown us \nthat it must not be compromised. We cannot forget the lessons of the \nExxon Valdez oil spill and allow ourselves to become complacent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nextend the food labeling requirements of the Nutrition Labeling and \nEducation Act of 1990 to enable customers to make informed choices \nabout the nutritional content of standard menu items in large chain \nrestaurants; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the Menu \nEducation and Labeling Act, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and \nSenator Gillibrand of New York.\n  It is by now well established that poor diet and obesity, as well as \nrelated conditions such as heart disease, have reached epidemic levels. \nThe majority of the U.S. population is either overweight or obese. The \nincidence of type II diabetes has reached levels not even imaginable 20 \nyears ago, with some research suggesting that one in three children \nwill develop the disease by adulthood.\n  There is no single solution to this complex issue of poor nutrition \nand diet related diseases. Policymakers looking for a silver bullet \nwill be disappointed. But inaction is not an option. We must start \ntaking meaningful steps to address this growing problem by giving \npeople the tools necessary to live healthier lifestyles. That is why my \ncolleagues and I are introducing this bill today to extend nutrition \nlabeling beyond packaged foods to include foods at chain restaurants \nwith 20 or more locations, as well as food in vending machines. This \ncommon-sense idea will give consumers a needed tool to make wiser \nchoices and achieve a healthier lifestyle. It is a positive step toward \naddressing the obesity epidemic.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, \nNLEA, requiring food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on \nnearly all packaged foods. The impact has been tremendous. Not only do \nnearly three-quarters of adults use the food labels on packaged foods, \nbut studies indicate that consumers who read labels have healthier \ndiets.\n  Unfortunately, when Congress first passed the NLEA, it excluded \nrestaurants from any labeling requirements. Since that time, \nrestaurants have become more and more important to Americans' diet and \nhealth. Americans consume a third of their calories and spend half of \ntheir food dollars at restaurants at the very time when nutrition and \nhealth experts say that rising caloric consumption and growing portion \nsizes are causes of obesity. We also know that when children eat in \nrestaurants, they consume twice as many calories as when they eat at \nhome. Consumers say that they would like nutrition information provided \nwhen they order their food at restaurants, yet, while they have good \nnutrition information in supermarkets, at restaurants they can only \nguess.\n  In recent years, some states and cities have led the way on menu \nlabeling. New York City has already implemented a menu labeling \ninitiative that requires the disclosure of calories on menus and menu \nboards at chain restaurants. Consumer surveys show that\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nthe residents of New York are enthusiastic about the initiative. The \nexperience in New York has also underscored the feasibility and \npracticality of the endeavor. Despite earlier concerns about \nimplementation, the vast majority of restaurants in New York City \ncomplied with the law quickly and without incident. Those with \nparticular challenges were assisted by the New York City Health \nDepartment to enable them to comply with the law.\n  But New York City is not the only such initiative. Other cities such \nas Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco have followed \nsuit. Just last fall, the State of California became the first State in \nthe Nation to enact a statewide menu labeling law, and Massachusetts \nbecame the second yesterday. Clearly there is not only a public health \nrationale for menu labeling, but consumer demand as well.\n  As I already stated, I harbor no illusions that any one policy will \nturn the tide on obesity and poor diet in our country, but if we are \never to reorient our society and our health care system in the U.S. \naway from treatment and towards a stronger focus on prevention, we must \nbuild prevention into the very fabric of society. We must provide \nconsumers with the tools and the support that they need to make the \nhealthy choice the right choice. The MEAL Act is one means by which to \naccomplish that goal, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Levin)):\n  S. 1050. A bill-amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to \nestablish Federal standards for health insurance forms, quality, fair \nmarketing, and honesty in out-of-network coverage in the group and \nindividual health insurance markets, to improve transparency and \naccountability in those markets, and to establish a Federal Office of \nHealth Insurance Oversight to monitor performance in those markets, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today--with my colleagues \nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro and Congresswoman Alyson Schwartz--to \nintroduce the Informed Consumer Choices in Health Care Act, legislation \nto hold insurance companies accountable by increasing transparency in \ninsurance coverage and to provide consumers critical information about \ntheir health care so they can make informed decisions.\n  All Americans deserve affordable, meaningful health care coverage \nthat meets their needs when they need it. However, there is an \nunsettling trend in America that is growing at an alarming rate--\nhardworking Americans are suffering from serious economic hardship \nbecause of medical bills. There countless consumers all across the \ncountry who thought they were safe because they had health insurance \ncoverage. Health insurance is meant to protect against the risk that, \nif you get sick, severely injured or require extensive medical care for \none reason or another, it would not bankrupt you. However, the exact \nopposite is happening. People who thought they had coverage for health \ncare events--small and large--found out much too late that they were \nnot protected at all. The lack of insurance transparency leads \nconsumers to purchase coverage that actually does not meet their needs \nand leads to disaster for them financially.\n  In June 2008, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on health \ninsurance reform where we heard devastating testimony from Mrs. Lisa \nKelly, who purchased a limited benefit plan that did not provide \nadequate coverage when she needed treatment for leukemia. Mrs. Kelly \npaid a monthly premium of $185 for AARP's Medical Advantage plan, \nunderwritten by UnitedHealth Group, only to be told that she had to pay \nM.D. Anderson $105,000 up front, prior to starting her chemotherapy \ntreatment. This situation left Ms. Kelly in the untenable situation of \nleaving her cancer untreated or finding a way to pay on a limited \nbudget.\n  Medical bills are the second highest cause of bankruptcy in our \ncountry. It is estimated that 50 percent of all bankruptcies are a \nresult of medical expenses. Sixty-one percent of the 72 million adults \nunder age 65 who had problems paying medical bills or were paying off \nmedical debt in 2007 were insured at the time health care was provided. \nAn additional 1.5 million families lose their homes every single year \ndue to medical costs. This is simply unacceptable.\n  This is not just a coincidence. Plans that provide bare-bones \ncoverage may be fine if you live in a bubble, but that is not the \nreality most Americans live in. If we as a nation are serious about \nprotecting all Americans from the devastating financial consequences of \nserious illness, then Congress must hold the insurance industry \naccountable by arming consumers with comprehensive information about \nthe benefits covered and not covered under their health plan, the true \ncost of their coverage, and the cost-sharing they are responsible for. \nThis information should not be shrouded in the legalese of health \ninsurance companies, but in clear language that is easy for consumers \nto understand. As we seek to give consumers greater coverage choices, \nwe should also give them the necessary tools to understand those \nchoices.\n\n  Another example of where the lack of insurance transparency has hurt \nconsumers is in the experience of the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Seniors and individuals with disabilities have simply been \noverwhelmed by the number of prescription drug plans offered--without \nany meaningful way to decipher the differences between plans in terms \nof benefits covered or cost-sharing. Over the last recess, I held a \nhealth care roundtable discussion in Charleston, which has more than 50 \nMedicare prescription drug plans for seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities to choose from. I heard from countless West Virginians \nabout the extreme difficulty they have wading through their \nprescription drug coverage options each and every plan year. The most \ncompelling stories came from a retired chemical engineer and a retired \nattorney--both very smart individuals--who have had major problems \ndetermining what is and is not offered and how much they will have to \npay out of their pockets for it.\n  When consumers buy cars, computers, or even cereal, they generally \nknow what they are buying and how much it will cost. But, when it comes \nto making choices about health care coverage, it is often very \ndifficult for consumers to tell what is actually covered and how much \nthey will have to pay out-of-pocket in case of a serious illness or \ninjury. Consumers cannot make meaningful choices if details about \ncoverage are obscure or if the definitions of key terms such as \n``hospitalization'', ``outpatient care'', or ``out-of-pocket limit'' \nvary from plan to plan.\n  The lack of health insurance transparency also contributes to \nadministrative waste and complexity. According to the American Medical \nAssociation, more than half of health insurers do not provide \nphysicians with the transparency necessary for an efficient claims \nprocessing system. Physicians and hospitals must divert substantial \nresources away from patient care to accurately determine patient \ninsurance eligibility and benefit structure.\n  The black box in which insurers operate also provides them with the \nopportunity to use flawed payment structures, like the Ingenix \ndatabase, to underpay patients who choose to get health care out of \nnetwork. An investigation by the New York Attorney General and hearings \nconducted this spring by the Senate Commerce Committee revealed \nAmerican consumers have been paying billions of dollars out of their \nown pockets for health care that the insurance companies should have \nbeen paying. The numbers the insurance industry relied on justify these \nunder-payments came from a secretive health care data company called \nIngenix. Insurers refused to tell patients or doctors how Ingenix came \nup with their payment amounts. And they didn't disclose that Ingenix \nwas a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, the Nation's \nsecond largest health insurance company. The Ingenix investigations \nshow tat the health insurance industry is willing to go to great \nlengths to withhold accurate, objective health care payment information \nfrom American consumers. While they talk about transparency, they spent \nhundreds of millions of dollars\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\ncreating a reimbursement system that kept patients and doctors in the \ndark.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor currently lacks the capacity to oversee \ninsurance industry compliance with federal health insurance laws and to \nprovide states with the technical assistance necessary to effectively \nenforce federal standards for health insurance. These federal standards \ninclude crucial protections like the Genetic Information and \nNondiscrimination Act, GINA, the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, HIPAA, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection \nAct, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, Michelle's Law, \nand mental health parity. As states continue to be overwhelmed by the \nincreasing pressure of the recession and cost-cutting measures by \ninsurers, state regulators are in desperate need for additional \nresources. In a 21st Century health system where there will be even \ngreater health insurance choices, adequate federal oversight is \nabsolutely critical.\n  There is no excuse for limiting access to information that has such \nwidespread consequences for consumers. The Informed Consumer Choices in \nHealth Care Act is the type of transformative legislation we need to \naddress the very significant issues stemming from the lack of health \ninsurance transparency. First, this legislation promotes transparency \nin coverage by providing crucial data and assistance to consumers and \nhealth care providers. This includes new ``Coverage Facts'' labels for \ninsurance, similar to nutrition labels, which accurately portray the \nfinancial obligations of patients in a given year under various medical \nscenarios. The legislation also requires the development of consistent \nstandards for insurance, including standard definitions of key \ninsurance terms to be used in descriptions of plan benefits, so that \nconsumers can make ``apples to apples'' comparisons of coverage \noptions. Lastly, it strengthens insurance accountability and oversight \nby creating a new Office of Health Insurance Oversight within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and provides new resources for \nstates to help enforce federal standards.\n  In the most recent Presidential election, the voice of American \nvoters was clear--they want medical care they can afford and health \ncare coverage they can trust. The traditional role of insurers to hide \nor misrepresent insurance coverage options can longer be tolerated; \ntherefore, I urge my colleagues to stand up for informed consumer \ndecisions in health care and support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupport material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effective competition in private health insurance \n     markets requires that consumers must have extensive and \n     meaningful information about what health insurance covers, \n     what it costs, and how it works.\n       (2) Based on the information currently provided by health \n     insurers, patients are unable to predict what their health \n     insurance coverage limits or out-of-pocket costs would be if \n     they had a serious illness. 72 million adults under age 65 \n     had problems paying medical bills or were paying off medical \n     debt in 2007, and 61 percent of those were insured at the \n     time care was provided.\n       (3) It is difficult to impossible for consumers to obtain a \n     copy of a health insurance policy from an insurance company \n     before they purchase it.\n       (4) Consumers often find it difficult to navigate and \n     evaluate their choices in today's health insurance markets \n     and many select a sub-optimal plan as a result.\n       (5) The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \n     Sciences has estimated that nearly half of all American \n     adults--90 million people--have difficulty understanding and \n     using health information.\n       (6) The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion \n     in the Department of Health and Human Services reports that \n     only 12 percent of the population using a table can calculate \n     an employee's share of health insurance costs for a year.\n       (7) A RAND Corporation study found that making it easier to \n     get information about insurance products and simplifying the \n     applications process would increase purchase rates as much as \n     modest subsidies would, and all these reports prove the need \n     for a fundamental improvement in the way insurance choices \n     are made available to consumers.\n       (8) Insurance forms provided to patients and providers are \n     often confusing, difficult to reconcile with medical bills, \n     and vary widely from insurer to insurer, thereby adding \n     complexity and administrative waste to the health care \n     system.\n       (9) Research indicates that physicians divert substantial \n     resources, as much as 14 percent of their total revenue, to \n     ensure accurate insurance payments for their services. \n     Hospitals spend as much as 11 percent of their total revenue \n     on billing and insurance-related costs. These include time \n     spent determining patient insurance eligibility and benefit \n     structure. One study found that paperwork adds at least 30 \n     minutes to every hour of patient care.\n       (10) According to the American Medical Association, there \n     is wide variation in how often health insurers pay nothing in \n     response to a physician claim and in how they explain the \n     reason for the denial. There is no consistency in the \n     application of codes used to explain the denials, making it \n     extremely expensive for physician practices to determine how \n     to respond.\n       (11) According to the American Medical Association, more \n     than half of health insurers in a recent study did not \n     provide physicians with the transparency necessary for an \n     efficient claims processing system.\n       (12) According to the American Medical Association, payers \n     vary widely on how often they use proprietary rather than \n     public claims edits to reduce payments (ranging from zero to \n     as high as nearly 72 percent).

A bill to amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act to \nextend the termination date; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this week is National Police Week, the \none week each year when tens of thousands of law enforcement officers \nfrom around the U.S. and some from foreign lands descend upon \nWashington, DC to pay homage to the fallen officers who gave their \nlives in the service of our communities.\n  All around Washington we see police cars and motorcycles from \njurisdictions far and wide. Honor guards and drill teams. And many \nuniformed law enforcement officers with their families and kids.\n   At a hotel in Alexandria, VA, thousands of surviving families and \ncoworkers of fallen law enforcement officers are gathered for the 2009 \nNational Police Survivors Conference, sponsored by Concerns of Police \nSurvivors. Today marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of Concerns \nof Police Survivors. I thank all of our colleagues for supporting S. \nRes. 138 commending that organization on the occasion of this \nsignificant anniversary. Tomorrow we observe Peace Officers Memorial \nDay with services at the U.S. Capitol.\n  Last evening the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund \nconducted its annual candlelight vigil at the memorial on Judiciary \nSquare. I had the privilege of reading the name of a fallen officer, \nJohn Patrick Watson of the Kenai Police Department, at the 2004 \ncandlelight vigil. I can attest that this annual event does justice to \nthe memory of the 18,662 names inscribed on the memorial walls.\n  For fifty-one weeks out of every year those memorial walls display \nnames. Just names. There is a story of heroism behind each of these \nnames. Yet for 51 weeks out of each year, those stories are hidden from \npublic view. Visitors to the memorial can discover but a few of these \nstories by viewing the displays at the Memorial Fund's tiny visitor's \ncenter.\n  During National Police Week the memorial comes alive with news \nclippings, photographs and patches--even the door of a police car--\nplaced at the memorial by law enforcement agencies and friends and \nfamily members of the fallen officers. These ad hoc memorials are \nremoved at the end of Police Week. Those that are left behind become \npart of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's permanent \ncollection. Someday more substantial parts of that collection will be \ndisplayed to the public at the National Law Enforcement Museum.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the National Law Enforcement Museum Act, \nPublic Law 106-492, which set aside land across from the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial for a National Law Enforcement Museum. \nThe museum is to be operated by the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial Fund.\n  This National Law Enforcement Museum will tell the story of our law \nenforcement heroes. It will help ensure that visitors to the Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial have an opportunity to reflect on the \nways that our fallen officers lived their lives, rather than the way \nthose officers died.\n  Our colleagues may be interested to know that it was Vivian Eney-\nCross, the surviving spouse of a fallen U.S. Capitol Police officer, \nwho coined the phrase, ``It is not how these officers died that made \nthem heroes, it is how they lived.''\n  The National Law Enforcement Museum Act requires that the museum be \nfinanced with private contributions. The National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial Fund has been diligent in seeking private financing \nand hopes to break ground on the museum in November 2010 with a 2013 \nopening date.\n  I am hopeful that construction of the new museum will begin in 2010 \nbut I am also realistic about the difficulties of raising private funds \nfor worthy projects given current world economic conditions.\n  Fortunately, these economic conditions have neither deterred the \nMemorial Fund from asking for donations nor have they deterred \nprospective contributors with the ability to give, from giving. On May \n4, the Memorial Fund announced a $1.5 million grant from the Verizon \nFoundation to develop educational and interactive technology programs \nat the planned museum.\n  However, I must call the attention of our colleagues to a critical \ndeadline in the National Law Enforcement Museum Act. The act provides \nthat the authority to construct a museum terminates on November 9, 2010 \nif construction has not begun by that date. Today, I offer legislation \nthat will push the termination date out to November 9, 2013. This \nlegislation will provide a cushion for the Memorial Fund to continue \ntheir fundraising efforts.\n  Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to \nprotect our communities. Giving the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial Fund a bit more time to arrange financing, if they need it, is \na small price to pay. A small price to pay for the sacrifices our law \nenforcement officers and their families make every day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 151\n\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of men and women have served \n     this Nation in building its nuclear defense since World War \n     II;\n       Whereas these dedicated American workers paid a high price \n     for their service and have developed disabling or fatal \n     illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing \n     radiation, toxic substances, and other hazards that are \n     unique to the production and testing of nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas these workers were put at individual risk without \n     their knowledge and consent in order to develop a nuclear \n     weapons program for the benefit of all American citizens; and\n       Whereas these patriotic men and women deserve to be \n     recognized for their contribution, service, and sacrifice \n     towards the defense of our great Nation: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 30, 2009, as a national day of \n     remembrance for American nuclear weapons program workers and \n     uranium miners, millers, and haulers; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to support \n     and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and \n     other activities to commemorate October 30, 2009, as a \n     national day of remembrance for past and present workers in \n     America's nuclear weapons program.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Bunning \nand other senators to introduce a resolution to declare a National Day \nof Remembrance in honor of the thousands of men and women that \nsupported our nuclear efforts during the Cold War.\n  The dedicated employees of the Department of Energy and its \ncontractors were instrumental in our winning the Cold War. These \nemployees worked in laboratories and factories related to nuclear \nweapons, under hazardous conditions that were sometimes not well \nunderstood. They put their health and their lives in jeopardy in the \nservice of their country, often without knowing it.\n  Tennessee has more workers that were made sick through their exposure \nto nuclear weapon hazards than any other state in the union. That is \nwhy one of my priorities in the U.S. Senate has been to help get our \nCold War heroes and their families the compensation they deserve--from \na major overhaul of the sick worker's program in 2004, to legislation \nthat introduced last year to ensure that compensation for the families \nof sick nuclear worker won't be taken away in cases where sick workers \nor their eligible survivors die before their claims are processed.\n  While the compensation program can provide some financial assistance, \nit can never fully make up for what was lost.\n  I would also like to take a moment to mention one particular heroine \namong these Cold War heroes: Janine Lynn Anderson, a dedicated advocate \nfor all the American nuclear weapons workers. Janine worked tirelessly \nfor over a decade to ensure that nuclear weapons workers were not \nforgotten after the Cold War was won. Sadly, Janine passed away just a \nweek ago on May 2. She will be missed.\n  It was her idea that these patriotic men and women be recognized \nthrough a National Day of Remembrance, for their contribution, service, \nand sacrifice towards the defense of this great nation.\n  That is why it is particularly appropriate that today we introduce \nthis resolution to designate October 30, 2009 as a National Day of \nRemembrance in honor of these Cold War heroes. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues from both parties to pass this resolution \nsoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/14/senate-section/article/S5530-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5530-S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1111.
